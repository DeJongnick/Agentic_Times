<h1>Thursday news quiz: French reshuffles, naked cyclists and a heroic dog</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-10-16T10:00:04Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p>It is Thursday. You’re tired. The quiz is tired. The official dog of the quiz is tired. We’re all tired. But somehow, with the weekend in sight, it is time to summon up the enthusiasm for the only news quiz on the internet that deliberately trolls its readers with increasingly unhinged question themes and in-joke answers – the Guardian’s long-running and slightly baffling Thursday news quiz. There are no prizes but we love to hear how you got on in the comments. <em>Allons-y</em>!</p> 
<p><strong>The Thursday news quiz, No 219</strong></p>

    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:D - The Hungarian novelist was celebrated for dystopian, melancholic novels that apparently 'reaffirm the power of art', much as the Thursday quiz does, 2:B - He still needs to do a couple more weeks in the job to have outlasted a Liz Truss premiership but he is nearly up to four Scaramuccis, 3:C - Biometric access requires staff to scan their fingerprints or eye to gain access through security gates in the lobby instead of swiping their ID badges, 4:A - The Thursday quiz is firmly of the opinion that if you didn't track it on Strava, those calories did not get burned, 5:B - Cardiff City, who were hosting the match, have defended their pest control practices, although clearly they had already let the Wales manager, Craig Bellamy, into the ground, 6:A - Disney+ will air the six-episode series The End of an Era from 12 December, with the first two episodes launching on that date, 7:D - Let's just say it did not go down well with the community, 8:B - Rider Janene King called the nude ride a “quintessentially Portland way to protest”, 9:A - Academy had erroneously been given more points than they had actually earned amid confusion about the scoreboard at one juncture of the game, 10:C - It is a donkey's name, to be fair, but yes, bless that good boy. And bless Hendrix, who is a very good boy indeed, 11:B - It is presumably a reference to the 2004 track she recorded vocals with Zero 7, rather than named after a gymnastics move. Presumably, 12:A - Lovely Katharine picked up four of the things during her glittering career, 13:C - It was apparently found languishing in the files of an assassinated mafia crime boss for at least 40 years, which is coincidently how the Thursday quiz would also like its discarded drafts to be discovered, 14:C - She was 37 when she was executed by guillotine at Place de la Révolution in Paris, 15:C - It is, of course, her epic international hit that is inspiring the works of art</p>
