<p>A Donald Trump nominee who is scheduled for a confirmation hearing this week told other Republicans he “has a Nazi streak” and that holidays commemorating Black people should be “eviscerated”, according to a report based on a private group chat.</p> <p>Trump nominated Paul Ingrassia to serve as special counsel of the United States, a role charged in part with safeguarding federal whistleblowers from retaliation. His confirmation hearing is set for Thursday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/20/paul-ingrassia-racist-text-messages-nazi-00613608?_sp_pass_consent=true">Politico reported</a> on Monday that Ingrassia told other Republicans in a group chat that the Martin Luther King Jr holiday, which celebrates the civil rights icon, should be ended.</p> <p>“MLK Jr was the 1960s George Floyd and his ‘holiday’ should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs,” Ingrassia wrote in the messages from early 2024, Politico reports. He also wrote that holidays commemorating Black people, such as Black history month or Juneteenth, should all be “eviscerated”, though he used an Italian slur for Black people.</p> <p>His comment about a “Nazi streak” came amid a discussion of a Trump campaign staffer who wasn’t being deferential enough to the founding fathers being white, Politico reported. Another participant said Ingrassia “belongs in the Hitler Youth”, to which Ingrassia responded: “I do have a Nazi streak in me from time to time, I will admit it.”</p> <p>Ingrassia’s attorney, Edward Andrew Paltzik, told the outlet that the texts could have been manipulated or lacking context, though that if they were real, they “clearly read as self-deprecating and satirical humor making fun of the fact that liberals outlandishly and routinely call Maga supporters ‘Nazis’”.</p> <p>Ingrassia, 30, has had several roles in the second Trump administration. He was a White House liaison to the justice department, then moved to the Department of Homeland Security. He was nominated in May to lead the office of special counsel, but his appointment was postponed. His critics have <a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/07/trumps-controversial-osc-nominee-pulled-confirmation-hearing/406964/">drawn on</a> his public comments and inexperience for the role, as well as his support of white supremacist Nick Fuentes.</p> <p>Ingrassia was also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/09/ingrassia-trump-harassment-dhs-00596545">accused</a> of sexual harassment earlier this year, Politico reported. He has called the report about the alleged harassment a “vexatious political attack” and said it should be retracted.</p> <p>Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/private-chat-among-young-gop-club-members-00592146">reported last week</a> on a trove of 2,900 pages of leaked chats from a Telegram group with young Republicans, in which the participants made racist comments, praised Hitler and celebrated rape.</p> <p>“If we ever had a leak of this chat we would be cooked fr fr,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/young-republicans-racist-group-chat-messages-leaked">said</a> Bobby Walker, who was <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DN6NIHJDspZ/">recently</a> made chair of the New York division.</p> <p>The New York Republican state committee <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/17/ny-republicans-racist-chats-suspended">suspended</a> the authorization of their young Republicans chapter after its members were implicated in the chat.</p>
