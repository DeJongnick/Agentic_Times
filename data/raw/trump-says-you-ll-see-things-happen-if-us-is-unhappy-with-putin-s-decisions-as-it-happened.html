 <h2 class="block-title">Polish leaders welcome Trump's words on US troops presence in Poland</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/polish-president-karol-nawrocki-meeting-trump-tensions-tusk">domestic political disagreements in the build up to Nawrocki’s visit to Washington</a>, a number of <strong>senior Polish government figures have welcomed Trump’s reassurances that he was not looking to reduce the number of US troops in Poland. </strong></p> 
  <p>Poland’s prime minister <strong>Donald Tusk</strong>, who will take part in tomorrow’s Coalition of the Willing summit in Paris, said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“President Trump has just declared that the United States had no plans, and does not plan in the future, to withdraw American troops from Poland. These are important words that confirm the timeless nature of our alliance.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Deputy prime minister and defence minister <strong>Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“An important declaration by President @realDonaldTrump about the presence of American troops in Poland. This is proof that the strategic [Polish-American] alliance, which is one of the foundations of our security, is extremely strong.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Deputy prime minister and foreign minister <strong>Radosław Sikorski </strong>said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“It is good that President Trump confirmed the continued stationing of American troops in Poland. On matters of security, deterring Putin, and supporting Ukraine, the government and the opposition speak with one voice.”</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Aaaand just like that</em>:</p> 
  <p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> has just arrived at the Élysée Palace, welcomed by the French president, <strong>Emmanuel Macron, </strong>ahead of tomorrow’s talks with the Coalition of the Willing.</p> 
  <p>In his opening remarks, Macron said that building on the preparatory work by military planners, Europe was “ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine and the Ukrainians” once a peace accord is agreed.</p> 
  <p>“The question now is to determine the sincerity of Russia and its successive commitments on peace talks made to the US,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Curiously, two diplomatic sources told Reuters that US special envoy <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong> is also in Paris, ahead of tomorrow’s meeting.</p>

 <div class="block-elements">

  <p>The French president’s office said that <strong>one of the aims of the meeting is to say “we are capable, with regard to our American partners, of honouring the commitments we have made</strong>, while it is up to them to maintain or increase pressure on Russia,” AFP reported.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>call with Trump is expected around 1pm BST, 2pm CEST</strong>, with a press conference to follow later.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Poland's Nawrocki gets from Trump the big declaration he wanted - snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>One should always be cautious about judging the visit from its first half hour, but <strong>you bet that Nawrocki’s officials in Warsaw are </strong><em><strong>very</strong></em><strong> pleased with that they just heard.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Concerns about the future of the US military presence in Poland and the broader region have featured very prominently in the Polish public debate in recent months</strong>, with rumours and speculations about potential reduction of US troops in the country amid signals about the US looking to shift its focus and prioritise the Indo-Pacific region.</p> 
  <p><strong>To get Trump to say in this meeting that he’s got no plans to do so </strong>(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/03/volodymyr-zelenskyy-denmark-support-ukraine-karol-nawrocki-meet-donald-trump-europe-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-68b8672b8f08020a75f12cbf#block-68b8672b8f08020a75f12cbf">18:08</a>) – or even that he could increase their presence (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/03/volodymyr-zelenskyy-denmark-support-ukraine-karol-nawrocki-meet-donald-trump-europe-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-68b863ae8f08bb514e0fb64f#block-68b863ae8f08bb514e0fb64f">17:52</a>) – <strong>is a big political win for Nawrocki and his allies.</strong></p> 
  <p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/polish-president-karol-nawrocki-meeting-trump-tensions-tusk">Poland controversially skipped the recent Zelenskyy-Trump meeting</a> in the White House, Nawrocki’s aides argued <strong>their primary focus was on a bilateral agenda with the US,</strong> and this issue would feature prominently on their list coming into today’s meeting.</p> 
  <p>Obviously, <strong>you just never know with Trump</strong> as he can and often does change his views. But for now, that was <em>exactly</em> what Nawrocki and his team were hoping for.</p>

  <p>Asked what he will do to end the war, Trump says he will have a conversation with “him” – erm - “very shortly, and I will know pretty much what we are going to be doing.”</p> 
  <p><em>(It’s not entirely clear if he means <strong>Putin</strong> or <strong>Zelenskyy</strong> or <strong>Nawrocki</strong>, as confirmed by a desperate journalist asking “but who”)</em></p> 
  <p>“We’ve taken very strong action, as you know, and in other ways, we’ve taken very strong action, but I’ll be speaking to him over the next few days and we’re going to see,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He adds that <strong>he is “not happy” with the number of people being killed every week there.</strong></p> 
  <p>“They’re human beings, their souls, they have parents. They wave goodbye to their parents, and their parents never see them again … I want to see it stopped now,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He then <strong>blames Biden for the Russian invasion on Ukraine</strong>, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>A big reason this war happened was sitting right in these chairs, this one in particular.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He ends by saying he thought the Russian invasion on Ukraine wouldn’t be that difficult to end, and “would be in the middle of the pack, maybe on of the easiest,” but adds:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“You never know with war. <strong>War is complex and dangerous and what a mess, what a bloody mess.</strong> It’s going to be done one way or the other. But they have to stop killing all of these souls.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Trump</strong> <strong>angrily reacts to a suggestion from a Polish reporter that he has not followed up on his warnings to Putin</strong>, despite the Russian president still not agreeing to a meeting with Ukraine’s Zelenskyy.</p>

  <p>“You call that no action, and I haven’t done phase two yet or phase three, but when you say there’s no action, I think you ought to get yourself a new job,” he says.</p>

  <p>The UK government said that “to date, <strong>more than 19,500 Ukrainian children have been forcibly transferred or deported by the Russian authorities to Russia</strong> and the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine.”</p> 
  <p>UK foreign secretary <strong>David Lammy</strong> said:</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Poland’s conservative nationalist president <strong>Karol Nawrocki</strong> is due to meet <strong>Donald Trump</strong> at the White House in the first serious test of his foreign policy credentials.</p> 
  <p>Backed by the populist rightwing opposition Law and Justice party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023, Nawrocki <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/01/exit-poll-in-polish-presidential-run-off-puts-candidates-neck-and-neck">unexpectedly won Poland’s presidential election</a> after running a campaign under a Trumpesque slogan of <strong>“Poland first, Poles first”.</strong></p> 
  <p>The historian turned politician <strong>had met the US president before the election</strong>, securing his highly prized endorsement and presenting himself as someone who could safeguard Poland’s interests with the conservative US administration. </p> 
  <p>When he won, Trump posted on Truth Social: “<strong>Such a great win in Poland</strong> by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/karol-nawrocki">Karol Nawrocki</a>. He will be a great president!”</p> 
  <p>Nawrocki’s <strong>visit to the White House on Wednesday will be his first overseas trip</strong> since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/nationalist-karol-nawrocki-sworn-in-as-polish-president">taking office last month</a>, and is <strong>expected to focus on security issues, including Ukraine, but also on economic and energy cooperation.</strong></p> 
  <p>But the visit has also <strong>prompted fresh tensions with the nation’s pro-European government led by Donald Tusk.</strong></p> 
  <p>Nawrocki, a fierce critic of Tusk who has pledged to continue supporting Kyiv <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/24/poland-presidential-debate-puts-ukraine-and-europe-centre-stage">but opposes Ukraine’s membership in Nato</a> and pushed for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/polands-president-vetoes-legislation-to-prolong-benefits-for-ukrainian-refugees">tightening the benefits paid out to Ukrainian refugees</a> in Poland, <strong>publicly clashed with the government over his intention to pursue his foreign policy</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/nationalist-karol-nawrocki-sworn-in-as-polish-president">independently of the government</a>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Ukraine’s <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> and Denmark’s <strong>Mette Frederiksen</strong> are now talking with journalists after the earlier NB8 meeting on Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy stresses that <strong>Ukraine really counts on further support via the Nato’s PURL programme,</strong> and talks about <strong>the need for air defence system supplies</strong> which he describes as “absolutely strategic” ahead of winter.</p> 
  <p>The Ukrainian president also says that <strong>he wants the future security guarantees for Ukraine to go further than the existing wartime arrangements</strong> to make sure that “it doesn’t matter who will be the leader of one or another country, this system has to work” to uphold peace.</p> 
  <p>As a journalist invites him to criticise Trump for not putting more pressure on Russia, he elegantly sidesteps that question and stresses that <strong>Ukraine needs the US “on our side, in this crucial period.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He stresses that <strong>Ukraine needs more air defence systems, and “to be realistic, mostly United States has it.”</strong></p> 
  <p>But <strong>he eventually concedes that some decisions are progressing “very slow.”</strong></p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy also <strong>talks about the importance of further sanctions on Russia</strong>, pointing out that it’s been more than two weeks since Trump-Putin conversation, with <strong>Russia seemingly showing no interest in progressing the talks</strong> – despite the promise made to the US president.</p> 
  <p>He reveals that <strong>the leaders taking part in the Coalition of the Willing meeting tomorrow “will try to connect with President Trump, and we’ll speak about it.”</strong></p> 
  <p>Asked if he could trust Putin’s word, he replies:</p>

  <p>“Tomorrow will be an important meeting, so I expect tomorrow, or soon after tomorrow, to have clarity on what collectively we can deliver,” Rutte told journalists at a press conference alongside Estonian president Alar Karis.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“That means that we can engage even more intensely, also with the American side to see what they want to deliver in terms of their participation.”</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Afternoon opening: Intense diplomatic work on Ukraine</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>After a heavy night of Russian attacks in Ukraine, it’s <strong>another busy day for European diplomacy</strong> as leaders seek new ways to pressure Russia into engaging with the peace process and are confronted with a new geopolitical reality.</p> 
  <p>Ukraine’s <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> is in Denmark, meeting with the Nordic and the Baltic leaders (the so-called NB8) to discuss further support for his country, while Poland’s president <strong>Karol Nawrocki</strong> is about to make his debut appearance on the international stage visiting US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> at the White House.</p> 
  <p>We should hear from all of them this afternoon.</p> 
  <p>But then Slovak prime minister <strong>Robert Fico </strong>is in Beijing, where – fresh from meeting one-on-one with Russian president Vladimir Putin and talking about the need for “standardisation” of their bilateral relations – he <strong>joined a massive military parade intended to show China’s military might.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Xi Jinping</strong> said the world was facing a choice between peace or war as he held China’s largest-ever military parade, joined by <strong>Putin</strong> and <strong>Kim Jong-un</strong> in a show of defiance to the west.</p>
