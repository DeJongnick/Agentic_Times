<p>The White House plans to cut staffing at the Central Intelligence Agency by 1,200 positions while other intelligence agencies including the National Security Agency will also shed thousands of jobs, the Washington Post has reported.</p> <p>A person familiar with the plan confirmed the changes to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>The Trump administration has told members of Congress about the planned cuts at the CIA, which will take place over several years and be accomplished in part through reduced hiring as opposed to layoffs, the Post reported on Friday. The cuts include several hundred people who had already opted for early retirement, it said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/03/trump-news-at-a-glance-president-floats-pentagon-budget-boost-army-may-hold-parade-for-his-birthday">Trump news at a glance: president floats Pentagon budget boost; army may hold parade for his birthday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response to questions about the reductions, the CIA issued a statement saying its director, John Ratcliffe, was working to align the agency with Donald Trump’s national security priorities.</p> <p>“These moves are part of a holistic strategy to infuse the agency with renewed energy, provide opportunities for rising leaders to emerge, and better position CIA to deliver on its mission,” the agency said in the statement.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
