<p>Snoop Dogg has worked with artists including Stevie Wonder, Katy Perry and Mariah Carey – and now a small London charity for people with learning disabilities has joined that list.</p> <p>The rapper, with Dr Dre, sampled the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxFMc60kaA">Watermelon Fantasy</a>, released by the charity <a href="https://www.daylightstud.io/watermelon-fantasy">Daylight Studio</a> in 2018, for the single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUPLv48_exc">Outta Da Blue</a> from their new album, Missionary, which was released on 13 December.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2024/aug/11/snoop-dogg-paris-2024-olympics-in-pictures">Snoop Dogg’s Paris 2024 Olympics – in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Watermelon Fantasy is performed by three artists with learning disabilities, and produced by the founder of Daylight Studio and one of its trustees. Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre have, between them, sold millions of records and have 42 Grammy award nominations.</p> <p>Tina Bruins, who features on the track and lives in supported housing in north London, said: “I was shocked. I remember being like: ‘Whaaaaaat?’ I didn’t know it was going to be released by Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg. I thought no, I thought it was a fantasy.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxFMc60kaA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PfxFMc60kaA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Bruins, 40, a longtime fan of Snoop Dogg, remembers watching his music videos on TV late at night. “It was a good shock because it sort of proves I make good music,” she said. “I’m proud of [Watermelon Fantasy] because Snoop Dogg took it over.”</p> <p>In the month since its release on 21 November, Outta Da Blue has been featured in the <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/back-in-action-cameron-diaz-release-date-photos-news">trailer for Back in Action</a>, a Netflix film due to be released in January 2025 starring Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx; on the American football video game Madden NFL 25; and in an Amazon Music Live<em> </em>series where Snoop Dogg performed songs from throughout his career.</p> <p>Proceeds from the collaboration will be split equally between Bruins and two other artists with learning disabilities, Mandy Priddice and Cedrick Letshou Olembo, with production shares being donated back to the charity.</p> <p>Jack Daley, a recording engineer, and Oliver Price, a songwriter and music producer, made Watermelon Fantasy in 2017 with Bruins, Priddick and Letshou, while hosting music sessions at Daylight, a day centre for adults with learning disabilities, run by Islington council.</p> <p>When the centre closed temporarily during the coronavirus pandemic, Daley founded the charity, Daylight Studio, to continue his work composing and producing music with people with learning disabilities, with Price as a trustee.</p> <p>The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/31/day-centre-recording-studio">first covered Daley’s work and Watermelon Fantasy</a> in early 2019. Daley and Price believe if it weren’t for that coverage, the song would never have been discovered by Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre.</p> <p>“This is the biggest thing that’s ever happened to me, and I’m pretty certain I can say that this year has been the best year of my life because of it,” said Daley. His and Price’s shares would be “life-changing” for the charity and will fund and expand its work over the next couple of years.</p> <p>Price said: “I still can’t believe it’s a real thing. It sort of feels divinely ordained because the song is called Outta Da Blue and it came out of the blue and it’s like we’re living in a watermelon fantasy. It’s all quite funny really.”</p> <p>He added: “I’m excited about the charity and bringing attention to people with learning difficulties. They are often put in a box separate from society, and no one ever sees them or works with them … But they have a lot to offer as we have just demonstrated.”</p> <p>All involved would like to do more collaborations with local and international artists making use of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0G7anOFInumuHkQq1DWlBB">Daylight Studio’s catalogue of music</a>.</p> <p>“We want to continue creating music and maybe this won’t be the last sample,” said Price. “It would be awesome if Kendrick Lamar or Drake or someone [would use it]. You just don’t know.”</p> <p>The Guardian approached representatives for Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre but neither were available to comment.</p>
