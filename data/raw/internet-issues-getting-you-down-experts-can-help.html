<p>Zoom calls that can’t be unmuted; share-house internet that drops in and out; spotty reception that ruins social media moments. Technology issues such as these may not be earth-shattering, but they are annoying.</p> <p>With script-free technology experts in call centres across Australia, the internet provider Aussie Broadband aims to solve its customers’ internet problems, serious or not. Forget AI voice recognition or representatives who are measured on call times; these consultants are real and ready to help.</p> <p>We put an Aussie Broadband customer service consultant, Jamie Gonzalez, to the test with five common internet concerns.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>My internet is always freezing or dropping out on Zoom meetings.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Jamie Gonzalez: </strong>That’s not good. Particularly now that working from home has become the norm. What do you do for work, if you don’t mind me asking?</p> <p><strong>Guardian Labs: </strong>I write articles for the internet, mostly.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Well, let’s show the boss you’re still paying attention. The problem could be wifi connectivity from your router playing up. It could be the computer you’re using, or an issue with the NBN/OptiComm network. Let’s check it out, run some tests and get to the bottom of it together, shall we?</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>I’m kind of a big deal. How do I stay connected to the internet on a road trip?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>JG: </strong>Hey, I get it: road trips are always full of the best content. Where are you off to?</p> <p><strong>GL:</strong> The plan is to drive out past Mildura to the edge of the outback. It’s beautiful out there.</p> <p><strong>JG</strong>: Jealous! To stay connected, start with mobile broadband with a 4G or 5G SIM – either a data-only or a mobile SIM. Would you like me to run you through that?</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>What is data pooling, and how do I do it?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>JG: </strong>Great question. Let’s say you have three mobile services with 40GB of allocated data per service. Each of the services draws from a combined pool of 120GB of data. With data pooling, if one service uses more than 40GB, it won’t be restricted or slowed. This can be handy for work, and is really great for families if someone chews through their data but still needs their speed.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>I can’t figure out how to share my screen for work. I’m embarrassed to tell anybody.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>JG: </strong>Don’t be embarrassed. You’d be surprised how common this question is. First off: what video platform are you using?</p> <p><strong>GL:</strong> For this job, Microsoft Teams.</p> <p><strong>JG:</strong> Easy as. To share your screen in Teams, you’ll first need to be in an actual meeting. From there, locate your toolbar – it’s normally at the bottom of the screen – then find the ‘Share content’ button. A menu should then ask what you want to share, such as your entire screen or a specific window. Click on the option that suits. If you see a minimised version of your screen in the Teams window, you’re in business. It’s a good idea to ask your colleagues if they can see your screen before you begin your presentation.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Ani Sharma, Aussie Broadband Customer Service Consultant</p></li> </ul>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>My internet speed always lags when my housemates are streaming their shows and I’m streaming mine. What can I do?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>JG:</strong> Tell your housemates to watch a DVD? Joking!</p> <p>This is really common in data-heavy households, and the problem is bandwidth, meaning your plan doesn’t have the capacity to let everyone stream at the same time. Bandwidth is like the size of the pipe that carries your internet: the bigger the pipe, the more data can flow through at once.</p> <p>Let’s dig a little deeper into the streaming services and devices you’re using and see if we can find the right plan with the best speeds for you and your housemates.</p> <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.aussiebroadband.com.au/internet/nbn-plans/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=residential-nbn-content-partnership&amp;utm_content=speed-changes" rel="nofollow">Check your eligibility for Aussie Broadband’s new high-speed plans on its purpose-built network.</a></strong></em></p>
