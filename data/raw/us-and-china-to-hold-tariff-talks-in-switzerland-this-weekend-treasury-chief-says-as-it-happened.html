The blog will be closing now, but will revive on Wednesday morning. Here are a few of the day’s developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> met with <strong>Mark Carney</strong>, the new Canadian prime minister he helped elect (by enraging the Canadian public with threats of annexation and economic warfare). Both men seemed satisfied with the Oval Office meeting, even if Carney told a reporter later he was “glad you couldn’t tell what was going through my mind” when Trump railed about erasing the border between their two nations, and attacked Carney’s close friend who handled previous trade negotiations. Carney also said he asked Trump to stop calling Canada the 51st state. </p></li> <li><p>US treasury secretary <strong>Scott Bessent</strong> and US trade representative <strong>Jamieson Greer</strong> will meet with their Chinese counterparts later this week in Switzerland, in what could be the first step to negotiating an end to the trade war between the world’s two largest economies over tariffs imposed by Trump.</p></li> <li><p>Bessent also contradicted a previous claim from Trump that talks with China had been going on for weeks. “We haven’t had negotiations,” Bessent told Fox. “The world has been coming to the US, and China has been the missing piece.”</p></li> <li><p>Trump revealed to reporters that three more Israeli hostages have died in Gaza, meaning that just 21 of the hostages taken from Israel on October 7 2023 remain alive. “I say 21, because, as of today, it’s 21. Three have died,” the president said.</p></li> <li><p>At the White House event on the 2026 World Cup, Trump learned from a reporter that Russia is banned from taking part, as a result of its invasion of Ukraine.</p></li> <li><p>Columbia University <a href="https://president.columbia.edu/news/preserving-columbias-critical-research-capabilities">announced</a> that it laid off nearly 180 researchers in response to the Trump’s administration’s decision to cancel $400 million in funding over the Ivy League school’s handling of student protests against the war in Gaza.</p></li> <li><p>The Trump administration may deport migrants to Libya for the first time this week, three US officials <a href="https://x.com/humeyra_pamuk/status/1919919219312931022">tell Reuters</a>.</p></li> </ul> </div>

cybersecurity official targeted by Trump says</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Chris Krebs</strong>, the former director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency secured a top spot on Donald Trump’s enemies list on 12 November 2020 <strong>—</strong>by <a href="https://x.com/CISAKrebs/status/1327047087024984064">tweeting</a> a link to <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-elections-infrastructure-government-coordinating-council-election-infrastructure">a statement</a> from government experts that called the presidential election Trump lost “the most secure in American history”.</p> <p>Trump fired Krebs, by tweet, five days later, claiming that the election was marred by “massive improprieties and fraud”.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Krebs returned to the social media platform that has since been sold to Trump’s donor Elon Musk and rebranded X <a href="https://x.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1919917919212847191">to post</a> a simple plea: “Make America normal again”.</p> <p>Things have been far from normal for Krebs since he was singled out for investigation by Trump last month in a presidential memorandum headlined: “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/addressing-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/">Addressing Risks from Chris Krebs and Government Censorship</a>”.</p> <p>The memorandum charged that Krebs had “falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines.”</p> <p>“We’re going to find out about this guy”, Trump said as he signed the memorandum, “because this guy’s a wise guy”.</p> <p>Since then, Krebs has had his security clearance revoked and and his Global Entry pre-approval to enter the US canceled. A spokesperson for the homeland security department in which Krebs once held a senior role, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/former-aide-refuted-trumps-false-2020-election-claims-federal-investig-rcna204394">told NBC News</a> last week that Krebs was ineligible for Global Entry because he “is under active investigation by law enforcement agencies”.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-681a97228f0807a885cdbc97" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-06T23:29:18.217Z">12.29am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Bessent confirms trade talks with China begin Saturday in Switzerland</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1919892282851131728">told the Fox host Laura Ingraham</a> that he will meet with Chinese officials to look for a way out of the trade war Donald Trump started last month when he imposed massive tariffs.</p> <p>“Laura, we haven’t had negotiations,” Bessent said. “The world has been coming to the US, and China has been the missing piece. I was going to be in Switzerland to negotiate with the Swiss. Turns out the Chinese team is traveling through Europe. And they will be in Switzerland, also. So, we will meet on Saturday and Sunday.”</p> <p>“Look, we have shared interests,” Bessent continued. “This isn’t sustainable,” he added, referring to the effective halt in trade between the two largest economies in the world since Trump imposted a 145% tariff on goods from China. That level of tariff, Bessent said “is the equivalent of an embargo”.</p> <p>“We don’t want to decouple. What we want is fair trade,” he said.</p> <p>Bessent’s first statement, that there have been no negotiations with China directly contradicts <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1915446986230079750">a claim</a> Trump made two weeks ago that there have been talks.</p> <p>Asked by Jeff Mason of Reuters on 24 April if he could “clarify with whom the US is speaking with China? They’re saying it’s ‘fake news’ that trade talks are happening”, <a href="https://x.com/BulwarkOnline/status/1915446986230079750">Trump replied</a>: “Well, they had a meeting this morning.”</p> <p>When Mason asked, “Who’s ‘they’?” Trump said: “I can’t tell you; it doesn’t matter who ‘they’ is. We may reveal it later, but they had meetings this morning. And we’ve been meeting with China. So I think you have, Jeff, as usual. I think have your reporting wrong.”</p> <p>As Mason clarified that he “was saying what China said”, Trump abruptly ended the press availability.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-05-06T23:35:48.600Z">at 12.35am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-681a92928f08145062c51b5a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-06T23:05:09.309Z">12.05am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">US treasury secretary and trade representative to meet Chinese officials in Switzerland this week for trade talks</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>US treasury secretary <strong>Scott Bessent</strong> and US trade representative <strong>Jamieson Greer</strong> will meet with their Chinese counterparts later this week in Switzerland, in what could be the first step to negotiating an end to the trade war between the world’s two largest economies over tariffs imposed by Donald Trump.</p> <p>Bessent’s office said in <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0132">a statement</a> that he will travel to Switzerland on Thursday to discuss trade with the Swiss president, Karin Ketter-Sutter, and “will also meet with the lead representative on economic matters from the People’s Republic of China”.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://ustr.gov/about/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2025/may/ambassador-jamieson-greer-travel-switzerland">a statement</a> from Greer’s office, he will also “discuss negotiations about reciprocal trade” with the Swiss leader and “will also meet with his counterpart from the People’s Republic of China to discuss trade matters.”</p> <p>Neither statement revealed the names of the Chinese officials expected to attend, but China’s vice premier He Lifeng is widely seen as China’s economic czar and chief trade negotiator.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-05-06T23:06:07.639Z">at 12.06am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-681a8af98f0807a885cdbc55" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-06T22:38:42.387Z">11.38pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump says three more Israeli hostages have died in Gaza, only 21 remain alive</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Asked to comment on the renewed Israeli assault on Gaza, Donald Trump revealed that three more Israeli hostages have died in Gaza, meaning that just 21 of the hostages taken from Israel on October 7 2023 remain alive.</p> <p>“Well, we’ve gone very slowly,” Trump said of efforts to end the conflict, “because we want to try and get as many hostages saved as possible, and we’ve done a good job in that regard.”</p> <p>“Two weeks ago, I had 10 hostages come in and they thanked me profusely,” Trump continued.

Trump’s directive cast the gender identity of transgender people as a lie and asserted that they are unable to satisfy the standards needed for service in the armed forces.</p> <p>The Pentagon later issued guidance to implement the order, disqualifying from military service current troops and applicants with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria or who had undergone gender transition steps. The guidance allowed people to be considered for a waiver on a case-by-case basis if their service would directly support “war-fighting capabilities.”</p> <p>Settle blocked Trump’s policy, calling it “<strong>unsupported, dramatic and facially unfair</strong>”, and saying that <strong>the administration had provided no evidence of any harm that had resulted from the inclusion of transgender people in the armed services</strong>. After Settle imposed a nationwide hold on the policy and a federal appeals court rejected the administration’s emergency plea, the justice department then turned to the supreme court.</p> <p>The justice department told the supreme court that Settle had usurped the authority of the executive branch of government to determine who may serve in the armed forces. The judge’s injunction “cannot be squared with the substantial deference that the [department of defense’s] professional military judgments are owed”, the justice department said in a court filing.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-05-06T18:29:11.785Z">at 7.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-681a50768f0807a885cdba15" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-06T18:13:59.074Z">7.13pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Oman says it mediated ceasefire between the US and Yemen's Houthis</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Oman</strong> said it mediated a ceasefire deal between Yemen’s <strong>Houthis</strong> and the <strong>United</strong> <strong>States</strong>, according to Reuters, marking a major shift in the Iran-aligned group’s policy since the start of <strong>Israel’s</strong> war in Gaza in October 2023.</p> <p>Neither side will target the other, including US vessels in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait, Oman said in its statement.

Justice department attorney <strong>Drew Ensign</strong> said those orders by two judges in Vermont should never have been issued, as Congress has made clear that any challenges to the government’s decisions to deport someone must proceed in immigration court. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The result is precisely what Congress took particular care to avoid: simultaneous proceedings in both immigration courts and district courts considering the same issues regarding the removal of aliens from the United States.</p> </blockquote> <p>He urged the court to allow the administration to avoid moving Öztürk from the Louisiana detention facility she is being held in and to allow immigration authorities to swiftly take Mahdawi back into custody. But <strong>lawyers for Öztürk and Mahdawi countered that their lawsuits were not about the government’s ability to seek their deportation but instead were</strong> <strong>focused on claims they were unlawfully detained for making constitutionally protected statements critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza</strong>.</p> <p>Öztürk’s lawyers say she is being punished for co-authoring an opinion piece in Tufts’ student newspaper that criticized the school’s response to calls by students to divest from companies linked to <strong>Israel</strong> and to “acknowledge the <strong>Palestinian</strong> genocide”.</p> <p>“Rümeysa Öztürk’s case is unprecedented and shocking,” said Esha Bhandari, her lawyer at the <strong>American Civil Liberties Union</strong>. “She has been held behind bars for six weeks while her health deteriorates for writing an op-ed.”</p> <p>Members of the three-judge panel appeared to struggle with whether immigration law stripped the courts of jurisdiction over the students’ claims, with US circuit judge <strong>Susan Carney</strong> calling the issue “difficult to untangle”. But she spoke <strong>critically of how Öztürk was arrested in the first place</strong>, saying she was “seized in Somerville on the streets by an unmarked vehicle and seized by people who are not in uniform and who are masked and hooded”.</p> <p>US circuit judge <strong>Barrington Parker</strong> questioned whether under the administration’s view of the law someone like Öztürk would be able to even challenge their detention if they believed they were being held due to a case of mistaken identity. He asked:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>How would she be able to challenge that without having to wait months and months in removal proceedings?</p> </blockquote> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/25/trump-tufts-rumeysa-ozturk-ice">Democratic lawmakers call for release of Tufts student from Ice detention</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-05-06T17:50:58.261Z">at 6.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-681a475a8f086f71ec8c8287" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-06T17:32:23.606Z">6.32pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Per Politico: “Trump also seemed to downplay the prospects for major trade deals with other countries during the meeting.

Trump repeated during the meeting his interest in making Canada the 51st US state, saying “it would be a wonderful marriage”, and later adding: “Time will tell.”</p> <p>For the most part, the tone of the meeting was friendly. Trump said that he wants “friendship” with Canada, which he called “a very special place” and said he has “a lot of respect for Canadians”, while Carney called Trump “<strong>a transformational president</strong>” and said the two countries are stronger when they work together.</p> <p>Trump said that the <strong>United State-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)</strong>, inked during his first term in office and set to expire next year, <strong>may be renegotiated</strong>. However, he said he’s not exactly looking to extend the free trade agreement. Trump said he’d consider a renegotiation of the trade deal but questions “if it’s even necessary”, to which Carney followed up: “It is a basis for a broader negotiation.

In a court filing released on Monday, the justice department called Lozano-Camargo a member of “a violent terrorist gang” and said that disqualifies him from asylum in the US. […]</p> <p>Gallagher’s ruling marked the second time that courts have declared that the Trump administration violated pre-existing court orders by deporting people to a notorious El Salvador prison in March. […] US district judge <strong>Paula Xinis </strong>ruled that the administration had disobeyed a 2019 immigration court order barring the government from deporting Ábrego García to El Salvador because he faced a risk of violence there.

While reciprocal tariffs with most trade partners were suspended for 90 days, duties on Chinese goods came into effect in early April, triggering a trade war with Beijing.</p> <p>Imports vaulted 4.4% to an all-time high $419bn in March. Goods imports soared 5.4% to a record $346.8bn. Exports climbed 0.2% to $278.5bn, also a record high. Exports of goods increased 0.7% to $183.2bn.</p> <p>The government reported last week that the trade deficit cut a record 4.83 percentage points from GDP last quarter, resulting in the economy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/30/economy-gdp-q1-trump-tariffs">contracting at a 0.3% annualized rate</a>, the first decline since the first quarter of 2022.</p> <p>Economists expect the flood of imports to ebb by May, which could help GDP to rebound in the second quarter. They, however, caution that the lift from subsiding imports could be offset by a <strong>drop in exports as other nations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/i-feel-utter-anger-from-canada-to-europe-a-movement-to-boycott-us-goods-is-spreading">boycott American goods</a> and travel</strong>.

Trump’s worldview isn’t driven by Marxist theory but by a deep-seated belief that America has been ripped off for decades. He’s also constrained by the rule of law, unlike Mao Zedong’s violent communist regime. Plus, much of Trump’s agenda remains pro-capitalist: He champions private industry and his appeals to sacrifice are rooted in geopolitical competition, not class struggle.]</p> <p>But, Axios writes, listen to recent rhetoric from Trump and his top advisers, and it’s clear why the analogy has gained traction.

week cancelled the first bargaining session scheduled with the US Food and Drug Administration’s largest workers’ union since its ability to represent government staff was temporarily restored by a federal court, according to one of the union’s bosses.</strong></p> <p>Donald Trump in March signed an executive order that excluded agencies from collective bargaining obligations that he said “have as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work”.</p> <p>The order applied to the FDA, as well as agencies under the justice, state, defense, treasury and veterans affairs departments, Reuters reports.</p> <p>Senior US district judge Paul Friedman on 25 April issued an injunction to block the executive order from being implemented, pending the outcome of a lawsuit by the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 160,000 federal employees including as many as 9,000 FDA staff.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time

on Monday that it was ending billions of dollars in research grants and other aid unless the school accedes to a list of demands from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> that would effectively cede control of the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university to the government.</strong></p> <p>The news was delivered to Dr Alan Garber, Harvard’s president, in a deeply partisan <a href="https://x.com/EDSecMcMahon/status/1919517481313427594">letter</a> from Linda McMahon, the education secretary, which she also posted on social media.</p> <p>“This letter is to inform you that Harvard should no longer seek grants from the federal government, since none will be provided,” McMahon wrote.</p> <p>The main reason for the crackdown on Harvard is the school’s rejection of <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf">a long list of demands</a> from the Trump administration’s antisemitism taskforce, prompted by campus protests against Israel’s brutal military campaign in Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks of 7 October 2023. McMahon also accuses the university of “a systematic pattern of violating federal law”.</p> <p>As Garber <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/upholding-our-values-defending-our-university/">explained</a> in a message to the Harvard community last month, the university decided to sue the federal government only after the Trump administration froze $2.2bn in funding, threatened to freeze an additional $1bn in grants, “initiated numerous investigations of Harvard’s operations, threatened the education of international students, and announced that it is considering a revocation of Harvard’s 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status”.</p> <p>The government’s “sweeping and intrusive demands would impose unprecedented and improper control over the university”, Garber wrote.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/05/trump-harvard-grants">Trump blocks grant funding for Harvard until it meets president’s demands</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-05-06T12:07:49.585Z">at 1.07pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6819cc0c8f088a65239d2a47" class="block is-summary" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-06T09:45:31.398Z">10.45am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump to host Canada's Carney at the White House</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Good morning and welcome to our US politics blog as <strong>Donald Trump prepares to welcome his newly elected northern counterpart, Canada’s Mark Carney, to the White House</strong>.</p> <p>At 11.30am ET the president is due to welcome Carney and the event will also include talks and a lunch. This is unlikely to be a straightforward meeting, Trump’s tariffs on Canada and even suggestions that it could become the “51st state” created anger over the border that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/29/mark-carney-donald-trump-canada-election-51st-state-economic-warfare-liberals">helped propel Carney to power</a>.</p> <p>In his victory speech just a week ago, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/29/canada-election-result-liberal-win-mark-carney-anti-trump">Carney claimed that Trump wanted to “break us,</a> so that America can own us”, adding: “That will never, ever happen.”</p> <p>The following day they did have what Trump described as an “extremely productive” call and later he said wanted a “very good relationship” with Canada. Of course, with Trump, things are never predictable, so let’s see how today plays out.</p> <p>Amid the talks, likely to centre on the tariff issue, the pair seems unlikely to discuss another major subject we’ll be covering today – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/05/trump-harvard-grants">Trump’s move to block grant funding for Harvard until it meets his demands.</a></p> <p>The Canadian economist and central banker is a Harvard graduate and served on the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing body, before resigning earlier this year to take up his role leading the Liberal party.</p> <p>In other news:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Trump</a> has said he is directing the administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the notorious former prison on an island off <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> that has been closed for more than 60 years.</strong> California Democrats called the idea “absurd” and part of the US president’s strategy of political distraction. Other officials pointed to the closure of the prison complex in 1963, known for its brutal conditions, due to operational expense and the high number of (unsuccessful) escape attempts.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump announced his 100% tariff on films <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/04/trump-tariffs-foreign-movies">“coming into our country produced in foreign lands”</a> one day after meeting with actor Jon Voight to discuss his proposals to bring film production back to the US</strong> – which only suggested that tariffs could be used “in certain limited circumstances”.</p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Trump’s</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">tariffs policy</a> will trigger a “price shock” and possible shortages, and lead to public pressure on him to change his approach, the former vice-president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pence">Mike Pence</a> has said</strong>.
