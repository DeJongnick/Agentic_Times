Chelsea punished Postecoglou’s gung-ho tactics on their past two trips to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Frank will surely be smarter. Is a switch to a back five on the cards? Chelsea have conceded from three long throws this season. Spurs could have Kevin Danso chucking balls into the box. They will note that Chelsea have improved at offensive set pieces but are conceding too many chances.</p> </blockquote> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/31/thomas-frank-enzo-maresca-tottenham-chelsea-premier-league">Clash of styles awaits as Frank and Maresca face off in growing rivalry</a> </p> </aside>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-01T09:51:55.292Z">at 9.51am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6905ca7b8f089c910df34e09" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-01T09:03:38.864Z">9.03am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Predicted lineups:</strong> our writers bring you all the latest injury news and put forward their probable XIs for all 10 Premier League fixtures, all drawn up with some handy teamsheet graphics.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/31/premier-league-team-news-predicted-lineups-for-the-weekend-action">Premier League team news: predicted lineups for the weekend action</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6905c7948f08e3e3851d172d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-01T08:50:06.321Z">8.50am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Earps: I told Wiegman she was rewarding Hampton's bad behaviour</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Mary Earps has been detailing the story behind her international retirement with England. In her new autobiography All In, serialised exclusively in the Guardian, the PSG goalkeeper reveals the moment she was told by Sarina Wiegman that Hannah Hampton was going to play ahead of her.</p> <p>After Hampton was initially dropped by England in 2022 because of her behaviour, she was recalled in 2023. In April 2024, Wiegman told Earps she planned to play the Chelsea keeper ahead of her in a Euros qualifier.</p> <p>“I don’t get it,” Earps says she told Wiegman. “It’s a qualifier match. And bad behaviour is being rewarded.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/01/mary-earps-interview-sarina-wiegman-hannah-hampton-england-lionesses">In an interview in the Guardian today</a>, Earps says of Hampton: “I think we had different ideas of what being a teammate should be. I think there was a mismatch, a misalignment, of values.”</p> <p>Asked to elaborate on what the disruptive behaviour was, Earps said: “I don’t want to go into the specifics because it’s not my place … She is a very good goalkeeper and I’ve tried to draw a line under all that. I have messaged her privately to say: ‘Look, no bad blood.’”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/31/mary-earps-sarina-wiegman-england-lionesses">Mary Earps says she told Wiegman she was rewarding Hampton’s ‘bad behaviour’</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-01T10:06:19.804Z">at 10.06am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6905c5258f081a1dc7fbf871" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-01T08:40:24.729Z">8.40am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Jack Wilshere’s Luton fended off a fightback from Robbie Savage’s Forest Green</strong> as the FA Cup first round got under way last night.</p> <p>Luton took a 3-0 lead, thanks in part to a double from Nakhi Wells, before their National League opponents surged back to 3-3 with 10 minutes to go at Kenilworth Road.</p>    <p>However, Gideon Kodua’s stoppage-time winner spared Luton’s blushes. “Credit to them,” Wilshere said. “We expected them to be like that, a Robbie Savage team.
