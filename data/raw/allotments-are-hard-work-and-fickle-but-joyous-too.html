<p>Allotments were originally “allotted” to the landless poor of the 18th century to give them dignity, a means of eating and reprieve from the daily grind of land or industrial work (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/18/the-one-change-that-worked-i-gave-up-my-allotment-and-accepted-who-i-really-am">The one change that worked: I gave up my allotment – and accepted who I really am, 18 August</a>). They were a necessity during the two world wars, after which Britain had never been leaner, fitter or taller.</p> <p>Today, we are not as hungry as our ancestors were and life is convenient. However, we are in the throes of obesity, diabetes and mental health crises, we stand on the edge of food supply catastrophe (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/feb/26/yes-we-have-no-tomatoes-why-shelves-are-emptying-in-uk-stores">for example, the tomato crisis of early 2023</a>) and climate change is heavily affecting farmers. I had three children under three and I took on an allotment in my village when war in Ukraine broke out because I wanted to learn, and I wanted to be less reliant on a fragile food system that supplies tasteless fruit and vegetables. I knew little about growing, but quickly came to see that vegetable growing is hard work.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/27/defeated-by-drought-my-bean-growing-efforts-have-failed-after-40-years-of-success">Defeated by drought: my bean-growing efforts have failed after 40 years of success</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nothing looked like it did in the fancy seed catalogues, nothing grew exactly as I thought it would, beasts and pests ate everything and the vegetables were often tougher than supermarket imports, but they were sweeter too. I&nbsp;wrote about the experience in my second book My Family and Other Seedlings .</p> <p>My children are a little older now, but we still work at it together. We often fail, but we have lost so much of what our ancestors knew about growing food that I can’t help but feel that through failure comes understanding. It doesn’t have to be perfect and, frankly, having a go&nbsp;is probably more climate-friendly than recycling. <br><strong>Lalage Snow</strong><br><em>Rimpton, Somerset</em></p> <p>• I too know the relief of admitting that you are not green-fingered and should probably not be left in charge of a garden or allotment. I’ve found that I can still live out that fantasy by joining a community garden (though not while also carrying a baby in a sling). It’s perfect for me – I get to be muddy and enjoy the unique satisfaction of eating something I grew, but if I can’t go for a couple of weeks, everything is fine.</p> <p>Weeding’s always better when you’re with someone to talk to. For me, being part of a group takes away all my gardening shame and brings me only joy. I recommend it.<br><strong>Laurie Nettle</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• Nicola Slawson shouldn’t beat herself up for leaving her allotment. Here in Hanwell, west London, as in most areas, unbribable plot inspectors frequently issue “non-cultivation” notices, but always offer the option of downsizing from a 10-pole plot to a five- or even 2.5-pole one.</p> <p>It is also true that some crops – peas and parsnips, for example – can be hard to bring to harvest, but any five-year-old can manage tomatoes and runner beans.</p> <p>The benefits of exercise and the joyous consumption of fresh fruit and veg are delights indeed, and I do hope that Nicola will once again slip on her boots and head for the oasis of tranquillity that may be found in the heart of&nbsp;even&nbsp;the&nbsp;meanest city.<br><strong>Stephen Pound</strong><br><em>Chair, Framfield Allotment&nbsp;Association</em></p> <p><em><strong>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
