<p>You are right to persist in drawing attention to the need for long-term support of the BBC World Service (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-bbc-world-service-a-boon-to-the-uk-as-well-as-audiences-elsewhere">Editorial, 23 May</a>). It has been an important medium for truthful reporting since the 1930s.</p> <p>I joined in 1967 as PA to its redoubtable editor Bob Gregson. Soon after, it became a 24-hour service, and in the years that followed it became a substantial international service. </p> <p>The reputation of its news and current affairs programmes and independent editorial stance was second to none, and it offered the world what was best in British culture. It was then funded by the Foreign Office.</p> <p>Over recent years, I have seen it shrinking in types of output, yet the importance and reputation of its news and current affairs remains as solid as ever. With the rise in misinformation and disinformation, particularly in these times of international conflict, it remains a beacon of truth. </p> <p>The BBC World Service, and not&nbsp;just the English language service, cannot be allowed to shrink away to a token voice – or worse, nothing. Funding must be found from somewhere. Britain’s international reputation would be poorer without it.<br><strong>Diana Hirst</strong><br><em>Broad Oak, East Sussex</em></p> <p>• Your editorial raises concerns over possible government funding cuts to the BBC World Service. By implication and in light of the government’s 1&nbsp;April announcement to reduce VisitBritain funding by 41%, it is clear how priorities have changed over the use of soft power to influence positive perceptions of the UK – perceptions that will ultimately prove pivotal in securing much-needed economic growth and international investment. <br><strong>Andrew Campbell</strong><br><em>Former chair, Wales Tourism Alliance</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
