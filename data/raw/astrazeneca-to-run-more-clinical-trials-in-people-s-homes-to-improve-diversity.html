<p>AstraZeneca is to let more people take part in clinical trials from the comfort of their own homes in an attempt to increase the diversity of participants.</p> <p>Recruiting volunteers to clinical trials can be difficult, but they are a crucial step in the development of new drugs, tests, devices and other interventions. </p> <p>Concerns have been raised that a lack of diversity among people participating in clinical trials means drugs and medical equipment may be less effective in certain groups.</p> <p>The health secretary, Sajid Javid, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/21/sajid-javid-announces-review-racism-bias-medical-devices">on Sunday </a>announced a review into systemic racism and bias in medical devices to examine why people of colour and women have worse health outcomes.</p> <p>Cristina Durán, the chief digital health officer, R&amp;D, at AstraZeneca told the Guardian typically only 3% to 5% of eligible patients choose to join a clinical trial, with recruitment taking as long as 18 months.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/nov/21/from-oximeters-to-ai-where-bias-in-medical-devices-may-lurk">From oximeters to AI, where bias in medical devices may lurk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Experts <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00100-6/fulltext">have stressed </a>it is crucial there is diversity among trial participants, as genetic, social, and cultural factors can all affect the way different groups respond to interventions.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/07/coronavirus-diversity-vaccine-trial-moderna">Early trials of Covid vaccines were criticised for </a>predominately involving white participants, despite the virus having a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds">disproportionate effect on people of colour</a>. A lack of diversity in clinical trials <a href="https://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/clinical_trials/increasing-racial-diversity">has also been cited by the nonprofit organisation breastcancer.org</a> as one of the potential reasons Black women in the US have worse breast cancer outcomes than other groups.</p> <p>Now <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/what-science-can-do/topics/clinical-innovation/delivering-frictionless-patient-experiences-in-clinical-research.html">experts at AstraZeneca</a> have said shifting data collection to the home may break down barriers to participation in clinical trials, potentially increasing diversity and the speed of research.</p> <p>Durán said before the pandemic the company had sought to delve into the issue of recruitment, by carrying out interviews with patients.</p> <p>“The feedback was mainly that it was very burdensome for patients to participate, because it did require for them to travel to a hospital or site, to spend quite a significant number of hours at that site, either waiting or having the procedures done to collect the data,” said Durán, adding historically about 90% of such data was collected at such locations.</p> <p>Durán said the team found participation could be made far more accessible. “We reviewed close to 100 protocols – those are the instructions of how to run clinical trials – and 70% of that data could be collected[…] at home.”</p> <p>Heart rate and activity are among metrics that can be monitored at home and it is also possible to take blood samples and evaluate lung function. </p> <p>Durán said while it was feasible to collect some of the data at home before the Covid pandemic, the crisis had accelerated the approach.</p> <p>“All the technology was there, but what we’ve seen through the pandemic is a change of behaviour,” she said, with many people having to interact with healthcare in a different way, for example through telemedicine calls with doctors.</p> <p>Phillippa Brown, vice-president of development operations, R&amp;D, at AstraZeneca said that among other approaches to increase participation of minority populations, the company has been increasing the diversity of investigators on clinical trials – a move she suggested could help to build trust with local communities.</p> <p>Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said “increasing diversity in trials is something that virtually every trialist wants to do”. </p> <p>But doing some things from home could come with downsides. “People may not make the measurements as carefully as they are made in a clinic,” he said, adding it was also extremely important participants were unaware of the treatment they have been given – for example whether it was an active drug or a control. “Otherwise the biases could become very substantial,” he said.</p>
