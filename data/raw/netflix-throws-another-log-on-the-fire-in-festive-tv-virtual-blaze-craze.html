<p>It pays the world’s biggest stars and utilises the most cutting-edge special effects to entice families away from terrestrial TV over the festive period.</p> <p>But Netflix viewers this year were instead drawn to one of humanity’s oldest sources of fascination: fire.</p> <p>A recent Christmas tradition of streaming fake flames into the living room was bolstered this year when a virtual log fire became the US streaming company’s most-watched show.</p> <p>The hour-long Crackling Birchwood Fireplace edged out the new series of Squid Game for the <a href="https://x.com/PaulMaddison121/status/1872417261002404181">top UK slot on the streaming service</a> on Boxing Day evening.</p> <p>It features footage of burning wood on an open fire on a loop. According to the programme notes, “snapping, crackling birch logs set the mood for a relaxing good time as a beautiful fire comes to life with glowing embers and dancing flames”.</p> <p>A variation on the fireplace for home franchise, Classic Crackling Fireplace, was the third most watched TV show on Boxing Day. It offers viewers the chance to “enjoy the sights and sounds of a real crackling fire that lends warmth and a festive glow to parties, family gatherings – or a quiet night at home”.</p> <p>By Friday, the popularity of watching these virtual fireplaces had dropped but they were still in the top 10 shows in the UK, at No 6 and No 9.</p> <p>Netflix has been streaming virtual fireplaces since 2013 when the original Fire Place for Your Home was first shown. Since then there have been a number of variations on the theme including Bridgerton: Fireplace, Mid-Century Modern Fireplace and Family Pack: Fireplace, featuring a campfire.</p> <p>The popularity of virtual flames peaks at Christmas. Last year, two fireplace programmes were the <a href="https://x.com/CathStaincliffe/status/1739977558257705211">second and third most watched shows in the UK on Christmas Day</a>.</p> <p>And the phenomenon is not confined to Britain. Crackling Birchwood Fireplace also hit the <a href="https://x.com/THENAMESBLU/status/1872522336295117052">top spot on Netflix in Canada this year.</a> And it was<a href="https://x.com/lukestanton/status/1872476610450047170"> No 2 in the US Netflix Boxing Day chart</a>, with the classic version at No 5.</p> <p>There is even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcyfa7SXQb0">spoof behind-the-scenes documentary</a> about the making of the programme on Netflix’s YouTube channel showing a director fussily selecting logs to be in the foreground of the shot.</p> <p>Netflix has been approached for comment.</p>
