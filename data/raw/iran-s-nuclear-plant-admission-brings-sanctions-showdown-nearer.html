<p>The Iranian nuclear crisis reached a decisive moment yesterday after Tehran was forced to admit it was building a secret uranium enrichment plant inside a mountain in the arid centre of the country.</p> <p>The admission, following the discovery of the plant by the CIA, MI6 and the French DGSE intelligence agency, paved the way for a showdown on Thursday in Geneva, where Iranian officials are due to meet representatives of six major powers.</p> <p>Failure to reach a resolution there would usher in a wave of wide ranging economic sanctions.</p> <p>Yesterday morning, the US, British and French leaders broke away from the G20 summit in Pittsburgh to announce the intelligence findings and condemn the Iranian regime.</p> <p>Barack Obama said western intelligence agencies had known of the secret plant, – near the holy city of Qom, a seat of Shia learning – for more than two years. He called on Iran to allow UN inspectors to visit it, and to co-operate fully with scrutiny of its nuclear programme.</p> <p>Standing alongside him, Gordon Brown and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, said the alternative would be tougher sanctions against the Islamic republic.</p> <p>Moscow issued a separate statement describing the plant as a "violation" of UN security council decisions, and offering to support an investigation.</p> <p>Iran privately acknowledged the existence of the previously undeclared uranium enrichment plant in a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency, after becoming aware that it had been discovered, western officials said. But Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president, remained defiant as he met journalists at UN headquarters in New York yesterday.</p> <p>He claimed the plant was legal and open for scrutiny. "We don't have any problems with inspections of the facility. We have no fears," Ahmadinejad said. He said the three western leaders would "regret this announcement", claiming it had been made to disrupt the Geneva talks.</p> <p>"They wanted to set up a sort of media game, take the stage to sort of set up the upper hand. This is not nice," he said.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad dodged a question about whether Iran had sufficient enriched uranium to manufacture a nuclear weapon, but said Tehran rejected such armaments as "inhumane". "We believe that nuclear weapons are against humanity," he said. "This bomb belongs to the last century."</p> <p>Western officials said the secret enrichment plant was being built in a fortified cavern being drilled out of the side of a mountain on a missile base run by Iran's revolutionary guard. They said it was begun in mid-2006 and was big enough to accommodate 3,000 centrifuges. They said that was far too big to be a pilot plant, as Iran claimed, but far too small produce enough low enriched uranium for electrical power generation. Nuclear experts say that 3,000 centrifuges can produce enough enriched uranium each year to make a bomb, if it is further refined to weapons grade purity.</p> <p>Obama said yesterday: "This site deepens a growing concern that Iran is refusing to live up to those international responsibilities, including specifically revealing all nuclear-related activities."</p> <p>Sarkozy said the world would not be drawn into prolonged talks while the centrifuge "motors are running". He said: "If by December there is not an in-depth change by the Iranian leaders, sanctions will have to be taken."</p> <p>Brown said Iran was guilty of "serial deception" and it was time for the international community to draw a line in the sand. "On 1 October, Iran must engage with the international community and join the international community as a partner," Brown said. "If it does not do so, it will be further isolated."</p> <p>German, Russian and Chinese officials were shown the full intelligence dossier for the first time on Thursday in New York, after it was presented to the IAEA in Vienna.</p> <p>The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that world powers should not shy away from imposing further sanctions if the talks on Thursday failed.</p> <p>The reactions of Russia and China will be critical to how the meeting in Geneva unfolds. Together with the US, Britain, France and Germany, they make up the six-nation group that leads negotiations with Iran. The group has sought to maintain a united face to Iran through years of negotiations, despite internal strains over the use of sanctions.</p>
