<p>Festivals Edinburgh - the umbrella group which represents twelve of Edinburgh's festivals throughout the year- made its latest move towards capturing the imagination of its local online audiences with the launch of the <a href="http://www.festivalslab.com">Innovation Lab</a> last week.</p> <p>The project, funded by a £300,000 grant from Creative Scotland, builds on previous forays into the digital market, most notably last year's <a href="http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/iphone">iphone app</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.festbuzz.com/ ">festbuzz project</a> also ranked festival events based on conversations and comments on social media sites. </p> <p>But one of the factors that make this new project interesting to an Edinburgh audience is the way that its organisers are looking to engage with the local population. Rather than introducing new interaction methods as a result of technological innovations, Rohan Gunatillake, who is heading the project, wants to engage in dialogue about the best way to serve the festival's local audience.<br>Speaking to Guardian Edinburgh he explained: </p> <blockquote> <p>"It is important to highlight that we are at the start of the process, so we are more focussed on our challenges than we are on finding technologies that will match them."</p> </blockquote> <p><br>Some ideas have already been mooted by the group responsible for taking the project forward. These include crowdsourcing, a p<a href=" http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8788780.stm">ractice which sees people invited to contribute their ideas </a>and comments, in this context on various elements of the festivals. </p> <p>However, the fact that no firm parameters have been set for this interaction is one of the exciting features of the Innovation Lab. </p> <h2>Call for developers</h2> <p>As well as communicating with performers and representatives of Festivals Edinburgh's members, the Lab will be looking for ways to enhance audience experience and asking digital innovators to get involved in the project. Edinburgh, it seems, is the perfect setting for such a campaign.<br>"The digital community in Edinburgh is really strong", says Gunatillake, "We are looking for local developers to engage and contribute to this project."</p> <p>Part of this will be the appointment of a "Geek-in-Residence", a part time (four or five days per month) post for somebody with digital experience that can help drive the project forward. The project managers hope that this will allow somebody with fresh eyes on the festivals to enter the innovation working group which is currently overseeing the project, as well as bringing new networks into its communication channels. Anybody wanting more information on applying for the post <a href="http://www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk/geek">can find it here</a>.</p> <p>Gunatillake believes that the introduction of the Lab will help the festivals meet their full potential in the digital realm and implement those ideas that have been suggested but not followed through.</p> <blockquote> <p>"Meeting with the various management teams, we found that there were lots of ideas for trying out new ways of working and using new technologies" he says. "But because their day jobs are putting on the festivals, they do not have the chance or skills to take these ideas and make them happen."</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong>How do you think Edinburgh's festivals-including Hogmanay - could be made more accessible to the digital community? Is Edinburgh given enough attention by organisers? Post your comments below and we will pass them on to the organisers.</strong></p>
