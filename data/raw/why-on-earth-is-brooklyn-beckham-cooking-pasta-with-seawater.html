<p><strong>Name: </strong>Brooklyn Beckham.</p> <p><strong>Age</strong><strong>:</strong> 26.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Tattooed. Also, uncannily like his old man.</p> <p><strong>Occupation … actually, hang on, I think I know this</strong><strong>. He’s a celebrity offspring, isn’t he?</strong> Ouch, cruel. No, he’s actually something in his own right.</p> <p><strong>Footballer?</strong> Never really happened.</p> <p><strong>Model?</strong> Old news.</p> <p><strong>Oh yeah, he’s a photographer, isn’t he?</strong> Again, was. A book of his photos, published when he was just 17, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2017/jun/29/not-brooklyns-finest-whos-to-blame-for-beckham-jrs-photo-debacle">roundly and widely lampooned</a>.</p> <p><strong>So now he’s a</strong><strong>…</strong> Chef.</p> <p><strong>Oh yes, I think I did see that. And what’s he been cooking up?</strong> A bit of a storm as it happens. On a boat ‘n’ all.</p> <p><strong>Go on!</strong> So Peltz Beckham (as he’s called himself since marrying American actor Nicola Peltz in 2022) is working as a chef on a yacht.</p> <p><strong>Good for him. A superyacht presumably?</strong> It certainly could be, judging from the size of the kitchen. This week he shared <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brooklynbeckham/video/7529624993894780174">a TikTok video</a>, filmed on board, demonstrating his tomato pasta.</p> <p><strong>Tomato pasta! Not exactly </strong><strong>cordon </strong><strong>bleu is it? </strong>Previous masterclasses have included <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/cuisine/730080/brooklyn-beckham-baffles-fans-cooking-video-jacket-potato/">one on jacket potatoes</a> with cheese and baked beans.</p>    <p><strong>Does he have any cooking qualifications?</strong> Nothing formal, though that hasn’t stopped him from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/brooklyn-beckham-uber-eats-pop-up-review/">opening a restaurant</a>. And making a video series, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/17/brooklyn-beckham-career-high-profile">Cookin’ With Brooklyn</a>, which also attracted criticism when it was revealed that a whole lot of professionals and a whole lot of money were required to make each episode … but that’s another story.</p> <p><strong>Back to this story then. </strong>So the controversy this time comes with the pasta water, a saucepan of which Brooklyn scoops from … the sea.</p> <p><strong>Ew. Hope the yacht’s not parked off Southend pier, what with Thames Water dumping all that raw sewage upstream.</strong> It looks more like the Med than the Thames estuary. But even so, some commenters were horrified. “That’s disgusting,” one opined. Another waded in: “Obviously cooking pasta in seawater where there are boats that dump diesel into the sea and E coli abounds is not really the best alternative.”</p> <p><strong>But he’s boiling it, presumably</strong><strong> – surely that will kill any bacteria. </strong>I guess. Boiling pasta and rice in seawater is common among seafaring folk, though the general consensus is that it’s too salty and that <a href="https://www.cruiserlog.com/forums/f30/using-sea-water-for-cooking-2457.html">one part sea to two parts fresh</a> is about right.</p> <p><strong>Plus, pasta water requires salt, seawater has salt, so it makes perfect sense. And he’s saving precious fresh water. </strong>Go Brooklyn, eco warrior!</p> <p><strong>Though there’s</strong><strong> no escaping the diesel.</strong> Or the fact that, even if other countries aren’t as bad as the UK at dumping sewage, a lot of toilets on small boats flush straight into the sea …</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Leave the poor boy alone. It must be hard, and at least he’s trying.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> Basil? I think that’s seaweed, Brooklyn …</p>
