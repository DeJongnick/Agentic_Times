<p>Carlo Ancelotti has been confirmed as the new manager of the Brazil men’s team, the first foreign national to take sole charge of the world’s most ­successful national side since&nbsp;1925.</p> <p>After months of speculation, it has been confirmed that the 65-year-old Italian will leave Real Madrid at the end of the Spanish domestic ­season to take up his first ­international ­coaching role. The ­Brazilian ­Football Confederation (CBF) revealed the news in a statement on Monday, welcoming ­Ancelotti, a man they described as a “legend” of the game, and expressing excitement about “a new era of success” under his leadership.</p> <p>“This landmark moment sees the coming together of two icons – the only five-time Fifa World Cup champions and a coach with an unmatched record across Europe’s elite competitions,” the federation said in a statement. “The CBF extends its sincere gratitude to Real Madrid and [the club president] Mr [Florentino] Pérez for the cordiality and sportsmanship shown in facilitating the coach’s release during his contract term, allowing this new chapter to begin with mutual respect and cooperation between the teams.”</p> <p>Ancelotti will start in his new post on 26 May, the day after Madrid play their final league fixture of the ­season, against Real Sociedad. <em>Los&nbsp;Blancos</em> are second in La&nbsp;Liga, seven points behind Barcelona after losing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/11/barcelona-real-madrid-el-clasico-la-liga-match-report">4-3 against their great rivals on Sunday</a>.</p>    <p>It is widely expected that Xabi Alonso will replace Ancelotti at the Bernabéu. The Spaniard, who played for Madrid between 2009 and 2014, announced on Friday that he will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/09/xabi-alonso-confirms-bayer-leverkusen-exit-before-expected-real-madrid-move">leave Bayer Leverkusen</a> at the end of this campaign having led the club to the Bundesliga title and a German Cup double last season. Alonso, it is anticipated, will take charge of Madrid in time for their participation at the newly expanded Fifa Club World Cup that takes place in the US this summer.</p> <p>Ancelotti will depart for South America with an unmatched CV in the European club game. He has won the Champions League a record five times as a mana­ger – three times across two spells with Madrid and twice with Milan. He has also won domestic titles with both of those clubs as well as with Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich.</p> <p>Ramón Platero took charge of the <em>Seleção</em> for four games in 1925 while two other men – Joreca of Portugal and the Argentinian Filpo Núñez – coached them briefly in non-competitive matches. But there has been longstanding opposition to a non-Brazilian taking the role, with 2002 World Cup winner Rivaldo once insisting: “The <em>Seleção</em> is ours and has to be managed by someone who has Brazilian blood running through his veins.”</p>
