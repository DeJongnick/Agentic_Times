Total nonfarm payroll employment shows August saw an increase of just 22,000, down markedly from a revised 79,000 in July and far below estimates. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.3%.</p> <p>“Last month’s payroll data showed large downward revisions to previous months, with May and June’s employment numbers dropping by a combined 258,000 from initial estimates. Today, we have seen a further downward revision to June’s total, taking it from an increase of 14,000 to a decrease of 13,000, and a modest 6,000 upward revision to July’s figure.</p> <p>“Earlier this week, jobless benefit claims ticked higher, and today’s worse than expected payrolls figure cements the fact that the jobs market is weakening significantly. Following the Fed’s decision to hold rates in July, markets had already largely priced in a cut, regardless of today’s numbers. Still, one major obstacle remains. Inflation continues to complicate the Fed’s path, and next week’s CPI print will be critical, especially as several FOMC members remain cautious about easing policy under political pressure. With the full impact of Trump’s tariffs still unfolding, a hotter than expected inflation reading could lead to a split decision later this month.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68badb198f08a33f6288d854" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-05T12:50:13.240Z">1.50pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Dollar slumps after weak jobs report</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The US dollar is weakening on the foreign exchanges, after today’s shockingly bad jobs report.</p> <p>The news that non-farm payrolls rose by just 22,000 in August, missing forecast of 75,000 new jobs, has pushed the dollar down against other major currencies.</p> <p>The pound is now up three-quarters of a cent today, at $1.35, meaning it has now almost recovered its losses during Tuesday’s bond market wobble.</p> <p>The Swiss franc has gained 0.6% too.</p> <p>The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, has dropped by 0.66%, as this chart shows:</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bad96e8f08abd04b4cfaf6" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-05T12:41:34.162Z">1.41pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Where jobs were created, or lost, in August</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The BLS reports that the <strong>US healthcare section</strong> added 31,000 jobs in August, which is below the average monthly gain of 42,000 over the prior 12 months. </p> <p>Employment in <strong>social</strong> <strong>assistance</strong> continued to trend up in August (+16,000), reflecting continued job growth in individual and family services.</p> <p>But there was a 15,000 drop in employment in <strong>federal</strong> <strong>government</strong>.

Reflecting that, our retail sales figures are collected for blocks of four weeks, four weeks and then five weeks (a ‘4-4-5′ approach) and can both sit within a month or span multiple months. This adds complexity to our seasonal adjustment process, given the need to align the collected data to calendar months. The process is complicated further by the pattern of the blocks of four and five weeks sometimes changing.</p> <p>Our review revealed that we had not seasonally adjusted data correctly because we did not properly account for the adjustment in retail reporting calendars. We have now corrected for this mistake.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68ba82b18f08bfd6d85c1474" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-05T06:40:23.648Z">7.40am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Halifax: house prices at record high</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>UK house prices have hit a new record high, lender Halifax has reported this morning.</strong></p> <p>Halifax’s house price index shows that prices rose by 0.3% in August, the third monthly rise in a row.</p> <p>That lifted the average property price to £299,331, a new record high.</p> <p><strong>Amanda Bryden</strong>, head of mortgages at <strong>Halifax</strong>, says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p> “The story of the housing market in 2025 has been one of stability.
