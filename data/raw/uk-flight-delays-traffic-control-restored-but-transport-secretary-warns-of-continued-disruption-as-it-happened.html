The problems raised fears of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/29/air-passengers-face-further-delays-after-uk-air-traffic-control-failure">repeat of chaos at airports</a> in August 2023 when hundreds of thousands of passengers’ flights were delayed or cancelled.</p> <p>British Airways said it was forced to restrict the number of its inbound and outbound flights at Heathrow to 32 an hour until 7.15pm. It said the flow rate would then return to the usual level of 45 an hour.</p> <p>It is understood that the UK National Cyber Security Centre does not view it as a hacking incident.</p> <p>Ryanair called for the Nats chief executive, Martin Rolfe, to resign or be fired. The airline’s chief operating officer, Neal McMahon, said: “It is outrageous that passengers are once again being hit with delays and disruption due to Martin Rolfe’s continued mismanagement of Nats.</p> <p>“Yet another ATC system failure has resulted in the closure of UK airspace meaning thousands of passengers’ travel plans have been disrupted. It is clear that no lessons have been learned since the August 2023 Nats system outage, and passengers continue to suffer as a result of Martin Rolfe’s incompetence.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/30/uk-flights-disrupted-air-traffic-control-glitch-gatwick-birmingham-london">Calls for UK air traffic control boss to resign as new glitch disrupts flights</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-688a66648f08e66ccdc028fb" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-30T18:37:42.575Z">7.37pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “While passengers should continue to check with individual airports for advice, Nats have confirmed their systems are now fully operational and flights are returning to normal.</p> <p>“We are working closely with Nats to understand the cause of the technical issue and the implications for the resilience systems in place.”</p> <p>The department noted the transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, does not have any direct control over Nats and has no powers on staffing decisions.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-30T18:47:09.117Z">at 7.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-688a659c8f08d10b04f31996" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-30T18:34:22.309Z">7.34pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Wednesday’s air traffic control technical fault came as many thousands of families prepared to head off on their summer holiday, writes Rupert Jones and Zoe Wood.</p> <p>Those whose flights have been disrupted have significant rights and entitlements in relation to everything from refreshments to refunds.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/30/uk-flight-delays-disruption-heathrow-gatwick-live-updates">UK flight delays: traffic control restored but transport secretary warns of continued disruption – live updates</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-688a60258f08dc862cec3904" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-30T18:12:22.644Z">7.12pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>John Carr, whose plane was cancelled from Heathrow Airport, said he was worried he would miss his brother’s wedding.</p> <p>Carr, a chiropodist from Stourbridge, was on his way to Norway with a group of friends to help setup his brother’s wedding, for which he is best man, when he found out after checking in his flight was cancelled.</p> <p>The 35-year-old told the PA news agency from outside Terminal 3: “I’m pretty gutted. We’ve got loads of stuff in the suitcases to set up the venue, because we’re obviously flying to Norway. We’ve got the wedding rehearsal to do.

Air traffic control issues fall under this category, meaning passengers are not entitled to compensation for the inconvenience.</p> <p>“Even though compensation may not be available, passengers still have rights. If your flight is cancelled due to ATC problems, the airline must offer you a full refund or an alternative flight to your destination at the earliest opportunity. You may also choose to rebook the flight for a later date, if this is more convenient for you.”</p> <p>McAfee added: “Additionally, airlines are still required to provide care and assistance during delays, even those caused by ATC issues. This includes meals and refreshments (proportional to the waiting time), accommodation and transport to and from the hotel (if an overnight stay becomes necessary), and communication (the airline must cover the cost of two phone calls, faxes, or emails to help you make any necessary arrangements).”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-30T18:11:51.113Z">at
