<p>Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of the national guard to Portland, Oregon, authorizing “full force, if necessary”, ignoring calls from local and state officials who say the president has been misinformed about the scale of a protest outside a federal immigration office.</p> <p>The president says that he has directed all necessary troops to be deployed to protect “war ravaged Portland”, claiming that immigration facilities were “under siege from attack by Antifa and other domestic terrorists”.</p> <p>Officials in Portland have pushed back against the decision and rejected the president’s characterization.</p> <p>“There is no insurrection. There is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city,” said Oregon’s Democratic governor, Tina Kotek.</p> <p>Here are the key stories at a glance.</p>  <h2>Donald Trump says he is deploying troops to Portland, Oregon</h2>  <p>Donald Trump made the announcement on social media, where he claimed that the deployment was necessary “to protect war ravaged

terrorists”.</p> <p>Oregon’s governor, Tina Kotek, rejected the president’s characterization. “In my conversations directly with President Trump and secretary [of homeland security, Kristi] Noem, I have been abundantly clear that Portland and the state of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oregon">Oregon</a> believe in the rule of law and can manage our own local public safety needs,” Kotek said at a news conference in Portland on Saturday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/portland-oregon-us-military-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p>
