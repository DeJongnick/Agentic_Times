<p>An employee at a jewellery shop in Tokyo has been hailed a hero after thwarting an attempted robbery and giving chase after the three suspects fled. But the hero of the hour wasn’t armed with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taser-electronic-weapons">Taser</a> or pepper spray, but with a weapon invented hundreds of years ago by samurai warriors: the <em>sasumata</em>, a pole with two prongs attached to the end.</p> 
<p>After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTpYvNTi2eg">footage </a>of the attempted robbery early on Sunday evening attracted attention online, an auto parts manufacturer that also makes the forked pole reported a deluge of requests for the traditional weapon.</p> 
<p>In the clip, a store employee, dressed in a white shirt and braces, can be seen brandishing the <em>sasumata</em> in an attempt to pacify three men wearing motorcycle helmets after they attempted to rob the business in the capital’s Taito ward.</p> 
<p>He is then seen using the implement to strike a motorcycle – presumably a getaway vehicle – he had knocked to the ground seconds earlier.</p>

<p>The incident has generated a wave of interest in the implement, which according to the public broadcaster NHK, was first used by samurai during the Edo period (1603-1868) to apprehend criminals.</p> 
<p>Far from becoming a museum piece, the <em>sasumata</em>, which is designed to restrain people without seriously injuring them, is still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Mp1mSOqTnk">used by police officers</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a>, NHK said.</p> 
<p>Japanese media reported two suspects had been arrested over Sunday’s incident, while the search for a third continued.</p> 
<p>A firm in Tochigi prefecture, north of Tokyo, has become an unexpected beneficiary of the incident and a spate of other robberies over the past year, telling NHK it had been inundated with calls from people wanting to buy one.</p> 
<p>The firm, whose employees use their metalworking skills to make <em>sasumata</em>, said it once sold just a few every month, but has been receiving as many as 10 orders a day since autumn last year.</p> 
<p>Its range includes a weapon that releases a strong rubber band that wraps around the assailant’s body to inhibit their movement, while another is made of a lighter material to make it easier to use.</p> 
<p>However, the company’s president, Takemitsu Sano, cautioned against using <em>sasumata</em> to start a fight, stressing that they were intended to be for self-defence and were more effective in the hands of people who have been trained to use them, NHK said.</p> 
<p>In 2001, demand for the weapons among teachers rose after a man <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/09/japan.justinmccurry">killed eight children</a> during a knife attack at a primary school in Osaka.</p>
