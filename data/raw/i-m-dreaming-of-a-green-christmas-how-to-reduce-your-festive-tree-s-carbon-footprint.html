<p>I call it the Biennial in our house: 2024, the Christmas tree returns to our living room after a two-year absence. I’m no Scrooge. I’m one of those people who goes big on Christmas. I can quote The Muppet Christmas Carol. I&nbsp;love pigs in blankets. I once chartered a Routemaster to drive through central London so my pals and I could admire the lights.</p> <p>But I can only face having a tree once every two years because it feels somewhat ghoulish dressing a dead tree up, only to watch it slowly drop its&nbsp;needles before unceremoniously dumping it on the pavement several weeks later. We have to move Christopher Figgins, our five-foot fiddle-leaf fig plant, who is fussy at the best of times, down a flight of stairs to make room for it. Somehow, I’m always the person who decorates and un-decorates it. They’re not cheap.</p> <p>More pertinently, I worry about the carbon footprint. The older I get, the more overwhelmed I am by the rampant consumerism of Christmas. Replacing the tree with bowls of narcissi, amaryllis and, one year, a beautiful mantelpiece wreath made of seasonal spruce, pine and dried bits from the garden all felt a bit more manageable.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>The Forestry Commission sells trees – with a walk in the woods as an added wholesome bonus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But, well, Christmas trees are a sort of irreplaceable part of the whole thing. I like the cosiness of sitting in a&nbsp;room lit only by the glow of fairy lights. I love the sheer, vaguely Victorian magic of having a woodland tree in your house. No candle in the world, regardless of the price, can beat&nbsp;the smell.</p> <p>Some might say that an artificial tree could solve my quandary, but the&nbsp;Carbon Trust has found that you&nbsp;have to reuse a plastic tree for more than seven years before it has a&nbsp;smaller&nbsp;footprint than a real one. </p> <p>To lower the footprint of a real tree, choose a&nbsp;locally grown one; the <a href="https://www.forestryengland.uk/real-christmas-trees">Forestry Commission sells trees across the UK</a> with a walk in the woods as an added wholesome bonus. In Scotland, <a href="https://www.caringchristmastrees.com/">Caring Christmas Trees</a> are sustainably grown, with profits going to good causes.</p> <p>I can’t, alas, shove a tree in a Zipcar. Even after 15 years of living in London, I still find the fact they are sold on pavements a bit odd. You can rent pot-grown Christmas trees which go back in January, but getting a slot is a bit like doing the online Christmas supermarket shop – you have to be organised. For the more spontaneous, <a href="https://www.greenelftrees.co.uk/collections/main-shop?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAi_G5BhDXARIsAN5SX7qL9fYcGML4s3cML4fqM0vmMJk5qi5pPMTxvvUewdUtCw9x-ZtXMHMaAqOxEALw_wcB">Green Elf Trees</a> offer a variety of pot-based options: you can keep it in your garden, rent it so that it can be replanted or opt to take one that hasn’t&nbsp;been bought, minimising waste. They also have a collection service, meaning trees are properly composted.</p> <p>Once it’s in place, sawing a chunk off the bottom will help it to take in more water – which is crucial, especially if you’ve got the central heating on.</p>
