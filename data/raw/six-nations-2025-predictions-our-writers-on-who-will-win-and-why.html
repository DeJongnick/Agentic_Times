<h2>Ugo Monye</h2> <p><strong>Who is going to win and why?</strong> France are the favourites for me. The form their players have shown in the Champions Cup is extraordinary. There are six French teams in the last 16 and five have home ties. They are peaking at the right time and also have the world’s best player and captain back in Antoine Dupont.</p> <p><strong>Predicted finishing order</strong> France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Italy.</p> <p><strong>Watch out for </strong>The players from D2 in France, Noah Nene and Alexander Masibaka, tearing it up for France and Scotland respectively. When you have players in your second division playing at the top level of international rugby, it is a reasonable suggestion that your domestic game and player pool is thriving.</p> <p><strong>Top try scorer will be </strong>Louis Bielle-Biarrey. He’s an electric winger, quite possibly the fastest in the Six Nations. The fluidity that France play with and the creativity they have in their backline should offer him plenty of chances.</p> <p><strong>Thing I’m most looking forward to is </strong>England-Scotland on 22 February. Surely Scotland can’t win it five times in a row? What a challenge, what a game! I just love the Calcutta Cup.</p>    <h2>Robert Kitson</h2> <p><strong>Who is going to win and why?</strong> France. Tons of forward power, even more pace and the peerless Antoine Dupont back to sprinkle his magic on the whole <em>gâteaux</em>. A Gallic grand slam would not be a surprise.</p> <p><strong>Predicted finishing order</strong> France, Ireland, England, Scotland, Italy, Wales.</p> <p><strong>Watch out for </strong>Italy causing a surprise at some point. And a Lions bolter or two emerging from the shrubbery. England’s Asher Opoku-Fordjour and Tom Willis and Scotland’s Tom Jordan all have obvious potential.</p> <p><strong>Top try scorer will be </strong>Louis Bielle-Biarrey. It’ll almost certainly end up being Damian Penaud (again) but, hey, where’s the fun in predicting that?</p> <p><strong>Thing I’m most looking forward to is </strong>A thrilling tournament for casual fans and diehards alike. Tedious box-kicking is being increasingly overtaken by greater attacking intent and this year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jan/30/duponts-return-heralds-fizzing-new-era-for-what-could-be-a-spectacular-six-nations">Six Nations could be spectacular viewing</a>.</p>    <h2>Andy Bull</h2> <p><strong>Who is going to win and why?</strong> This French team are overdue a second title given how gifted they are. A grand slam ought to be unlikely given they’ve got three away games, but I think they can do it.</p> <p><strong>Predicted finishing order</strong> France, England, Ireland, Scotland, Italy, Wales.</p> <p><strong>Watch out for</strong> Maro Itoje’s England. The man has been their most consistent player for the best part of a decade. It’s going to be fascinating to see if England find their edge now he’s finally leading the team.</p> <p><strong>Top try scorer will be</strong> Duhan van der Merwe. You can probably pencil him in for a couple against the English to begin with.</p> <p><strong>Thing I’m most looking forward to is </strong>France’s trip to Ireland in the fourth week. Unless England click it will be the defining game of the tournament and the French will want revenge for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/feb/02/france-ireland-six-nations-">beating they took in Marseille</a> last year.</p> <h2>Gerard Meagher</h2> <p><strong>Who is going to win and why?</strong> France. They have unrivalled forward power and a backline to die for, plus the best player on the planet making his return to the Six Nations after his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/27/antoine-dupont-france-rugby-sevens-gold-paris-olympics-2024">Olympic absence last year</a>.</p> <p><strong>Predicted finishing order</strong> France, England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Wales.</p> <p><strong>Watch out for </strong>An England grand slam and Bill Sweeney taking all the credit for it. More seriously, France look to have a raft of players in sensational form and if they turn it on under the lights on Friday it will be a joy to watch.</p> <p><strong>Top try scorer will be </strong>Duhan van der Merwe. Damian Penaud will come close but misses out against Wales while Louis Bielle-Biarrey is sure to score a couple of stunners but the Scotland wing is a proven prolific finisher on this stage.</p> <p><strong>Thing I’m most looking forward to is</strong> Finding out how Italy deal with the expectation that comes a year after their best finish. The tournament is so much richer when the <em>Azzurri</em> are not just a bonus-point banker.</p>    <h2>Michael Aylwin</h2> <p><strong>Who is going to win and why?</strong> France. In the recent ding-dong with Ireland (the pair have finished first and second for the past three years), it’s France’s turn. A gimme opener against Wales, they’ll be motoring come Dublin in round four.</p> <p><strong>Predicted finishing order</strong> France, England, Scotland, Ireland, Italy, Wales.</p> <p><strong>Watch out for </strong>Scotland-Ireland on the second Sunday. Scotland have beaten Ireland once in the past 15. If they manage it this time, can they raise themselves again for Twickenham? A tight championship could hinge on it.</p> <p><strong>Top try scorer will be </strong>Louis Bielle-Biarrey. Think we’ve done Dupont and Penaud, haven’t we, so let’s suggest the latter’s mate on the other wing.</p> <p><strong>Thing I’m most looking forward to is </strong>Introduction of the smart ball. Use currently limited to pinpointing where ball crosses touchline (hardly revolutionary), but if it can one day be deployed to adjudicate on forward passes and ball-groundings …</p>
