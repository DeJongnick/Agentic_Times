<p>The text of the note handed to Donald Trump by Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, on Wednesday afternoon, captured in a photograph, suggested the president could soon announce a ceasefire deal in Gaza on his social media platform.</p> 
<p>“Very close,” the note read, according to an image of the handwritten note taken by Associated Press photographer Evan Vucci. “We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first.”</p> 
<p>Not long after the note was revealed, Trump posted on his Truth Social network, saying he was “very proud” to announce the first phase of the deal.</p> 
<p>“This means that ALL of the Hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace,” he wrote.</p> 
<p>Trump was holding a roundtable event with conservative influencers about antifa when Rubio, standing in the back corner of the White House’s Blue Room, caught his eye.</p> 
<p>He had news for Trump, he said, but it would have to wait until after the media left. Then Rubio passed the president a note.</p> 
<p>“I was just given a note by the secretary of state saying that we’re very close to a deal on the Middle East, and they’re gonna need me pretty quickly,” Trump said. “So we’ll take a couple of more questions.”</p> 
<p>The event had already been going on for more than an hour when Rubio first approached. The president invited him to come in, and Rubio whispered something to Trump before handing him the note.</p> 
<p>The note’s urgent tone came as Trump’s top Middle East adviser, Steve Witkoff, the Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and other senior officials joined a third day of peace talks between Israel and Hamas at an Egyptian resort – a sign that negotiators aim to dive deeply into the toughest issues of a US plan to end the war in Gaza.</p> 
<p>Trump had kicked off the influencer event by telling assembled journalists that he planned to travel to the Middle East “toward the end of the week” and could even “make the rounds” in the region to Egypt and possibly Gaza as US negotiators closed in on a deal.</p> 
<p>Still, even after Rubio passed Trump the note, Trump continued to talk to the influencers and take questions from the media as the secretary of state became visibly anxious.</p> 
<p>Nearly 10 minutes after his initial comments about leaving, Trump said: “I have to go now to try and solve some problems in the Middle East – although I’m very well represented by our secretary of state. He could probably do an even better job than me, but who knows.</p> 
<p>“We don’t want to take any chances. So we’re going to go and do that,” Trump added.</p> 
<p>He then suggested Pam Bondi and Kristi Noem stay and take questions in his absence. However, Trump continued to take questions before the event finally broke up without cabinet members remaining behind.</p> 
<p>“We’re gonna get peace in the Middle East,” Trump wrapped by saying. “That’s what we want to do.”</p>
