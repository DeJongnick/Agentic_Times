But this is a necessity because we are the unique crazy place where we don’t protect our domestic players. In the US, you have a US agenda. In China, it’s no more Chinese preference, it is a Chinese exclusivity sometimes.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>He said <strong>Europe was “the only place where you put regulations on your players, but at the same time you negotiate the lifting of barriers with non-European players with a double standard”.</strong> This is almost certainly a reference to the EU trade deal with Mercosur, which France argues disadvantages European farmers.</p> <p><strong>Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk, who has argued for a review of some Green Deal regulations,</strong> said the <strong>EU should be easing demands on companies</strong> to allow them to compete with more lightly regulated competitors elsewhere in the world.</p> <p>He recounted his “blunt” exchanges with Polish steel companies, who he said wanted deregulation, rather than simply state aid, i.e. subsidies or tax breaks. </p> <blockquote> <p><em>“This is why <strong>we have to think about our real acceleration when it comes to the deregulation process.</strong> Our ambitions cannot mean that we continue to impose new burdens on companies, it cannot mean that because of Europe, companies lose competitiveness vis-à-vis the world. </em></p> <p><em>Look at the world around us: we Europe are responsible for only 6% of the world’s emissions, <strong>we cannot constantly be the ones who reduce emissions at the pace that no company can bear.</strong> We cannot constantly increase our ambition when others do not.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>While the <strong>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen</strong> highlighted that <strong>she had made six proposals to cut red tape in different areas</strong>, the so-called omnibuses, which she claimed added up to an €8bn reduction in bureaucracy for business. </p> <p>She highlighted that none had been agreed by the EU’s co-legislators, i.e. the Council of Ministers and European parliament.

break Israel’s aid blockade of Gaza said on Wednesday that several of its boats had been approached by patrol vessels and a submarine, as crews braced for an Israeli raid.</strong></p>    <p><strong>The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF),</strong> carrying around 500 pro-Palestinian activists – among them the climate campaigner <strong>Greta Thunberg</strong> – says its mission is to establish a humanitarian corridor into Gaza. </p> <p>The convoy, which also includes humanitarian supplies, is <strong>currently being shadowed by a Spanish naval ship</strong> providing cover in case of drone attacks.</p> <p>Until Tuesday, the flotilla was also escorted by <strong>an Italian warship that</strong>, according to organisers, <strong>offered participants the chance to abandon their vessels before entering what has been described as a “critical zone”</strong>. The activists rejected the offer, denouncing it as an attempt to sabotage the mission. Italy has since withdrawn its frigate.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Italian government and the president of the Republic, <strong>Sergio Mattarella</strong>, had <strong>repeatedly urged the flotilla to avoid confrontation with Israel and to deliver aid instead via Israeli or Cypriot ports.</strong> </p> <p><strong>Activists, however, insist their operation is not about the aid</strong> – which they describe as largely symbolic – <strong>but about breaking Israel’s “illegal siege”</strong> of the territory.</p> <p>“Our mission stays true to its original goal of breaking Israel’s illegal blockade and delivering humanitarian aid to the besieged population of Gaza,” said four Italian opposition MPs on board the vessels in a joint statement.</p> <p>The flotilla was attacked last week by drones that dropped stun grenades and itching powder, causing minor damage but no injuries.</p> <p><strong>Israel’s navy has said it is preparing to seize control of the more than 50 vessels now within its interception range. </strong>The elite Shayetet 13 naval commando unit is reportedly on standby for the operation, which could involve towing ships to the port of Ashdod or sinking some at sea, according to Israel’s public broadcaster Kan.</p> <p>In a post on X, Israel’s foreign minister, <strong>Gideon Sa’ar</strong>, said <strong>the flotilla’s rejection of the Italian proposal to unload aid in Cyprus proved that “their real purpose is provocation and serving Hamas”.</strong></p> <p>Italy’s prime minister, <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong>, has also called on the flotilla to halt its mission, warning that any attempt to break the blockade could jeopardise a recent US-brokered peace initiative between Israel and Hamas.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68dcd8118f083cb646624663" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/jakub-krupa"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-01T08:09:26.117Z">9.09am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: Things can only get worse</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Danish prime minister <strong>Mette Frederiksen </strong>warned that the recent drone sightings in Danish airspace warning are “only the beginning; it will get worse and it will get more serious.”</p> <p>In two major interviews, with the Danish newspaper <a href="https://www.berlingske.dk/politik/mette-frederiksen-taler-om-et-forandret-europa-jeg-tror-kun-det-her-er-begyndelsen-det-bliver-vaerre-endnu-og-det-bliver-endnu-mere-alvorligt">Berlingske</a> (£) and with the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4c03d08e-4a05-4d98-8d09-2927c74a211a">Financial Times</a> (£), <strong>Frederiksen urged Europe to discuss “more deeply” what the new security situation means for the continent</strong> and how it should respond to counter the threat.</p>    <p>In a stark remark, <strong>she said that the situation in Europe reminded her of that in the interwar period in the 20th century</strong>, as the continent faces the threats arising from the “real war” in Ukraine, and the new, broader hybrid war waged against it.</p> <p>“<strong>The idea of a hybrid war is to threaten us, to divide us, to destabilise us.</strong> To use drones one day, cyber attacks the next day, sabotage on the third day.
