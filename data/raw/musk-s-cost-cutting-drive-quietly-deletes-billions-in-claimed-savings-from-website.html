<p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>’s cost-cutting drive, the so-called “department of government efficiency (Doge), posted its <a href="https://www.doge.gov/savings">“wall of receipts”</a> boasting of major savings to the federal budget, the list was billed as the proud public interface of a radical shake-up of the US government.</p> <p>Instead, like much of Musk’s unprecedented engagement with the federal bureaucracy, the initiative has been mired in errors, confusion and obfuscation.</p> <p>In the latest embarrassment to befall the site, Doge has stealthily expunged all of the five largest items on the “wall of receipts” after the much-vaunted “savings” were revealed to be so much hot air.</p> <p>The deletions, first reported by the New York Times, were made on Tuesday without explanation. A White House spokesperson would only say that Musk’s slash-and-burn initiative had “identified billions of dollars in savings”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/us-climate-research-agency-noaa-cuts">US climate research agency braces for ‘efficiency’ cuts: ‘They will gut the work’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Doge is currently claiming it has succeeded in lopping $65bn from federal spending, a sharp rise from its earlier figure of $55bn. Yet the itemized savings listed on the “wall of receipts” have plummeted since the deletions from $16.6bn to $9.6bn.</p> <p>The “wall of receipts” is the only element of public accountability offered by Musk, the world’s richest man who has been given virtual carte blanche by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> to probe federal government departments. The webpage is strap-lined: “The people voted for major reform.”</p> <p>What the people have so far been delivered is a “saving” to the costs of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) listed on the “wall of receipts” as being worth $8bn. As the New York Times points out, the entire budget of the immigration agency is about $8bn – in fact the cost savings should have correctly been recorded at $8m.</p> <p>That slip of the accounting pen has now disappeared from Doge’s site. Among the other four big-figure “savings” also deleted are three cuts of $655m each to the budget of the beleaguered US Agency for International Development, USAid.</p> <p>That sounded impressive, until it was uncovered by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-wall-of-receipts-shows-errors-tallying-billions-in-savings/">CBS News</a> to be a single cut, counted erroneously three times.</p> <p>The largest of the five vanishing “savings” was a $1.9bn item listed as a cut at the treasury department. That was based on a contract that was cancelled last year, at a time when Joe Biden was in the White House.</p>
