 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It’s coming up to 9pm in the UK. This blog will be closing shortly but you can find all the Guardian’s UK politics coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics">here</a>.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>According to the Metropolitan police, about 110,000 people were in attendance in central London for a ‘unite our kingdom’ march featuring far-right activist Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon</strong>. Crowds of people waving St George’s and union flags made their way from near Waterloo Bridge to Whitehall.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A smaller counter-protest led by Stand Up to Racism, with a march led by a Women Against the Far Right contingent including the MPs Zarah Sultana and Diane Abbott, saw supporters gather in Russell Square before heading towards Whitehall. </strong>The Met police estimated there were about 5,000 in the crowd, with many holding placards that said “refugees welcome” and “oppose Tommy Robinson” while chanting “say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Police said they had to intervene in multiple locations to try to stop supporters of the “unite the kingdom” march from entering sterile areas. </strong>The force also said that a number of officers had been assaulted, and that some members of the crowd breached police cordons or tried to reach opposing groups. </p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>There were nine arrests, with many more likely, the Met said, as violence flared at the protest. </strong>More people were identified to be committing offences. “We will find them and they will face police action, even if it is not possible to do so today,” the force wrote in a social media post.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> <strong>addressed the crowd attending the march via video link. He said a “dissolution of parliament” and a “change of government” is needed in the UK, and also railed against the “woke mind virus”.</strong> Other speakers included Katie Hopkins and French far-right politician Éric Zemmour.<br></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Elsewhere, away from the demonstrations near Whitehall, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a> was photographed attending the Arsenal v Nottingham Forest football match</strong> taking place at the Emirates Stadium in north London.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Home secretary condemns protesters</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The home secretary condemned protesters who attacked and injured police officers at the march.</p> 
  <p><strong>Shabana Mahmood</strong> posted on X on Saturday evening: “The right to peaceful protest is fundamental to this nation. I thank the police who worked hard to ensure much of today’s protest was peaceful.</p> 
  <p>“But I condemn those who have attacked and injured police officers. Anyone taking part in criminal activity will face the full force of the law.”</p> 
  <p>Also on X, Liberal Democrat leader <strong>Sir Ed Davey</strong> criticised Elon Musk for comments delivered via video link in which he said a “dissolution of parliament” and a “change of government” were needed in the UK.</p> 
  <p>Davey said: “Our democracy is too precious to be a plaything for foreign tech barons.</p> 
  <p>“Elon Musk doesn’t care about the British people or our rights. He only cares about himself and his ego.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Counter-protesters penned in</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Ben Jamal</strong>, director of the <strong>Palestine Solidarity Campaign</strong>, was one of the anti-fascist counter-protesters who was blocked in by supporters of the <strong>“unite the kingdom”</strong> march in central London.</p> 
  <p>Jamal said that as the some of the supporters of the counter-protest, led by Stand Up to Racism, attempted to get to Whitehall, they were surrounded by thousands of marchers from the “unite the kingdom” march, led by far-right activist <strong>Tommy Robinson</strong>. This created a blockade and meant they were unable to move without intimidation from marchers.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Metropolitan police</strong> said it was trying to create a safe route for these counter-protesters to leave. However Jamal said those in the anti-fascist crowd were told the force did not have the resources to help at the time.</p> 
  <p>Jamal said that the counter-protesters aimed to keep morale high through music and dancing, although there was still “a degree of fear” created by the sheer scale of the “unite the kingdom” march. “There was a sense of astonishment that this was allowed to happen, there were fascists on top of government buildings,” he said.</p> 
  <p>He criticised the police’s “inability or unwillingness” to get them out of the blockage.</p> 
  <p>He said: “It is a deeply depressing spectacle when there are many people marching in support of racist narratives.</p> 
  <p>“For 22 months I’ve been leading pro-Palestine marches which have been demonised by the police. But today, they seemed unable or unwilling to stop fascists effectively imprisoning fellow citizens for three to four hours.</p> 
  <p>“There need to be extremely important questions asked to Mark Rowley and the home secretary.”</p>

  <p>More scuffles broke out between police and supporters of the <strong>“unite the kingdom”</strong> march as they moved out of <strong>Whitehall</strong>, PA reports. </p> 
  <p>Objects including a traffic cone, bottles and pieces of wood were thrown at the line of officers as they started to push the group back towards Trafalgar Square and Northumberland Avenue at around 5.25pm.</p> 
  <p>After this, at about 5.45pm, than a hundred helmeted officers on foot, backed up by dozens of police horses, have rushed at supporters and them along Northumberland Avenue and towards Embankment station. Some marchers - now largely dispersed - faced them carrying flags.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Elon Musk addresses the "unite the kingdom" march crowd via video link</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> has addressed crowd attending the <strong>“unite the kingdom”</strong> march, via video link. He spoke to march leader, far-right activist <strong>Tommy Robinson,</strong> whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, over the video call.</p> 
  <p>Musk claimed that a “dissolution of parliament” and a “change of government” is needed in the UK. He said: “I really think that there’s got to be a change of government in Britain. You can’t – we don’t have another four years, or whenever the next election is, it’s too long. Something’s got to be done. There’s got to be a dissolution of parliament and a new vote held.”</p> 
  <p>Musk told the march rally: “My appeal is to British common sense, which is to look carefully around you and say ‘If this continues, what world will you be living in?’</p> 
  <p>“This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn’t get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. They don’t want that, they’re quiet, they just go about their business.</p> 
  <p>“My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice. You’re in a fundamental situation here. Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that’s the truth, I think.”</p> 
  <p>The X owner told the crowd “the left are the party of murder”, referring to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images">death of Charlie Kirk</a>. He said: “There’s so much violence on the left, with our friend Charlie Kirk getting murdered in cold blood this week and people on the left celebrating it openly. The left is the party of murder and celebrating murder. I mean, let that sink in for a minute, that’s who we’re dealing with here.”</p> 
  <p>Musk also said that the British public are “scared to exercise their free speech” and claimed the BBC was “complicit in the destruction of Britain”.</p> 
  <p>When they finished their conversation, Robinson said: “Not only are we in the fight right now, but we’re on the advance thanks to free speech being fought for, for us, by Elon Musk.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Metropolitan police</strong> have said nine arrests have been made so far at the Tommy Robinson-led <strong>“unite the kingdom”</strong> march, although “many more people have been identified as committing offences.”</p> 
  <p><a href="https://x.com/metpoliceuk/status/1966894521276371019">Writing on X</a>, the force said: “We will find them and they will face police action, even if it is not possible to do so today.”</p> 
  <p>The post by the Metropolitan police also said officers are continuing to face aggression in multiple locations, in particular at the north of Whitehall. This is where the police are attempting to create safe routes for those attending the anti-fascist counter protest, led by <strong>Stand Up To Racism</strong>.</p> 
  <p>According to the police, officers also faced “unacceptable violence” by attendees of the “unite the kingdom” march at Victoria Embankment, where supporters went to try to access Whitehall as the turnout for the march was too large. </p> 
  <p>Officers were reportedly kicked and punched. Bottles, flares and other projectiles were thrown.</p>

  <p>A giant dance party has erupted among the anti-fascists who are trapped on <strong>Whitehall</strong> with far-right groups on every side.</p> 
  <p>The sun has almost come out and people of all ages are dancing to Lose Yourself to Dance by Daft Punk. Some of the moves are questionable but everyone is in good spirits.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, at the <strong>Trafalgar Square</strong> end of <strong>Whitehall</strong>, clashes are continuing between police and the supporters of the <strong>“unite the kingdom”</strong> march, but the police are slowly gaining ground. Fireworks were fired at mounted police from the supporters.</p> 
  <p>On the other side of the barrier, antifascists are chanting. An injured man with blood coming from a head wound was carried through the barrier by police medics and brought through the crowd of antifascists who jeered and shouted “nazi scum”.</p>

  <p>Here are some images coming in today via the newswires of crowds gathering in central <strong>London</strong> for a march featuring far-right activist <strong>Tommy Robinson</strong>, whose real name is <strong>Stephen Yaxley-Lennon</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The rally is expected to attract upwards of 40,000 attenders, according to the anti-extremism group <strong>Hope Not Hate</strong>. A smaller gathering organised by the group <strong>Stand Up to Racism</strong> is also taking place.</p>

  <p>It is the work shortcut that dare not speak its name. A third of people do not tell their bosses about their use of <strong>AI tools</strong> amid fears their ability will be questioned if they do.</p> 
  <p>Research for the Guardian has revealed that only 13% of UK adults openly discuss their use of AI with senior staff at work and close to half think of it as a tool to help people who are not very good at their jobs to get by.</p> 
  <p>Amid widespread predictions that many workers face a fight for their jobs with AI, polling by Ipsos found that among more than 1,500 British workers aged 16 to 75, 33% said they did not discuss their use of AI to help them at work with bosses or other more senior colleagues. They were less coy with people at the same level, but a quarter of people believe “co-workers will question my ability to perform my role if I share how I use AI”.</p> 
  <p>The Guardian’s survey also uncovered deep worries about the advance of AI, with more than half of those surveyed believing it threatens the social structure. The number of people believing it has a positive effect is outweighed by those who think it does not. It also found 63% of people do not believe AI is a good substitute for human interaction, while 17% think it is.</p> 
  <p>Next week’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/king-charles-schedules-trump-state-visit-for-when-uk-parliament-is-in-recess">state visit to the UK</a> by <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is expected to signal greater collaboration between the UK and <strong>Silicon Valley</strong> to make Britain an important centre of AI development.</p> 
  <p>The US president is expected to be joined by <strong>Sam Altman</strong>, the co-founder of <strong>OpenAI</strong> who has signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK government to explore the deployment of advanced AI models in areas including justice, security and education. <strong>Jensen Huang</strong>, the chief executive of the chip maker <strong>Nvidia</strong>, is also expected to announce an investment in the <strong>UK’s biggest datacentre yet</strong>, to be built near <strong>Blyth</strong> in <strong>Northumbria</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/uk-to-mainline-ai-in-the-veins-under-new-plans-from-sir-keir-starmer-13287743">has said</a> he wants to “mainline AI into the veins” of the UK. Silicon Valley companies are aggressively marketing their AI systems as capable of cutting grunt work and liberating creativity.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Charlie Kirk killing invoked to bolster UK’s largest far-right rally in decades</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The killing of <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong> is being used by <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson">Tommy Robinson</a></strong> to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades, which will include speakers from <strong>Britain</strong>, the <strong>US</strong> and <strong>Europe</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Steve Bannon</strong>, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s former chief strategist, is among those listed to appear on stage at the rally in central <strong>London</strong>, which is expected to draw tens of thousands for an event that Robinson has been heavily attempting to monetise.</p> 
  <p>Other planned speakers on Saturday include <strong>Ant Middleton</strong>, a former UK special forces soldier who has increasingly used far-right rhetoric, as well as an MP for <strong>Germany</strong>’s far-right <strong>AfD party</strong> and a far-right <strong>Polish</strong> MEP.</p> 
  <p>Other Americans making the trip include <strong>Joey Mannarino</strong>, a self-styled US rightwing commentator who said: “All rape cases have just become fake to me” after a civil case alleging sexual assault by Trump.</p> 
  <p>However, there are doubts about whether one of the most high-profile speakers, the <strong>Canadian</strong> psychology professor and culture warrior <strong>Jordan Peterson</strong>, will appear.</p> 
  <p>While he is listed in the lineup and has been a supporter of Robinson online, he has made no mention of the event recently. His appearance would also pose questions about his continued association with the <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/20/us-culture-war-show-arc-london-strikes-chord-european-populists">Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC)</a></strong>, a yearly gathering in London involving businesses and conservatives that has included the Conservative leader, <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>, and <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the leader of Reform UK.</p> 
  <p>A pause on any new leave being booked has been imposed by police, who have had to contend with violence on the fringes of previous events involving Robinson, whose real name is <strong>Stephen Yaxley-Lennon</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The rally is expected to attract upwards of 40,000 attenders, according to the anti-extremism group <strong>Hope Not Hate</strong>. A smaller gathering organised by the group <strong>Stand Up to Racism</strong> is also taking place.</p> 
  <p>The Stand Up to Racism march to a rally at <strong>Whitehall</strong> will be led by a <strong>Women Against the Far Right</strong> contingent including the MPs <strong>Zarah Sultana</strong> and <strong>Diane Abbott</strong>.</p>

  <p>There has been a joke going around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/labour">Labour</a> MPs over the past week about three envelopes in Soviet Russia. “Whenever you run into trouble, open them in order,” the instructions go. Envelope one says: “Blame your predecessor.” So he does – and it works. The party officials are satisfied. A year later, problems arise again. He opens envelope two. It says: “Restructure the organisation.”</p> 
  <p>He does a big reshuffle, changes some titles, and again buys himself some time. Finally, another crisis comes. He opens envelope three. It says: “Prepare three envelopes.”</p> 
  <p>The problem for <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a></strong> is that the MPs sharing the joke believe he has already opened his first two. It is becoming increasingly hard to find anybody in the Labour party who will argue that things are going anything other than disastrously for the government.</p> 
  <p>They fear that attempts to deal with the multiple difficulties faced by the prime minister over the past year – many of them self-inflicted errors such as the <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/21/keir-starmer-confirms-u-turn-on-winter-fuel-payment-cuts">winter fuel duty</a></strong> decision, the freebies row and the handling of <strong>welfare cuts</strong> – have instead unleashed more chaos.</p> 
  <p>The most recent example of this is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations">sacking of </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations">Peter Mandelson</a></strong>. When ministers warned that his scandal-ridden history indicated he was more of a risk than an asset – even when the security services allegedly shared concerns – Starmer went ahead and appointed him.</p> 
  <p>Then, even though Mandelson had warned publicly that more “embarrassing” emails from him to convicted child sex offender <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> were about to be published, Starmer defended him at prime minister’s questions.</p> 
  <p>With his political judgment repeatedly questioned, Labour people turn to his “vision” for Britain. The problem is they can’t identify what the prime minister really believes in. Allies say he doesn’t like the “V word” and has made no secret of being a distinctly non-ideological politician.</p> 
  <p>Instead, he believes the government should demonstrate change by making a material difference to people’s lives, through schools, the <strong>NHS</strong>, the immigration system and the economy, even if that is in relatively slow, incremental steps.</p> 
  <p>“It’s hopeless,” one minister said. “Too many people feel the country is in decline and the only route back is big, radical solutions. We’re doing lots of good stuff but it barely gets noticed. It just doesn’t hit the mark.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer's operation has 'gone into the bunker' after cabinet reshuffle, says Labour MP</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Backbench Labour MP <strong>Olivia Blake</strong> said it feels like <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>’s operation has “gone into the bunker”.</p> 
  <p>Discussing last week’s reshuffle, she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It does feel like they’ve gone into the bunker, but they’ve actually thrown half the people out of the bunker at the moment, and we need to get back to a much more inclusive parliamentary Labour party (PLP), inclusive discussions happening with ministers and better representation around the cabinet table.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>After a disastrous week in which <strong>Angela Rayner</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/angela-rayner-stands-down-over-stamp-duty-row">resigned</a> and <strong>Peter Mandelson</strong> was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/keir-starmer-sacks-peter-mandelson-over-jeffrey-epstein-revelations">sacked</a> as ambassador to <strong>Washington</strong>, Labour MPs have begun to ask whether Starmer could be challenged as prime minister.</p> 
  <p>A number of MPs said a challenge was likely if local and <strong>Welsh elections</strong> went badly next May. Some said the one thing now protecting Starmer was the lack of an agreed replacement.</p> 
  <p>Blake said last week’s reshuffle saw a “narrowing” of representation of different parts of the party in ministerial positions:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>People just felt that it was such a large reshuffle and, you know, people who were actually delivering in their posts were moved. And it just kind of felt like there was a real narrowing in who was sat around the table, and that can’t be positive, because I think there’s a sense that the leadership don’t like to be challenged.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked about the No 10 operation, she said it was “really embarrassing” if Starmer was not told about Lord Mandelson’s emails to <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> soon enough, amid suggestions <strong>Downing Street</strong> was aware of the messages before the prime minister defended the ex-ambassador on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>Blake said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We saw through the welfare reforms that they did the same again. They didn’t tell Keir, they didn’t tell the prime minister how bad it was on the back benches. So, you know, he was putting statements out saying, ‘oh, some people can sound off’.</p> 
   <p>Well, the strength of feeling in the PLP was much, much deeper than that. And again, I just think that whoever’s gatekeeping the information to the prime minister needs to stop. They need to be getting stuff to him much earlier.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She also said backbenchers are frustrated after a number of “own goals” for the government. Blake, the MP for <strong>Sheffield Hallam</strong>, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme it is “frustrating” that the good work the government has done is “not cutting through” and added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Instead, we’ve had a number of kind of own goals, and that has meant that we’ve slipped heavily in the polls, and that we seem to be more interested in focusing on each other rather than what’s in the best interest of the country at the moment.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>More on this story in a moment. Here are some other key developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/tommy-robinson">Tommy Robinson</a> to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades</strong>, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Senior Labour MPs and the UK’s largest anti-fascist campaign group have called on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a> to mount a more heartfelt defence of diversity and anti-racism.</strong> They say they fear that Labour is not yet putting its “heart and soul” into the battle against Nigel Farage and the far right. Hope Not Hate’s chief executive has written a letter to Starmer in the lead up to a planned far-right demonstration in London on Saturday, demanding the prime minister speak up more against hate and racism.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Lucy Powell has called for a “change of culture” inside Starmer’s Downing Street to make it more inclusive and better connected to MPs</strong>, promising that as Labour’s deputy leader she would when needed deliver difficult truths to the prime minister. Speaking to the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/11/phillipson-and-powell-confirmed-as-final-contenders-in-labour-deputy-race">after she secured</a> 117 MP nominations in the battle to replace Angela Rayner, Powell said a sequence of what she called “unforced errors” by the government had left many Labour MPs and members frustrated.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The bill to legalise assisted dying is a “licence to kill” that puts vulnerable people at risk, Theresa May has said</strong>, as the legislation was <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2025/sept-2025/assisted-dying-bill-considered-by-lords/">debated in the House of Lords</a> for the first time. The former prime minister said she opposed the bill because she said people in England and Wales with disabilities, chronic illnesses or mental health conditions could feel under pressure to end their lives, and “because there is a risk that legalising assisted dying reinforces the dangerous notion that some lives are less worth living than others”.</p></li>
