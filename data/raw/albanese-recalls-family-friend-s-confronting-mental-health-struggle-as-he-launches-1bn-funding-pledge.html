<p>Anthony Albanese became visibly emotional while recalling the mental health struggle of a family friend who nearly died, as he launched Labor’s $1bn pledge to boost access to treatment and counselling.</p> 
<p>The prime minister recalled being shocked as a young man by the difficulties faced by his friend’s niece and said many Australians have “issues that we need to talk about more”.</p> 
<p>“[She] ended up in Royal Prince Alfred [hospital] with an eating disorder,” Albanese told a Tuesday morning press conference in Sydney. “I was still pretty young at the time. I hadn’t seen anything like that.</p> 
<p>“She almost died. She is now well and has children of her own. But that was really confronting.”</p>

<p>Albanese also recalled speaking to the parents of a young woman called Charlotte, who took her own life, and praised their bravery. He said her experience was one of the reasons his government sought to introduce <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/05/australia-social-media-ban-trial-global-response-implementation">age restrictions on social media platforms</a>.</p> 
<p>“In general, it is quite clear that young men and young women have issues that we need to talk about more,” Albanese said. “When I was my son’s age, no one talked about these issues. I went to school with people and you knew there was an issue, but it wasn’t defined and wasn’t acceptable.”</p> 
<p>Labor has pledged $500m for 20 youth specialist care centres, as well as $225m for 31 new and upgraded Medicare mental health centres, and $200m for expanding or starting 58 Headspace centres.</p> 
<p>The youth centres will be focused on addressing “the missing middle”: complex needs that can be addressed outside hospitals, such as personality disorders, eating disorders and early psychosis.</p>

<p>The health minister, Mark Butler, said the Coalition’s previously announced competing policy of doubling the number of Medicare-backed mental health sessions would “create a bottleneck that means tens of thousands of Australians get no help at all” by “piling more demand on private psychologists”.</p> 
<p>The shadow minister for health, Anne Ruston, welcomed the additional funding for Headspace centres but dismissed Butler’s criticism as “disappointing”.</p> 
<p>“You would not ration a medical service in any other situation in the health sector,” Ruston said. “So I don’t know why this government thinks that you should ration mental health services.”</p> 
<p>“We have seen through the Productivity Commission that … the number of new people that are coming on, getting access to these sessions, has actually gone backwards to the lowest level in a decade.”</p> 
<p>The announcement was welcomed by mental health experts including Mental Health Australia, Headspace and Orygen’s Patrick McGorry, who called it a “breakthrough”. McGorry joined Peter Dutton in Melbourne last week when the Liberal leader announced new funding for a Headspace centre in Melton.</p> 
<p>Asked on Tuesday if he thought the Coalition might take money out of the mental health budget, McGorry said: “No, I don’t think they will.”</p> 
<p>“I think the prime minister already mentioned that this is, generally speaking, a bipartisan achievement of our country,” McGorry said.</p>

<p>“I’m very proud of our country, that we built this system to the extent that we have already … This announcement is very strong from the government. Young people aren’t interested in politics, they just want to get services.”</p>
