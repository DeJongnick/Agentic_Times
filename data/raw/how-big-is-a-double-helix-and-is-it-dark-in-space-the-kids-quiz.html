    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:C - The DNA double helix has a diameter of about 2 nanometers (nm). There are one million nanometers in a millimetre, so that’s really tiny! Each full turn of the helix spans about 3.4 nanometers., 2:C - Colours weren’t invented – they are a result of light interacting with objects. Different wavelengths of light are absorbed and reflected, and our eyes perceive the reflected light as colour. , 3:D - Space is mostly dark because there is no atmosphere to scatter light. The Earth is surrounded by an atmosphere, so that when light hits it it “scatters”, or bounces off, which is how we see the blue sky, or the colours of a sunset. In space, we see light from stars and other luminous objects, but the space between them remains dark., 4:A - Nitrogen is number seven on the periodic table, because it has seven protons in its nucleus – the nucleus is at the centre of each atom., 5:D - Gravity pulls everything towards the centre of the Earth, so no matter where you stand, “down” is always towards the ground beneath your feet.</p>
