<p>A structure arising from the ashes of a hazard reduction burn that went horribly wrong in 2020 has taken out New South Wales’ top architecture honours.</p> <p>The new North Head viewing platforms on Sydney’s heritage-listed headland overlooking Port Jackson were awarded the NSW medallion at the annual NSW Architecture awards in Sydney on Friday.</p>    <p>Designed by Sydney architecture firm CHROFI and design team Bangawarra, the viewing platforms reclaim the lookout – traditionally seen as a colonial symbol of the First Fleet’s arrival in 1788 – for First Nations peoples.</p> <p>The design was praised by judges for its ambitious agenda to reframe the cultural heritage and identity of North Head by honouring First Nations perspectives and values, and its environmental sustainability.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The dual steel and sandstone structures that wrap around two ceremonial circles create “poetic, generous ways to share stories and opportunities for learning, and create a truly meaningful connection with country,” the judges’ statement said.</p> <p>“At its core, this project is about fostering relationships with country that are reciprocal and respectful. It involves engaging with Indigenous knowledge and recognises that country is not merely a backdrop for human activities but a living entity with its own agency and significance.”</p> <p>A large swathe of the headland, on which the North Head quarantine station sits, was destroyed when strong winds caused a hazard reduction burn to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/17/residents-evacuated-at-sydneys-north-head-as-hazard-reduction-burn-jumps-containment-lines">break containment lines in 2020</a>. The viewing platform project, which also won the Robert Woodward award for small project architecture, included significant remediation of the land.</p> <p>The Premier’s prize, awarded for architecture that benefits the people of NSW, was won by a mid-rise apartment building in Sydney’s inner-west designed to provide affordable rental accommodation.</p>    <p>The Nightingale in Marrickville, designed by SJB, blends active street frontage with receding upper floors to give the building its residential feel, and was commended for its generous communal spaces with access to natural light, ventilation, outdoor landscaped areas, and sustainability.</p> <p>“Nightingale Marrickville demonstrates that a well-designed architectural response to increased density can simultaneously reflect the neighbourhood context and create outstanding homes,” the judges said.</p>    <p>“This project showcases affordable alternatives for communal living through a successful collaboration between a not-for-profit client, Nightingale, and the design team.”</p> <p>The building also won the commendation in the Residential Architecture – Multiple Housing category.</p> <p>The renovation of one of Sydney’s busiest train stations collected four awards, including the Lord Mayor’s prize – restricted to projects within the City of Sydney catchment – and the Heritage award.</p>    <p>DesignInc’s transformation of Redfern Station, which included the incorporation of a former broom factory, delivered a highly functional solution to access and safety while providing “a welcoming and positive experience” which set a high bar for other transport infrastructure projects, judges said.</p>    <p>The Blacket prize for regional architecture and the Public Architecture award went to Sibling Architecture for its refurbishment and expansion of the former Bega Valley Regional Art Gallery.</p> <p>The South East Centre for Contemporary Art (SECCA) design was “infused with character and joy” judges said, which will drive cultural tourism in the region.</p> <p>The design wraps the existing 1988 structure in undulating steel mesh and boldly coloured steel-framed windows.</p> <p>“The project has provided a vibrant and playful new facade which engages with the surrounding landscape and civic precinct,” judges said.</p>    <p>“The South East Centre for Contemporary Art is a worthy recipient of the Blacket prize as it demonstrates an innovative and sensitive architectural revival to an existing building and strengthens ties with the local community, providing a new fit-for-purpose art gallery in the regional town of Bega.”</p> <p>The first exhibition held at the refurbished museum was the touring Archibald prize in November 2023.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 29 June 2024.
