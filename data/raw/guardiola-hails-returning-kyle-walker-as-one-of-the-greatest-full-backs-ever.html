<p>Pep Guardiola has said he will not let the manner in which Kyle Walker left Manchester City tarnish the success the two enjoyed at the club and hailed the defender as “one of the greatest full-backs ever” as he prepares to return to the Etihad Stadium with Burnley.</p> <p>Walker won 14 major honours during eight years at City but informed Guardiola at the end of last year that he wanted to leave the club and went on to join Milan on loan in January, spending six months in Italy before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/kyle-walker-shock-5m-transfer-burnley-manchester-city">moving permanently to Burnley</a> in the summer.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/26/premier-league-wants-minimum-six-point-penalty-for-serious-breach-of-planned-spending-rules">Premier League wants minimum six-point penalty for serious breach of planned spending rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The last season was tough for everyone, for him, for all of us,” Guardiola said. “I don’t judge one behaviour over a short period of time. He was unbelievable. One of the greatest full-backs ever. I slept like a baby for the games with Kyle there.</p> <p>“[He is] one of the greatest in terms of consistency and no injuries and playing every single game, an incredible figure in the locker room. In [eight] years, six Premier Leagues, a Champions League, [many] titles, always being there in good moments and bad moments.”</p> <p>Guardiola will be able to call upon Erling Haaland for Saturday’s game after the striker recovered from a back spasm. Mateo Kovacic also has a chance to make the matchday squad for the first time this season after undergoing achilles surgery.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Savinho is poised to sign a new contract until 2031. The Brazilian’s current deal has four years remaining and he was of interest to Tottenham in the summer.</p> <p>“Always for the people up front it is about numbers, goals and assists,” Guardiola said. “Savinho created a lot last season but in the final third, the final moment, he was a little bit too hectic. The moment he learns that, the more he improves, he’ll be a top-class player because he can play on both sides, he’s got the speed and the work ethic. Savinho will make this step, naturally it will come, and he will be a top player for Man City.”</p> <p>City have confirmed that Nico O’Reilly has signed a new contract to 2030, with the option of a year’s extension. The midfielder, often used as a left-back, has been on Chelsea’s radar. </p>
