<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has replaced Covid.gov – a website that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250113233515/https://www.covid.gov/">once provided</a> Americans with access to information about free tests, vaccines, treatment and secondary conditions such as long Covid – with a treatise on the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/lab-leak-true-origins-of-covid-19/">“lab leak”</a> theory.</p> <p>The site includes intense criticism of Dr <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/anthony-fauci">Anthony Fauci</a>, who helmed national Covid policies under Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the World Health Organization (WHO) and state leadership in New York.</p> <p>“This administration prioritizes transparency over all else,” according to a senior administration quoted in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-vax-focused-covid-19-website-obliterated-white-house-replaced-true-origins-virus-guide">Fox News</a>, <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/rfk-jr-orders-hhs-end-notice-public-comment-process-rulemaking">in spite</a> of <a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/regulatory/hhs-budget-slashed-40-billion-first-look-hhs-reorganization-leaked-document">evidence to the contrary</a>. “The American people deserve to know the truth about the Covid pandemic and we will always find ways to reach communities with that message.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/20/trump-nih-cuts">NIH funding cuts are Trump’s latest attack on education, professors say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The origin of the SARS-CoV2 virus has been hotly debated since the pandemic emerged from Wuhan, China, and swept the world in early 2020. At the heart of the debate is whether a lab that studied coronaviruses in Wuhan leaked the virus unintentionally, or if it was part of a natural “spillover” event that took place at a nearby market that sold produce, fish, meat and live exotic animals.</p> <p>The Wuhan Institute of Virology was funded in part by the US government through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a fact that has added to controversy. Joe Biden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/biden-pardons-fauci-milley">pardoned Fauci</a> for fear he would be attacked during the incoming Trump administration.</p> <p>Although definitive answers about the virus’s beginnings are elusive and may never be known, scientists have argued as recently as <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01240-24">August 2024</a> in the Journal of Virology that, while they remain open-minded, the weight of evidence favors a spillover event.</p> <p>Spillover events are thought to have started at least two other pandemics in recent human history, including the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7086556/">Sars-CoV-1</a> outbreak in China in 2003 and the 1918 influenza pandemic, which is believed to have started in the American midwest by human-pig contact. Notably, many scientists are concerned about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/22/bird-flu-virus-trump">H5N1 transmission</a> among birds and dairy cows in the US because of its potential to infect humans.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the “lab leak” theory has received high-profile support from pundits and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/06/03/opinion/covid-lab-leak.html">in the media</a>, particularly in <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/hearing-wrap-up-suppression-of-the-lab-leak-hypothesis-was-not-based-in-science/">right-leaning circles</a>. It has become the subject of Republican-led hearings, rationale for punishing leaders such as Fauci and defunding scientific institutions such as the NIH.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/trump-healthcare-executive-order">Trump signs healthcare order that includes a win for pharma companies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“NIH’s procedures for funding and overseeing potentially dangerous research are deficient, unreliable, and pose a serious threat to both public health and national security,” the Trump administration’s new website argues.</p> <p>“Further, NIH fostered an environment that promoted evading federal record keeping laws,” the website argues.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding">Messenger RNA technology</a>, which powered Covid-19 vaccines and led to their swift development under the first Trump administration, has also come under attack. Many leading critics of the government’s initial approach to Covid-19 now have leadership roles in the new Trump administration – including the health secretary and longtime vaccine skeptic, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, and Dr Jay Bhattacharya, who now leads the NIH.</p>
