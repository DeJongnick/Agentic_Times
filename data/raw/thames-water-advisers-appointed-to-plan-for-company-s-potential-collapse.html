<p>UK ministers have appointed insolvency advisers to make contingency plans for the potential collapse of Thames Water.</p> <p>The company, which supplies 16 million customers, has been racing to pull together a deal to avoid financial collapse.</p> <p>In a development first reported by Sky News, Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has signed off the appointment of FTI Consulting to advise on plans for Thames Water to be placed into a special administration regime (SAR).</p> <p>The appointment indicates that FTI is the frontrunner to act as administrator if the government enacted an SAR, although a court would ultimately approve such a step.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/01/labour-mps-letter-thames-water-executive-bonuses">Labour MPs urge Thames Water to recover £2.5m paid to executives in April</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government has been trying to avoid such an outcome, with the Treasury threatening that a potential £4bn bill from the SAR <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/03/treasury-threatens-defra-with-4bn-bill-if-thames-water-nationalised">could be forced</a> on to Reed’s department. This process would ensure that the taps stayed on for customers but would heap immediate costs on to the government.</p> <p>However, the government’s Water (Special Measures) Act contains a <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2025/5/crossheading/special-administration-orders">provision for SAR</a> costs to be recouped from customer bills further down the line.</p> <p>Thames faced embarrassment earlier this year when its preferred bidder, KKR, pulled out of a deal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/03/thames-water-kkr-pulls-out-rescue-deal">at the last minute</a>. Now, its class A creditors, who hold the bulk of the company’s senior debt, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/thames-water-creditors-offer-up-5bn-as-part-of-emergency-turnaround-plan">are in talks with the regulator, Ofwat</a>, about a deal to inject capital into the company, which has £17.7bn of net debts and regulatory gearing of 84.4%.</p> <p>The company has been trying to get Ofwat to write off more than £1bn in expected fines from failures to invest in infrastructure to stop sewage spills, in order to secure a rescue deal. Chris Weston, chief executive of Thames Water, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/oralevidence/16368/pdf/">told a recent</a> parliament committee that the company could not afford to pay these fines and continue to invest and operate as was expected by the regulator.</p> <p>A company spokesperson said: “Our focus remains on a holistic and fundamental recapitalisation, delivering a market-led solution, which includes targeting investment-grade credit ratings and returning the company to a stable financial foundation.</p> <p>“Constructive discussions with our many stakeholders continue.”</p> <p>Andy Prendergast, national secretary of the GMB union, said: “Thames Water has been sacrificed on the altar of privatisation. It’s sinking without a trace under a deluge of debt, while huge amounts of cash from inflated customer bills have flooded out to directors, shareholders and loan servicing.<br><br>“If you want an advert for why private companies shouldn’t be involved in certain sectors, this is it. Yet another damning indictment of Thatcher’s terrible legacy.<br><br>“The government must now intervene to find a water-tight solution that protects Thames’ millions of customers and gives immediate guarantees for the thousands of loyal workers and their pensions.”</p> <p>Thames Water faced fury recently over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/09/thames-water-paid-out-millions-in-bonuses-using-3bn-emergency-loan-documents-reveal">plans to pay senior staff members millions in bonuses</a> from a controversial £3bn loan granted by the class A creditors. The company has been banned from paying performance-related bonuses to its chief executive and chief financial officer because of its poor performance.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “The government will always act in the national interest on these issues.</p> <p>“The company remains financially stable, but we have stepped up our preparations and stand ready for all eventualities, including applying for a special administration regime if that were to become necessary.”</p> <p>FTI Consulting declined to comment.</p>
