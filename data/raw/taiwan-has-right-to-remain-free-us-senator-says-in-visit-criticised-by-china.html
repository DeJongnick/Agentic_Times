<p>A visit to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/taiwan">Taiwan</a> by two US senators has drawn criticism from China, which claims the island as its own and objects to any contact between officials of the two sides.</p> <p>The chair of the Senate armed services committee, Roger Wicker, and the Nebraska senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taipei on Friday for a series of high-level meetings with senior Taiwanese leaders. They plan to discuss US-Taiwan relations, regional security and trade and investment, according to the American Institute in Taiwan, Washington’s de facto embassy in lieu of formal diplomatic relations with the self-governing island democracy.</p> <p>Upon arrival, Wicker said: “A thriving democracy is never fully assured … and we’re here to talk to our friends and allies in Taiwan about what we’re doing to enhance worldwide peace.”</p> <p>Wicker told Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-te, during a meeting at the presidential office in Taipei, that he and Fischer were visiting to get a better understanding of Taiwan’s needs and concerns.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/16/donald-trump-xi-jinping-china-taiwan">Trump says Xi told him China will not invade Taiwan while he is in office</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We come here from the United States bringing a message from the Congress of commitment, of long-term friendship and a determination that a free country like Taiwan absolutely has the right to remain free and preserve self-determination,” Wicker said.</p> <p>“At a time of global unrest, it is extremely significant for us to be here,” Fischer added, noting that discussions would include “security, opportunities and progress for this part of the world”.</p> <p>The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun protested against the visit by the two Republicans, saying it “undermines China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and sends a gravely wrong signal to the separatist Taiwan independence forces”.</p> <p>The US is Taiwan’s largest supplier of arms. It provides the island with the latest-generation tanks, air defence missiles and upgraded F-16 jet fighters as part of its guarantee of security against Beijing’s threat to invade.</p> <p>China considers the US supply of arms to Taiwan a violation of commitments made to it by previous White House administrations.</p> <p>But US-Taiwan ties have been strained since Donald Trump took office and launched a global trade war while also pressing governments in Europe and elsewhere to spend more on their own defence.</p> <p>The Trump administration reportedly denied permission for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/30/taiwan-president-cancels-latin-america-trip-us-opposed-nyc-stopover">Lai to stop over in New York</a> as part of a planned official trip to Latin America this month after Beijing objected. Lai reportedly then cancelled the trip.</p>
