<p>Good morning. Asic bosses have admitted that cracking down on scam websites can be a vast game of internet whack-a-mole. The regulator took down an average of 20 sites each day in the first year of its operation to target fake cryptocurrency schemes and sham online trading platforms.</p> 
<p>The US secretary of state, Anthony Blinken, has landed in Tel Aviv for 11th-hour talks with Israeli officials amid struggles to get a Gaza ceasefire deal over the line.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, commuters are onboard for today’s cross-harbour opening of the Sydney Metro’s multibillion-dollar extension. And the Australian rider Kaden Groves has sprinted to victory in stage two of the Vuelta a España.</p>
