<p>A robot dog that does the vacuuming, a flatpack coffin and a cross between a cookie and a cake were among the things that UK-based inventors thought up last year.</p> <p>A Guardian analysis of patent applications listed by the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) found 5,955 involving at least one UK-based inventor had been published in 2023.</p> <p>They included a <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2608355">lying-down computer table</a>, invented by Alex May, 31, from London. The device involves a downwards-facing computer monitor that can be viewed from under a desk that can also operate as a sitting or standing desk if needed. May, who has had chronic back issues since his teenage years, came up with the desk after searching for a more comfortable way to use his computer.</p> <p>“I was surprised to find there wasn’t something easy already out there when I first looked for it, but then I guess adding wheels to suitcases didn’t happen for decades,” he said.</p> <p>The invention became even more useful after he developed long Covid in 2022. “I think there are lots of medical conditions where people could benefit from the desk, anything where lying down is more comfortable than sitting or standing,” he said.</p>    <p>“For otherwise able-bodied people, there are ergonomic benefits too. We’re all becoming familiar with the postural issues such as chronic lower back pain and ‘tech neck’ from using computers and phones. It’s been life-changing for me and I hope it will benefit many others too.”</p> <p>May is in the process of patenting an updated model and setting up a small e-commerce business for the product.</p> <p>Other inventions included a jute and bamboo <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2614723">flatpack coffin</a>. Invented by David How from Stourbridge, it is environmentally friendly and easy to assemble. Manufactured in Bangladesh through his fair-trade company Oasis Coffins, it was granted a patent in May.</p> <p>Anna Coombe of Brandon in Suffolk was also granted a patent for a novel baking method and product combining dough and batter. Her Cookie Cake “enables the user to experience different textures in one bite”.</p> <p>The invention was the result of a happy accident while baking with her daughter, when some cupcakes spilled over, resembling cookies on top. “She asked if we could make cakes topped with cookies and biscuits,” Coombe said.</p>    <p>“I wasn’t sure but said I would try. It took months to create the recipes, calculate proportions and experiment with different baking techniques, ingredients and flavours. I am inspired by my autistic daughter who has amazing ideas and creativity.”</p> <p>After a “fantastic” initial reaction, Anna is selling her cakes online and in a local department store. She is looking for trials with other businesses and considering going into mass production.</p> <p>Most of the patents applications were for highly technical or scientific inventions, but other less esoteric examples included an easy-assembly plywood cow to help <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2614107">you</a> practise lassoing like a cowboy, <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2615518">smart goalie gloves</a> that record data on how the keeper is performing, a grand piano with the <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2618585">strings arranged vertically</a> to save space, a <a href="https://reallyclever.co/">leather-like material</a> made from mushrooms, a <a href="https://somvai.com/">nap timer</a> that uses radar to decide on the perfect time to wake you up, <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2617678">cheese made of potatoes</a>, a shoe that <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2609264">fits on both right and left feet</a> and a <a href="https://www.ipo.gov.uk/p-ipsum/Case/PublicationNumber/GB2615857">machine</a> that vibrates your nose to get mucus out.</p> <p>The figures show that 318 companies were responsible for half of the UK-based patent applications in 2023. Jaguar Land Rover led the way with 182, followed by Dyson with 151 – one of which was for a robot dog that does the vacuuming. The four legs allow the robot to travel up and down stairs, previously an impossible feat for robot vacuum cleaners such as a Roomba.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 5 October 2024 to correct a misspelling in a picture caption of Sarah Nicolls’ name.</p>
