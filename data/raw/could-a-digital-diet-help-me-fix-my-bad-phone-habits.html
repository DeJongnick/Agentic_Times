<p>Can you count the number of times you’ve looked at your phone today? Or how often you’ve opened it to do one thing to find yourself doing something else entirely?</p> <p>If you’re anything like me, you’ll have little idea – merely an inkling – that it’s more times than you’d hope. Smartphone algorithms are designed to capture our attention and hold it, but a new book written by an academic who studies them promises to help people take back control.</p> <p>I spent a week putting some of her suggestions to the test.</p> <p>A first step towards breaking any addiction is acknowledging you have one and understanding its nature. In her book,<a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/smartphone-nation-9781035069040/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article"> Smartphone Nation</a>, Dr Kaitlyn Regehr suggests keeping a “phone fed journal” for a few days, noting what you opened your phone to do, where you ended up, how long you spent there, and how the session made you feel.</p> <p>Trying to keep track of the minutes I’m spending on phone-based diversions proves tricky, as I’m often unaware I’m even being diverted. With practice though, I think I’m beginning to notice this more quickly, and it’s apparent that my problematic phone use falls into two general categories.</p> <p>The first, which I’ve named “deliberate procrastination”, happens when I’ve got a mentally taxing task ahead of me, and I don’t want to do it, so I check my apps for updates instead.</p> <p>According to my diary, I am a master task-avoider, particularly when tired. Or perhaps I’m just saddled with too many mentally taxing tasks. But since I appear more prone to procrastinating in the mornings, it strikes me that a quick fix could be moving more challenging tasks to later in the day, when I’m more awake.</p>    <p>The second and more worrying habit I’ve identified, I’ve christened the “oblivion vortex”: where I open my phone to do something, only to come round goodness knows how many minutes later, to find myself watching some random video, with no idea how I got there.</p> <p>Reader: beware the treacherous 30 minutes after waking! Last Tuesday, while intending to prepare school snacks and rally teenagers out of the door, I emerged from the vortex to find the beauty entrepreneur Trinny Woodall telling me about a recent trip to the hairdresser to get her highlights done.</p> <p>According to Regehr, an associate professor of digital humanities<em><strong> </strong></em>at University College London<em><strong>,</strong></em> this is classic algorithm skulduggery.</p> <p>“This technology<strong> </strong>wants to seamlessly move you off one task and on to another application, then hold you there for as long as possible. That’s what advertisers are paying for: your attention. However, what’s great is that this week, you became aware that it is happening.”</p> <p>Mindless scrolling isn’t always harmful, Regehr adds. “Sometimes we need a break,” though she encourages reflecting on how that content makes you feel.</p> <p>I admit that some of my feeds leave me feeling inadequate or that I’m missing out – while they’re littered with ads for intermittent fasting and eye creams, clearly tailored to my age and search habits.</p> <p>Regehr suggests unfollowing individuals or brands that no longer inspire or educate me, and narrowing in on things that do.</p> <p>“You might decide: ‘I do want that soothing scroll, but I’d like to be more active about what I fill that break with.’ You don’t just have to take what algorithms feed you.”</p>    <p>It’s sage advice, but that digital spring clean will have to wait until I’m less busy. For now, I try another of her tips: switching my phone to greyscale by removing colour via the accessibility settings.</p> <p>Dr Alex Taylor, a lecturer in marketing at Newcastle Business School in Australia who studies<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401223001032"> smartphone distraction</a>, supports this: “One of the most obvious reasons smartphones compete for our attention is the level of stimulation they provide. Minimising this by limiting exposure to high fidelity imagery is a good step.”</p> <p>Indeed, without the usual candy-coloured icons winking seductively at me from my screen, I struggle to find apps. The pull is lessened – out of sight really does mean out of mind. Still, when I actually need to use my phone, the palette makes navigation frustrating. It’s a useful, if imperfect, deterrent.</p> <p>Despite efforts to monitor my smartphone use, I also suspect I’m only capturing a fraction of the distractions I experience.</p> <p>Dr Maxi Heitmayer, a human-computer interaction researcher at the London School of Economics, shares this view. In one <a href="https://ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk/id/eprint/21662/1/3447526.3472026.pdf">study</a>, he equipped 41 participants with wearable cameras to observe when they checked their phones without unlocking them. These quick checks, though seemingly minor, are disruptive nonetheless.</p> <p>“We found that whenever there’s this little break in an activity – it could be turning the page of a book, or you’re done cutting the tomatoes and now you need to chop the onions – that’s when the phone comes in,” Heitmayer says.</p> <p>Breaking this pattern isn’t simple. In a more <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computer-science/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2025.1422244/full">recent study</a>, Heitmayer found that moving phones out of reach did reduce use – but often led people to shift their distractions to desktop screens instead.</p> <p>He suggests leaving my phone in a different room, and noting each time I think about checking it. The answer is frequently – to check for messages, Google random thoughts, or open apps out of sheer habit.</p> <p>And our phones are undeniably useful. On the second day of stashing my phone upstairs, I miss a call from my daughter’s school about her lunch account. When I finally receive this message, I immediately open an app and deposit some money – though I get so irritated by the greyscale that I turn it off.</p> <p>Even so, my digital detox has made me more mindful of how I interact with my smartphone. Since starting my diary, I’ve found myself sucked into the oblivion vortex less frequently, and though I’m still guilty of procrastination, I aspire to fill these deliberate breaks with apps and feeds that bring me joy.</p> <p>Still, this mini digital detox has made me more aware of how I use my phone and I’m starting to swap aimless browsing with more intentional use – choosing apps that spark joy rather than just steal time.</p> <p>Regehr and her team have proposed a hierarchical approach to digital engagement, similar to a healthy eating pyramid: nutritious habits at the base, indulgent treats at the top. For her, a scroll through second-hand clothing app Vinted is the digital equivalent of a cupcake.</p> <p>I’m not perfect, but I’m learning to reshape my phone habits – and yes, the occasional Trinny Woodall video is allowed, so long as I’ve chosen to watch it.</p> <h2><strong>Tips for a healthy digital diet</strong></h2> <p>Building a healthier relationship with your smartphone doesn’t necessarily mean going cold turkey or tossing your device into a drawer. Instead, it’s about subtle shifts that return a sense of control. Dr Kaitlyn Regehr suggests the following strategies:</p> <ul> <li><p>Set app limits for your most-used platforms – not just mentally, but through your phone’s settings.</p></li> <li><p>Reclaim your attention by asking: Who do I really want to hear from? Then silence the rest. Turn off unnecessary push notifications, and consider assigning different ringtones to different contacts.</p></li> <li><p>Temptation can also be engineered away by moving social media apps off your main screen – or deleting them entirely, so you can only access them via a browser.</p></li> <li><p>Try greyscaling your phone: Without vibrant colours tugging at your attention, you might find that the allure of Instagram or TikTok fades a little.</p></li> <li><p>Reduce targeted advertising by using different browsers for shopping and chatting, or turn on incognito mode to avoid cookie tracking.</p></li> <li><p>Create real-world boundaries by setting screen-free zones and times, such as a no-phones-at-the-table rule, or a digital curfew before bed.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Smartphone Nation by Kaitlyn Regehr (Pan Macmillan, £22).
