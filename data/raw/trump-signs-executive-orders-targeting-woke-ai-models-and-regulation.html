<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> on Wednesday signed a trio of executive orders that he vowed would turn the United States into an “AI export powerhouse”, including one targeting what the White House described as “woke” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/artificialintelligenceai">artificial intelligence</a> models.</p> <p>During remarks at an AI summit in Washington, Trump decried “woke Marxist lunacy in the AI models”, before signing the orders on stage at the Mellon Auditorium.</p> <p>“Once and for all, we are getting rid of woke. Is that OK?” Trump said, drawing loud applause from the audience of AI industry leaders. He then <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1948144278439706726">asserted</a> that his predecessor, Joe Biden, had “established toxic diversity, equity and inclusion ideology as a guiding principle of American AI development”.</p> <p>“So you immediately knew that was the end of your development,” he said, eliciting laughter.</p> <p>The new order requires any artificial intelligence company receiving federal funding to maintain politically neutral AI models free of “ideological dogmas such as DEI” – putting pressure on an industry increasingly seeking to partner with government agencies. It is part of the Trump administration’s<strong> </strong>broader anti-diversity campaign that has also targeted federal agencies, academic institutions and the military.</p> <p>While the directive emphasizes that the federal government “should be hesitant to regulate the functionality of AI models in the private marketplace”, it asserts that public procurement carries “the obligation not to procure models that sacrifice truthfulness and accuracy to ideological agendas”. The metrics of what make an AI model politically biased are contentious and open to interpretation, however, and therefore may allow the administration to use the order to target companies at its discretion.</p> <p>The other orders were aimed at expediting federal permitting for datacentre infrastructure and promoting the export of American AI models. The executive actions coincide with the Trump administration’s release of a broader, 24-page “AI action plan” that seeks to cement the US’s “global dominance” in artificial intelligence as well as expand the use of AI in the federal government.</p> <p>“Winning this competition will be a test of our capacities unlike anything since the dawn of the space age,” Trump declared, adding: “We need US technology companies to be all-in for America. We want you to put America first.”</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the White House unveiled its long-promised “action plan”, titled “Winning the Race”, that was announced shortly after Trump took office and repealed a Biden administration order on AI that mandated some safeguards and standards on the technology. It outlines the White House’s vision for governing artificial intelligence in the US, vowing to speed up the development of the fast-growing technology by removing “red tape and onerous regulation”.</p> <p>During his remarks, Trump also proposed a more nominal change. “I can’t stand it,” he said, referring to the use of the word “artificial”. “I don’t even like the name, you know? I don’t like anything that’s artificial. So could we straighten that out, please? We should change the name. I actually mean that.”</p> <p>“It’s not artificial. It’s genius,” he added.</p> <p>A second order Trump signed on Wednesday calls for deregulating AI development, increasing the building of datacentres and removing environmental protections that could hamper their construction.</p> <p>Datacentres that house the servers for AI models require immense amounts of water and energy to function, as well as produce greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental groups have warned about harmful increases to air and noise pollution as tech companies build more facilities, while a number of local communities <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/05/data-center-protest-community-resistance/">have pushed back</a> against their construction.</p> <p>In addition to easing permitting laws and emphasizing the need for more energy infrastructure, both measures that tech companies have lobbied for, Trump’s order also frames the AI race as a contest for geopolitical dominance. China has invested billions into the manufacturing of AI chips and datacentres to become a competitor in the industry, while Chinese companies such as Deepseek have released AI models that rival Silicon Valley’s output.</p> <p>While Trump’s plan seeks to address fears of China as an AI superpower, the Trump administration’s move against “woke” AI echoes longstanding conservative grievances against tech companies, which Republicans have accused of possessing liberal biases and suppressing rightwing ideology. As generative AI has become more prominent in recent years, that criticism has shifted from concerns over internet search results or anti-misinformation policies into anger against AI chatbots and image generators.</p> <p>One of the biggest critics of perceived liberal bias in AI is Elon Musk, who has vowed to make his xAI company and its Grok chatbot “anti-woke”. Although Musk and Trump are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/trump-musk-feud-doge-deportation">still locked in a feud</a> after their public falling out last month, Musk may stand to benefit from Trump’s order given his emphasis on controlling AI’s political outputs.</p> <p>Musk has consistently criticized AI models, including his own, for failing to generate what he sees as sufficiently conservative views. He has claimed that xAI has reworked Grok to eliminate liberal bias, and the chatbot has occasionally posted white supremacist and antisemitic content. In May, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/14/elon-musk-grok-white-genocide">Grok affirmed white supremacist conspiracies</a> that a “white genocide” was taking place in South Africa and said it was “instructed by my creators” to do so. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/14/us-military-xai-deal-elon-musk">Grok also posted pro-Nazi ideology and rape fantasies</a> while identifying itself as “MechaHitler” until the company was forced to intervene.</p> <p>Despite Grok’s promotion of Nazism, xAI was among several AI companies that the Department of Defense <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/14/us-military-xai-deal-elon-musk">awarded with up to $200m contracts</a> this month to develop tools for the government. OpenAI, Anthropic and Google, all of which have their own proprietary AI models, were the other recipients.</p> <p>Conservatives have singled out incidents such as Google’s Gemini image generator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/22/google-pauses-ai-generated-images-of-people-after-ethnicity-criticism">inaccurately producing racially diverse depictions</a> of historical figures such as German second world war soldiers as proof of liberal bias. AI experts have meanwhile long warned about problems of racial and gender bias in the creation of artificial intelligence models, which are trained on content such as social media posts, news articles and other forms of media that may contain stereotypes or discriminatory material that gets incorporated into these tools. Researchers have found that these biases <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07856-5">have persisted despite advancements in AI</a>, with models often replicating existing social prejudices in their outputs.</p> <p>Conflict over biases in AI have also led to turmoil in the industry. In 2020, the co-lead of Google’s “ethical AI” team Timnit Gebru <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/04/timnit-gebru-google-ai-fired-diversity-ethics">said she was fired</a> after she expressed concerns of biases being built into the company’s AI models and a broader lack of diversity efforts at the company. Google said she resigned.</p>
