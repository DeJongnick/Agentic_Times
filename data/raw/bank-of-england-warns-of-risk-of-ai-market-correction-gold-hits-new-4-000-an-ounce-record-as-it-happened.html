The regulator added that it is keen to create the best possible scheme “and draw a line under this issue quickly”.</p> <p>It still looks likely to be the biggest mass payout relating to a financial product since the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling debacle, which led to 34 million consumers receiving an average of about £1,000 each.

The economy shrank by 0.3% between April and June, the second quarter of the year. Two or more consecutive quarters of contraction are defined as a technical recession.</p> <p>Compared with August last year, industrial production was down by 3.9%, driven by manufacturing – the car industry in particular, where output slumped by 18.5%.</p> <p><a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2025/10/PE25_364_421.html?nn=2112">According to Germany’s statistical office</a>, the sharp drop in production in the automotive industry can be explained, at least in part, by annual plant closures for summer holidays and production changeovers.</p> <p><strong>Carsten Brzeski</strong>, global head of macro at ING, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Let’s hope this is true. However, even if there might be some one-off factors at play, we fear that the sharp drop in industrial production also heavily reflects the end of US frontloading.</p> <p>This remains the clearest illustration of the structural challenges facing German industry. More than six years since the pandemic began, industrial production in Germany is still some 15% below its pre-pandemic level. Production in energy-intensive sectors is still around 4% below its 2024 level. At the same time, the fact that capacity utilisation in German industry has now remained at the low levels last seen during the financial crisis for more than a year is another painful sign of this structural weakness.</p> <p>Still, with the announced fiscal stimulus after the German elections earlier this year, optimism for at least a cyclical rebound had returned.</p> </blockquote> <p>The second consecutive increase in construction activity also offers a glimmer of hope.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-08T07:26:28.617Z">at 8.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68e60dff8f08279c35e17ed7" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-08T07:12:09.570Z">8.12am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Gold continues to climb, and is now up 1.25% on the day at $4,0333.48 an ounce.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stephen Innes</strong>, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The milestone is staggering in scale and symbolism.

The global debt mountain has breached $330 trillion, and policymakers are doing what they’ve always done when confronted with unpayable numbers — inflating them away. The so-called “fiscal event horizon” has arrived, a gravitational pull of deficits so immense that not even the pretense of restraint can escape.

Last week, gold-backed exchange-traded funds expanded again, taking the total gold ETF holdings to the highest level since September 2022.
