<p>Cryptocurrencies have risen sharply after one of the industry’s biggest critics, Gary Gensler, said he would stand down as the head of the US financial regulator when president-elect Donald Trump was inaugurated in January.</p> <p>In a post on X, Gensler confirmed he would resign from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on 20 January.</p> <p>Trump had previously said he intended to fire Gensler on “day one” of his presidency after the chair of the SEC took legal action against cryptocurrency trading and platforms.</p> <p>“I thank President Biden for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility,” Gensler wrote in the post on X.</p> <p>Gensler was appointed chair of the SEC in 2021 and immediately called on Congress to give him more powers to regulate the “wild west” crypto-sector, saying that it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/03/cryptocurrency-sec-regulation">“rife with fraud, scams and abuse”.</a></p> <p>Bitcoin extended its recent rally on Friday morning, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/nov/22/british-households-energy-bills-rise-fall-january-retail-sales-eurozone-us-economies-business-live-news">hitting $99,500</a> (£79,463) for the first time. Ether has risen more than 7% in the last 24 hours, while the “meme coin” doge rose 2%.</p> <p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/22/bitcoin-nears-100k-with-crypto-market-cap-at-record-34t/">According to the digital currency news site CoinDesk</a>, the total market capitalisation of crypto coins is now a record $3.4tn, having added 4.5% in the past 24 hours.</p> <p>Officially, Gensler’s five-year term at the SEC was meant to run until 2026, however it has become common practice for the chair to leave when the presidency changes.</p> <p>Under Gensler, the SEC pushed through rules seeking to bring more transparency to markets and improve corporate disclosure.</p> <p>However, he had a number of legal defeats in his attempt to tighten regulation.</p> <p>On the day he announced his resignation, a federal court in Texas threw out the SEC’s new rules for the $27tn US Treasury market, finding that the regulator had exceeded its authority.</p> <p>“The SEC has met our mission and enforced the law without fear or favor,” Gensler said in his X post on Thursday.</p> <p>Trump holds more pro-crypto views and the value of cryptocurrencies have been rising since he won the US election<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/nov/22/british-households-energy-bills-rise-fall-january-retail-sales-eurozone-us-economies-business-live-news">.</a></p> <p>Crypto firms have donated at least $119m to congressional candidates they think will pass legislation that is more favourable to their aims.</p> <p>In his time as SEC chair, Gensler’s regulatory efforts also included new standards for climate disclosures and cybersecurity and market changes.</p> <p>However, a US appeals court threw out rules that would have forced private equity and hedge funds to increase transparency.</p> <p>A series of lawsuits also prompted the SEC to halt a measure that for the first time would have required companies to disclose their climate risks.</p> <p>Trump will nominate Gensler’s successor and is expected to appoint someone who will seek to deregulate and potentially discard rules proposed by the outgoing SEC chair but not yet finalised.</p> <p>In remarks made before Gensler’s resignation announcement, Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Citadel, said: “Over the last four years, there were a number of rule changes proposed where, to be blunt, it’s like: ‘What problem are we trying to solve?’”</p> <p>“Much of Gensler’s agenda will not survive, in my opinion, the next four years. Between the courts and a new SEC, we’re going to see a rollback of the regulatory onslaught,” Griffin told the Economic Club of New York on Thursday.</p> <p>The Trump transition team is reportedly considering Teresa Goody Guillén, a securities lawyer, to lead the SEC, according to CoinDesk.</p> <p>She is the co-leader of the blockchain team at the law firm BakerHostetler, and has defended crypto firms and individuals facing investigations and enforcement actions brought by the SEC.</p>
