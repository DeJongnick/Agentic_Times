Kick-off at Accor Stadium in Sydney is 7.30pm AEST.</strong></p> <p>The 2025 NRL season got underway seven months ago in Las Vegas. From the opening kick-off in Allegiant Stadium rugby league fans have been treated to one of the most entertaining and open campaigns in the sport’s history.</p> <p>The long-dormant Bulldogs stirred. Ricky’s upstart Raiders were irrepressible. The Panthers climbed off the canvas like The Undertaker. Mark Nawaqanitawase made a mockery of switching codes. The greatest match in modern history took place in Mudgee, only to be one-upped three weeks later in Canberra. And now there is only the destination of the The Provan-Summons Trophy to go.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/sep/15/broncos-v-raiders-nrl-classic-was-it-the-greatest-game-of-all-time">The greatest game of all?

Or will it be awarded to Brisbane Broncos, the team with the most chutzpah, the highest ceiling, and the largest fanbase?</p> <p>Storm have always looked destined to make the grand final, but have only occasionally hit top gear in a season dominated by injuries. Their presence owes as much to unheralded utilities like Tyran Wishart, Grant Anderson, and Joe Chan, as it does to their more illustrious colleagues wearing numbers 1,6,7 and 9.</p> <p>The Broncos weren’t even in the top eight halfway through the season, and in round 23 looked to have lost both starting halves to year-ending injuries. But Michael Maguire’s influence has grown over the course of his first year in the Brisbane hotseat and his players now reflect his hard nosed never-say-die approach to the game. Maguire has also benefited from the very best forward in the game, Payne Haas, hitting top form, and the back with the most potential in the game, Reece Walsh, demonstrating why he is such a precious talent.</p> <p>Both these teams have recent grand final experience.
