  <p><strong>Tasmanian teachers stop work to school government on stalled deal</strong></p> 
  <p>Frustrated teachers, firefighters, health and other public workers are walking off the job over three days in Tasmania to protest a “contemptuous” government wages offer, AAP reports.</p> 
  <p>Stop-work action forced schools to open several hours late in north-west Tasmania on Tuesday, with further disruptive rallies planned in Launceston on Wednesday and Hobart on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Unions rejected the state government’s offer of a one-off 3% pay rise while longer-term deals are negotiated.</p> 
  <p>Hundreds of workers rallied at Burnie and Devonport in what the Health and Community Services Union secretary, <strong>Robbie Moore</strong>, said was evidence of unprecedented anger.</p> 
  <p>Ramped-up industrial action that could impact government income was also on the cards, he said.</p> 
  <p>The business, industry and resources minister, <strong>Felix Ellis</strong>, said the 3% offer was fair and included additional conditions around leave and entitlements.</p> 
  <p>The government plans to cut 2,500 public sector jobs to help balance the budget, with state debt forecast to reach $13bn by 2027/28.</p>

  <p><strong>High court fight looms over woman’s terror flag charge</strong></p> 
  <p>A woman accused of carrying the Hezbollah flag at a pro-Palestine rally will be the first person to challenge the validity of federal anti-terror laws, AAP reports.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sarah Mouhanna</strong> has pleaded not guilty to causing a public display of a prohibited terrorist organisation symbol after a protest in the Sydney city centre on 29 September 2024.</p> 
  <p>The 20-year-old is the first person to contest national laws introduced in 2023 to stop the display of prohibited terrorist organisation symbols in public places, a court heard.</p> 
  <p>She was prepared to fight the charge in Sydney’s Downing Centre local court on Tuesday, but left with a much bigger fight on her hands after the magistrate refused to preside over the landmark case.</p> 
  <p>Mouhanna’s barrister said the law his client was accused of breaking was unconstitutional because it infringed on the implied freedom of political speech. There was also a dispute over whether the 20-year-old knew she was carrying the flag of a proscribed terrorist organisation, the court heard.</p> 
  <p>The magistrate, <strong>Christine Haskett</strong>, said the constitutional challenge meant she could not deal with the matter, which should instead be elevated to the nation’s highest court.</p> 
  <p>The case was adjourned until 18 November after Mouhanna flagged an intention to escalate the fight to the high court.</p>

  <p>Optus will soon have to front a Senate inquiry to explain how it responded to its triple-zero outage in September, which was linked to the deaths of at least three people.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Jane Hume to push for nuclear energy ban to be lifted</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Liberal backbencher <strong>Jane Hume</strong> will introduce a private member’s bill to lift the nuclear energy ban, renewing her party’s pursuit of the energy source just months after it was rejected at the federal election.</p> 
  <p>The Victorian senator on Tuesday announced plans for a bill to repeal the John Howard-era nuclear moratorium and allow the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Australian Renewable Energy Agency to invest in the technology.</p> 
  <p>Hume – a moderate Liberal who supports net zero – told Guardian Australia:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>If you’re serious about getting emissions down, you’ve got to have all options on the table. If you’re not technology agnostic, well then your real objective is about blanketing the country in renewable energy projects, rather than genuinely lowering emissions and energy prices. The only way to be technology agnostic is to remove the moratorium on nuclear energy.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Hume’s proposal is a substantially watered-down version of the policy the Coalition took to the May election, which involved replacing retired coal-fired power stations with taxpayer-funded nuclear reactors at seven sites nationwide.</p>

  <p>If you missed it, the opposition leader, <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>, has criticised <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> for wearing the T-shirt of celebrated post-punk band Joy Division, five days ago, when on a plane.</p> 
  <p>She pointed out that Joy Division – the acclaimed and influential British band behind Love Will Tear Us Apart – had been named after “a wing of a Nazi concentration camp where Jewish women were forced into sexual slavery”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Ian Curtis</strong>, the frontman of Joy Division between 1976 and 1980 (when he committed suicide aged 23) decided on the name after reading the novella House of Dolls, which referred to the term and was written by an Auschwitz survivor, according to numerous media reports.</p> 
  <p>The band was previously called Warsaw, and became New Order after Curtis’s death.</p>

  <p><strong>Three thousand Victorian students complete English as Additional Language exam</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Jennifer Nguyen</strong> has been in Australia for the past three years – she moved to learn English and was one of the 3,000 international students doing the English as Additional Language test.</p> 
  <p>For the second part of the exam, students were asked to write a story based on three prompts – country, protest, personal journey or play. And for the third part, they were asked to analyse an argument.</p> 
  <p>In the second part, Jennifer wrote about moving to Australia, away from her family, and the things she has learned:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I blended in my own personal journey. I talked about how I came to Australia, and it changed my life. It was easy because it was my real experience, which I just changed to connect to the title and the stimulus.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Jennifer’s parents are home in Vietnam, and she says they called her five times this morning to check if she was awake and ready.</p> 
  <p>She says she misses them, but has grown a lot by being away from home at such a young age:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When I first came here, it was very challenging. Because I had to speak complete English, I was staying with a homestay, and the food was different. It was just so overwhelming. Sometimes I wanted to go home, but I did not give up.</p>

  <p><strong>Year 12 Footscray High students jubilant after English exam</strong></p> 
  <p>In Victoria, 47,000 VCE students completed the marathon three-hour English exam earlier today, and the mood was jubilant at Footscray high school’s basketball hall turned exam room.</p> 
  <p>Come Tuesday afternoon, Year 12s were picking up toasties, standing around with their friends and dissecting the prompts in the paper.</p> 
  <p><strong>Noah Regassa</strong>, who is hoping to get good enough grades to get into criminal law, says there were no nasty surprises.</p> 
  <p>The first part of the exam asked students to write an analytic response to a text like Jane Eyre by <strong>Charlotte Brontë</strong>, My Brilliant Career by <strong>Miles Franklin</strong> or Sunset Boulevard directed by <strong>Billy Wilder</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Noah spent last night before rewatching Sunset Boulevard and going through his notes.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I just hoped when I sat down, and I saw the text, it would just refresh everything in my mind, and everything would be OK. Honestly, it was easier than I expected. They could have made it so much harder for us. They could have bullied us with these prompts.</p>

  <p><strong>Herbie Grarock</strong> didn’t really have to worry about the exam – he has already got into Australian National University in Canberra, where he will do arts, with the hope of becoming a Greens politician.</p> 
  <p>But that doesn’t mean he didn’t take it seriously. He was up until almost midnight “scrolling through my quotes over and over again to try to memorise them”.</p>

  <p><strong>Human rights groups accuse Labor of ‘ICE-like’ behaviour over deportation of NZYQ member to Nauru</strong></p>

  <p>While Nauru’s president, <strong>David Adeang</strong>, told the parliament last Friday that the first person had arrived under the new offshore detention deal, the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) said it had been unable to make contact with the individual and held concerns for their wellbeing.</p>

  <p><strong>Opposition accuses federal government of ‘secrecy’ over deportation of first NZYQ member</strong></p> 
  <p>The shadow home affairs minister, <strong>Jonathon Duniam</strong>, has criticised the federal government’s quiet deportation of the first NZYQ member to Nauru, urging Labor to be more open about the operations.</p> 
  <p><strong>Tony Burke</strong> earlier today confirmed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/28/nauru-australia-deal-payment-as-first-man-arrives-nzyq">the first person to be deported to Nauru</a> as part of a $2.5bn deal over three decades had touched down in Nauru last Friday.</p> 
  <p>No further information is known about the man’s circumstances or details.</p> 
  <p>Duniam, who took over the opposition portfolio from <strong>Andrew Hastie</strong> after his public disagreement over immigration policy, said the Albanese government had “not been open with Australians who deserve to know that they are safe”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The government’s secrecy over this deportation also begs the question of what else it is hiding … the Coalition is urging the minister to deport all remaining NZYQ members as soon as possible. And it must not further bury any information that Australians deserve to know.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The 350 or so people within the NZYQ cohort were released following a high court ruling in November 2023 that found indefinite detention unconstitutional. Since 2014, Australia has automatically cancelled the visas of anyone who served 12 months or more in jail. This means while some in the cohort may have been convicted of serious or violent crimes, others may have served 12 months for a single offence, or series of minor offences.</p> 
  <p>With no valid visa for remaining in Australia, the cohort had been detained indefinitely because they could not be deported elsewhere due to being stateless or owed protection as a refugee.</p>

  <p><strong>Aboriginal woman dies in custody in Tasmania</strong></p> 
  <p>An Aboriginal woman has died in custody in Tasmania after suffering a serious medical episode while on remand, in what the state’s Aboriginal legal service believes is the first Indigenous death in incarceration since the 1990s.</p> 
  <p>The CEO of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service (TALS), <strong>Jake Smith</strong>, said they stood ready to support the family and community during the difficult time.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The loss of life will profoundly impact her family, the community and others across the state.</p>

  <p>The woman was transferred to hospital in the early hours of Saturday from Mary Hutchinson Women’s Prison in Hobart, prison authorities say.</p> 
  <p>A Tasmania Prison Service spokeswoman said she experienced a “serious medical episode” and sadly passed away in hospital on Monday.</p> 
  <p>Her death has been referred to the coroner for investigation, as per process with any death in custody, the state prison director said.</p> 
  <p>Earlier this month, the state coroner of NSW revealed more First Nations people had died in custody in the state <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/15/indigenous-deaths-in-custody-nsw-2025-australia-record-high-coroner">than ever before</a>, pointing to soaring Aboriginal incarceration rates as a key driver behind the “profoundly distressing milestone”.</p> 
  <p>Twelve Indigenous people have died in NSW corrective services custody since January, while four have died in police operations – the highest number recorded in any full year.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Still on wild weather in Queensland, the premier, <strong>David Crisafulli</strong>, has taken aim at the Bureau of Meteorology’s new website for failing to allow Brisbane and surrounding residents to prepare for last weekend’s storms.</p> 
  <p>Speaking in state parliament this morning, he called the $4m update “flawed” and said “preparation was key” to mitigate damage from natural disasters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The changes to the federally run Bureau of Meteorology website are not good enough. The changes to the website don’t make sense. The website is flawed. Easy access to individual radars have been removed.</p> 
   <p>The colour scheme we became accustomed to has changed, and platitudes from Canberra won’t cut it with Queenslanders.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The first redesign in 12 years, according to the bureau’s senior meteorologist, <strong>Andrea Peace</strong>, has raised the ire of some users, who quickly took to social media to tell the bureau just what they thought of the change.</p> 
  <p>Rain radars, weather maps, MetEye, industry pages, specialised forecasts and historical data can be found via tabs and buttons on the main page, some of which link back to the former site while pages are still being migrated across.</p> 
  <p>It has been criticised by some users for being confusing, clunky and “really, really bad”.</p> 
  <p>The state’s treasurer, <strong>David Janetzki</strong>, confirmed he had written to the federal environment minister, Murray Watt, to raise “significant concerns” with the website’s overhaul.</p>

  <p>In a statement on Tuesday, the ICA confirmed it had put in place its preliminary catastrophe processes, assisting insurers to assess the insurance impact of the hail, heavy rain and strong winds.</p> 
  <p>Under the declaration, claims reporting processes begin and the ICA liaises with the government and agencies on the need for assistance.</p> 
  <p>It comes ahead of forecast storm activity to continue along the east coast.</p> 
  <p>The ICA said Sunday’s event may be escalated to an “insurance catastrophe” if more complex claims were lodged and if the geographical spread extended.</p> 
  <p>The ICA’s CEO, <strong>Andrew Hall</strong>, said insurers would be “moving quickly” to ensure communities received assistance.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>While it’s too early to determine the complete insurance impact on homes and businesses, claims lodged to date include damage to motor vehicles, food spoilage due to power outages, smashed windows, and fallen trees.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Victorian Liberal leader reveals why he’s changed his position on voluntary assisted dying</strong></p> 
  <p>The Victorian opposition leader, <strong>Brad Battin</strong>, has told reporters he will support a bill that amends the state’s voluntary assisted dying scheme, after opposing the introduction of the laws in 2017.</p> 
  <p>With debate on the bill beginning in the lower house on Tuesday afternoon, Battin says he’s changed his position after watching a close friend’s battle with cancer. He told reporters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When it went through last time, I had some concerns that were raised, particularly within the community. Since that time, I’ve spoken to people who have gone through the process with voluntary assisted dying, and seeing the impact on their families … the relief that they had. To watch someone go through the pain of cancer, a close friend, and then see this go to the stage where they had the choice, it totally changed my mind. Totally changed my mind.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The bill follows an independent review of Victoria’s assisted dying laws, released in February. The review found Victoria, which was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/23/crossing-the-threshold-victoria-makes-history-with-assisted-dying-law">first state in Australia to pass VAD laws</a> in 2017, had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/12/too-complex-too-late-the-guardrails-acting-as-roadblocks-to-voluntary-assisted-dying-across-australia">become a “more conservative model”</a> when compared with the other states that followed.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ley launches extraordinary attack on PM over Joy Division T-shirt</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Sussan Ley</strong>, who said the very spelling of her own name was due to her “punk phase”, has criticised <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> for wearing the T-shirt of celebrated post-punk band <strong>Joy Division</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Referencing a T-shirt Albanese wore five days ago when departing his plane on arrival in Sydney, Ley claimed it was a “profound failure of judgment” which “fails the basic tests of leadership”. She pointed out that Joy Division – the acclaimed and influential British band behind Love Will Tear Us Apart – had been named after “a wing of a Nazi concentration camp where Jewish women were forced into sexual slavery”.</p> 
  <p>“At a time when Jewish Australians are facing a rise in antisemitism, when families are asking for reassurance and unity, the prime minister chose to parade an image derived from hatred and suffering,” Ley told parliament on Tuesday afternoon. Her office later distributed a transcript of the remarks to journalists.</p> 
  <p>Ley’s statement pointed out that Albanese discussed the band in a podcast in 2022, and said he wasn’t aware at the time of the origin of the name. The Sky News host <strong>Sharri Markson</strong> ran a segment on her TV show about Albanese’s T-shirt on Monday night, with Ley’s comments making similar points about the band and Albanese’s knowledge of the name’s origin.</p> 
  <p>The origin of Joy Division’s name is well known. The band dissolved after the death of its frontman, <strong>Ian Curtis</strong>, and its remaining members formed New Order.</p> 
  <p>Ley went on to claim Albanese “should apologise immediately and explain why he thought this was acceptable”.</p> 
  <p>Her comments come days after she briefly called for <strong>Kevin Rudd</strong> to be sacked as US ambassador – an overreach that several of her colleagues did not endorse, and which Ley later walked back after Liberal senator <strong>Jane Hume</strong> called it “churlish”.</p> 
  <p>Ley in June said she added an extra s to her name “during my rebel teenage years … I went through a punk phase”, and has referred often to her “punk rock past”.</p>

  <p><strong>Bowen hits back at Coalition’s handling of manufacturing closures</strong></p>

  <p>Spoiler alert, there’s no apology, but Bowen promises to work every day “in the best interests of working Australians”.</p>

  <p><strong>Government ‘fighting every day to keep Tomago open’, Conroy says</strong></p> 
  <p>The Nationals MP <strong>Alison Penfold</strong> asks the minister representing the industry minister about the impact of the potential closure of the Tomago smelter on industry, including a company that makes aluminium cans in her electorate. Her question is whether the minister will “admit that Labor’s energy policy is killing local jobs”.</p> 
  <p>There’s a bit of back and forth over whether it’s appropriate for <strong>Pat Conroy</strong> to answer when the question of energy policy should go to the energy minister. After some interjections and a plea of “help me help you” from Speaker <strong>Milton Dick</strong>, Conroy stands up.</p> 
  <p>Conroy says, “we’re fighting every day to keep Tomago open,” and argues that wholesale energy prices have come down since the Coalition was in government.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have a range of policies to strengthen and grow the aluminium supply chain. From fixing mining approvals while protecting the environment, securing affordable gas for alumina refineries through the gas market review, and backing our smelters with the green aluminium production credit. We’re going to keep working on this, and we’ve got to keep working with Rio and the state government to explore every option.</p>

And I had already quoted because it says – it says – that the submissions they’ve had from coal-fired power were uncompetitive. And that is true.

  </blockquote> 
  <p>Another little note here, it’s always a little bemusing when the opposition’s questions and the government’s dixers fall on the same issue.</p> 
  <p>While <strong>Sussan Ley</strong> was testing <strong>Chris Bowen</strong> on the future of smelters and industry in Australia, the minister representing the industry minister, <strong>Pat Conroy</strong>, gets a question to spruik the government’s response to Rio Tinto’s statement today.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>How can Labor promise a future made in Australia, <strong>Sussan Ley</strong> asks, when facilities like the Tomago aluminium smelter in NSW are considering shutting down as they struggle with high energy prices.</p> 
  <p><strong>Chris Bowen</strong> acknowledges Rio Tinto refers to energy prices in its statement announcing that it will consult with its workers about Tomago’s future.</p> 
  <p>But he argues for more renewables in the grid. (As he answers, there’s plenty of heckling from the opposition benches – which garners a warning from the Speaker.)</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They [Rio Tinto] go on to say that it is difficult to find enough renewable energy for the project. What they’re saying is what we say – that we need more of the cheapest and most reliable energy for our grid.</p> 
   <p>What we won’t do … is stand at this dispatch box and celebrate the death of manufacturing jobs in this country. I’m old enough to remember that happening. I’m old enough to be sitting there when a treasurer of Australia goaded manufacturing to leave this country. I remember what that was like, and it won’t happen on our watch.</p>

  <p>Some of Australia’s most recognisable faces have descended on parliament today, calling for the government to fulfil its promise of implementing Australian content quotas for streaming giants.</p> 
  <p>Actors including <strong>Bryan Brown</strong>, <strong>Marta Dusseldorp</strong> and <strong>Nina Oyama</strong> fronted up to the media today, warning that Australian voices could be “taken away” if action isn’t taken.</p> 
  <p>They appeared alongside independent MPs including <strong>Zali Steggall</strong> and <strong>Nicolette Boele</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The arts minister, <strong>Tony Burke</strong>, has been a longtime advocate for local content quotas, but progress stalled last year and doesn’t seem to be moving anywhere. One of the sticking points is understood to be the free trade agreement between the US and Australia.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Watt says he was right to reject climate trigger in environment laws</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The environment minister, <strong>Murray Watt</strong>, says he is seeking “tangible gains for the environment and for business” from the EPBC reforms, but has told Labor MPs that he was right to reject putting a “climate trigger” in the legislation.</p> 
  <p>A package of laws – updating the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and to set up an Environmental Protection Agency – were passed through Labor’s party room on Tuesday, clearing the way for the long-anticipated reforms to be tabled in parliament this week.</p> 
  <p>Watt told the party room that he wasn’t that keen to entertain amendments to his legislation when it hits parliament, but noted that business lobbyists were lobbying the Coalition and environmental groups were lobbying the Greens to pass the bill.</p> 
  <p>Watt noted the Business Council’s opposition to the Coalition’s call to split the main bill into smaller components.</p> 
  <p>According to a party spokesperson, a Labor MP in their meeting asked Watt what politicians should be telling their constituents about the climate-related issues pertaining to the bill.</p> 
  <p>Watt pointed out that <strong>Graeme Samuel</strong>’s report had ruled out setting up a “climate trigger” to block projects that would increase emissions. Another MP said it was important to explain this issue to constituents out in public.</p> 
  <p>Watt went on to say again that he believed the changes would lead to faster approval times for new projects, faster assessments and less duplication of effort with state governments.</p> 
  <p>He went on to say power to approve developments, which now sits with his department, would be delegated to the EPA – but that powers for the minister to step in and make decisions would remain.</p>

  <p>Marles addressed Labor’s partyroom meeting this morning, with Anthony Albanese overseas at the Asean summit. He branded Albanese’s White House meeting with Donald Trump as a success, in particular hailing the work of US ambassador Kevin Rudd, and singling out the critical minerals deal.</p> 
  <p>A partyroom spokesperson said Marles had also praised the Labor caucus for having “remained calm when catastrophe was being predicted” by critics, contrasting what he called “discipline” on his side to what he described as a “clown show” in the Coalition. Marles said the partyroom had remained “calm amidst the noise” around the Trump meeting, and said Albanese was advancing Australia’s domestic interests on his world travels.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Queensland’s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender patients has been overturned by the state’s supreme court.</p> 
  <p>Judge <strong>Peter Callaghan</strong> ruled in favour of a challenge by the parent of a transgender child. As a result the directive is unlawful.</p> 
  <p>On 28 January Queensland Health’s director general <strong>David Rosengren</strong> ordered that the directive be published after consulting with health service executives for just 22 minutes. </p> 
  <p>As exclusively reported by the Guardian, the legally mandated consultation had taken place at the same time as a press conference in which the health minister announced the decision.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Australia’s top credit rating has been affirmed by Fitch, as the global ratings agency pointed to the country’s “resilient growth outlook” but warned that a sustained lift in government debt over coming years could threaten the coveted AAA score.</p> 
  <p>Australia is only one of nine countries to be rated AAA by all three major credit rating agencies, which gives the government access to cheaper finance from overseas lenders.</p> 
  <p>Fitch’s latest national report card said a pick up in consumption would drive an economic recovery through 2026 and 2027, underpinned by improving real incomes and a solid jobs market.</p> 
  <p>Australia had “strong” potential growth of 2.2%, Fitch said, which was higher than most of our peers and other top-rated countries.</p> 
  <p>Productivity growth has been “subdued” but should improve, with the ratings agency noting that reforms are likely to be “incremental”.</p> 
  <p>Australia is “relatively insulated from US tariff risks”, but exposed to weakness in China. Fitch also said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Australia should benefit from a larger role in global critical-mineral supply chains ... but we do not foresee a repeat of the mining investment boom in the early 2010s.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> said the report was a “powerful endorsement of Labor’s responsible economic management”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are realistic about the challenges facing our economy including growing global uncertainty, but our AAA rating is further proof Australia is coming at these challenges from a position of genuine economic strength.</p>

  <p>White is understood to have sold shares in the company he founded during a period where company directors were not permitted to trade, though he himself was not on the board or executive at the time, having <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/24/richard-white-wisetech-global-founder-steps-down-affair-allegations-ntwnfb">stepped down from the company in October 2024</a> after weeks of damaging revelations about his personal life.

  <p>Asic said the warrants related to an ongoing investigation but no charges had been laid. A spokesperson declined to comment on the scope of the investigation or whether the employees remained at Wisetech.</p> 
  <p>WiseTech said it would fully cooperate with any investigation and was not facing any allegations itself. Shares in the company have plummeted 16% in early trading this morning.</p>

   <p>I come from a coal mining town … and these things are horrific. They have an incredible impact not only on the family but also on the entire community …</p> 
   <p>We had a patient airlifted to Orange Hospital and I can provide an update that they are in a stable condition at this stage and we will ensure at appropriate times that the community is kept informed but this is a very sad day for the people of western New South Wales and a sad day for the people of our country.</p> 
   <p>Mining remains a dangerous activity and something that despite all regulation and safety improvements that we have made it is still a risky and dangerous occupation and our heart goes out to everyone impacted.</p>

  <p>Ayres says he has been working with the New South Wales government, and has come to the table with an offer to Rio Tinto but the parties “didn’t reach an agreed outcome”. (He wouldn’t give us any details of what was in that offer, and what Rio Tinto were asking for.)</p>

  <p>The parent of a transgender child challenged the process behind the decision on three grounds: that the consultation was insufficient, that Rosengren had been unduly influenced by political interference, or that he had taken into account irrelevant factors.</p>

  <p><strong>Malmsbury youth justice facility to reopen a year after it closed</strong></p> 
  <p>The Malmsbury youth justice facility will reopen just a year after the Victorian government closed its doors, due to an increase in the number of young people on remand.</p> 
  <p>The Victorian corrections minister, <strong>Enver Erdogan</strong>, told reporters outside parliament this morning that the facility will reopen in a staged approach from early next year under a new model.</p> 
  <p>He says the initial 30 beds will be for a lower-risk cohort aged 17 years and older – freeing up more custodial beds at Cherry Creek and Parkville youth justice centres for serious high-risk offenders.</p> 
  <p>The new model at Malmsbury will deliver more education, vocational training and job opportunities for this lower-risk cohort, Erdogan says.</p> 
  <p>The cost of reopening the facility – which only closed at the end of 2024 – will be $140m over five years. An additional $4.8m will be spent on upgrading security at the centre.</p> 
  <p>Erdogan told reporters it wasn’t a mistake to close it:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There was no need for a third premises at the time for youth justice but of course times have changed, we’ve seen a 46% increase in the remand population. We are doing what we said we’d do, and that’s taking repeat dangerous offenders off our streets.</p>

  <p>As <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> continues meeting with south-east Asian leaders at the Asean summit today, one senior minister says free trade is the key to maintaining peace in the region.</p> 
  <p>Yesterday, Albanese said the region is growing quickly and will become the fourth largest economy by the end of the decade – making it ripe for stronger relations and investment from Australia.</p> 
  <p>Jumping back to <strong>Don Farrell</strong>’s appearance on ABC News Breakfast, the trade minister said Australian businesses should invest more in the region and export more products such as food and wine.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve got lots of advantages. Obviously, proximity is one of them, a very reliable route for supply chains, and also large numbers of south-east Asian migrants who’ve come to Australia: Filipinos, Indonesians, Vietnamese, Thais.</p> 
   <p>We don’t want conflict in our region, and one way to avoid conflict is to increase the prosperity of our region. How do we do that? Well, free and fair trade does that precisely … The more we can engage economically with the region, then the more peaceful our region is going to be, and that’s the way the Albanese government would like to see it.</p>

  <p>The Tomago aluminium smelter, which has been struggling with high power prices, has started a consultation process with employees on the potential future of its operations, but is yet to reach a decision.</p> 
  <p>The smelter’s existing electricity supply contract with AGL Energy expires in December 2028, with Tomago yet to identify a pathway that supports commercially sustainable operations beyond the period “despite extensive engagement and market approaches”, according to the miner’s statement.</p> 
  <p>Tomago Aluminium CEO, <strong>Jérôme Dozol</strong>, said:</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Victorian premier, <strong>Jacinta Allan</strong>, is holding a press conference to announces what she says is the “biggest overhaul” of the state’s planning laws in decades.</p> 
  <p>Under changes to the Planning and Environment Act 1987, three new planning streams will be created to slash permit approval times to as little as 10 days for standalone houses and duplexes, 30 days for townhouses and low-rise developments and 60 days for larger developments.</p> 
  <p>Third party appeal rights – which allow anyone to object to a planning permit – will be scraped for homes, duplexes, townhouses and low rise apartment streams.</p> 
  <p>For higher density apartments, only those who are directly impacted – such as neighbours in the area – will be able to appeal.</p> 
  <p>Allan says a planning permit currently takes 140 days to get approved – and if there is an objection, it blows out to more than 300 days.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Victoria’s planning laws were written decades and decades ago. It was a very different time, a very different time. We need to not only bring our planning laws into the 21st century, we also need to overhaul them, to take them from being old fashioned nimby-type laws into a planning system that says yes and gets homes and projects built more quickly.</p>

  <p><strong>MPs run riot in press v politicians touch football match</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> and <strong>Matt Canavan</strong> got one back on the journalists this morning, claiming victory in the annual press v pollies touch football match.</p> 
  <p>Liberal MP <strong>Simon Kennedy</strong> bamboozled the press gallery defence, notching up the match highlight in scoring a try after a twinkletoes performance reminiscent of Brisbane star <strong>Reece Walsh</strong>. Nationals MPs Joyce and Canavan combined regularly through the middle, with strong defence and reliable carries for yardage, as a few fleet-footed staffers finished off the movements to score in the corners.</p> 
  <p>Even without Wallabies legend <strong>David Pocock</strong> taking the field, the politicians ran riot as the game went on. Not even the addition of minister <strong>Pat Conroy</strong> – referred to by some as the minister for rugby league – to the journos’ team could turn the tide.</p> 
  <p>Despite the press taking an early lead, with Sky News reporter <strong>Cam Reddin</strong> sidestepping through the defence with the ease of a seasoned politician dodging questions, the MPs piled on a number of unanswered tries to take a clear victory.</p> 
  <p>It wasn’t all smooth sailing for the pollies though. As Joyce took a carry but fumbled the ball, Canavan yelled in mock outrage “that’s why we’re getting rid of him”.</p> 
  <p>The final score? Unimportant. The numerical gap didn’t tell the whole story, the game on the paddock being much closer than it looked on the scoreboard. The real winner on the day, as it always is, was football itself.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The chance of a Melbourne Cup rate cut has been slashed to just 10%, according to financial markets.</p> 
  <p>Investors had been pricing in more like a 60% chance yesterday - but that was before <strong>Michele Bullock</strong>, the Reserve Bank’s governor, made it clear that she was more worried about a recent pick-up in inflation than last month’s jump in unemployment.</p> 
  <p>“There are still jobs being created, just not as many,” Bullock said on Monday night, adding that a jobless rate of 4.5% was “still pretty low”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’d always thought [unemployment] would drift up a bit. Maybe it’s drifted up a bit further than we thought, but it’s not a huge amount yet.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Tomorrow’s inflation report is expected to show price pressures were stronger than the RBA expected in the three months to September.</p> 
  <p>Economists still think there’s another rate cut or two in the works over coming months, although not likely until next year.</p> 
  <p>And financial market pricing still puts the chance of a rate cut by December at 80%.</p>

  <p>The minister for climate change and energy released the document after an order of production of documents request by Liberal senator <strong>Dean Smith</strong>.</p>

  <p>The brief states:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Emission reductions need to accelerate rapidly to meet the 2030 target. Full and timely implementation of your first-term reforms will be essential. You can chart the forward path by setting a credible and ambitious 2035 target, building on the Future Made in Australia investments and through ongoing focus on leveraging Australia’s comparative advantages— renewable energy, critical minerals, and access to global capital as a global investment location.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The peak medical body says regulatory loopholes must be closed to put an end to private health insurance product “phoenixing”.</p> 
  <p>The government is currently considering outlawing the deceptive practice where insurers close an existing product offering before opening an almost identical one at a higher price outside the regulated premium round process.</p> 
  <p>In a submission on the proposed amendments to legislation to do so, the Australia Medical Association has supported changes that would force insurers to use only the annual premium round to seek approval for the pricing of new products, unless in exceptional circumstances.</p> 
  <p>AMA president <strong>Dr Danielle McMullen </strong>said private health insurers have enjoyed extraordinary profits for many years with few consequences for poor behaviour:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Private health insurance premiums have outpaced wages and inflation in recent years, all while insurers’ management expenses and profits continue to soar.</p> 
   <p>The widespread practice of phoenixing is a major factor in consumers struggling to access the level of cover that meets their needs, and it is eroding public confidence in the private health system.</p> 
   <p>Private hospitals play a vital role, especially as more Australians seek care outside the overwhelmed public sector. But unacceptable conduct from insurers threatens the integrity of our entire healthcare landscape.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Telcos to face $30m fines for failing to connect customers to triple zero</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The fines for telcos that fail to connect customers to the triple zero connect will triple to $30m after Labor agreed to calls from the Greens and Coalition for higher penalties.</p> 
  <p>The larger fines were agreed on Monday during debate on the government’s legislation to establish a “custodian” to oversee the emergency network.</p> 
  <p>The Labor senator <strong>Nita Green</strong>, who was steering the laws through the upper house on behalf of communications minister <strong>Anika Wells</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are not on the side of corporate criminals on this side of the chamber and we will certainly make sure that these penalties signify what the community standard and expectation is, but also from the government.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Greens communications spokesperson<strong> Sarah Hanson-Young</strong>, who pushed to raise the penalty to $30m, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This should send a message to all the telcos that they are on notice. Failure to ensure that this most basic emergency service is available will result in bigger penalties.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">McKenzie says Joyce situation ‘not unusual’ for Nationals amid net zero wrangling</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Nationals senator<strong> Bridget McKenzie</strong> has said <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/27/barnaby-joyce-walkout-net-zero-rehashing-nationals-coalition">Barnaby Joyce</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/27/barnaby-joyce-walkout-net-zero-rehashing-nationals-coalition">’s walkout</a> was “not an unusual situation” for the Nationals, as she has sought to downplay the influence of the Queensland MP on her party’s position on net zero.</p> 
  <p>Asked on the ABC’s 7.30 on Monday night if Joyce’s walkout risked destabilising the Nationals, McKenzie said he had not resigned from the party.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>He is taking a break from the party room, like our current deputy leader Kevin Hogan did, like Darren Chester did … this is not unusual for this to be the case. And the facts remain that Barnaby, as deputy prime minister, minister and Senate leader, has made a significant contribution … I’m absolutely confident he’ll be considering all of that over coming months.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>McKenzie rejected the suggestion that a potential decision by the Nationals to oppose net zero emissions would be “bowing to” Joyce’s demands on the issue.</p> 
  <p>Asked if net zero threatened to rupture the Coalition, McKenzie said it was “not our job to ensure that the Liberal party can win seats in capital cities”, but she hoped it would not.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Well, obviously I hope not … But at the end of the day, we’ve got a job to do here in Canberra, we’re going to continue to do that. People expect us to do that. And we haven’t made a decision yet. But we’re not going to take a backwards step in standing up for our people and our community.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Joyce says he will make a decision on his future in the new year</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Barnaby Joyce has <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/nationals-hit-out-at-joyce-as-rebel-mp-digs-in-and-refuses-to-reveal-future-20251027-p5n5l6.html">told the Nine newspapers</a> that he will consider his political future over the summer before making a decision next year about whether or not to throw in his lot with One Nation.</p> 
  <p>Joyce had admitted that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/20/barnaby-joyce-one-nation-possible-defection-pauline-hanson">he has talked to Pauline Hanson </a>about joining One Nation but that nothing was “locked in”, sparking frenzied speculation about his intentions.</p> 
  <p>But in <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/nationals-hit-out-at-joyce-as-rebel-mp-digs-in-and-refuses-to-reveal-future-20251027-p5n5l6.html">comments reported last night</a>, he said if he had “wanted to be completely disruptive, of course, I suppose I would have resigned and wandered off”. </p> 
  <p>“I have said my piece, and now I want to take time, as hard as it is for me to turn down the volume, between now and the end of the year,” he said.</p> 
  <p>“I’ll consider my options and I haven’t made up mind.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m <strong>Martin Farrer</strong> with the best overnight stories before <strong>Krishani Dhanji</strong> takes you through the day’s events in Canberra and beyond.</p> 
  <p>It’s going to be a busy week for Coalition watchers as MPs prepare for their crunch meeting about net zero on Friday. One casualty of the issue is <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong>, who is reported today to have said he will decide his future over the summer, while another climate naysayer, <strong>Andrew Hastie</strong>, has warned Liberals they can “no longer live” in the Howard era. More coming up.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile telcos that fail to connect customers to triple zero face bigger fines after Labor accepted a push by the Greens and Coalition for higher penalties. Telcos will also be required to maintain a public register of network outages that is updated in real time, after the Optus triple-zero outage in September. More shortly.</p>
