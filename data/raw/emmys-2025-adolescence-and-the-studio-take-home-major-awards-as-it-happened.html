<h1>Emmys 2025: Adolescence and The Studio take home major awards - as it happened</h1>

Besides a chuckle-worthy opening skit poking fun at the quirks of the television business, host Nate Bargatze mostly stuck to chiding winners for talking too long, threatening to deduct money for the Boys &amp; Girls Club with a ticker and actual children on stage. The bit didn’t really work, but it ultimately didn’t matter – Bargatze, as expected, donated his own money to bring the tally to $350,000 at the end of the show.</p> <p>The ticker did keep the speeches mostly under 45 seconds, and thus mostly underwhelming. But there were still emotional highlights – Cristin Milioti’s exuberant win for lead actress in a limited series, 15-year-old Owen Cooper becoming the youngest supporting actor winner ever, Stephen Colbert’s jubilance in the Late Show’s Emmy swan song and the shock win for Jeff Hiller, from the little-show-that-could Somebody Somewhere.</p> <p>Most heartwarming of all was the triumph of Noah Wyle and The Pitt over much more expensive, much more prestige-y shows than the HBO max medical drama. Less surprising was the dominance of The Studio, now the most awarded comedy for a single season (when counting the Creative Arts Emmys), and the sweep by Netflix hit Adolescence. Creator Stephen Graham provided one of the night’s most moving speeches, calling for equality and respect on television sets.</p> <p>Well, that’s it from us. Thanks for sticking with us, and we’ll see you next year!</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c787038f084b3c85a4efd6" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/adrian-horton"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-15T03:26:43.879Z">4.26am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>My colleague Benjamin Lee wrote a full rundown of tonight’s awards, reunions and speeches:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/14/emmy-awards-2025-winners-adolescence-the-studio">Adolescence triumphs at the Emmys while The Studio breaks records</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c785488f0880bae9c53b8c" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/benjamin-lee-film"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-15T03:23:55.946Z">4.23am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>It feels like it happened a few days ago now, but there was a red carpet and it looked a bit like this:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2025/sep/15/emmy-awards-2025-red-carpet-looks-for-tvs-big-night-in-pictures">Emmy awards 2025: red carpet looks at TV’s big night – in pictures</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c785c18f0880bae9c53b94" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/benjamin-lee-film"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-15T03:20:41.530Z">4.20am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The night’s most genuine moment:</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/SpencerAlthouse/status/1967417449990799465">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">omg the entire Adolescence cast freaking out over Stephen Graham&#39;s Emmy win for Lead Actor <a href="https://t.co/qzzjjNbDDY">pic.twitter.com/qzzjjNbDDY</a></p>&mdash; Spencer Althouse (@SpencerAlthouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpencerAlthouse/status/1967417449990799465?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote>   </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c785058f0880bae9c53b89" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/benjamin-lee-film"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-15T03:16:42.900Z">4.16am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here’s the full list of winners if you need to catch up:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/14/emmys-2025-full-list-of-winners">Emmys 2025: full list of winners</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c783448f086519d32723ae" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/adrian-horton"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-15T03:13:17.391Z">4.13am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1967424205160620073">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The cast of &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; reunite at the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Emmys?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Emmys</a> to present best drama series. <a href="https://t.co/dd3IDGaelh">pic.twitter.com/dd3IDGaelh</a></p>&mdash; Variety (@Variety) <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1967424205160620073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <p>Just before the Pitt’s triumph, the Emmys brought together one final cast reunion tribute.

And with a healthy mix of award show veterans and newbies.</p> <p>With the absence of Shōgun, which basically swept the drama awards last year, the race this year is shaping up to be one of the more interesting competitions this year. Apple TV’s Severance leads the night with 27 nominations for its second season. But the epitome of prestige TV – long-gestating, high-budget, starry cast – is up against HBO Max’s answer to the network medical drama. The Pitt, with 13 nominations and plenty of audience goodwill, could come out ahead. Both face-off against Andor, Slow Horses, Paradise, The Last of Us, the Diplomat and Emmys stalwart, The White Lotus.</p> <p>On the comedy side, another Apple TV success, Hollywood business satire The Studio, has the momentum, with 23 nominations – breaking the record for most nominations for a show’s first season. It competes with two former winners – Hacks and still-not-a-comedy The Bear – as well as Abbott Elementary, Only Murders in the Building, Shrinking, What We Do in the Shadows and the first season of the Netflix hit Nobody Wants This. And like Baby Reindeer last year, another small British production released through Netflix, Adolescence, enters as the heavy favorite for limited series, along with several deserved acting nominations.</p> <p>The night promises at least a few surprises and memorable speeches, as well as cast reunions for Gilmore Girls and Law &amp; Order – stick with us for all the highlights!</p> </div>   </div>
