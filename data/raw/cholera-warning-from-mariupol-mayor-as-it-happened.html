  <p><strong>Russia has labelled a non-governmental organization that fights for investigations into torture allegations as a “foreign agent.”</strong></p> 
  <p>On Friday, the Russian justice ministry updated its website list of blacklisted entities to include the Committee Against Torture, a UN-linked human rights treaty body. </p> 
  <p>Russia has long used the “foreign agent” label to blacklist opponents, journalists and human rights activists who are accused of carrying out foreign-funded political activities against the state. </p> 
  <p>The organization, founded 22 years ago, has urged Russian authorities to investigate torture allegations carried out by its security forces and called for preventative measures. </p> 
  <p>In 2015, the organization was designated as a “foreign agent” and again the following year, dissolving itself and then re-forming to try and evade the label.</p> 
  <p>Since the start of Moscow’s military operation in Ukraine on February 24, dozens of members of the Russian intellectual elite and journalists have left the country, as the authorities step up pressure against the last critical voices and media.</p> 
  <p>In April, Russia announced that it was shutting down the local offices of over a dozen international organizations including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.</p>

  <p><strong>Ukraine tried to push back Russian troops in the east and south on Friday as France offered to help ensure access to the port of Odessa and ease a global grain crisis.</strong><br></p> 
  <p>Agence France-Presse reports: </p> 
  <p><em>Kyiv said Friday it had launched new air strikes on Russian positions in the captured southern region of Kherson, one of the first areas to be taken by Russia after the February 24 invasion.</em></p> 
  <p><em>Fierce fighting continued in the eastern Donbas region, where <strong>President Volodymyr Zelensky </strong>said that Ukrainian forces were “holding on” despite Moscow concentrating its firepower there.</em></p> 
  <p><em>The fiercest fighting remains around the eastern industrial city of Severodonetsk, a battle that Zelensky has said is pivotal for the fate of the Donbas region.</em></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em><strong>Local governor Sergiy Gaiday</strong> said on Friday that Russian forces had destroyed a major sports centre, adding: “One of the symbols of Severodonetsk was destroyed. The Ice Palace burned down.”</em></p>

  <p><em>With the world still facing shockwaves from the war, an adviser to <strong>French President Emmanuel Macron</strong> said France was ready to assist in an operation to allow safe access to Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odessa.</em></p> 
  <p><em>The port has been subject to a de facto blockade by Russia, and grain is waiting to be exported amid mounting fears of global food shortages, especially in developing countries.</em></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>“We are at the disposal of the parties to put in place an operation which would allow access in complete safety to the port of Odessa, in other words for boats to pass through despite the fact that the sea is mined,” said the advisor, who asked not to be named.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Any way you count it, the figures are stark: Ukrainian casualties are running at a rate of somewhere between 6oo to 1,000 a day.</strong> </p> 
  <p>One presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, told the Guardian this week it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/08/ukraine-and-russia-compete-to-be-last-army-standing-as-donbas-deaths-mount">150 dead and 800 wounded</a>; another, Mykhaylo Podolyak, told the BBC that 100 to 200 Ukrainian troops were being killed a day.</p> 
  <p>It represents an extraordinary loss of human life and capacity for the defenders, embroiled in a defence of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk that, this week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/08/ukraine-may-pull-back-in-sievierodonetsk-russia-war-donbas">turned into a losing battle</a>. Yet the city was also arguably a place that Ukraine could have retreated from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/08/ukraine-and-russia-compete-to-be-last-army-standing-as-donbas-deaths-mount">to the more defensible Lysychansk</a> across the Siverski Donets River, the sort of defensive situation that Ukraine has fared far better at.</p> 
  <p>The sheer number – more than 20,000 casualties a month – raises questions about what state Ukraine’s army will be in if the war drags on into the autumn. That is true for Russians too, of course. But it is the invaders who already control large chunks of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, and they can pause the fighting with the territorial upper hand.</p> 
  <p>Consider the figures in context. Ukraine’s army was 125,000 strong according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies – and there were a further 102,000 national and border guards in addition. Crude analyst estimates suggest that since the start of the war that figure could have doubled to an impressive 500,000.</p> 
  <p>Kyiv’s forces are far from a point of collapse. But several months of high casualties will erode its fighting strength significantly, even allowing for some of the wounded to recover. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s forces are already being pushed back in a Donbas artillery bombardment so intense it is likely to have a shell-shock impact on many of those who survive it. Morale is certainly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/07/exhausted-russian-fighters-complain-of-conditions-in-eastern-ukraine">an issue for the Russians</a>, but there are now <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ukraine-war-intelligence-russia-kyiv-military-b2096715.html">reports of desertions</a> from the Ukrainian side too.</p>

  <p><strong>The leaders of nine central and eastern European countries have asked Nato to strengthen its eastern flank following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p>Leaders of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia met in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, less than three weeks ahead of a Nato summit later this month in Madrid, AFP reports.</p> 
  <p>Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis, opened the meeting alongside his co-chair and Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, by saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In view of the increased security risks in Romania and the Black Sea, consolidating Nato on its eastern flank, in a unified and balanced manner, becomes all the more urgent and crucial.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The summit will draw up “a long-term vision... putting collective defence and Article 5 at the heart of the actions”, Iohannis said, referring to Nato’s article that states that an attack on one member is an attack on all of them.</p> 
  <p>The heads of state of the nine countries represented in Bucharest will also discuss the impact of the Russian invasion on the security of Nato’s “vulnerable partners”, including Moldova and Georgia.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Mariupol mayor: Cholera could kill thousands as corpses poison city’s water supply</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, warned cholera and other deadly diseases could kill thousands of people in the Russian-occupied city in southern Ukraine as corpses lie uncollected amid rising temperatures.<br></strong></p> 
  <p>Boichenko, who is no longer in the devastated city, said wells had been contaminated by the corpses of people killed during weeks of Russian bombardment and siege, and that the collection of bodies by the city’s Russian occupiers was proceeding slowly, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on national television, Boychenko said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is an outbreak of dysentery and cholera. This is unfortunately the assessment of our doctors: that the war which took over 20,000 residents ... unfortunately, with these infection outbreaks, will claim thousands more Mariupolites.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Mariupol has been placed into quarantine, he said earlier. “Nobody is let in or out.” He told the BBC that “there are a lot of dead” in the city, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p> They have not cleared the bodies of those they killed in the bombings. Many bodies are still under the ruins. The problem is compounded by the absence of garbage collection – the system hasn’t been functioning since February.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The situation was being made worse by it now being summer and hot, with heavy rain ruining makeshift burial places as well as a lack of functioning water and sewage systems, he said.</p> 
  <p>Boychenko told the BBC:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The resulting mix flows towards rivers and wells, where people draw and use it. This water is already poisoned. It has already propagated throughout the city. The occupation authorities bring water to the city, but not enough. People still go to the wells and take that poisoned water.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Earlier today, Britain’s defence ministry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/10/russia-ukraine-war-latest-ukrainian-forces-holding-on-in-key-donbas-battles-but-losing-up-to-200-troops-a-day-zelenskiy-aide-says-live?page=with:block-62a2d7cf8f08f6946a4ee9e7#block-62a2d7cf8f08f6946a4ee9e7">said</a> there was a risk of a major cholera outbreak in Mariupol because medical services were likely near collapse. Russia is struggling to provide basic public services to the population in Russian-occupied territories, it said.</p> 
  <p>About 100,000 people are in the city that once had a population of about 430,000 before Russian troops invaded the country, according to Ukrainian officials. </p>

  <p>“We take Turkey’s security very seriously and we will as a Nato member contribute to security for all Nato members, Turkey included,” Reuters reports she told a news conference later in the day.</p> 
  <p>Linde said Swedish membership of Nato could “change the conditions for arms exports within our national regulatory framework”.<br></p> 
  <p>The minister said talks between representatives of Sweden, Finland, Turkey and Nato were being held in a constructive spirit. However, asked at the news conference in what way talks were constructive, she could only reply: “They are not called off.”<br></p> 
  <p>She said she had been very surprised by Turkey’s objections, which were first voiced publicly shortly after applications were handed in. She said that before the application had been made, “we had had talks with Turkey where they had said that ‘we certainly have views on various things that we can discuss where we aren’t of the same opinion, but we welcome Sweden and Finland’”.</p>

  <p><strong>Russia wants to use the two Britons and Morrocan sentenced to death for fighting Russian forces as “hostages” to put pressure on the west over peace negotiations, according to a senior Ukrainian official.</strong></p> 
  <p>Following the sentencing of Aiden Aslin, Shaun Pinner and Saaudun Brahim in the self-proclaimed republic in Donetsk, Ukraine said the ruling had no authority and that the men were members of the Ukrainian armed forces and subject to Geneva Convention protections.</p> 
  <p>Kyiv would coordinate its position on the sentences with London, Washington and the EU, interior ministry adviser, Vadym Denysenko, said.</p> 
  <p>Denysenko said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The trial of the foreigners raises the stakes in the Russian Federation’s negotiation process. They are using them as hostages to put pressure on the world over the negotiation process.</p>

  <p>Russian and Ukrainian delegations have held multiple rounds of talks remotely and in person since Russian troops invaded on 24 February, but efforts have been frozen for more than a month.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Two Britons sentenced to death ‘committed crimes in Donetsk', says Russia</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said two British nationals and one Moroccan were sentenced to death </strong><strong>in the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) had committed crimes on the territory of the self-proclaimed state.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking at a press conference, Lavrov declined to comment on the cases of the two Britons sentenced to death for fighting Russian forces, saying they are under the jurisdiction of the DPR.</p> 
  <p>Lavrov said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>At the moment, the trials you mentioned are being held on the basis of the legislation of the Donetsk People’s Republic, because the crimes in question were committed on the DPR’s territory.</p>

  <p>Aiden Aslin, 28, and Shaun Pinner, 48, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/liz-truss-ukraine-to-discuss-britons-death-sentences-fighting-russia">were convicted yesterday</a> in a court of taking action towards violent seizure of power, a verdict that has been described as a “sham judgement” with “absolutely no legitimacy”.<br></p> 
  <p>The DPR, where separatist forces began a military campaign to break away from Ukraine with Moscow’s support in 2014, is internationally recognised as part of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Among UN member states, only Russia recognises the entire Ukrainian province of Donetsk, much of which remains under Ukrainian control, as the independent DPR.</p>

   <li>The UK foreign secretary, <strong>Liz Truss</strong>, will raise the case of <strong>Aiden Aslin</strong> and <strong>Shaun Pinner</strong>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/09/britons-sentenced-to-death-russian-occupied-ukraine-aiden-aslin-shaun-pinner">two British men sentenced to death</a> by a pro-Russian court in occupied Ukraine, when she speaks to Ukraine’s foreign secretary, <strong>Dmytro Kuleba</strong>, on Friday. Truss has already called it a “sham judgment” and said it had “absolutely no legitimacy”.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li>A British MP has said the only person who can immediately resolve the situation with the two men is the Russian president, <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>. <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong> described the sentencing as a “war crime”, “absolutely outrageous” and “a flagrant breach of international law”.

A court in Russian-controlled east Ukraine convicted 28-year-old Aslin, from Newark-on-Trent, 48-year-old Pinner, from Watford, and Saaudun Brahim on charges of “terrorism”.</li>

   <li><strong>Ukrainian troops claim they have advanced in fierce street fighting in Sievierodonetsk</strong> but say their only hope of turning the tide is with more artillery to offset Russia’s massive firepower. Ukraine’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong>, said the country was “holding on” to key frontline cities in Donbas. “Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk and other cities in Donbas, which the occupiers now consider key targets, are holding on,” he said, adding that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> had had some success in Zaporizhzhia.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Serhiy Haidai, </strong>Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said: “The whole free Luhansk region came under heavy shelling. Fierce street fighting continues in Sievierodonetsk. We are exhausting the enemy.”</li> 
  </ul>

   <li>Russia is looking for weak points in Ukrainian defences near the <strong>Siverskyi Donets</strong> river in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian defence ministry spokesperson <strong>Oleksandr Motuzyanyk</strong> has said.

  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Oleh Synyehubov</strong>, the governor of <strong>Kharkiv</strong>, has said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> has not been able to advance in his region, despite extensive shelling. </li>

   <li><strong>Putin paid tribute yesterday to tsar Peter the Great, drawing a parallel between what he portrayed as their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/putin-compares-himself-to-peter-the-great-in-quest-to-take-back-russian-lands">twin historic quests to win back Russian lands</a>.</strong> After visiting an exhibition in Moscow dedicated to the 350th birthday of the 18th-century ruler on Thursday, Putin told a group of young entrepreneurs that “you get the impression that by fighting Sweden he was grabbing something. He wasn’t taking anything, he was taking it back”.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Ukrainian military casualties are </strong><strong>between 100 and 200 a day</strong>, according to Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Zelenskiy, who spoke with the BBC on Thursday.

   <li><strong>Nearly 5 million Ukrainians have been registered across Europe since the beginning of the war, according to figures by the UN’s refugee agency. </strong>Far more will have actually left the country, with UNHCR data showing that more than 7.3m border crossings out of Ukraine had been recorded by 7 June.

  <p>The replacement for McDonald’s in Russia has unveiled its new logo, ahead of a grand reopening on Sunday. The reopening is timed to coincide with Russia Day, celebrating the country’s independence, at the very same location in Moscow’s Pushkin Square where McDonald’s first opened in Russia in 1990.</p> 
  <p>Then it was seen as a potent symbol of opening up the old Soviet economy to western companies, but now more than 1,000 former McDonald’s restaurants in Russia will be part of a new chain, partly as a result of western sanctions on economic activity with Russia.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">British MP: death sentence Britons 'essentially used as hostages' by Russia</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A UK lawmaker has said the only person who can immediately resolve the situation with <strong>Aiden Aslin</strong> and <strong>Shaun Pinner</strong> is Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p> 
  <p><strong>Robert Jenrick</strong> described the sentencing of the two British men to death in occupied Ukraine as a “war crime”, “absolutely outrageous” and “a flagrant breach of international law”. He said the two men were being “essentially used as hostages” by pro-Russian forces in the region</p> 
  <p>Jenrick is the local member of parliament for the constituency of Aiden Aslin’s family, and says he has known them for many years. Appearing on the BBC Breakfast television programme, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a completely outrageous situation. These are not mercenaries. They’re British citizens, who, for personal reasons, were living in Ukraine before Vladimir Putin’s invasion.</p> 
   <p>They joined up to serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, were captured, and should be being treated as prisoners of war, which means being looked after appropriately and returned to Ukraine at the earliest opportunity.</p> 
   <p>Instead, they’ve been put on this show trial, and now have been sentenced to death.</p> 
   <p>I’ve asked the foreign secretary Liz Truss to raise this matter with the Russian ambassador so that we as a country are very clear that you can’t treat British citizens in this absolutely outrageous way. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Jenrick suggested that at some point they could be part of prisoner exchanges between the two nations, but that relied on a change of attitude from Russia, saying:<br></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There are prisoner exchanges happening between the Ukrainian and the Russian army, and the Ukrainian ambassador told me last night that they would give priority to Aiden and Shaun in one of those exchanges.</p> 
   <p>But that of course relies on Russia playing ball, or being reasonable, and abiding by international law. And nothing in recent weeks and months suggest that Vladimir Putin does that, because he’s been committing war crimes like this trial, and worse, left, right and centre.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked whether the situation was complicated because Russia views its invasion of Ukraine on 24 February not as a war, but as a “special military operation” and therefore not necessarily covered by the usual protocols of war, Jenrick said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a fairly straightforward situation. These were members of the Ukrainian armed forces. All members of armies are subject to the Geneva Convention and should be being properly looked after, not put on show trials or sentenced to death in this way.</p> 
   <p>The Ukrainians have thousands of Russian soldiers in their care, and there are exchanges going on. These two British nationals have been hooked out of that normal process and essentially used as hostages to make a point to try to gain advantage either over the UK or over Ukraine. We’re saying that’s completely unacceptable. It’s a flagrant breach of international law. They need to be treated properly.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Jenrick also expressed sympathy for the families of the men, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is an enormously stressful experience for two British families who have watched their sons and grandsons being put on this trial, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/british-man-captured-in-ukraine-reportedly-pictured-beaten-and-handcuffed">being beaten</a>, their health deteriorating, and now there’s risk of execution. It’s totally unacceptable.</p> 
   <p>I know the Ukrainian government want to assist but at the end of the day, the person who could resolve this immediately is Vladimir Putin. </p>

   <p>This is an illegal court in a sham government that has held this trial, and obviously we don’t recognise it has any authority, but we will continue to use our diplomatic channels to make the case that these are prisoners of war who should be treated accordingly.</p> 
   <p>Clearly they are in this area controlled by Russia’s proxies. And that’s why it’s absolutely vital that Russia recognises its obligations under international law and meets its commitments under the Geneva Convention.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ukraine relies on western arms, ammunition low - military</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Ukraine’s deputy head of military intelligence has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> is losing against Russia on the frontlines and is now almost solely reliant on weapons from the west to keep Russia at bay.</p> 
  <p>“This is an artillery war now,” said Vadym Skibitsky, deputy head of Ukraine’s military intelligence. The frontlines were now where the future would be decided, he told the Guardian, “and we are losing in terms of artillery”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us.</p> 
   <p>Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Ukraine is using 5,000 to 6,000 artillery rounds a day, according to Skibitsky. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have almost used up all of our [artillery] ammunition and are now using 155-calibre Nato standard shells,” he said of the ammunition that is fired from artillery pieces.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>“Europe is also delivering lower-calibre shells but as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> runs out, the amount is getting smaller,” he added. </p> 
  <p>Skibitsky’s remarks corroborate with that of US military intelligence cited by a recent Agence France-Press report. </p> 
  <p>According to military sources who spoke to the agency, Ukraine has depleted its Soviet and Russian-designed weaponry and is now completely dependent on allies for arms.</p> 
  <p>Once part of the Soviet Union, Ukraine’s army and its defence industry were built around Soviet and Russian-standard equipment, small arms, tanks, howitzers and other weapons not interchangeable with those of neighbours to the west.</p> 
  <p>More than three months into the conflict, that equipment has been used up or destroyed in battle, the US sources said.</p>

He wasn’t taking anything, he was taking it back”.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Ukrainian troops claim they have advanced in fierce street fighting in Sievierodonetsk</strong> but say their only hope of turning the tide is with more artillery to offset Russia’s massive firepower. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the country wa “holding on” to key frontline cities in Donbas. “Sievierodonetsk, Lysychansk and other cities in Donbas, which the occupiers now consider key targets, are holding on,” he said, adding that Ukraine had had some success in Zaporizhzhia.</li>
