<p>The makers of Gore-Tex, a popular product commonly used to waterproof clothing by companies such as the North Face and Mountain Hardware, poisoned drinking water and sickened residents around their facilities in rural Maryland, two lawsuits allege.</p> <p>The facilities, about 90 miles north-east of Baltimore, polluted drinking water with levels up to 700 times above federal limits with some kinds of Pfas, a group of toxins known as “forever chemicals” due to their environmental longevity. The tainted water caused high rates of cancers and other diseases linked to Pfas exposure in the area, a class action suit alleges.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Maryland is suing WL Gore and Associates, Gore-Tex’s parent company, over alleged environmental violations. Each suit claims Gore knew about its products’ dangers as early as the 1980s, but continued to put Pfas into local waters, which drain into the Chesapeake Bay, and emit the substances from smokestacks.</p> <p>The company has said it only learned about PFOA, a common type of Pfas compound, in nearby groundwater two years ago, and has suggested it is not responsible for at least some of the pollution.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/microplastics-pesticides-sea-stars-washington-state">Microplastics and pesticides aiding death of sea stars in Washington state – study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Philip Federico, an attorney for the plaintiffs, dismissed the idea, noting the chemicals in the water match what Gore used. “They’re really not in a position to say it’s not their Pfas – they know it is, and everyone else knows it,” Federico said.</p> <p>Pfas are a class of about 15,000 chemicals typically used to make products that resist water, stains and heat. They can accumulate in humans and the environment, and are linked to cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders, birth defects and other serious health problems.</p> <p>The EPA in 2023 found virtually no level of exposure to PFOA in drinking water is safe. PFOA was used in Gore’s production process, the suit alleges. The chemicals that were emitted from the smokestacks probably landed on the nearby ground and percolated into groundwater that contaminated wells and poisoned agricultural soil. Similar issues have been reported around other Pfas facilities.</p> <p>Gore, a company with an estimated value of nearly $5bn, used PFOA to produce PTFE, a type of Pfas, applied to clothing, carpets, furniture, food packaging and more. The company set up <a href="https://forward.gore.com/">a webpage</a> defending its record, noting it has conducted some investigations. It has said it is working with state regulators, as well as providing drinking water or filtration systems to some residents.</p> <p>“Gore denies the allegations in the various lawsuits that have been recently filed. We have been and will remain committed to the health and safety of our Associates, our community, and the environment,” says a statement on the website.</p> <p>It added: “Working with our suppliers, we eliminated PFOA, the substance cited in the lawsuit, from our supply chain many years ago. We will defend ourselves against the meritless allegations through the legal process with facts and science.”</p> <p>The suit details how the Pfas industry knew throughout the 1970s that the substances were dangerous, and a Gore executive knew by 1990 at the latest. Still, the company’s Pfas waste grew as operations expanded, and the company told employees the substance was harmless even as staff got sick and some died of Pfas-linked disease.</p> <p>The suit alleges Gore effectively lied to regulators about Pfas air pollution beginning in 1995 and the company also later destroyed documents detailing its pollution, the suit alleges.</p> <p>“Gore had actual knowledge, knew and fully understood the toxicity and danger to human life caused by APFO/PFOA at all times by its production and dispersion activities,” the complaint reads.</p> <p>About 4,000 people are part of the class action suit. It and the state of Maryland demands the company cover cleanup costs, pay for medical costs, pay for upgrades to water utilities and provide clean water to residents, among other actions.</p>
