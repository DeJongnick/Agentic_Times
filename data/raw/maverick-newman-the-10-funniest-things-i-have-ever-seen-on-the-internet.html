<p>By the time I stumbled into puberty, my friends and I were all starting to own mobile phones and school laptops, and YouTube had become ubiquitous. It was access to a whole world beyond where we were. Mainly the US. And, as a tragic theatre kid, it was access to New York, to Broadway! It was also access to a whole swathe of brilliant performances from before the internet; see below, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/elaine-stritch">Elaine Stritch</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/catherine-tate">Catherine Tate</a>, Debra Monk. Growing up with these funny people is a huge reason I’m doing what I’m doing with my life (being a singing, dancing loony).</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/aug/01/eliza-the-delusionals-the-10-funniest-things-i-have-ever-seen-on-the-internet">Eliza &amp; The Delusionals: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is fascinating and joyous to look back as, this year, I get to live out a dream emulating the humour of the videos I was obsessed with: I am about to play 12 camp, predominately female characters in the musical comedy Murder for Two in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne">Melbourne</a>. In the show I get to bring every comic bone in my body, a skeleton that was made from the videos I grew up obsessing over.</p> <p>This list is my tasting platter of just some of the videos that helped shape my sense of humour. It’s second nature that we have the internet – but really how lucky we are that, from Shakespeare to SNL, we get to revel in it all!</p> <h2>1. My Favorite Broadway: The Leading Ladies – Everybody’s Girl – Debra Monk (Official)</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLBc2gQo32U"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fLBc2gQo32U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I’m starting my list with a show tune, get over it!</p> <p>A gem of musical theatre comedy, from a relatively little-known Broadway broad Debra Monk, from a relatively little-known Kander and Ebb musical, Steel Pier. My favourite lyric: “You won’t be disappointed / I’m also double jointed.”</p> <h2>2. Catherine Tate Meets The Queen!</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijStfku29dk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ijStfku29dk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of my favourite sketches ever. Catherine Tate as the iconic “am I bovvered?” Lauren Cooper. Fun fact: this was the first time in history the program actually cut to the royal box. IMO this gets to the heart of British humour – when it can cut the shiz and make fun of itself.</p> <h2>3. Jiminy Glick Interviews Bill Hader</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoUAp9HCUv0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RoUAp9HCUv0?start=274&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=274" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>My most recent obsession is Martin Short as Jiminy Glick. Evidence that nothing is too ridiculous if you commit strong enough. Grotesque <em>and</em> subtle, heaven.</p> <h2>4. Shakespeare: Twelfth Night (Shakespeare’s Globe)</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDPT2e26SgY"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RDPT2e26SgY?start=62&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=62" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>As an actor, nothing turns me on more than a brilliant line reading. The best being completely unexpected yet completely true. This is one of my favourite line reads of all time from the phenomenal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/mark-rylance">Mark Rylance</a>. The line is “how now, Malvolio?” And yes, I have Shakespeare on my list …</p> <h2>5. Julia Louis-Dreyfus acceptance speech | 2018 Mark Twain prize</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfe2MoPDdkM"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nfe2MoPDdkM?start=371&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=371" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Most people in my life know I am obsessed with JLD. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jul/23/veep-show-kamala-harris">Veep</a> is my favourite television show of all time. She’s just so enigmatic. I think Julia Louis-Dreyfus could read a phone book and still ooze humour and charm. She is maybe the strongest example of someone that has that comic je ne sais quoi.</p> <h2>6. Lano &amp; Woodley – Opening Night Comedy Allstars Supershow 2018</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbLZw1guAic"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZbLZw1guAic?start=184&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=184" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>A more recent Lano and Woodley skit, where Woodley pretends to be a fly. Enough said.</p> <h2>7. Sean Hayes’ outstanding physical comedy for 12 minutes | Will &amp; Grace</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9kO0_M0iuQ"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N9kO0_M0iuQ?start=631&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=631" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Perhaps the single greatest comedy hero of mine is Sean Hayes. I have been likened to Sean Hayes as Jack McFarland many-a-time and it is the biggest compliment I can receive.</p> <h2>8. Exit Polling – Saturday Night Live</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-he5DH-sXxU"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-he5DH-sXxU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>A one-off SNL skit from the best of the best, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/kristen-wiig">Kristen Wiig</a>. It’s just so simple and stupid.</p> <h2><strong>9. </strong>Gabbi Bolt: Valentine’s Day Song | The Weekly with Charlie Pickering</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY9N1xfoGzc"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TY9N1xfoGzc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>My penultimate choice is really just a chance to show off how amazingly talented my co-star is. This is Gabbi on The Weekly with Charlie Pickering, being funny, musical brilliant and anti-capitalist while SERVING lewks on the ABC.</p> <h2>10. I’m Still Here – Elaine Stritch</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Xz1TUgdG6A"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3Xz1TUgdG6A?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I don’t care if I was asked to list my top 10 yoghurts, I can’t curate a list of anything without some Sondheim. It seems fitting to start and end with 20th century Broadway show tunes. Favourite lyric: “In the depression, was I depressed? Nowhere near / I met a big financier … so I’m here.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Maverick Newman and Gabbi Bolt star in <a href="https://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/2024/comedy/murder-for-two" title="https://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/2024/comedy/murder-for-two">Murder for Two</a>, at Arts Centre Melbourne 15–25 August</em></p></li> </ul>
