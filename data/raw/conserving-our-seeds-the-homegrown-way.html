<p>Re Chris Smith’s article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/02/seeds-biodiversity-hurricane-helene">I don’t want to die with a freezer full of seeds. Biodiversity and preservation need rethinking, 2&nbsp;April</a>), the Heritage Seed Library (HSL) based at Ryton Organic Gardens in Warwickshire has been encouraging its members to conserve seeds in their own gardens&nbsp;since the 1970s.</p> <p>The HSL, set up by Lawrence D Hills, was ahead of its time and is still going strong with 800 varieties safely stored – either local or discontinued by seed firms – but also regularly grown. Each year its members can choose from 100 rare varieties, and HSL seed&nbsp;guardians grow larger amounts for seed to ensure there are stocks for the future. Local seeds adapt to local conditions and may be more resilient in our changing climate,&nbsp;as&nbsp;Smith points out.<br><strong>Judy Steele</strong><br><em>Radford Semele, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>• Liz of Bury St Edmunds, who says her bush lily<em> </em>(<em>Clivia miniata</em>), acquired in 1987, “has thrived but is very temperamental when it comes to flowering” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/03/the-leaves-fall-off-but-i-think-thats-normal-the-houseplants-you-just-cant-kill">‘The leaves fall off – but I think that’s normal’: the houseplants you just can’t kill, 3 April</a>), should try placing it in a cold, frost-free place for a couple of months in the middle of the winter, watering it very sparingly. This often triggers flowering when the plant is then returned to a warm room and watered regularly. This also applies to <em>Hippeastrum</em>, often&nbsp;known as amaryllis.<br><strong>Shirley Neish</strong><br><em>Bookham, Surrey</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
