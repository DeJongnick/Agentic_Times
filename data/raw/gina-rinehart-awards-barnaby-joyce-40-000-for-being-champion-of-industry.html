<p>Australia’s richest woman, mining magnate Gina Rinehart, has awarded Barnaby Joyce $40,000 for services to the agricultural sector.</p> <p>At a gala dinner in Canberra on Tuesday, Rinehart gave the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Joyce, describing him as a “champion of the industry”.</p> <p>Labor immediately took aim at the award, with the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, labelling it a “$40,000 cash present”. Joyce has said he will refuse the cash.</p> <p>The Nationals leader, a close personal friend of Rinehart and former agriculture and water minister, is currently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/04/he-speaks-for-us-why-tamworth-is-oozing-sympathy-for-barnaby-joyce">battling for his political life in the New England byelection</a> after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/27/high-court-rules-barnaby-joyce-and-four-others-ineligible-in-dual-citizenship-case">the high court ruled him ineligible</a> to sit in parliament because of dual New Zealand citizenship.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/04/he-speaks-for-us-why-tamworth-is-oozing-sympathy-for-barnaby-joyce">'He speaks for us': why Tamworth is oozing sympathy for Barnaby Joyce</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rinehart thanked Joyce for taking “time out of your campaigning schedule to come here – to be here for the industry you love and support”.</p> <p>“What a great voice for Australian agriculture,” she said.</p> <p>“The agricultural industry is fortunate to have had such a dedicated, understanding and enthusiastic minister – one with years of first-hand experience – a real Aussie country boy and boy, do we hope you return.”</p> <p>Footage of the event shows Joyce stood up to accept the award and giant cheque, before modestly exclaiming “hooley dooley – rightio”.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59PCvkhTk9s"                                                                        > <iframe width="460" height="259" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/59PCvkhTk9s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Mining magnate Gina Rinehart awarding the inaugural agricultural and related industries award to Barnaby Joyce on 21 November.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>In addition to being the chair of Hancock Prospecting, Rinehart has extensive agricultural holdings and is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/oct/27/gina-rinehart-makes-improved-386m-bid-for-kidman-and-co-empire">the part owner of the $386m S Kidman and Co </a>cattle company which has leasehold over 80,000 sq km in Australia’s north.</p> <p>At a press conference on Wednesday, Shorten asked: “Why is a mining millionaire giving a Turnbull government minister a $40,000 cash present?</p> <p>“This is very unhealthy for our democracy,” he said. “It doesn’t look right, it doesn’t smell right. This is very, very unusual and concerning conduct.”</p> <p>A spokesman for Joyce told Guardian Australia he “literally had no idea” he would be receiving the award.</p> <p>He dismissed Shorten’s criticisms as “completely irrelevant” because Joyce will decline the $40,000 cash prize.</p> <p>Labor’s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon, said the award had turned the National Agriculture Day event into “the festival of Barnaby”.<br></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/07/effective-anti-corruption-efforts-must-be-part-of-broader-lobbying-regulation">Everyone wants an end to 'bad lobbying'.
