<p>“Starmer to toughen migration rules in challenge to Reform”, said your main headline in print today. Isn’t this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/11/english-test-among-range-of-labour-measures-to-control-immigration">a race to the bottom</a>?<br><strong>Colin Prower</strong><br><em>Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>• I noticed a mistake in the main&nbsp;headline on Monday’s front&nbsp;page – you’ve spelt “capitulation” as “challenge”.<br><strong>Ian Lewis</strong><br><em>Hope Mansell, Herefordshire</em></p> <p>• Oh, so wealthy Americans coming to live in this country and buying our houses are relocating – they are not immigrants (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/10/were-in-the-hamptons-of-england-trump-sends-wealthy-americans-fleeing-for-the-cotswolds">We’re in the Hamptons of England, 10 May</a>).<br><strong>Stephanie Bailey</strong><br><em>Norton-sub-Hamdon, Somerset</em></p> <p>• Bob Forster’s accordion playing (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/09/how-an-excise-officer-kept-up-their-spirits">Letters, 9 May</a>) may be more excruciating for his wife than my late husband’s attempts to learn the french horn in his 60s. He insisted on giving visitors renditions of his “tunes”, despite my pleas not to. Alan’s musical accomplishments are the only thing I don’t miss after 13 years of widowhood.<br><strong>Sharman Finlay</strong><br><em>Portrush</em><em>, County Antrim</em></p> <p>• Bob Forster’s accordion achievement was tempered in my mind by the saying: “A&nbsp;gentleman is someone who can play the accordion, but doesn’t.”<br><strong>Peter J Negri</strong><br><em>Norwich</em></p> <p>• Re old kitchen tools (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/07/lock-up-the-crown-if-trump-comes-to-visit">Letters, 7 May</a>), about 25 years ago, my in-laws dug out my husband’s great-great-grandmother’s three cast iron skillets and gave them to us. More than 120 years old and used so&nbsp;often that we just leave the&nbsp;largest one out on the hob.<br><strong>Karen Abbott</strong><br><em>Macclesfield, Cheshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
