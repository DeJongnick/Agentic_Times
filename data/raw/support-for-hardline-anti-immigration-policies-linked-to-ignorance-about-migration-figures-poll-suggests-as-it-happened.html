This sets the guidelines for the commission to follow when it makes its recommendations later in the year for the national living wage (the rate for people over the age of 21) and the national minimum wage (the rate for younger workers) in 2026.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/despite-ambitious-language-the-government-is-continuing-its-cautious-approach-to-uprating-the-minimum-wage/">an analysis</a>, the <strong>Resolution Foundation</strong> thinktank says the government is adopting </p> <p>It says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The new remit again states that the government “is determined to deliver a genuine living wage”.</p> <p>But despite this ambitious language, the government has again opted for a steady-as-she-goes approach to the adult minimum wage rate for 2026, which is set to rise in line with typical earnings next year. This was also the approach taken to the 2025 uprating. Similarly, despite a bold pledge to get rid of minimum wage rates for younger workers (under the age of 21), which the government says are “discriminatory”, worrying economic data means reality may be less spectacular. The government has asked the Low Pay Commission to consult on changes in the rate for 18-to-20 year olds, which suggests the 18-to-20 year old rate is set for a smaller increase in 2026 than the large 16.3 per cent increase this year.</p> <p>Given current forecasts for wage growth and the government’s policy announced today, the <strong>Low Pay Commission</strong> have said they currently expect the National Living Wage (the NLW – which applies to workers aged 21 and above) <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-living-wage-estimate-update">to reach £12.71 in April 2016</a>, an increase of 4.1 per cent. This would be a smaller cash increase than all but one year (2021) in the post-2015 National Living Wage era.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>UKHospitality</strong>, the trade body representing the hospitality industry, has urged the commission to be cautious about the rate at which it raises the living wage. Kate Nicholls, its chair, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>With significant new costs, such as the increase made to employer national insurance contributions, already hitting businesses hard, any significant wage hike may cost jobs. We urge the Low Pay Commission to recognise these cost pressures and recommend a more gradual and sustainable increase this year.</p> <p>Regrettably, escalating employment costs are already forcing businesses to reduce staff hours and, in some cases, make redundancies. Across the board, the labour market indicators are flashing red, and the Bank of England has also repeatedly voiced concerns about a potential wage-price spiral fuelling inflation. Inflating wages too far, too fast, would be counter-productive, resulting in fewer people earning a little more, but many more facing job losses or reduced hours, ultimately undermining the goal of putting more money in people’s pockets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-05T16:09:49.723Z">at 5.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-689220f18f0804180afc1360" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-05T15:22:46.355Z">4.22pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Danny Shaw</strong>, the former BBC home affairs correspondent who is now a commentator (and who briefly worked for Yvette Cooper as an adviser), has also been looking at the veracity of Robert Jenrick’s claim about asylum seekers being disproportionately likely to be sex offenders.

Under current guidance, this morning is not normally released. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/aug/05/yvette-cooper-small-boats-migrants-uk-france-home-office-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-6891c6718f081004615b8daa#block-6891c6718f081004615b8daa">9.54am</a>.)</p> <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> told journalists today that she wanted “full transparency” in this area. She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We should know the ethnicity and the nationality of suspects, of perpetrators, of victims. There shouldn’t be anything to hide.</p> <p>People will start losing faith in the justice system, in the police, if they feel that things are being hidden. So I would like to see full transparency as much as possible.</p> </blockquote> <p>Pressure for the routine release of infomation like this is coming in particular from rightwing politicians, in the Conservative party and Reform UK, who believe that asylum seekers are disproportionately likely to engage in criminal behaviour, particularly sexual offending. This is now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/aug/04/uk-politics-labour-conservative-reform-nigel-farage-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-689058bf8f081ec98bf0664c#block-689058bf8f081ec98bf0664c">official Conservative party thinking</a>, and it is a key Reform UK message, as the party illustrated at a press conference yesterday.</p> <p>Yet <strong>Amnesty International UK</strong> has warned disclosing information like this after suspects have been arrested could inflame racism. Responding to Cooper’s comments on this, Alba Kapoor, racial justice lead at Amnesty International UK said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The racist riots of last summer show how exactly how focus – true or false – on a suspect’s ethnicity or immigration status can become a lightning rod for racist sentiment.</p> <p>Yet almost exactly a year on, the government is choosing to pour fuel on the fire of dangerous narratives, instead of taking action to address racism and hostility. Moreover, the release of this data could further amplify entrenched racism in the police service, as outlined in the Met’s recent Casey Report.</p> </blockquote> <p>There has also been criticism of the statistics cited by the Tories and Reform to justify their concerns on this. Yesterday Robert Jenrick, shadow justice secretary, claimed that foreigners committed 40% of sexual crimes in London last year, despite comprising 25% of the population, and that groups like Afghans and Eritreans were 20 times more likely to commit sexual offences than British nationals.</p> <p>Speaking on Radio 4 yesterday, <strong>Robert Cuffe,</strong> head of statistics at the BBC, said the figure relating to crime in London was “probably an exaggeration”. He explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The figures come from the Metropolitan police. The Centre for Migration Control got a Freedom of Information request from them, and they do indeed show that 40% of people proceeded against for sexual offences last year were foreign nationals.</p> <p>“Proceeded against” – that’s charged or cautioned, not necessarily convicted.</p> <p>So [Jenrick’s] wrong to say it’s 40% of crimes committed.</p> <p>But there’s a more important caveat to bear in mind. Analyses like these that look at the number of crimes or charges against the share of the population – they’re missing a really important factor – age. Younger men are more likely to commit or be charged for these types of crimes, and foreign nationals are more likely to be young.</p> <p>So if you did a proper analysis that really took account of those differences, the gaps would look a lot smaller.</p> <p>I’ve been talking to people in the field who don’t have an axe to grind, and they say of course it’s possible that there’s something here, these just aren’t the data to tell us.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cuffe said the second claim, about Afghans and Eritreans being 20 times more likely to commit crimes than Britons, was much more problematic.</p> <p>He explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>For this one, I think you’re on much, much, much shakier ground, because all of the problems [with the previous figures] apply here, and some more as well.</p> <p>Foreign nationals are also less likely to show up in the population stats, because, for example, the ONS don’t go to communal establishments like migrant hostels.</p> <p>That’s not too big a deal if you’re looking at the share of population as a whole. But if you’re looking at just Eritreans, who account for less than 1% of these offences, or Afghans, then those differences become really, really important. If you miss a small number of people, it can have an outsized effect.</p> <p>So those numbers like 20 times more likely – run a mile from those.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the blog yesterday I also highlighted <a href="https://monkdebunks.substack.com/p/are-small-boat-migrants-really-24x">a very good Substack analysis</a> by Emma Monk dismantling Tory claims about asylum seekers being disporportionately criminal.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-05T14:46:07.477Z">at 3.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-689209858f08c02c0d98809c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-05T13:41:06.273Z">2.41pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> has restated her opposition to Keir Starmer’s plan to recognise Palestinian statehood.

Asked if she accepted that her party was “partly” to blame for the problem, she replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>No I don’t accept that at all, because what Labour are doing is just rubber-stamping all of the applications and saying they’re processing.</p> <p>We need to make sure that when people come to our country illegally, they are deported.</p> <p>That is our policy. And what we’re seeing right now is an explosion in the use of these hotels because Labour have failed to stop the boats.</p> <p>The reason why they’ve failed to stop the boats is because they have scrapped the only deterrent that this country had, which was the Rwanda plan.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is a chart from a Home Office report showing how the asylum application backlog grew over the past decade.</p>    <p>She also claimed that the “one in, one out” returns scheme with France about to come into force would make no difference to small boat arrival numbers. She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This is not going to make any difference whatsoever. 50, at best, migrants being swapped with France is not going to stop the boats.</p> <p>The thing that would stop the boats was a deterrent. A Rwanda plan, which we had, processing people in a third country, and if they got asylum, keeping them there, is what would have stopped people trying to come to the UK to claim benefits.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-6891f59a8f08c266736ce190" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-05T12:15:02.830Z">1.15pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Jeremy Corbyn warns new rules on council asset sales threaten allotments</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> has criticised Angela Rayner, the local government secretary, over changes that will allow councils to sell allotments to fund day-to-day spending, saying it “makes the future of these precious spaces even more perilous”, <strong>Jessica Murray</strong> reports.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/05/jeremy-corbyn-council-asset-sales-allotments">Jeremy Corbyn warns new rules on council asset sales threaten allotments</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6891f3a28f083ddf91b249de" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/priya-bharadia"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-05T12:12:39.124Z">1.12pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">50% of Reform UK supporters back Online Safety Act, despite party's pledge to repeal it, poll suggests</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Priya Bharadia is a Guardian reporter.</em></p> <p>Some 59% of the British public support the Online Safety Act, with seven in ten (71%) saying they prioritise protecting children over free expression and privacy, according to polling by <strong>More in Common</strong>.</p> <p>Reform UK voters are the most divided voter group about the legislation.

Advocating for migrants who settled in the UK for years to leave is a policy that has not been supported by anyone in mainstream politics for decade, and even now it is a cause that is principally being championed by people who are unashamedly racist.</p> <p>But the YouGov polling also found that almost half of respondents thought there were more immigrants staying in the UK illegally than legally, and that only 19% said that there was “much more” legal than illegal immigration (which is almost certainly the correct answer, even allowing for <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/unauthorised-migration-in-the-uk/">the very highest estimates of the level of unauthorised migration</a>).</p> <p>And YouGov established that people saying, wrongly, that there is “much more” illegal migration than legal migration are much more likely to be in the group saying large numbers of recent migrants should be returned.</p> <p>In his write-up of the research, YouGov’s <strong>Matthew Smith</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Almost half of Britons (47%) think there are more migrants staying in the UK illegally rather than legally … [and] crucially, this view is held by 72% of those who want to see mass removals. However, these perceptions appear to be wide of the mark.</p> <p>Estimates of the population of illegal migrants living in the UK range from 120,000 to 1.3 million, with Reform UK’s Zia Yusuf recently putting the figure at 1.2 million.</p> <p>Regardless of which figure from this range is chosen, it does not come close to the number of migrants living in the UK legally, with 2021/2022 census data putting the entire foreign-born population of the UK at 10.7 million.</p> </blockquote>    <p>Although ignorance of the numbers is linked to support for hardline anti-immigration policies, YouGov is not arguing that better public understanding would eliminate all concerns about immigration. It points out that, when asked specifically about legal immigration, a plurality of people say it is too high. And a significant minority of people think even legal migrants have not integrated into British society successfully, YouGov says.</p> <p>Smith says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>While it is clear that legal migration dramatically outweighs illegal migration, that is not to say that if only the public could be made aware of this fact then immigration would disappear as an issue.</p> <p>After all, Britons tend to think that legal immigration has been too high as well, and the concerns that many people have extend beyond the economic terms in which immigration is typically justified – anyone seeking to address the issue will need to engage with deeper anxieties about identity, integration, and the perceived erosion of shared national values.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aljwhite.bsky.social/post/3lvn3cscaw22v">a post on Bluesky</a>, <strong>Alan White</strong>, editor of PoliticsHome, says this polling is a terrible indictment of the media.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>New YouGov polling.

This could involve invoking emergency powers under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 to release prisoners early, in order to avert the risk of public disorder. Those meetings and discussions continued throughout the election period.</p> <p>The risk was real: at one point there were fewer than 100 places in adult male prisons. However, the system had in fact been in crisis for over eighteen months. From 2023 onwards, prisons were running very close to the edge of capacity. On three occasions, this was only pulled back at the last minute by the use of early release schemes, gradually decreasing the amount of time many prisoners spent in custody, using powers designed to allow release on compassionate grounds. Senior officials were so concerned about a potential breakdown in the criminal justice system that an audit was kept of all decisionmaking and documents, in case there was a public or parliamentary inquiry.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6891ce6d8f08904ec1b8a333" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-05T09:32:13.755Z">10.32am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Cooper defends banning Palestine Action</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Yvette Cooper,</strong> the home secretary, has defended her decision to ban Palestine Action as a terrorist group.</p> <p>The decision has been widely criticised and a demonstration against the move is planned for this weekend.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/04/police-warn-of-mass-arrests-if-palestine-action-protest-goes-ahead">Police warn of mass arrests if Palestine Action protest goes ahead</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about the issue on LBC, Cooper said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The proscribing process is based on very extensive security advice and security assessments to me as home secretary, which I have to take immensely seriously.

Keir Starmer has invested a lot of effort in measures that will “smash the gangs” and today the government is announcing the start of one of his big achievements in this area – a returns agreement, of sorts, with France. It is only a pilot, and the numbers are likely to be small, but the Conservatives never negotiated a deal of this kind when they were trying to stop small boat arrivals. (In fact, as a result of Brexit, <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/leaked-recording-reveals-top-tory-knew-of-flaws-in-post-brexit-plan-to-return-illegal-migrants-13367821">they achieved the opposite</a>.)

In media interviews, some politicians are keen to go on the offensive, by opening up new arguments or lines of attack. Cooper is the ultimate defensive player, smothering all awkward questions with splurge of officious, technocratic reasonableness. Journalists find it frustrating, because she tends to be a bit boring, but government spin doctors are happy because she never messes up.</p> <p>When Starmer and Emmanuel Macron announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/10/keir-starmer-emmanuel-macron-tories-migration-france-kemi-badenoch-uk-politics-live-news">the “one in, one out” pilot last month</a>, details about how it would work were sketchy. In her interviews this morning, Cooper did not reveal anything new about how the scheme would operate, arguing that, if she were to release this information, that might help the people smugglers evade the new regime. It has been widely reported that the scheme will start with about 50 people being removed per week, but Cooper would not even confirm this. On numbers, she told the Today programme:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We are not putting an overall figure on this programme. Of course, it will start will lower numbers and then build, but we want to be able to expand it. We want to be able to increase the number of people returned through this programme.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Cooper did try to counter the key charge being thrown against the government – that all the “smash the gangs” measures it is announcing are failing, because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/31/channel-crossings-25000-faster-year-record-asylum-seekers-migrants#:~:text=The%20first%20year%20in%20which,reduce%20the%20number%20of%20crossings.">small boat arrivals are at record numbers.</a></p> <p>On the Today programme, when she was asked why arrival numbers have been soaring over the past year, Cooper cited two reasons. She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>What we’ve seen in the course of this year has been the change in tactics by the criminal gangs, and they’ve been doing two things.</p> <p>First of all, exploiting the French maritime rules, which have meant up until this summer that the French authorities just could not intervene in French waters. That’s why we’ve seen these disgraceful scenes of the loading of people into small boats in shallow waters, and then the French police unable to intervene according to their rules.</p> <p>And that’s why it’s so important that, as part of this agreement with France, France is changing their maritime rules, and that will be starting later this summer.</p> <p>The second reason is we’re seeing [a] big increase in the overcrowding of the boats, so far more people being crammed into the boats.</p> <p>That is why we are seeking to change the law. We have the new border security bill going through parliament at the moment, bringing in the new offence of endangerment, so that people who are getting on overcrowded boats who are frankly putting other people’s lives at risks can themselves be prosecuted for getting on these overcrowded boats. Because it’s those two factors that are particularly driving this.</p> </blockquote> <p>By citing these two factors as the explanation, and stressing that the government is addressing them, Cooper was implying that the government will be able to reduce arrival numbers.</p> <p>The Conservatives claim that she is wrong because only a Rwanda-style deterrent policy would work. In an overnight press notice, the party descibed the UK-France deal as the “migrant surrender treaty” (using Boris Johnson’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/26/pms-divisive-surrender-bill-phrase-neither-careless-nor-casual"> inflammatory Brexit rhetoric</a>) and <strong>Chris Philp</strong>, the shadow home secretary, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Returning just 50 illegal immigrants a week, and probably less, will make no difference whatsoever. This amounts to just 6% of illegal arrivals. Allowing 94% to stay in the UK will be no deterrent at all. This is a gimmick which won’t work.</p> <p>The Rwanda removals deterrent, under which 100% of illegal arrivals would be removed, was ready to go last summer but Labour cancelled it just days before it was due to start with no proper replacement plan. As a result, this year so far has been the worst ever for illegal immigrants crossing the channel.</p> <p>Only removing all illegal immigrants upon arrival will provide the necessary deterrent to stop the crossings. This is the Conservative plan, but Labour is too weak to implement it and as a result they have lost control of our borders.</p> </blockquote> <p>It’s August, parliament is in recess, and there is almost nothing in the diary for today. This morning the Home Office will publish the text of the “one in, one out” returns treaty with France. And Kemi Badenoch is doing a visit in her North West Essex constituency, where she will be restating the Tories’ opposition to what they call Labour’s “family farm tax”.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media.
