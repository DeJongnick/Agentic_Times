<p>The fossil fuel industry poured more than $19m into Donald Trump’s inaugural fund, accounting for nearly 8% of all donations it raised, a new analysis shows, raising concerns about White House’s relationship with big oil.</p> <p>The president raised a stunning $239m for his inauguration – more than the previous three inaugural committees took in combined and more than double the previous record – according to data published by the US Federal Election Commission (FEC). The oil and gas sector made a significant contribution to that overall number, found the international environmental and human rights organization Global Witness.</p> <p>The group pulled <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/forms/C00894162/1889684/f132">itemized inaugural fund contribution data released by the FEC in April</a>, and researched each contributor with the help of an <a href="https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-fuels/how-we-used-ai-to-help-us-find-lobbyists-at-cop/" title="https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-fuels/how-we-used-ai-to-help-us-find-lobbyists-at-cop/">in-house artificial intelligence tool</a>. It located 47 contributions to the fund made by companies and individuals linked to the fossil fuel sector, to which Trump has voiced his fealty.</p> <p>On the campaign trail and in his inauguration speech, the president pledged to “drill, baby, drill”.</p> <p>“We will be a rich nation again, and it is that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/oil">liquid gold</a> under our feet that will help to do it,” Trump said in his inaugural address, just hours before he signed a spate of executive orders to “unleash American energy” and roll back environmental protections. His administration has since worked to boost the oil industry, including by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/trump-climate-state-laws-executive-order">taking aim at city- and state-led</a> fossil fuel accountability efforts, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/02/trump-administration-alaska-drilling-mining">opening up swaths of land</a> to extraction, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/may/27/texas-republicans-trump-wind-power-turbines">cracking down</a> on renewable energy expansion.</p> <p>“It’s no surprise the oil and gas industry handed millions to Donald Trump for his inauguration, and they seem to have reaped a huge return on their investment, said Nicu Calcea, a senior data investigator at Global Witness.</p> <p>Among the oil-linked donors identified, the energy giant Chevron made the largest contribution to Trump’s inaugural fund at $2m, tying it for fourth-largest donor overall alongside other givers such as the crypto platform <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/23/trump-inauguration-donors-include-meta-amazon-target-delta-ford.html">Coinbase and the financial services company Robinhood</a>.</p> <p>Reached for comment, a Chevron spokesperson said: “Chevron has a long tradition of celebrating democracy by supporting the inaugural committees of both parties. We are proud to have done so again.”</p> <p>ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips and Occidental Petroleum each made $1m donations. None of the three companies responded to the Guardian’s requests for comment.</p> <p>Altogether, Global Witness identified $19,151,933 in donations from fossil fuel-linked donors. That number is probably an underestimate, it says, because it does not include contributions from unverified energy-linked donors, or from diversified investors and businesses that do not work primarily in oil and gas.</p> <p>Trump’s profile of inaugural fund donors starkly contrasts with Joe Biden’s; the former president banned contributions to the fund from the oil and gas sector.</p> <p>“So Trump’s day one love-in with the oil and gas industry really tells us whose side he’s on,” said Alice Harrison, head of fossil fuel campaigning at Global Witness.</p> <p>Set up as charitable organizations, presidential inaugural funds are used to cover the costs of parades, galas and receptions as a new president enters the White House. Unlike presidential election campaigns, there are no set limits on how much a corporation or US citizen can give to an inaugural committee.</p> <p>Fossil fuel interests poured an additional $96m into Trump’s re-election campaign and affiliated political action committees, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/23/big-oil-445m-trump-congress">January report found</a>. Though that was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/03/trump-big-oil-campaign-pitch-corruption">less than the $1bn</a> he requested from the sector in an infamous meeting at his Mar-a-Lago club last spring, it still constituted record levels of spending.</p>
