<p>Lily Yohannes wastes no time. The 18-year-old scored on her international debut for the US at age 16 last year, having become a starter for Ajax before that. Now, with a move to European power OL Lyonnes over the summer, Yohannes scored a goal and was named player of the match in her debut for the club, a 3-1 win over Olympique Marseille.</p> <p>Born in Springfield, Virginia, to Eritrean parents, Yohannes was 10 when she moved to Europe after her father accepted a job in Amsterdam. She played on an amateur boys’ team and quickly earned the attention of Ajax, who signed her to their youth academy at 13 years old.</p> <p>“You have to make sacrifices to play at the highest level … I’ve had a different childhood than others, but I think I’ve found a good balance between having that dedication to my football, as well as enjoying my life outside of football,” Yohannes told the Guardian US in an exclusive interview before the season’s start. “From the moment I joined Ajax, I could feel the level of detail, how they try to implement the style of play of Ajax and the philosophy, and I think that’s something that’s pushed my game both tactically and technically. I’m just really grateful to Ajax for my development over the years.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/01/uswnt-euro-2025-lindsey-heaps">Would a still-developing US women’s team have won Euro 2025? </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yohannes was 15 when she became the youngest player, male or female, to sign a professional contract with Ajax. Seven months later, she became the youngest player to start a Uefa Women’s Champions League group stage match and the youngest American to play in the competition. Two months after that, Yohannes was named player of the match in a 2-0 win against Roma in the Champions League. She excelled on the domestic and international front and received the Johan Cruyff talent of the year award for the 2023–24 season, given to the best U-20 player of the Vrouwen Eredivisie campaign. Yohannes racked up five goals and four assists in 20 matches, helping Ajax finish second and beat Fortuna Sittard in the KNVB Women’s Cup final.</p> <p>It wasn’t long before the United States and the Netherlands were inundating her with offers to play for their national team, with Yohannes eventually choosing to represent the country where she grew up. When she made her debut, she was following in the footsteps of her maternal grandfather, Bokretsion Gebrehiwot, who played for Ethiopia (which annexed Eritrea between 1950 and 1993). Minutes after entering, she peeled away from her opponent and coolly slotted home to seal a 3-0 friendly win over South Korea. One week shy of her 17th birthday, Yohannes became the third-youngest goalscorer in USWNT history.</p> <p>“Wearing the US jersey is always such an honor, and to score on my debut was such a surreal moment,” Yohannes said. “What I remember most is that after I scored, all my teammates ran towards me to celebrate. To share that with them, my family, and my friends, it’s something I’ll never forget.”</p> <p>She continued to excel for Ajax while also graduating from high school. Her performances for Ajax attracted the interest of OL Lyonnes, who signed her to a three-year deal on 7 July. In the space of just a few years, Yohannes went from being another American abroad to an important signing for one of the most powerful teams in women’s soccer.</p> <p>“When Lyon showed their interest, I was really excited. What they’ve done over the years, what they’ve won, they’ve pushed the women’s game further in France and on the European stage by showing their dominance,” Yohannes said. “Obviously, you have to adapt to the change in environment, but my teammates and staff are helping me settle in, and I’m enjoying playing with so many world-class players who I can learn from. Lyon is a very ambitious club and is known for winning, so I want to be a part of that and win as many titles as I can.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/08/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Women’s Super League: talking points from the weekend’s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It’s clear to see why Yohannes is regarded as one of the top young talents in football. She glides in and out of congested areas with the grace and dexterity of a veteran midfielder, she can spot a player 50 yards ahead and pick her out with an inch-perfect through ball, and she has the intelligence and anticipation to find an inch of space before uncorking a powerful shot.</p> <p>“I can describe myself as a composed, creative midfielder,” Yohannes said. “I really like to be involved in the play and get on the ball and help dictate and distribute the ball … Every day, I’m just trying to constantly work on the small details to improve my game.”</p> <p>More than anything, though, she never shrinks from the biggest occasions, but instead sets an example for her teammates with her diligent work rate and measured risk-taking on and off the ball. It’s this fiery competitive instinct that has taken her to the zenith of the women’s game, and which has been developing ever since she was a girl in Virginia playing with her dad in 2v2 games against her elder brothers (who both play club football in the Netherlands).</p> <p>“I’ve always been chasing after them and trying to beat them. They’re older than me, bigger than me, so I’ve always had that competitiveness to want to win, even when it was tough,” she said. “We always train together and push each other, and we want to see each other do well.”</p> <p>OL Lyonnes are France’s ruling force in women’s soccer, winning a record eight women’s Champions League titles and finishing atop the Première Ligue in 18 of the last 19 seasons. Now, they chase a fifth consecutive championship under new manager Jonatan Giráldez, former manager of Barcelona Women and the Washington Spirit.</p> <p><strong>“</strong>Jonatan is really making his style of play clear, how he wants us to attack and defend … the training sessions have been high-intensity, and every week, it’s been really positive what we’re building,” Yohannes said.</p> <p>If the first game is any indication, they’ll be counting on Yohannes to deliver the goods and further her meteoric progression.</p>
