<p>Would-be car buyers considering ditching petrol for electric tend to fret – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/series/ev-mythbusters">not always correctly</a> – about higher upfront costs, access to chargers and whether their battery will last on long journeys.</p> <p>But Keir Starmer has an unusual obstacle to making the switch – Britain’s largest carmaker has claimed electric vehicles (EVs) do not offer adequate bomb protection. </p> <p>The prime minister’s armoured Range Rover Sentinels will need to remain as petrol versions for the foreseeable future, according to their manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover.</p> <p>JLR addressed the issue in written responses to a government consultation on EV sales rules. The documents – obtained by <a href="https://www.fastcharge.email/">Fast Charge</a>, a newsletter covering electric cars, and shared with the Guardian – detailed how JLR and other carmakers lobbied the UK government to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/24/uk-carmakers-ev-sales-rules-zev-mandate">weaken targets</a> requiring them to sell more EVs each year.</p> <p>JLR said armoured cars should be excluded from the targets, known as the zero emission vehicle mandate, because it “does not see any workable engineering solution to the challenges surrounding an armoured BEV [battery EV], primarily because the required safety levels and blast protection cannot be achieved”.</p> <p>Armoured vehicles are a small but very profitable business for carmakers. They usually have bulletproof glass, armour plating, and “bomb blankets” under the floor, adding hundreds of kilograms of weight to already heavy cars.</p> <p>While JLR did not say what specific vulnerabilities it sees in armoured electric vehicles, key engineering roadblocks are likely to include the extra weight from the battery cells, range issues and the time needed to recharge. </p> <p>However, its German rival BMW does not appear to share those worries: its electric <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0426598EN/the-first-ever-bmw-i7-protection-the-new-bmw-7-series-protection">i7 Protection</a> saloon offers “special armouring” in the floor and ceiling to protect against explosives on the ground and those carried by drones.</p> <p>JLR said the UK government was the main customer in Britain for its armoured vehicles. The vehicles are built at the company’s site at Solihull in the West Midlands and then converted by its special vehicle operations department.</p> <p>Precise specifications of Starmer’s fleet of Range Rover Sentinels are not public to avoid aiding potential attackers, but they are understood to have 5-litre V8 engines, designed to allow the heavy cars to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/17/boris-johnsons-car-hit-by-security-vehicle-outside-parliament-protester">speed off if threatened</a>.</p> <p>The prime ministerial fleet also includes non-electric, German-made armoured Audi A8 saloon cars, which replaced the Jaguar XJ after that model was discontinued.</p> <p>Tom Riley, the author of the Fast Charge newsletter, said: “This is the first time I’ve come across ‘blast anxiety’ as an excuse not to switch. Clearly, it’s a valid concern, but it does mean the prime minister could be the last Brit to go electric.”</p> <p>For motorists who do not need to worry about bomb attacks, overall lifetime costs for electric cars are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/16/are-electric-cars-too-expensive-to-tempt-motorists-away-from-petrol-and-diesel-vehicles">significantly lower</a> on average, while “range anxiety” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/09/stranded-electric-car-ev-range-anxiety-charging-network">should not be a problem</a> for those who rarely make journeys longer than 200 miles and live in places where charging facilities are increasingly common, such as the UK, western <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> or parts of the US.</p> <p>JLR declined to comment.</p>
