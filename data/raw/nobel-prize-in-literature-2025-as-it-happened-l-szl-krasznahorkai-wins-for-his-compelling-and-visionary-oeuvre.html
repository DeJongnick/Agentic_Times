At the time I was working on seeing writers from what we then called post-communist Europe into publication in English. Even then, in that explosion of access to wonderful writing too long inaudible in the Anglosphere, this fiction stood out.</p> <p>“The Melancholy of Resistance was the first novel of his I read. I was immediately sucked into its shadowy moodscape. Starting to read this famously unparagraphed novel is like entering a labyrinth: a claustrophobic zone where the mystery of an arriving leviathan (and all that symbolises), of the suffocating small town into which it arrives, not to mention the nocturne which is the setting, all combined almost unbearably in a portrait of powerlessness and society’s failure. A political critique? Almost certainly, but also such a profound and new made symbol it speaks to every kind of stalemate, psychic and societal. </p> <p>“Krasznahorkai reminds us life is difficult, agency almost always almost out of reach, and the colours of many times and places sombre. An essential read for these times, not least in a Europe once again feeling the squeeze between Russia and the US.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e79ef88f08e1d65d2a5f1d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/philip-oltermann"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T11:50:05.309Z">12.50pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Where does Krasznahorkai stand politically?</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Although he retains a house in his native Hungary, Krasznahorkai has spent recent years living in self-imposed exile in Berlin and Trieste, and has not hid his disdain for the policies of prime minister Viktor Orbán. <br><br>In his novel Baron Wenckheim’s Homecoming, published in Ottilie Mulzet’s translation in 2019, there is an “evil, sick, and omnipotent” but nameless figure who sweeps through town in a black motorcade, and whom some critics have identified as a cipher for the strongman prime minister who has ruled Hungary since 2010.<br><br>During his time in office, Orbán’s Fidesz party has systematically brought universities, theatres, independent news outlets and the book industry in line with its brand of “illiberal democracy”. On the war in neighbouring Ukraine, Hungary has tried to tread a neutral path, condemning the war but also blaming Ukraine and its western allies while remaining one of the few European countries not to provide military aid.<br><br>In <a href="https://yalereview.org/article/l%C3%A1szl%C3%B3-krasznahorkai_interview">an interview with the Yale Review</a> in February this year, Krasznahorkai said the inauguration of Donald Trump filled him with “horror” and described Orbán’s failure to condemn Putin as the result of a “psychiatric” mindset.<br><br>“Hungary is a neighbouring country of Ukraine, and the Orbán regime is taking an unprecedented stance – almost unparalleled in Hungarian history”, he said. “I could never have imagined that the Hungarian political leadership would talk about so-called neutrality in this matter! How can a country be neutral when the Russians invade a neighbouring country?”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e79dc38f08e1d65d2a5f06" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/ella-creamer"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T11:40:57.499Z">12.40pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Krasznahorkai’s novel Herscht 07769 was translated into English by Ottilie Mulzet and published in the UK last year.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/06/herscht-07769-by-laszlo-krasznahorkai-review-sinister-cosmic-visions">Herscht 07769 by László Krasznahorkai review – sinister cosmic visions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Herscht 07769 is “bleak from start to finish”, wrote Tanjil Rashid in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/nov/06/herscht-07769-by-laszlo-krasznahorkai-review-sinister-cosmic-visions">Guardian review</a>. “It opens with the almost comically on-brand words ‘hope is a mistake’ (the novel’s epigraph) and closes with a line that warns of ‘merciless night descending heavily upon the land’.

He first left Communist Hungary in 1987, spending a year in West Berlin for a fellowship, and later drew inspiration from East Asia – particularly Mongolia and China – for works such as The Prisoner of Urga, and Destruction and Sorrow Beneath the Heavens.</p> <p>While working on War and War, he travelled widely across Europe and lived for a time in Allen Ginsberg’s New York apartment, describing the legendary Beat poet’s support as crucial to completing the novel.</p> <p>His admirers are formidable: Susan Sontag called him “the contemporary Hungarian master of apocalypse,” while WG Sebald praised the universality of his vision.

In 2004, he made his only well-publicised media cameo: on The Simpsons.

The Japanese novelist, essayist and translator has been a bookies’ favourite for years, thanks to a vast global readership and a unique literary voice.</p> <p>Born in Kyoto in 1949, Murakami came to writing relatively late. He ran a jazz bar in Tokyo before publishing his debut novel Hear the Wind Sing in 1979. It won the Gunzou Literature prize and launched a career that would make him one of the most widely read authors in the world.</p>    <p>Murakami’s work blends the everyday and the surreal, often following lonely, introspective characters as they drift between ordinary reality and strange, dreamlike worlds.</p> <p>His best-known novels include Norwegian Wood (1987), a breakout hit that made him a literary star in Japan; The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1994); Kafka on the Shore (2002); and 1Q84 (2009). His fiction features jazz, cats, wells, disappearances and quiet obsessions, elements that have become instantly recognisable Murakami signatures.</p> <p>A prolific translator of American writers such as Raymond Carver and F Scott Fitzgerald, Murakami has long bridged cultures.</p> <p>While immensely popular with readers, Murakami’s relationship with Japan’s literary establishment has sometimes been complicated – he has been criticised for being “un-Japanese”, leading to the author claiming that he was a “black sheep in the Japanese literary world”. The Nobel prize has eluded him despite perennial predictions. He has, however, received numerous honours, including the Franz Kafka prize (2006), the Jerusalem prize (2009) and the Hans Christian Andersen literature award (2016).</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:55:44.452Z">at 11.55am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68e7817b8f08e1d65d2a5cfc" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/ella-creamer"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:51:35.947Z">11.51am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Who is the bookies’ favourite, Can Xue?</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The experimental Chinese author has been the bookies’ favourite for several years running now.</p> <p>She has had some international recognition already, having been longlisted for the International Booker prize in 2019 and 2021, first for her novel Love in the New Millennium, translated by Annelise Finegan Wasmoen, and then for her short story collection I Live in the Slums, translated by Karen Gernant and Chen Zeping.</p>    <p>Can Xue, whose real name is Deng Xiaohua, was born in 1953 in Changsha, Hunan province.

When the Academy announced it was honouring him “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition,” the response was immediate and polarising. Fans hailed the decision as groundbreaking, recognising songwriting as a legitimate literary art. Critics, however, questioned whether a musician should receive an award traditionally reserved for novelists, poets and playwrights. Dylan’s initial silence, and his decision not to attend the ceremony, only intensified the debate.</p>    <p>A few years later, in 2019, the prize went to <strong>Peter Handke, </strong>the Austrian novelist and playwright. The decision drew fierce criticism because of Handke’s public support for Slobodan Milošević and comments downplaying Serbian war crimes during the Yugoslav wars. Several writers, politicians and cultural figures condemned the Academy’s choice; some boycotted the ceremony.</p> <p>Going back further, <strong>Dario Fo,</strong> the Italian playwright and satirist, stunned many when he was named laureate in 1997. Known for his politically charged, often anarchic theatre, Fo was adored in some circles and dismissed in others. The Academy’s decision to celebrate him over more traditional literary figures raised eyebrows, though it also underlined their willingness to challenge expectations.</p> <p>Another surprising choice came in 1953, when <strong>Winston Churchill </strong>received the prize for his historical writings and oratory. Many questioned whether a statesman should be honoured over major literary figures of the era.</p> <p>Other contentious choices have included <strong>Harold Pinter</strong> in 2005, whose biting political speeches overshadowed his award. Earlier, in 1964, <strong>Jean-Paul Sartre</strong> made history by declining the Nobel prize altogether, saying a writer should not allow themselves to be turned into an institution – another moment that fuelled debate about the role and meaning of the award.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e6ebae8f08a99f04926825" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/ella-creamer"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:40:09.321Z">11.40am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Doris Lessing’s infamous reaction to winning the Nobel in 2007 is always worth a rewatch …</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuBODHFBZ8k"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vuBODHFBZ8k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e6ea778f0871610d006c0e" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/philip-oltermann"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:37:47.273Z">11.37am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Trying to detect patterns into the list of past Nobel laureates may be a fools’ game, and yet it would be a surprise if this year’s winner is a woman. While the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has emphatically rejected the idea of gender quotas, for the last 10 years it has in fact been quite careful to achieve parity, with five male and five female winners since 2015. Ever since 2018, it has gone about achieving this in the most failsafe manner, by alternating between female and male authors. And after <strong>Han Kang</strong> in 2024, that would mean it’s a man’s turn again today.</p> <p>What about geography? The Literature Nobel has traditionally been a Eurocentric prize, with the continent (if you exclude Russia) providing 91 out of 121 laureates, and more prizes going to Sweden itself than to all of Asia and Latin America. In an ever-more globalised world, this has been a bone of contention, and it might be tempting this year to nod to the literary achievements of corners of the world that have gone underappreciated in the past, such as India, Mexico or Australia (all of which have only notched up one prize each).</p> <p>The Academy has never been shy to make clear how much it values ambitious and difficult prose over popular fiction. But in the mid-2010s it went through an interesting experimental phase: as part of this exploratory amble along the line between high and low literature, it gave prizes to a journalist (<strong>Svetlana Alexievich</strong>), a singer-songwriter (<strong>Bob Dylan</strong>) and a novelist known for fantasy and science (if literary) fiction (<strong>Kazuo Ishiguro</strong>).</p> <p>The impression that the literature Nobel is mainly for writers over 70 is not really founded in fact. At 54, Han was the youngest laureature since <strong>Orhan Pamuk</strong>, who was the same age in 2006 – though none of them as young as <strong>Rudyard Kipling</strong>, who received it aged 41 in 1907. The average age to receive the prize is the sprightly age of 65.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e77d628f08e1d65d2a5ce8" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/ella-creamer"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:36:06.136Z">11.36am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/NobelPrize/status/1976185131963429002">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Toni Morrison – one of the most powerful storytellers of our time – became the first African American woman to receive a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NobelPrize?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NobelPrize</a> when she was awarded the literature prize in 1993.<br><br>Who will follow in her footsteps?

Sátántangó was famously adapted into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/07/books.guardianreview">a seven-hour film</a> by director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/oct/07/books.guardianreview">Béla Tarr</a>, with whom Krasznahorkai has had a long creative partnership.</p> <p>Krasznahorkai’s career has been shaped by travel as much as by language. He first left Communist Hungary in 1987, spending a year in West Berlin for a fellowship, and later drew inspiration from East Asia – particularly Mongolia and China – for works such as The Prisoner of Urga, and Destruction and Sorrow Beneath the Heavens.</p> <p>While working on War and War, he travelled widely across Europe and lived for a time in Allen Ginsberg’s New York apartment, describing the legendary Beat poet’s support as crucial to completing the novel.</p> <p>His admirers are formidable: Susan Sontag called him “the contemporary Hungarian master of apocalypse,” while WG Sebald praised the universality of his vision. In 2015, Krasznahorkai became the first Hungarian writer to win the Man Booker International prize.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e6e9858f0871610d006bfb" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/philip-oltermann"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:22:59.187Z">11.22am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Who do publishing insiders have their money on?</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Ladbrokes has Chinese experimentalist <strong>Can Xue</strong> and Hungary’s melancholy master <strong>László Krasznahorkai</strong> as favourites to win the prize, followed by popular Japanese novelist <strong>Haruki Murakami</strong>. But if you talk to people in the publishing industry, you’ll also hear a few names that aren’t riding high with the bookies, such as Swiss <em>Popliteratur </em>novelist <strong>Christian Kracht</strong>, whose Eurotrash was longlisted for the International Booker this year. Australian novelist <strong>Gerald Murnane</strong> has been a perennial bookies’ favourite, but if the prize goes to Down Under, some suggest it’s more likely to be awarded to Aboriginal writer <strong>Alexis Wright</strong> instead.</p>    <p>Peruvian writer <strong>Mario Vargas Llosa</strong> was the last Latin American laureate in 2010, which has brought Argentinian writer <strong>César Aira</strong> and Mexican <strong>Cristina Rivera Garza</strong> into the frame. Writing in Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, literary editor Rasmus Landström puts his money on this year’s winner carrying a Hungarian passport: Krasznahorkai or his countryman <strong>Péter Nádas</strong>. “Both have long been sitting on the Nobel pile”, Landström writes. “They both write fairly ‘traditional’ modernist prose and can be categorised as ‘witness literature’. Stable choices, of course – and a bit boring.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e6e90b8f0871610d006bfa" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/emma-loffhagen"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:18:14.515Z">11.18am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">How the Nobel prize in literature is chosen</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Every October, the announcement of the Nobel prize in literature sends ripples through the literary world — but how does the Swedish Academy actually choose a winner?</p> <p>It begins months earlier, when the Nobel committee, made up of a small group of writers, sends out nomination forms to a select network of individuals and organisations. Those invited to nominate include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Members of the 18-person Swedish Academy, as well as similar literary academies around the world</p></li> <li><p>Professors of literature and linguistics at universities and colleges</p></li> <li><p>Previous Nobel laureates in literature</p></li> <li><p>Presidents of national authors’ societies representing their countries’ literary production</p></li> </ul> <p>Once nominations come in, the committee filters and refines the list, narrowing it first to 15–20 names, and then to a final shortlist of five.</p> <p>Over the following months, Academy members read the nominees’ works in depth. In September, they hold their annual discussions and debates. Finally, in early October, the Academy gathers to vote.</p> <p>To be awarded the Nobel prize in literature, a candidate must receive more than half of the votes cast. The result is kept strictly confidential until the official announcement – one of the most anticipated moments in the global literary calendar.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:22:06.058Z">at 11.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68e77ad08f08e1d65d2a5cbc" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/emma-loffhagen"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:12:30.344Z">11.12am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Bookies’ favourites: Can Xue and Krasznahorkai tied at the top</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>As the 2025 Nobel prize in literature approaches, betting markets are pointing to a tight race.

The book won the Man Booker International prize in 2016, making Han the first Korean author to receive the award.</p>    <p>Her work is often described as poetic, precise and quietly devastating, combining spare prose with searing emotional depth. Themes of trauma, collective memory and the search for dignity in the face of brutality run through much of her writing, shaped in part by the legacy of South Korea’s turbulent political history.</p> <p>Han grew up in Gwangju, the site of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, an event that would profoundly influence her later work. In Human Acts, she turned to this history directly, crafting a devastating portrait of the aftermath of state violence through multiple interwoven voices.</p> <p>Over the years, she has explored grief, language and identity in works such as The White Book and Greek Lessons, with the latter shortlisted for the International Booker prize in 2023.</p> <p>Han’s Nobel win in 2024 was largely unexpected – the bookies had her at 30/1 – but widely celebrated as a landmark moment for Korean literature on the world stage. The Swedish Academy praised her “subtle, elliptical narratives that illuminate the fragile dignity of the individual amid collective trauma.”</p> <p>Read an interview with Han <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/01/i-want-to-be-hopeful-nobel-prize-winning-novelist-han-kang-on-the-crisis-in-south-korea">here</a>.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:19:13.924Z">at 11.19am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68e68c758f08e1d65d2a552a" class="block is-summary" data-block-contributor="profile/ella-creamer"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-09T10:01:40.316Z">11.01am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Opening summary</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Welcome to the Guardian’s coverage of the Nobel prize in literature.</p> <p>The biggest day in the book world’s calendar has arrived: today, the next Nobel laureate in literature will be announced.</p> <p>Could it be <strong>Can Xue</strong>, the Chinese avant garde author who has been the bookies’ favourite several years running?
