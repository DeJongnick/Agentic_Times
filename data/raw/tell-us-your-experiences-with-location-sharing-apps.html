<p>Location sharing apps and services have made it easier than ever to keep tabs on our friends and partners. For some, it is a quick and convenient way to keep loved ones updated on changing whereabouts – but others find such technology intrusive and are reluctant to use it.</p> <p>One recent survey found that nearly <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/newsroom/blogs/when-love-becomes-control">1 in 5 young people believe it’s OK to track their partner whenever they want</a>. With this in mind, we want to hear about your experiences of sharing your location with other adults in your life, whether that’s friends or partners – and, of course, how you feel about having your own location tracked in return. Does having someone able to view your location at all times make you feel safer – or does it feel like surveillance? Has it proved useful, or has it caused problems in your relationships? Either way, tell us about it below.</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="dbaf326a-f5b3-4b2f-a8f2-b02e43da2856" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <h2><strong>This Community callout closed on 31 July 2025.</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>You can see the article that included respondents to this callout <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/24/inside-the-rise-of-couple-location-sharing">here</a>.</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>You can contribute to open Community callouts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong></p></li> </ul>
