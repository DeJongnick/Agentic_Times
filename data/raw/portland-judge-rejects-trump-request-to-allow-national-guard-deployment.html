<p>A federal judge in Portland, Oregon, on Friday rejected the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s request to immediately lift her order blocking the deployment of federalized national guard troops to the city, saying that she would decide the matter by Monday.</p> <p>The hearing in Portland and one in Washington DC are the latest in a head-spinning array of lawsuits and overlapping rulings prompted by Trump’s push to send the military into Democratic-run cities despite fierce resistance from mayors and governors. Troop deployment remains blocked in the Chicago area, where all sides are waiting to see whether the US supreme court intervenes to allow it.</p> <p>The Portland district court judge Karin Immergut had previously issued two temporary restraining orders blocking the deployment of national guards troops there, in response to a persistent but small protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office.</p> <p>Her first order, blocking the deployment of 200 troops from the Oregon national guard, said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> had exceeded his authority by taking federal control of the troops based on his claim that the city was in a state of war-like rebellion. Trump’s assessment, Immergut ruled, was “simply untethered to the facts”.</p> <p>When Trump responded to that order by sending 200 troops from California’s national guard to Oregon, and threatened to send 400 more from Texas, Immergut determined it was an attempt to evade her order, and issued a second order barring the deployment of troops from anywhere in the country to Portland.</p> <p>Immergut’s first order was lifted on Monday by a three-judge panel of the ninth circuit court of appeals, over the strong dissent of the only judge on the panel who lives in Portland. But because the government never appealed Immergut’s second order, it remains in effect and the deployment of troops remains blocked until she decides whether to lift or modify it in response to the appeals court ruling.</p> <p>At a virtual hearing on Friday, Immergut cited two reasons for her to delay lifting the second injunction. The first was that the appeals court did not address a central fact in her second order: that she had issued it in part because the government responded to her first order by attempting to evade it. The second was that the ninth circuit appeals court is currently considering a call from one of its judges to rehear the appeal of her first order before a larger panel of 11 judges.</p> <p>Later on Friday, the ninth circuit appeals court paused the lifting of Immergut’s first order until next Tuesday evening, to give the court time to decide whether to rehear that case. The effect of that pause is that Trump will remain blocked by the courts from deploying troops to Portland for at least another four days.</p> <p>In Washington DC, a US district judge, Jia Cobb, a nominee of Joe Biden, was hearing arguments on Friday on a request from Brian Schwalb, the District of Columbia attorney general, for an order that would remove more than 2,000 guard members from Washington streets.</p> <p>In August, Trump issued an executive order declaring a crime emergency in the district – though the Department of Justice itself says violent crime there is at a 30-year low.</p> <p>Within a month, more than 2,300 guard troops from eight states and the district were patrolling under the army secretary’s command. Trump also deployed hundreds of federal agents to assist them.</p> <p>It is unclear how long the deployments will last, but attorneys from Schwalb’s office said troops were likely to remain in Washington through at least next summer.</p> <p>“Our constitutional democracy will never be the same if these occupations are permitted to stand,” they wrote.</p> <p>Government lawyers said Congress empowered the president to control the DC national guard’s operation. They argued that Schwalb’s lawsuit was a frivolous “political stunt” threatening to undermine a successful campaign to reduce violent crime in Washington.</p> <p>Although the emergency period ended in September, more than 2,200 troops remain. Several states told the Associated Press they would bring their units home by 30 November, unless their deployment is extended.</p> <p>Among the states that sent troops to the district was West Virginia. A civic organization called the West Virginia Citizen Action Group says the governor, Patrick Morrisey, exceeded his authority by deploying 300 to 400 guard members to support Trump’s efforts there.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/democratic-senators-ice-raids-schools">Democratic senators call on education department to stop ICE raids by schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morrisey has said West Virginia “is proud to stand with President Trump”, and his office has said the deployment was authorized under federal law. The state attorney general’s office has asked Richard D Lindsay, a Kanawha county circuit court judge, to reject the case, saying the group has not been harmed and lacks standing to challenge Morrisey’s decision.</p> <p>Lindsay heard some arguments on Friday before continuing the hearing to 3 November to give the state time to focus more on whether Morrisey had the authority to deploy the guard members.</p> <p>“I want that issue addressed,” Lindsay said.</p> <p>April Perry, a district judge, on Wednesday blocked guard deployment to the Chicago area until a case in her court is decided or the US supreme court intervenes. Perry previously blocked the deployment for two weeks through a temporary restraining order.</p> <p>Attorneys representing the federal government said they would agree to extend the order, but would also continue pressing for an emergency order from the supreme court that would allow for the deployment.</p> <p>Lawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked the supreme court to continue to block the deployment, calling it a “dramatic step”.</p>
