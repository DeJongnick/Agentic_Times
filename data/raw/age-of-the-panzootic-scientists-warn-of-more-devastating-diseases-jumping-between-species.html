<p>Bird flu poses a threat that is “unique and new in our lifetime” because it has become a “‘panzootic” that can kill huge numbers across multiple species, experts warn. For months, highly pathogenic bird flu, or H5N1, has been circulating in dairy farms, with dozens of human infections reported among farm workers. It has now jumped into more than <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10902543/">48 species</a> of mammals, from bears to dairy cows, causing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/04/forgotten-epidemic-with-over-280-million-birds-dead-how-is-the-avian-flu-outbreak-evolving">mass die-offs</a> in sea lions and elephant seal pups. Last week, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/06/first-human-death-bird-flu-louisiana">first person in the US died</a> of the infection.</p> <p>This ability to infect, spread between, and kill such a wide range of creatures has prompted some scientists to call H5N1 a “panzootic”: an epidemic that leaps species barriers and can devastate diverse animal populations, posing a threat to humans too. As shrinking habitats, biodiversity loss and intensified farming create perfect incubators for infectious diseases to jump from one species to another, some scientists say panzootics could become one of the era’s defining threats to human health and security.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>It is really hard for infectious diseases to stop being specialists and move over into a new species.

[It’s] unique and new in our lifetime and memory.”</p> <p>Ed Hutchinson from the MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research says: “It is really hard for infectious diseases to effectively stop being specialists and move over into a new species. So when that happens, it is striking and concerning.”</p> <p>The impacts on biodiversity can be huge. Bird flu has led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/13/bird-flu-uk-seabird-numbers-h5n1-great-skua-gannets">“catastrophic” declines</a> in seabird populations, with millions of wild birds killed.

Most recently, a man in Louisiana died after being exposed to a combination of a non-commercial back-yard flock and wild birds. Since March last year, 66 confirmed bird flu infections in humans have been reported in the US, but previous cases have been mild. So far, there is no evidence it is spreading between humans, and that is what experts are keeping a close eye on.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/21/humans-to-push-further-into-wildlife-habitats-across-more-than-50-of-land-by-2070-study-aoe">Three-quarters of emerging diseases</a> can be passed between animals and humans. This matters in terms of mapping them and protecting people, researchers say.</p> <p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9707580/">Some researchers argue</a> that Covid-19 could be an example of a panzootic because it has infected more than 58 non-human species, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html">including</a> deer, mink and even snow leopards (although unlike bird flu, it does not effectively spread between them and kill them, so does not fit the traditional definition).</p> <p>“We are being overwhelmed by the number of animal species which are susceptible to [Covid-19] infection,” researchers have said.</p> <p>Identifying the virus that causes Covid-19 as a potential panzootic could have resulted in active surveillance in animals, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9707580/">researchers say</a>, and the earlier development of vaccines.</p> <p>Scientists also warn that cross-species pandemics are on the rise. “There is a fair body of work now demonstrating that most human viruses are zoonotic (ie of animal origin),” says Michelle Wille, a senior research fellow at the Centre for Pathogen Genomics at the University of Melbourne.</p>    <p>Mark Honigsbaum, a medical historian and author of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/23/the-pandemic-century-one-hundred-years-panic-hysteria-mark-honigsbaum-review-riveting">Pandemic Century</a>, says: “Why are they becoming more frequent? Well, the simple answer is, it’s because of the way we humans settle and colonise larger and larger areas of the planet.”</p> <p>Biodiversity loss is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/09/biodiversity-loss-is-biggest-driver-of-infectious-disease-outbreaks-says-study#:~:text=Biodiversity%20loss%20is%20the%20biggest,they%20often%20originate%20in%20wildlife.">the leading driver</a> of infectious disease outbreaks, as habitat decline and industrialised farming place people in close proximity with other species. Humans have already transformed or occupied <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2023483118">more than 70%</a> of the world’s land. Since the 20th century, the most significant driver of this transformation of the way we use land has been the “livestock revolution”. The number of food animals and the amount they produce has increased rapidly to feed growing populations.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/19/bird-flu-zoos-endangered-animals-captive-species-lions-tigers-cheetahs-virus">Bird flu sweeps through zoos with ‘grave implications’ for endangered animals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Deforestation and climate breakdown also force humans and animals into close contact, as wildlife is pushed into smaller spaces.

Honigsbaum says: “We are going to see more of these outbreaks, and it’s only just a matter of time before one of them causes another pandemic.”</p> <p>“I don’t see those risks going away,” says Hutchinson, but adds that the risks could be reduced. “We increasingly have an understanding – if not a fantastic, practical setup – of what we could do to start reducing some of those risks. That’s my attempt at a moment of hope.”</p> <p><em>Find more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/the-age-of-extinction">age of extinction coverage here</a>, and follow the biodiversity reporters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/phoebe-weston">Phoebe Weston</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrick-greenfield">Patrick Greenfield</a> in the Guardian app for more nature coverage</em></p>
