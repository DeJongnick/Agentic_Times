  <p>The first day of <strong>Antoinette Lattouf</strong> v the ABC has wrapped up without the journalist finishing her cross-examination.</p> 
  <p>She will return to the witness box on Tuesday morning; and a cross-examination of her psychiatrist, Dr Nigel Strauss, will follow. </p> 
  <p>Also scheduled for Tuesday is outgoing ABC managing director <strong>David Anderson</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Steve Ahern</strong>, who hired Lattouf for the casual role when he was acting head of capital city networks, will appear on Thursday after a full-day of evidence on Wednesday from content chief <strong>Chris Oliver-Taylor</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Former ABC chair <strong>Ita Buttrose</strong> will give evidence on Friday morning.</p> 
  <p>Among the evidence heard on Monday was that advice from the ABC’s acting editorial director <strong>Simon Melkman</strong> was sought by the executive after the ABC received a large number of complaints about its decision to appoint Lattouf as a casual radio host.</p>

  <p><strong>Jo Haylen disappears from summit speaker list</strong></p> 
  <p>Embattled New South Wales transport minister <strong>Jo Haylen</strong> has disappeared from the lineup of a key planning summit in Sydney on Tuesday, as criticism mounts over her use of a taxpayer-funded ministerial driver for a private trip. </p> 
  <p>Scrutiny of Haylen’s activity has been building after the Daily Telegraph reported that she had summoned a taxpayer-funded ministerial driver from Sydney to near Newcastle on the Australia Day long weekend, to chauffeur her and friends – including housing minister <strong>Rose Jackson</strong> – to and from a long lunch at a Hunter Valley winery.</p> 
  <p>Using a ministerial driver for private travel is permitted as a benefit ministers are entitled to, but while Haylen did not break any rules in summoning the driver for what turned out to be a 446km round trip, premier <strong>Chris Minns </strong>on Monday said it was a bad look for his government.</p> 
  <p>While Minns has stopped short of sacking Haylen from her portfolio, he has vowed to tighten the rules to ban purely private travel. Haylen has also apologised for the trip and promised to repay the costs.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, on Monday afternoon, the <strong>Committee for Sydney </strong>released an updated speaker lineup for its annual Sydney Summit. </p> 
  <p>Haylen, who had been included on earlier versions of the lineup, was absent from the finalised running order. </p> 
  <p>Guardian Australia has contacted Haylen for comment.</p>

  <p><strong>Alleged antisemite lived in Jewish-run council home</strong></p> 
  <p>A young homeless man who was living in Jewish-run crisis accommodation will remain behind bars after allegedly yelling out antisemitic abuse at a woman while he was on bail, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p><strong>Wendell Mumbulla</strong> was arrested at Jewish House in Bondi just after midday on Sunday after a woman flagged down patrolling police attached to a strike force set up after a spate of antisemitic incidents.</p> 
  <p>The 21-year-old, who was a resident in the short-term housing in Sydney’s east, allegedly yelled the intimidating slurs at the woman just before 8am.</p> 
  <p>He was arrested and taken to Newtown police station, where he was charged with stalking and intimidation with the intent of physical or mental harm.</p> 
  <p>Mumbulla was also charged with property damage over an unrelated incident and breach of bail.</p> 
  <p>Prosecutor <strong>Alexandra Tomasetti</strong> opposed his application for bail on Monday, saying the rise in antisemitic incidents had raised community expectations for tough penalties.</p> 
  <p>She told Newtown local court:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>[There is] significant concern to the community.</em></p> 
   <p><em>There’s certainly discussion around expectations in how these matters are to be dealt with (and) a custodial sentence is likely.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Defence lawyer Matthew Allen said the young man was on the verge of finding suitable housing after being homeless for some time.</p> 
  <p>Mumbulla’s father died at a young age and his mother was an alcoholic, Allen added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The instructions I’ve gathered reveal a long history of disadvantage.</em></p> 
   <p><em>[Bail would] allow him to continue to work on himself as he is on the cusp of being able to achieve something for himself.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Allen agreed he did not have a bail address for the man as he “could not return to the accommodation where the alleged offences occurred”.</p>

  <p><strong>Extremist groups tipped to sidestep terror sanctions</strong></p> 
  <p>Neo-nazi and white supremacist groups are likely to quickly shift their approach in the face of counter-terrorism sanctions aimed at curbing radicalisation and cracking down on hate, an expert has said.</p> 
  <p>Terrorgram, an online network for neo-Nazis that advocates acts of violence, has been hit with counter-terrorism sanctions by the federal government in response to escalating anti-Semitic attacks in Australia.</p> 
  <p>The sanctions make it a criminal offence to use or deal with Terrorgram’s assets, under the threat of up to 10 years in jail and hefty fines. It is the first time Australia has imposed counter-terrorism financing sanctions on an online entity.</p> 
  <p><strong>Michael Zekulin</strong>, who researches terrorism and counter-terrorism at the Australian National University, said the situation wasn’t static and groups were constantly evolving.</p> 
  <p>Dr Zekulin said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Anytime you look to nullify or sort of constrain the use of one system, they simply find ways to bypass that, that’s the challenge.</em></p> 
   <p><em>You’re continuously chasing these groups as they move around from place to place and they learn and they sort of understand what’s coming and they try to react to that.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Greens to back hate crimes bill with amendments</strong> </p> 
  <p>The Greens will support the Albanese government’s hate crimes bill if amendments are made to include additional protection – including for people with disabilities.</p> 
  <p>The bill, which was introduced by the attorney general, <strong>Mark Dreyfus</strong>, last September, expands the existing offence of urging violence and establishes new offences of threatening to use force or violence against groups or individual members of a group.</p> 
  <p>The party will move amendments – in line with recommendations under the bill’s Senate inquiry report – to include disability as a protected attribute in hate symbols offences, extend protection to associates of protected groups, and update language around gender and sexuality.</p> 
  <p>Senator <strong>Mehreen Faruqi</strong>, deputy leader of the Greens and spokesperson for anti-racism, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The Greens will support Labor’s Hate Crimes Bill as it ensures stronger </em><em>protections</em><em> for vulnerable and targeted groups. It is a considered piece of legislation which is a step towards combating hate.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The Greens will continue to call for a national Human Rights Act, for the government to urgently and fully fund the implementation of the National Anti-Racism Framework to tackle all forms of racism, and for investment in responses to hate that are grassroots and community-led.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Lattouf questioned on ‘controversy’ of social media posts</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Antoinette Lattouf</strong> has been asked a number of questions by the ABC’s barrister <strong>Ian Neil SC </strong>about whether she was aware that her public social media posts about the Israel Gaza war would be considered controversial.</p> 
  <p>The posts were put online by Lattouf before she was employed as a casual presenter by the ABC’s local radio division in December 2023.</p> 
  <p><em>Did you know that the reports and opinions of Human Rights Watch are controversial among those sections of the Australian community who do not share the view that the State of Israel is guilty of apartheid?</em></p> 
  <p>Lattouf said it “may be” controversial.</p> 
  <p>Neil quoted an article Lattouf had written in 2022 for the Sydney Morning Herald in which she said “journalists should avoid anything that cast doubt on impartiality”.</p> 
  <p>Lattouf said that article was in reference to an ABC news presenter who had a different standard impartiality because she was hosting an ABC news program whereas she was on ABC local radio.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I was on ABC local [radio] in a Christmas festive program talking about cats on the Sydney to Hobart and Michael Bublé music.</em></p> 
   <p><em>So I don’t think the two are comparable, that is why I say it depends on the context.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Australia facing heatwave conditions in several states</strong></p> 
  <p>Some places in the south-east of the country are already heading into the mid 30s and even above 40C amid heatwave conditions.</p> 
  <p>Here were some of the temperatures from the Bureau of Meteorology, when last checked:</p> 
  <p>Temperatures in Melbourne were still climbing at 2pm, when the city recorded 35.5C. Meanwhile, the hottest town in the state was currently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/16/adelaide-and-other-sa-towns-hit-40c-before-10am-as-december-record-forecast-to-tumble-in-nsw">Walpeup</a>, which recorded 39.9C at 1:50pm.</p>

  <p><strong>Albanese spruiks ‘positive agenda’ ahead of parliament’s resumption</strong> </p> 
  <p>The PM confirms it will be a “busy couple of weeks” for Labor as parliament returns on Tuesday but he is “optimistic” Australians will respond well to a “positive agenda”.</p> 
  <p>He gives a “shout out” to the education minister, who has now secured deals with six of states and territories on fully funding public schools. Just Queensland and New South Wales are yet to sign on, though Albanese flags “we’ll get them there, I’m sure”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is so important, and so important for the students … because that’s how we compete in the 21st century. So, early childhood learning. Schools. TAFE. Universities accord. All of this fits together with how we build Australia’s future. Along with childcare, the reform we’ve done there, the biggest reforms in aged care in this century - all about building Australia’s future, as well as support for manufacturing …</p> 
   <p>All of these things fit in together. And this two weeks we have to progress some of this - we’ll legislate on three days of Child Care Subsidy, making free Tafe permanent, production tax credits for critical minerals and rare earths, keeping the NBN in public hands … and the response to the Robodebt Royal Commission. So a busy couple of weeks …</p> 
   <p>But I’m optimistic that Australians will respond to a positive agenda with fully costed policies - ones that build on the foundations we’ve built this term, but builds on that for the better Australia that we need to create - and one that we are busy working on each and every day.</p> 
   <p><strong>So welcome back everyone, I look forward to the next fortnight and beyond. Good on you.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>PM says voters ‘couldn’t find a more stark choice’ between Labor and Coalition</strong></p> 
  <p>“You’ll be worse off under <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>” is a phrase you’re likely going to hear quite a bit in the coming weeks – forming the tagline of a Labor advertising campaign ahead of the federal election.</p> 
  <p><strong>Albanese</strong> continues on cost of living relief, stating you “couldn’t find a more stark choice” that Australians will face in the coming months between Labor and the Coalition.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Labor providing that cost-of-living support, building Australia’s future for the long-term - where are the future jobs, future industries, going to come from? - and a Coalition saying, under <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> - saying themselves - that they want to go back.</p> 
   <p><strong>They want to go back, and being worse off under Peter Dutton.</strong> Now, we know that they opposed all of our cost-of-living measures. They opposed energy bill relief. They opposed cheaper childcare. They opposed free Tafe and think that people don’t value it. They, of course, most starkly, opposed our tax cuts for every single Australian taxpayer. </p> 
   <p>And we know, as well, that they opposed wages increasing. They wanted low wages to be a key feature of their economic architecture. But, having waited three years for a cost-of-living measure, they’ve come up with one.</p> 
   <p>And it’s a doozy, this one...! They don’t want workers to get a tax cut, but they do want bosses to get a free lunch. And that is the big distinction. And they want workers to pay for it … there’s about four million different businesses registered, sole traders - <strong>$20,000 a pop for people to engage in meals, entertainment, liaisons at golf courses, karaoke nights, weekends away - who knows what it would be?</strong> What we know is that $20,000 would be paid for by people who will never get that opportunity. And we know, as well, that they didn’t put forward any costing of it.</p>

   <p>I think the hard work this group have done [Labor] in making sure that we provided cost-of-living relief for people who are most in need in a way that helped to put that downward pressure on inflation – rather than what some of the economics orthodoxy would suggest we do – which is not worry about what the impact of [what] the economy was, as if the statistics weren’t about people.</p>

  <p><strong>BoM predicts Queensland flood waters to remain for days</strong></p> 
  <p>Senior meteorologist at the BoM, <strong>Dean Narramore</strong>, says major flood levels are likely to remain for several days in northern Queensland as the state continues to grapple with wild weather.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on ABC News earlier, he said rainfall over the past three days had been “massive”, with 800-900mm hitting Townsville alonel.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is a huge amount of rainfall to fall in three days and we are talking … nine months worth of rainfall in just a short space of time.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said emergency services continued to keep their eyes on Ingham and Townsville, with threats of rainfall moving onshore into the afternoon and evening bringing an additional 50 to 100mm in some areas.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It will take a few days all of the river water to flow down so we will maintain these long duration major flood levels at certain locations in the lower catchments … the problem is additional thunderstorms, not to the levels we have seen but still 50-100mm over a 24-hour period can lead to holding that level or even rising it slowly in the coming days.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW ministers made ‘massive error of judgment’, says Minns</strong></p> 
  <p>New South Wales premier <strong>Chris Minns</strong> has conceded two of his senior ministers made a “massive error of judgment” in calling on a taxpayer-funded driver to transport them to a private lunch, but has shot down calls to sack them.</p> 
  <p>Criticism has been mounting on the actions of transport minister <strong>Jo Haylen</strong>, after the Daily Telegraph reported that she had summoned a taxpayer-funded ministerial driver from Sydney to near Newcastle on the Australia Day long weekend, to chauffeur her and friends – including housing minister <strong>Rose Jackson</strong> – to and from a long lunch at a Hunter Valley winery.</p> 
  <p>Using a ministerial driver for private travel is permitted as a benefit ministers are entitled to, but while Haylen did not break any rules in summoning the driver for what turned out to be a 446km round trip, Minns said it was a bad look for his government.<br>Minns said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I want to make it clear that that trip should not have taken place, the NSW ministerial driver should not have been used for that purely private function.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>This was a massive error of judgment on behalf of those two ministers, I’ve made it very clear to them personally that I regard it as a major error. It gives the government a bad reputation and I think that many people in the community would be very, very unhappy with the actions of my government.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">National Australia Bank cuts fixed-interest mortgage rates</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>NAB has become the first big bank to cut fixed-interest mortgage rates, after challenger Macquarie, as expectations of an impending Reserve Bank rate cut grow, AAP reports.</p> 
  <p>Rate tracking by comparison site Canstar shows NAB dropped fixed rates by up to 0.25 percentage points for owner-occupiers and up to 0.3 percentage points for investors on Monday.</p> 
  <p>The move is likely to spur competition from other banks to start cutting rates as lenders try to entice customers to fixed mortgages, given <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/finance/lending-indicators/latest-release#housing-finance-detailed-">the latest data</a> shows more than 97% of new loans were variable, Canstar data insights director, <strong>Sally Tindall,</strong> told AAP.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’d hope to see competition really ramp up in that space as we get towards a cash rate cut, and then potentially on to the next one.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Wholesale funding is already starting to ease slightly and traders are pricing in an almost 95% chance the central bank will slash the cash rate by 25 basis points on 18 February, after its next two-day policy meeting.</p> 
  <p>Macquarie was the first lender to cut fixed-rate mortgages in 2025, reducing its one- to three-year fixed-rate mortgages by up to 0.16 percentage points in January.</p> 
  <p>NAB’s cuts bring it into line with Westpac, offering the lowest one-year fixed rate among the big four banks at 6.09%. ANZ is still offering the lowest two- and three-year fixed rates, both at 5.74%.</p>

  <p><strong>Australian dollar plummets as tariffs spook market</strong></p> 
  <p>The Australian dollar has slumped to its lowest level in more than four years as fears grip currency and share markets in response to the US’ new tariff regime.</p> 
  <p>The local currency dropped to below 61.2 US cents on Monday, a level last seen during the pandemic-induced selloff in March 2020.</p> 
  <p>The US president has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-democrats">set in train 25% import taxes for Canada and Mexico</a> across all products other than Canadian energy which will face a 10% tariff. </p> 
  <p>China will also have 10% tariffs, with the new impositions scheduled to start on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>The Australian dollar is viewed as a risk currency and highly exposed to the Chinese economy.</p>

  <p><strong>Advocacy organisation supports axing of Childcare Activity Test</strong></p> 
  <p>The Parenthood has backed the federal government’s planned removal of the Childcare Activity Test.</p> 
  <p>CEO <strong>Georgie Dent</strong> said if removed, 126,000 children from low-income families would be able to attend early childhood education and care, which would be of particular benefit to single-mother-families.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Removing the Activity Test is the most significant step towards creating truly universal early education and care. Five-year-olds around the country are currently heading off to school for the first time, and unfortunately one in five is already developmentally vulnerable. In regional and rural areas it’s closer to 2 in five students. A lack of access to early childhood education has a lot to do with that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Activity Test requires parents to be working, studying or volunteering in order to receive the Child Care Subsidy, with higher subsidies for higher “activity” hours.</p> 
  <p>Dent said this created a catch-22 for many parents, especially single mothers or those in insecure and unpredictable employment.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It can take months to get a childcare place, so you can’t get a job until you have secured childcare, but you can’t afford to secure childcare until you have a job.<br><br>This is entrenching inequity. The families who are being locked out of early childhood education by the Activity Test are overwhelmingly low-income families, single-mother families, and First Nations and culturally diverse families.</p>

  <p>Natural disasters can be particularly difficult in north Queensland, where the highway is often the only way in and out of communities. The state of the road has been a heated political issue.</p>

  <p>The ABC’s editorial director told the broadcaster’s executives that <strong>Antoinette Lattouf</strong> had not breached the ABC’s editorial guidelines early in the week when the journalist was a stand-in host in December 2023, the federal court has heard.</p>

  <p><strong>Lattouf to say she was sacked from ABC ‘because of her political opinions’, court told</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Antoinette Lattouf</strong> will argue she was sacked “because of her political opinions, including her opinions critical of the conduct of the state of Israel in Gaza, and her opinions regarding press coverage of the Gaza conflict”, the federal court has heard in opening statements.</p> 
  <p>It is standing-room only in courtroom 16A and <strong>Justice Darryl Rangiah</strong> has adjourned briefly to try and accommodate more members of the public and media who have turned up to watch.</p> 
  <p>The court heard Lattouf will argue she was sacked following a campaign not by tabloid media but by a group of people which the ABC identified as a pro-Israeli lobby, “a group which quite openly and frankly targeted her because of her opinions in relation to the matters which I have just identified”, Lattouf’s barrister, <strong>Oshie Fagir</strong>, said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The ABC admits that it removed Ms Lattouf from air because of her Instagram post. Its evidence appears to be to the effect that the post embodied some expression of an opinion which was controversial, but even so, it denies Ms Lattouf was removed because of her political opinion.</p> 
   <p>Now the logic of the position is not easily understood, but it appears to boil down to this: an ABC executive, <strong>Christopher Oliver-Taylor</strong>, believed that in re-sharing the post Ms Lattouf breached a direction which he had caused to be given to her.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Returning to the bushfires in Victoria, where firefighters are working to contain a number of blazes amid a three-day heatwave.</p> 
  <p>Properties are feared destroyed in bushfires raging across regional Victoria as the state battles a slew of erratic weather, AAP reports.</p> 
  <p>Residents at Mirranatwa in the Grampians National Park have been urged to leave immediately. Five Watch and Act warnings are currently in place, with residents urged to monitor changing conditions and prepare to leave.</p> 
  <p>They cover Apollo Bay, Cape Horn, Hordern Vale and Cape Otway, and large parts of the Little Desert National Park and the Grampians National Park.</p> 
  <p>The blaze in the Little Desert National Park, about 375km west of Melbourne, was declared contained but broke away on Sunday afternoon.</p> 
  <p>Victorian authorities confirmed they received reports of property losses from a fire near Ouyen, north of the region’s national park, on Sunday night.</p> 
  <p>It is believed two properties have been lost, Premier <strong>Jacinta Allan</strong> confirmed, as the inferno heads west towards Kaniva-Edenhope Road.</p> 
  <p>“Our thoughts are with the community around Hattah in the northwest of the state,” she told reporters in Melbourne’s west on Monday.</p> 
  <p>The Little Desert fire covers 84,000 hectares, while dual fires burning in the Grampians total 46,000 hectares.</p>

  <p>The government came under fire late last year after it was briefed out to journalists that proposals to curb gambling ads wouldn’t be introduced to parliament in 2024 - shortly after communications minister Michelle Rowland had said “we are aiming to have it done this year.”</p> 
  <p>Government ministers gave varying responses as to the delay. Sports minister <strong>Anika Wells</strong> claimed “this wasn’t reform that was ready to go”; while assistant treasury minister <strong>Andrew Leigh</strong> suggested the government’s proposal was finalised, and that the government could “put it to the parliament immediately”.</p> 
  <p>Albanese, on The Daily Aus, denied there had been legislation.</p> 
  <p>“There was legislation that was shelved in November, right?” host <strong>Billi Fitzsimons</strong> asked.</p> 
  <p>Albanese replied: “No.”</p> 
  <p>Fitzsimons pressed: “So you’ve never considered banning gambling ads?”</p> 
  <p>Albanese replied: “No, we’re considering a range of measures, but there has never been legislation.”</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

  <p><strong>PM vows to ‘do more’ on gambling ads</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> has again defended his government’s inaction on curbing gambling advertising, claiming “there has never been legislation” produced by Labor to address the issue but promising “we will do more” on the issue.</p> 
  <p>The prime minister has appeared on a podcast with The Daily Aus, in the latest instalment of both he and <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> seeking to connect with listeners of popular local podcasters. Asked about gambling ads, the PM repeated his usual talking points that Labor had “taken more action on problem gambling than any government since Federation”, listing action on the self-exclusion register Betstop, and banning the use of credit cards.</p> 
  <p>“There’s more to do,” he said, before countering that “there are no ads for poker machine gambling, which is overwhelmingly, overwhelmingly where losses are”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We accept that there’s more to do, and we will do more.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked further about why the government hadn’t taken up the recommendations of late Labor MP <strong>Peta Murphy</strong> to ban ads for sports betting, Albanese replied: “Well, which gambling ads?”</p>

  <p><strong>Ministers get amongst it with the voters of tomorrow</strong></p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, the minister for early childhood education, <strong>Anne Aly</strong>, and the education minister, <strong>Jason Clare</strong>,<strong> </strong>are having a “great time” at a childcare centre in Canberra this morning following the federal government’s announcement to introduce legislation for subsidised care three days a week.</p> 
  <p>Aly said the bill would mean 100,000 more families across Australia would have access to the guaranteed care.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’re … having a great time with some of the littlest Aussies here in Garran and talking to the staff here. When you look at the children here and you watch them play and you see their interactions, you get a bit of an understanding of just how important early childhood education and care can be in children’s lives.</p> 
   <p>Changing the activity test to ensure that there is a three day guarantee means that every family, no matter what their circumstances, and every child, no matter what their background, no matter what their postcode, no matter where they live, and no matter what their parents’ circumstances are, has access to good quality early childhood education and care.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Clare pointed to comments made by <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> on Insiders yesterday that he would cut “wasteful spending”, without announcing the scale until after the election.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>He won’t tell you where the cuts will be. Well, you don’t have to be Einstein to work it out. It’ll be cuts to childcare, cuts to aged care, cuts to Medicare.

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There are payments to support people who need to replace bedding or household goods that have been damaged by water. There are payments to allow people to make safe a home if they are uninsured and their home requires urgent repairs. There are payments for people who’ve been evacuated.</p>

The party says billionaires are spending big to influence the election results.</p> 
  <p>Members will doorknock, fundraise and letterbox, and have rented billboards that say “get billionaires out of politics”, featuring Palmer, Rinehart and media mogul <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Greens democracy spokesperson <strong>Larissa Waters </strong>accused Australia’s richest people of trying to “stop the surge of Greens and independents that have changed the face of our parliament, and elect <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>”.</p>

  <p>The US president has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-democrats">set in train 25% import taxes for Canada and Mexico</a> across all products other than Canadian energy, which will face a 10% tariff. China will also have 10% tariffs, with the new impositions scheduled to start on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>ASX futures point to a sharp fall of about 1.2% when trading commences later this morning. New Zealand’s benchmark index was down about 1.8% after the first few minutes of trading.</p> 
  <p>The incoming tariffs, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/02/trump-tariffs-markets-brace-for-falls-mexico-canada-hit-back">retaliation from targeted nations</a>, are expected to lead to volatile trading this week. Any deal that would mitigate the size or scope of the tariffs could also spark a rebound ahead of the proposed 4 February deadline.</p> 
  <p>Brokerage firm IG said a contraction in global trade and higher inflation was a headwind for equities and a positive for the US dollar and gold.</p> 
  <p>The Australian dollar, which is viewed as a risk currency and highly exposed to the Chinese economy, is trading at 61.65 US cents, the lowest level since mid January.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A major backer of the teal independents has topped the list of political donors ahead of the 2025 election.</p> 
  <p><strong>Robert Keldoulis</strong> and his investment firm Keldoulis Investments Pty Limited donated a combined $1.1m to Climate 200 in 2023-24, according to figures revealed by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on Monday.</p> 
  <p>Visy chairman <strong>Anthony Pratt</strong> (pictured below) was the second biggest donor, handing $1m to Labor.</p> 
  <p><strong>Marcus Catsaras</strong> rounded out the top three, donating just under $1m to Climate 200, the fundraising vehicle that backs the teal independents.</p> 
  <p>Conspicuously absent from the list was billionaire <strong>Clive Palmer</strong>, who has topped the list in recent years after funnelling tens of millions of dollars through his company Mineralogy into his party United Australia Party.</p> 
  <p>Palmer donated $117m ahead of the 2022 election, which delivered just one seat – Victorian <strong>Ralph Babet</strong>’s place in the upper house</p>

  <p>The changes would cap individual donations at $20,000 and limit spending to $800,000 per electorate, or $90m nationally.</p> 
  <p>The donation disclosure threshold would be lowered from $16,300 to $1,000, giving the public a much deeper insight into who is bankrolling the nation’s politicians.</p>

  <p><strong>New Victorian bushfires flare</strong></p> 
  <p>New fires have emerged in the Otways and upper Murray River as firefighters grapple to contain blazes amid a three-day-heatwave.</p> 
  <p>Victoria’s chief fire officer, <strong>Chris Hardman</strong>, told ABC News Breakfast areas of risk remained at the Little Desert and Grampians national park fires, where emergency evacuation warnings have been issued.</p> 
  <p>But he said thunderstorms and dry lightning had caused “a number of new fires” over the weekend in addition to stoking previously contained fires to break their containment lines.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The key areas of risk still are Little Desert, there’s an emergency warning for the Morea area, and certainly for the Mirranatwa area in the Grampians … But more important than that, we are now picking up new fires. There are three fires in the Otways – north of Apollo Bay – so firefighters are working incredibly hard with heavy machinery to get in close to those fires to do everything that they can to contain those fires before they become a problem.</p> 
   <p>And we also had some fires up at … the upper Murray River. <strong>We had some reports of property loss and those losses will be assessed today by firefighters when they can get on the fire grounds in the light of day.</strong></p>

   <p>There are also the risk of flash-flooding in a number of areas … and people need to keep their wits about them. We had 11 swift water rescues last night … and sadly, there was a woman in her 60s who lost her life in Ingham.

  <p>Severe thunderstorms swept across Geelong and Melbourne on Sunday night, bringing lightning, hail and damaging winds. Power was cut to more than 38,000 customers across the state with unplanned outages as of 10.45pm Sunday.</p> 
  <p>But the storms are set to give way to blazing sunshine on Monday, with a forecast top of 39C for Melbourne and Bendigo, 38C for Geelong and 36C for Ballarat.</p> 
  <p>Meteorologists had predicted overnight minimums to stay in the mid to low 20s, heightening the chance of heat exhaustion.</p> 
  <p>Severe heatwave warnings are also in place on Monday across the border in Adelaide and the South Australian regions of Riverland, Upper South East, Murraylands, Mount Lofty Ranges, Lower South East and the Mid North.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW teacher vacancies fall to four-year low</strong></p> 
  <p>Teacher vacancies have dropped by 40% in New South Wales public schools since 2023, new data released by the Minns government has found, ahead of students’ return to the classroom.</p> 
  <p>There are currently 1,294 vacancies in the state’s public schools, a four-year low and a 40% reduction on the same time in 2023. Vacancies peaked at 3,311 in 2022.</p> 
  <p>The NSW premier, <strong>Chris Minns</strong>, said the government had committed to improving teaching conditions.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We respect teachers, and we want them at the front of our classrooms doing what they do best. That is what we committed to before the election and that is what we are continuing work to deliver.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The deputy premier and minister for education and early learning,<strong> Prue Car</strong>, pointed to improved teachers’ pay as leading to a drop in resignations and retirements.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The massive fall in teacher vacancies shows what you can achieve when you actually listen to our dedicated and hardworking teachers and value the life-changing work they do.</p>

  <p><strong>Labor names sites of more study hubs for regional uni students</strong></p> 
  <p>The federal government has announced the sites of 10 additional study hubs, which operate to improve university accessibility to students living in regional Australia.</p> 
  <p>It comes alongside data, released by Labor, that suggests a 32% increase in the past year of students using the existing 43 hubs, which provide campus-style facilities for students completing degrees without leaving their community.</p> 
  <p>Queensland will receive two hubs in Clermont and Moranbah and Hughenden, as will New South Wales at Tumut and Hay and Western Australia at Northam and Kununurra.</p> 
  <p>One hub will be established on Kangaroo Island in South Australia, at Hamilton in Victoria, St Helens in Tasmania and Burnt Pine on Norfolk Island.</p> 
  <p>They are expected to be operational from mid-2025.</p> 
  <p>The minister for education, <strong>Jason Clare</strong>, said outer suburban and regional Australians were underrepresented when it came to university attainment.</p>

  <p><em>Continuing from last post:</em> The higher education sector has faced pressure on multiple fronts over its handling of accusations of antisemitism on campuses and growing concern over university governance.</p> 
  <p><strong>Iain Anderson</strong> said an independent, impartial body was necessary following growing concern around the ability of the regulator, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (Teqsa), to act on complaints, as well as “structural and attitudinal barriers” of universities.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For some time there have been concerns that student complaints aren’t being appropriately dealt with by providers, particularly serious issues like gender-based violence and antisemitism.</p> 
   <p>[Students] feel universities are prioritising their own reputation and issues of profit. We come with … extensive powers to acquire information and publicly shine light on it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The ombudsman’s establishment follows the 2023 release of the <a href="https://www.education.gov.au/australian-universities-accord/resources/accord-interim-report">universities accord interim report</a>, which found sexual assault and harassment on campuses was “affecting the wellbeing of students and staff, and their ability to succeed”, requiring “concerted action”.</p> 
  <p>The latest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/23/distressing-and-confronting-online-sexual-harassment-rises-for-australian-university-students-during-covid">national student safety survey</a>, released in 2022, found one in 20 students had been sexually assaulted since starting university and one in six had reported being sexually harassed.</p> 
  <p>Universities Australia committed to running a new national safety survey in 2023 but nearly a year-and-a-half later no new data had been released.</p>

  <p><strong>National watchdog has ‘wide remit’ to investigate students’ complaints</strong></p> 
  <p>Australia’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/23/national-ombudsman-sexual-assault-universities-australia">first national student watchdog</a> has begun taking official complaints, functioning as the key pillar of an action plan commissioned by the federal government to address student safety concerns.</p> 
  <p>Legislation to establish the watchdog passed parliament with bipartisan support last November, with the watchdog slated to address “a broad range of complaints”, including sexual violence and harassment.</p> 
  <p>The commonwealth ombudsman, <strong>Iain Anderson</strong>, told Guardian Australia he was “very optimistic” about the power of a student watchdog to promote systemic change and improvement in the sector.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Universities should be taking note. It might be a university has no complaints [with the ombudsman] but the fact they know we’re there will induce them to think about own processes and improving them.</p> 
   <p>Just by existing, we’re promoting systemic improvement … Transparency can be a very powerful lever.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Anderson said the watchdog, in addition to handling complaints over safety and welfare, would have a “wide remit” to investigate a host of student issues including racism, course administration, student experience and disability adjustments.</p> 
  <p>If the ombudsman is unsatisfied with the response of universities, he will be able to provide a report to the education minister to be tabled publicly in parliament.</p> 
  <p>“We will see what comes through the door but we can also do our own investigations,” he said, pointing to reports of antisemitism on campuses as an “abhorrent issue” that would receive a key focus.</p>

  <p><strong>New Labor ads swipe at Coalition on cost of living</strong></p> 
  <p>If you weren’t already feeling like it was an election year, Labor has launched a new campaign detailing how Australians will be “worse off” under a federal government headed by <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The ad campaign will be distributed on free-to-air TV, video-on-demand, YouTube and Meta services from this week, going hard on the Coalition’s voting track record towards cost-of-living measures.</p> 
  <p>The ad lists nine cost-of-living measures introduced by the Albanese government and opposed by the Coalition, including cheaper childcare and reducing student loans.</p> 
  <p>Government modelling projects an Australian household with two workers earning average incomes would have been around $7,200 “worse off” under Dutton, based on opposition wages, tax cuts and energy bill reforms.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>More than eight in 10 Australian schools will face a “high climate risk” by 2060, severely impacting the nation’s education system and infrastructure, a new report has forecast.</p> 
  <p>The Zurich-Mandala climate risk index, released on Monday, analysed the risk of the climate crisis across 9,829 primary and secondary schools across Australia for the first time.</p> 
  <p>Two-thirds of schools in Australia currently face high climate risk. The report estimated this would increase to 84% of schools by 2060, under an intermediate climate scenario with 2C of warming.</p> 
  <p>New South Wales and Queensland have the most schools at high risk with 92% and 91% respectively, followed by the ACT and the NT.</p> 
  <p>The report found increased chances of bushfire and hail posed the greatest climate risk to Australia’s schools. Students are projected to experience 34 annual heatwave days by 2060.<br><br>Mandala partner <strong>Dr Adam Triggs</strong> said high classroom temperatures could slow children’s cognitive ability and function.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Perhaps most troubling is how climate risks compound existing inequalities. The same schools already facing socio-educational disadvantage are often those most exposed to climate impacts, creating a double burden for vulnerable communities.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Laws to enshrine the next step in Labor’s plan for universal childcare will be introduced when federal parliament this week, as <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> attempts to leverage the flagship policy to propel his bid for re-election.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://ministers.education.gov.au/anthony-albanese/next-steps-building-universal-education-system">The $426m plan, which the prime minister announced in December,</a> would guarantee the childcare subsidy for three days a week to all families earning up to $530,000 from January 2026.</p> 
  <p>The Coalition and Greens likely won’t allow swift passage of the bill through parliament, meaning it almost certainly won’t pass in what could be the final sitting fortnight before the election.</p> 
  <p>But Labor will push ahead nonetheless in order to highlight a clear point of contrast with the opposition, <a href="https://sarahhenderson.com.au/nothing-but-smoke-and-mirrors-and-no-solutions-for-working-families/">which in December described the childcare announcement as a “desperate pitch to lure voters”</a>.</p> 
  <p>The minister for education, <strong>Jason Clare</strong>, said that “every child has the right to early education … and our Labor government is going to make that possible”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is fundamentally about making sure every child gets a great start in life and start school ready to learn.</p> 
   <p>At the moment the children who need early education the most can’t access it. They are missing out. As a result they start school behind and often never catch up. This will help fix that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Legislation to enshrine fee-free Tafe places, set up tax breaks for critical minerals processing and green hydrogen production and prevent any future sale of the National Broadband Network will also be prioritised in the coming sitting fortnight.</p>

  <p><strong>Lattouf</strong> lost her job after she posted on social media about the Israel-Gaza war, which the ABC said was a breach of editorial policy.</p> 
  <p>The ABC denied she was sacked because she was paid for the full five days of her contract.</p> 
  <p>The Fair Work Commission <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/jun/03/antoinette-lattouf-was-sacked-by-abc-fair-work-commission-finds">found last year she was sacked</a>, triggering her unlawful dismissal case.</p> 
  <p>The ABC has strongly denied Lattouf’s dismissal was the result of outside pressure on the broadcaster, after the Age reported that it had seen <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/secret-whatsapp-messages-show-co-ordinated-campaign-to-oust-antoinette-lattouf-from-abc-20240115-p5exdx.html">a chain of leaked WhatsApp messages</a> showing a campaign from pro-Israel lobbyists to have Lattouf sacked days before her dismissal.</p> 
  <p>The new court documents reveal there is a key difference of opinion over whether Lattouf was told by her ABC radio manager not to post anything about Israel/Palestine on social media or was told to only post factual information, a point the Fair Work Commission made last year.</p> 
  <p>Lattouf claims the post about the situation in Gaza was factual information based on a report from Human Rights Watch.</p> 
  <p>The commission found there was some confusion over whether the manager had advised Lattouf it would be best to make no social media posts at all for the rest of the week or had been “directed” not to make any posts.</p> 
  <p>The commission heard <strong>Oliver-Taylor</strong> had been told on 18 December by <strong>Anderson</strong> that he had received external email complaints about Lattouf’s position on the Israel-Gaza war and asked radio management to “ensure that Antoinette is not and has not been posting anything that would suggest she is not impartial”.</p> 
  <p>“I am concerned her public views may mean that she is in conflict with our own editorial policies … Can we also advise why we selected Antoinette as stand in host?”</p>
