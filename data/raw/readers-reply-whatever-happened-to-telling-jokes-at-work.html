<p>Whatever happened to sharing jokes in the workplace (or even among friends)? It used to be commonplace; not any more. <em>Nigel Parsons, London</em></p> <p><em>Send new questions to </em><strong><a href="mailto:nq@theguardian.com">nq@theguardian.com</a></strong><em>.</em></p> <h2>Readers reply</h2> <p>You started working from home? <strong>SpoilheapSurfer</strong></p> <p>Time was that you heard a joke and you could retell it because the chances were that people hadn’t heard it. Now that everything is everywhere all at once, people have heard everything already – and there is nothing worse (well, comparatively) than starting a joke and people immediately saying they’ve heard it, or jumping in with the punchline. <strong>Goldgreen</strong></p> <p>Have you ever come across an even vaguely funny joke about AI? This is about the best I’ve heard. A machine-learning algorithm walks into a bar. The bartender asks: “What will you have?” The algorithm says: “What’s everyone else having?” Gosh, what laughs to look forward to. <strong>woodworm20</strong></p> <p>Nowadays it opens you up to way too much legal liability, so nobody would dare. <strong>ElCommentario</strong></p> <p>Plenty of jokes at my work. If you’re incapable of judging whether a joke is work-appropriate, maybe just stick to cheese puns or whatever? Then you’ll brie fine. <strong>pickwick</strong></p> <p>I was going to donate blood today, but they ask way too many personal questions. Like: “Whose blood is this?” and: “Why’s it in a bucket?” <strong>Cartozzz</strong></p> <p>My workplaces jokes are so good that HR ask me to repeat them in their office. <strong>AlexNFFC</strong></p> <p>I once went to a lecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Muir">Frank Muir</a> in which he suggested all jokes are invented on the London Stock Exchange and then travel the country, gradually morphing into regional variations. Today, there is nothing funny whatsoever about the finance industry, so the great humour recirculation current has stopped. <strong>Erbium</strong></p>
