<p>Leicester have confirmed the appointment of Martí Cifuentes to fill the vacancy left by Ruud van Nistelrooy after relegation from the Premier League last season.</p> <p>The Spaniard left QPR last month having been placed on gardening leave in April at the tail end of a Championship campaign that resulted in a 15th-placed finish in the 24-club division. Rangers finished seven points above the relegation places and the 43-year-old Cifuentes left by mutual consent last month.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/15/its-not-fair-crystal-palace-fans-march-in-protest-at-demotion-from-europa-league">‘It’s not fair’: Crystal Palace fans march in protest at demotion from Europa League</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Foxes, who also spoke to the former Bournemouth and Wolves head coach Gary O’Neil and the former Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder, said in a statement that they opted for Cifuentes because of his “modern, progressive footballing philosophy”.</p> <p>The club’s hierarchy are understood to see in Cifuentes shades of their former manager Enzo Maresca, who oversaw promotion to the Premier League before leaving for Chelsea.</p> <p>Leicester finished third-bottom in England’s top tier last season with 25 points from 38 matches, and a goal different of -47, the second worst in the Premier League.</p> <p>Cifuentes, who has a three-year contract, told the club’s website: “It’s a great honour to be appointed Leicester City manager.
