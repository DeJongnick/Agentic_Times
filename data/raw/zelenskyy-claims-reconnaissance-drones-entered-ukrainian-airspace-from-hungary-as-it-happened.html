 <h2 class="block-title">Leaked document offers details of EU's thinking on reparations loan for Ukraine</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Brussels</em></p> 
  <p><strong>The European Commission believes it can generate a €140bn interest-free loan for Ukraine based on Russia’s frozen assets without confiscating the funds,</strong> according to a leaked document setting out the plan to make sure the Kremlin pays for its war of aggression.</p> 
  <p><strong>The two-page document seen by the Guardian fleshes out some details</strong> of how the EU could use an estimated €176bn Russian central bank assets currently frozen at Euroclear in Belgium.</p> 
  <p>In a significant move <strong>German chancellor Friedrich Merz has thrown his weight behind an interest-free EU loan</strong> of €140bn to Ukraine that would be ultimately be repaid by Russia once Moscow has paid reparations to Kyiv (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/26/denmark-drone-sightings-airport-russia-ukraine-europe-live-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68d650bb8f081ea00e4fa9ea#block-68d650bb8f081ea00e4fa9ea">10.54</a>).</p> 
  <p><strong>The loan is based on the idea Russia’s frozen central bank assets would be used to finance Ukraine’s recovery and or war effort.</strong> But to assuage fears of undermining investor confidence in Euroclear, Russia would remain the owner of the assets.</p> 
  <p>The paper explains the repayments chain in the following way:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“The reparations that Russia would provide to Ukraine would be used to repay the Reparations Loan from the Union, where the Union in turn would repay Euroclear, ensuring that when the sanctions are lifted, Euroclear would have the necessary cash to honour its liability to Russia.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Ukraine would get €140bn</strong>, rather than €176bn, because some of the larger sum is already being used to generate other loans for Ukraine based on the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/08/eu-reaches-deal-on-using-profits-from-russias-frozen-assets-for-ukraine"> interest from the frozen assets.</a> </p> 
  <p>EU member states would be on the hook to Euroclear if Ukraine failed to repay the loan. But <strong>EU officials are looking to ensure that situation never materialises.</strong></p> 
  <p>The commission says the EU would not lift sanctions against Russia – now a wide-ranging set of measures targeting swathes of the Russian economy and more than 2,500 people – unless Moscow agreed to pay Kyiv reparations.</p> 
  <p>And <strong>to avoid Hungary wielding a veto that could see EU sanctions fall without agreement on reparations, the commission has proposed a new legal device</strong> that would see the sanctions guaranteed by a majority vote, rather than consensus.</p> 
  <p>The sanctions currently have to be renewed every six months by unanimity giving Hungary’s Russia-friendly government a big card to play.</p> 
  <p><strong>EU law allows sanctions to be agreed by a weighted majority rather than unanimity if the EU’s “strategic interest” is at stake.</strong> It is not hard to see that EU leaders will agree that not being liable for tens of billions of debt caused by Russia is in their strategic interest.</p> 
  <p>As the paper puts it, this device to guarantee the sanctions “<em>would significantly reduce the risks arising from the guarantees and make it highly unlikely that the guarantees would be called against the wish of the guarantors”.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">EU 'needs to develop additional capabilities' which 'we lack at the moment' to fight drones, EU defence minister says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Kubilius </strong>says that looking at Ukraine’s experiences, <strong>it is clear that the EU “needs to develop additional capabilities, which we perhaps lack at the moment.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He says <strong>the task begins with “detection capabilities”</strong> including a range of radars, acoustic sensor and other equipment to detect all drones, including smaller aircraft flying at low altitudes.</p> 
  <p>He stresses that should be “our first priority.”</p> 
  <p>He says that <strong>the conversation then moves to how to take down drones</strong>, starting with electronic warfare, including very effective jamming being used by Ukraine, or more direct with drone interceptors.</p> 
  <p>“We need to look how we can build those capacities in our defence lines,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He adds that then t<strong>here are also options of using “traditional, classical artillery”</strong> against drones, which Ukrainians “use in a very effective way.”</p> 
  <p>He says that there is need to be clever about it, because otherwise you use “missiles that maybe cost a million to kill a drone that costs 10,000 [euros].”</p> 
  <p><strong>Häkkänen </strong>says “there is a lot of equipment in the market, so we just have to assess what kind of equipment” is needed.</p> 
  <p>He stresses that <strong>Ukrainians are “key” and have “best knowledge in Europe”</strong> on what works and what doesn’t.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Romaina suggested it could partner with Ukraine to build drones under a new European Union defence funding mechanism</strong>, noting that it will be at least seven years before the country has a multi-layered air defence system, a government source told Reuters.</p>

  <p>“Until then, <strong>defence will be asymmetrical with huge anti-aircraft costs which could only be covered on a Nato level.“</strong></p> 
  <p>The source says <strong>Romania was in talks with Ukraine, whose drone technology has been “battle tested at large scale” to produce drones</strong> in a project to be funded via the EU’s SAFE rearmament initiative.</p> 
  <p><strong>Romania will have €16.6bn ($19.4bn) available under EU’s SAFE.</strong></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>European culture editor</em></p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>the European Broadcasting Union has confirmed it will hold an online vote in November that could see the Israeli broadcaster Kan expelled from next year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eurovision">Eurovision</a> song contest.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a letter sent to participating broadcasters on Thursday, the EBU president, <strong>Delphine Ernotte Cunci</strong>, wrote <strong>there was an “unprecedented diversity of views” on Israel’s participation in Eurovision, and the issue required “a broader democratic basis”.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a statement, the EBU said: </p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“We can confirm that a letter has been sent from the executive board of the European Broadcasting Union to directors general of all our members informing them that a vote on participation in the Eurovision song contest 2026 will take place at an extraordinary meeting of the EBU’s general assembly to be held online in early November.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The decision comes after several European broadcasters, including those from <strong>Spain</strong>, <strong>the Netherlands, Ireland, Iceland </strong>and<strong> Slovenia</strong>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/16/spain-eurovision-boycott-israel-gaza-war">threatened to boycott the next edition of the world’s largest live music event</a> if Israel was allowed to take part.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump’s overnight threat to impose 100% tariffs on pharmaceuticals from companies not based in the US has been met with fresh uncertainty across Europe.</strong><br><br><strong>The Germans and the EU wide trade body have expressed concern</strong> while <strong>Ireland and Brussels says it remains confident that the 15% tariff rate agreed in July will apply</strong> to European drugs exported to the US.</p> 
  <p>The threat also <strong>brings fresh threats to exports from the UK</strong>, which is still waiting to seal a deal delivering Trump’s pledge to give it “preferential treatment” promised as far back as 8 May, could be snared by any new tariffs.</p> 
  <p><strong>The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations said “urgent discussions” were needed to clarify Trump’s intentions</strong> reiterating its position that tariffs on medicines could “increase costs, disrupt supply chains and prevent patients from getting life saving treatments”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Nathalie Moll</strong>, director general, EFPIA said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“The EU and US already have a trade agreement in place; urgent discussions are needed on how to avoid any tariffs on medicines that harm patients in the EU and the US.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Germany’s VFA trade association said on Friday the US deal could hit Germany-based pharmaceutical businesses hard</strong> and would violate previous transatlantic trade agreements. Around 25% of Germany pharma exports go to the US, worth about €27bn in 2024, it added.<br><br><strong>Ireland and Germany are two of the three EU countries with surplus trading relationships with the US</strong> and both large pharma industries.<br><br>Ireland’s deputy prime minister <strong>Simon Harris</strong> said <strong>the government would be “studying the impact” of the announcement</strong> but stressed that the joint statement on 21 August about the EU US tariff deal “made absolutely clear that any new tariffs announced by the US on pharmaceuticals under its Section 232 investigation would be capped at 15% for pharma products being exported by the EU.” <br><br>EU trade spokesperson <strong>Olof Gill</strong> confirmed this was also the view in Brussels: “This clear all-inclusive 15% tariff ceiling for EU exports represents an insurance policy that no higher tariffs will emerge for European economic operators”.<br><br><strong>The new tariff threat comes just days after the US also opened a section 232 investigation into medical devices</strong> that can include anything from stents for the heart to prosthetic hips, X-ray machines and pacemakers.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>the UK government said it was pressing for clarification over Donald Trump’s threat</strong> to impose new 100% tariff on pharma imports.</p> 
  <p>Trump promised the UK “preferential treatment” on pharma tariffs as far back as May but has yet to deliver on the pledge.”</p> 
  <p>“We know this will be concerning for industry, which is <strong>why we’ve been actively engaging with the US and will continue to do so over the coming days,</strong>” a British government spokesperson said.<br><br>“Sectors such as pharmaceuticals are critical to our economy... so <strong>we will continue to press the US for outcomes that reflect the strength of our relationship</strong> and deliver real benefits for UK industry.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Germany's Merz backs proposals for reparations loan to Ukraine secured against Russian frozen assets</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Brussels</em></p> 
  <p><strong>The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has thrown his weight behind proposals for a loan for Ukraine secured against billions of Russian assets frozen in the EU.</strong></p> 
  <p>In <strong>a significant intervention that could open the door to massive funding for Ukraine,</strong> the German chancellor said “a new impetus” was needed to change Russia’s calculations. </p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3aacc930-9f5e-4558-90f1-62bf47a31cd5">Writing in the Financial Times</a>, <strong>he proposed an interest-free EU loan of €140bn to Ukraine that would ultimately be repaid by Russia, once Moscow has paid reparations to Kyiv.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>France</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>Belgium</strong>, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/14/calls-for-russias-frozen-assets-held-in-belgium-to-be-used-in-rebuilding-ukraine">€183bn of Russian central bank assets are frozen at Brussels-based Euroclear</a>, <strong>have long resisted calls from central and eastern European countries to seize Russian funds</strong> that were immobilised soon after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </p> 
  <p>To break the deadlock, <strong>the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen earlier this month proposed a reparations loan to Ukraine secured against the Russian billions,</strong> which would remain untouched. Ukraine would only pay back the loan once Russia pays reparations for the colossal damage inflicted by more than 1,300 days of war.</p> 
  <p>Merz wrote that <strong>Germany remained cautious on confiscating the Russian central bank assets “with good reason” citing international law and the euro’s role as a reserve currency</strong>, but suggested these issues could be circumvented without affecting property rights.</p> 
  <p>The chancellor said <strong>he would discuss the plans with EU leaders next week</strong>, with the aim of getting an agreement on a “legally secure” financial instrument by an EU summit at the end of October.</p> 
  <p>Merz wrote: </p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“In recent years, we have often played it by ear. Now I am advocating the mobilisation of financial resources on a scale that will secure Ukraine’s military resilience for several years.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He stressed that <strong>the funds should be used solely to fund Ukraine’s defence, not general spending</strong>. Other political leaders have argued Russia’s frozen asset should pay for the ever-growing cost of rebuilding Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Merz also suggested <strong>the plan could be agreed by a large majority of EU member states, if unanimity was not possible,</strong> suggesting a way round a possible Hungarian veto.</p> 
  <p>Germany’s intervention is significant, but other member states will need to be convinced. <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/news/belgium-sceptical-of-using-frozen-assets-for-ukraine-reparation-loan/">Belgium has expressed scepticism about the reparations loan idea</a>, while France has previously voiced opposition to proposals to seize the assets.</p> 
  <p>The Belgian and French governments both hold stakes in Euroclear and are concerned about any action against the Russian assets that could trigger legal cases against the Brussels-based financial institution and endanger the status of the euro as a reserve currency.</p>

  <p>She conceded that <strong>the recent events showed “vulnerabilities”</strong> in Denmark’s critical infrastructure, but urged citizens not to give in to “insecurity and division” they were meant to create.</p> 
  <p>“One time it might be drones; another – cyber-attacks, what we call disinformation, influencing elections or conspiracy theories you read online.
