<p>Water at £19 a bottle (‘You’re either going to be a pioneer or a joke’, 28&nbsp;August)(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/28/water-sommeliers-rival-wine-terroir">Meet the water sommeliers: they believe H₂O can rival wine – but would you pay £19 a bottle?, 28 August</a>)? What a load of rubbish. Far better to order a free glass of tap water. At an Open University summer school some years ago, students were invited to take part in a trial. All were given 10 lots of two samples, Nottingham tap water and Highland Spring. There were enough participants over the weeks for a statistical sample. Answer? They could not tell the difference. Incidentally, licensed premises are obliged to provide free tap water on request. Refusing to do would be a breach of their licence condition.<br><strong>Rosalind Clayton</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• Perhaps Joe Rawlins and Gaëlle Radigon, the owners of La Popote restaurant, could consider putting tap water on the menu as “Corporation Pop”, as we called it when I was a child in Manchester. If you wanted it fizzy, just shake it. The omission of Buxton water from&nbsp;their list is a crime.<br><strong>Chris Walters</strong><br><em>Buxton, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>• As a non-drinker, I can readily tell between my Vichy Catalan (my favourite) and my Badoit green bottle or Badoit red bottle (second favourite), all naturally carbonated. Would I pay £19 for a bottle of water I haven’t yet tried? 100%. What’s the difference between this and a fermented grape or a distilled grain? Those who don’t drink alcohol need more of this. Water is not simply just water. And what’s more, it’s good for you.<br><strong>Siân Miller</strong><br><em>Guildford, Surrey</em></p> <p>• Simon Usborne enjoys a water menu at a Cheshire restaurant, but sampling craft water is nothing new. In 1874, Karl Marx was in Karlsbad – still known for its artisan waters – to imbibe spring waters for health reasons. Marx, who liked a pilsner beer, was rather grumpy about it, writing to Engels on 18&nbsp;September 1874 that drinking the water made him irritable.<br><strong>Keith Flett</strong><br><em>Tottenham, London</em></p> <p>• Betteridge’s law of headlines states that if it ends with a question mark, the answer is almost always “no”. The headline on the front cover of last Thursday’s G2 print section is a prime example: “They believe H2O can rival wine – but would you pay&nbsp;£19 for a bottle?”<br><strong>Nick Swallow</strong><br><em>Worminghall, Buckinghamshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
