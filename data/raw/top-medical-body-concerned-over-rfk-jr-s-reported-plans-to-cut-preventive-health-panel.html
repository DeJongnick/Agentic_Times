<p>A top US medical body has <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-press-releases/ama-deeply-concerned-reported-uspstf-changes">expressed</a> “deep concern” to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a> over news reports that the health secretary plans to overhaul a panel that determines which preventive health measures including cancer screenings should be covered by insurance companies.</p> <p>The letter from the American Medical Association comes after the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/rfk-health-screening-panel-members-c308cbb0?mod=hp_lead_pos10">reported</a> on Friday that Kennedy plans to overhaul the 40-year old US Preventive Services Task Force because he regards it as too “woke”, according to sources familiar with the matter.</p> <p>During his second term, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has frequently raged against organizations and government departments that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/trump-woke-dei-culture-wars">he considers too liberal</a> – often without any evidence. The US president, and his cabinet members <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/19/rfk-jr-science-research-cuts">such as Kennedy</a>, have also overseen huge cuts and job losses across the US government.</p> <p>The taskforce is made up of a 16-member panel appointed by health and human services secretaries to serve four-year terms. In addition to cancer screenings, the taskforce issues recommendations for a variety of other screenings including osteoporosis, intimate partner violence, HIV prevention, as well as depression in children.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/19/rfk-jr-science-research-cuts">Health experts raise alarm over RFK Jr’s ‘war on science’ amid mass firings and budget cuts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Writing in its letter to Kennedy on Sunday, the AMA defended the panel, saying: “As you know, USPSTF plays a critical, non-partisan role in guiding physicians’ efforts to prevent disease and improve the health of patients by helping to ensure access to evidence-based clinical preventive services.</p> <p>“As such, we urge you to retain the previously appointed members of the USPSTF and commit to the long-standing process of regular meetings to ensure their important work can be continued without disruption,” it added.</p> <p>Citing Kennedy’s own slogan of “Making America healthy again,” the AMA went on to say: “USPSTF members have been selected through an open, public nomination process and are nationally recognized experts in primary care, prevention and evidence-based medicine. They serve on a volunteer basis, dedicating their time to help reduce disease and improve the health of all Americans – a mission well-aligned with the Make America Healthy Again initiative.”</p> <p>According to the Affordable Care Act, public and private insurance companies must cover any services recommended by the Preventive Services Task Force without cost sharing.</p> <p>In a statement to MedPage Today, a Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson, Andrew Nixon, did not confirm the reports, instead <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/primarycare/preventivecare/116688">saying</a>: “No final decision has been made on how the USPSTF can better support HHS’s mandate to Make America Healthy Again.”</p> <p>Reports of Kennedy’s alleged decision to overhaul the taskforce come after the American Conservative published an essay earlier this month that described the taskforce as advocating for “leftwing ideological orthodoxy”.</p> <p>It went on to accuse the panel of being “packed with Biden administration appointees devoted to the ideological capture of medicine”, warning that the “continued occupation of an important advisory body in HHS – one that has the capacity to force private health insurers to cover services and procedures – by leftwing activists would be a grave oversight by the Trump administration”.</p> <p>In response to the essay, 104 health organizations, including the American Medical Association, issued a separate <a href="https://academyhealth.org/sites/default/files/friends_of_ahrq_uspstf_support_letter_0_0.pdf">letter</a> to multiple congressional health committees in which they urged the committees to “protect the integrity” of the taskforce.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/25/rfk-jr-artificial-food-dye">RFK Jr wants bright artificial dyes out of food.

It’s not good for the health of the nation,” Benjamin said.</p>
