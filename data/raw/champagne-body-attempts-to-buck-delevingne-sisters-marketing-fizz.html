<p>A champagne industry body has written to the celebrity Delevingne sisters demanding they stop making references to the drink in the marketing of their vegan prosecco brand.</p> <p>Della Vite, founded by Cara, Poppy and Chloe Delevingne, has been accused of exploiting the reputation of champagne, by Comité Champagne, <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/media/article/cara-delevingne-della-vite-vegan-prosecco-champagne-qnjzndsqd">the Times reported</a>.</p> <p>Della Vite marketing materials feature the slogan: “Cheat on champagne” and: “Warning: This is not champagne”.</p> <p>It has emerged Della Vite received a letter from the industry body, which describes itself as “defending the joint interests of champagne houses and growers”, demanding they stop making reference to champagne in their marketing.</p> <p>The sisters refused and the brand has continued with its campaign. Della Vite doubled down and shared a redacted image of the cease-and-desist letter on social media on Wednesday.</p> <p>The caption read: “Love letter from our friends at Champagne. As Oscar Wilde once said, ‘The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about.’ Salute!”</p> <p>Poppy Delevingne, 39, an actor and model, <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/media/article/cara-delevingne-della-vite-vegan-prosecco-champagne-qnjzndsqd">told The Times</a> the campaign was meant to be “fun, cheeky and a little provocative” and they “genuinely didn’t think we’d done anything wrong”.</p> <p>She added: “The severity of the response was unexpected, but we were also pleased to see the campaign making an impact and getting noticed.”</p> <p>In the letter, which has been seen by the Times, the Comité Champagne wrote: “Any use of the internationally renowned name ‘champagne’ other than in reference to the sparkling wines entitled to this appellation constitutes an unfair exploitation of its reputation.</p> <p>“Moreover, such misuse risks tarnishing the name and damaging the goodwill associated with the champagne destination.”</p> <p>Numa Heathcote, chief executive and co-founder of Della Vite, told the newspaper: “We see this reaction as proof that modern challenger sparkling brands are reshaping the conversation around quality. If the established champagne world feels a little unsettled, it’s because a new generation of drinkers is defining luxury on its own terms and brands like Della Vite are part of that shift.”</p> <p>Della Vite was founded by the Delevingne sisters in 2020.</p> <p>Della Vite and Comité Champagne have been contacted for comment.</p>
