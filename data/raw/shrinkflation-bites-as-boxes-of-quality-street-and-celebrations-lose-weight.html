<p>Tucking into a box of Quality Street or Celebrations is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/christmas">Christmas</a> tradition.</p> <p>But as this year’s supply arrives in British supermarkets, it is becoming clear that the Grinch has already struck and made the tubs of the confectionery lighter.</p> <p>Someone has also taken a bite out of Toblerone, with 20g shaved off its chocolatey peaks, reducing a 360g bar to 340g.</p> <p>The latest round of shrinkflation means anyone prising the lid off the Quality Street box may be underwhelmed by the number of sweets – as 50g has been lost from the weight, taking it from 600g to 550g. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at 500g, there’s less to celebrate about tubs of Mars’s Celebrations, which weighed 550g in 2024.</p> <p>The writing may have been on the wall earlier this year when Nestlé announced it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/07/its-just-not-right-consumers-decry-changes-to-quality-street-chocolates">altering how</a> Quality Street’s Purple One and Orange Crunch looked. </p> <p>As well as changing shape, they are now lighter: the unwrapped Purple One used to weigh 9.59g and is now 8.46g. The new look Orange Crunch is down from 9.06g to 8.72g.</p> <p>You can’t even seek solace from shrinkflation in a Terry’s Chocolate Orange as earlier this year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/04/cost-of-easter-rises-as-uk-chocolate-lamb-and-hot-cross-bun-prices-soar">the ball dwindled</a> from 157g to 145g.</p> <p>Toblerone, owned by the US food company Mondelēz, is no stranger to shrinkage. In 2016, it faced a backlash after it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/nov/08/toblerone-gets-more-gappy-but-its-fans-are-not-happy">widened the gaps</a> between the chocolate bar’s distinctive triangular chunks instead of putting the price up. Two years later it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/20/toblerone-to-revert-to-original-shape-but-with-bigger-size-and-price">reverted to the original shape</a>.</p> <p>Chocolate was once a relatively inexpensive indulgence, but the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/18/rise-in-chocolate-prices-could-spook-shoppers-this-halloween">soaring cost of cocoa</a> has pushed prices up. There have been consecutive poor harvests in west Africa, including Ghana and Ivory Coast where more than half of the world’s cocoa beans are harvested.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2024/dec/13/inequality-street-analysis-reveals-fewer-favourites-in-christmas-chocolate-selections">‘Inequality street’: analysis reveals fewer favourites in Christmas chocolate selections</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the price of cocoa beans has fallen back from last year’s record, the UK’s most recent official <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/20/inflation-rises-july-pause-interest-rate-cuts">cost of living data</a> showed the price of chocolate on shop shelves had climbed by 17.2% in the year to July.</p> <p>In the run-up to Christmas, the tubs of chocolate favourites are heavily discounted by supermarkets to pull in shoppers, but whereas last year the promotional price was £4, this year it appears to be £4.50.</p> <p>Andrew Moriarty, a cocoa expert at commodity analysts Expana, said price increases were linked to still-high ingredient costs. </p> <p>“Though raw material prices like cocoa butter have come down nearly 45% [in sterling terms] over the last 12 months, they remain substantially higher than in the years prior to 2024,” he said.</p> <p>“According to many of the retailers I speak to, suppliers have come for a few increases in recent months on the back of more aggressive costings done earlier in 2025.”</p> <p>A Mondelēz International spokesperson said any changes to its product sizes were a “last resort”. </p> <p>“However, we are continuing to experience significantly higher input costs across our supply chain, with ingredients such as cocoa and dairy costing far more than they have done previously. </p> <p>“Meanwhile, other costs, such as energy and transport, also remain high. This means that our products continue to be much more expensive to make.”</p> <p>As a result it had made “a small weight reduction to some of our Toblerone bars<em>”.</em></p> <p>Nestlé said that every year it set the pack sizes and RRPs for its Quality Street products based on a number of factors including the cost of manufacturing, ingredients and transport.</p> <p>A spokesperson added: “We think our pricing is competitive with a good variety of choice for Quality Street fans. Final prices are at the discretion of individual retailers.”</p> <p>Mars was also approached for comment.</p>
