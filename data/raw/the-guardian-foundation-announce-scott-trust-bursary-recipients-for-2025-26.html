Their talent, drive and perspectives embody the very spirit of the scheme.

I have every confidence this year’s recipients will build on that legacy, inspiring and strengthening journalism in the years to come.”</em></p> <p>For the last 37 years, the bursary scheme has assisted 146 students from backgrounds underrepresented in the media, offering funding and experience at a level unmatched by any other UK journalism scholarship. To date, 70% of Scott Trust Bursary alumni still work in journalism.</p> <p>In 2023, the Foundation added three new bursaries reserved specifically for Black aspiring journalists in the UK. These are funded by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust">Scott Trust</a> and form part of a decade-long programme of restorative justice in response to independent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-scott-trust/ng-interactive/2023/mar/28/the-scott-trust-legacies-of-enslavement-report">research</a> into the Guardian’s historical connections to transatlantic slavery.
