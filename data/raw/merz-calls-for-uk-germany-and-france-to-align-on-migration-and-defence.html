<p>The German chancellor has called for a strategic axis between London, Paris and Berlin to tackle illegal migration and deepen defence cooperation, despite declaring that he “deeply deplores” Brexit.</p> <p>Friedrich Merz appeared alongside Keir Starmer at a press conference in Stevenage after the signing of the Kensington treaty, the first formal pact between the UK and Germany since the second world war. The agreement, signed at the V&amp;A Museum and followed by a meeting at Downing Street, sets out plans for closer cooperation on migration, defence, trade and education, including a framework for school exchanges.</p> <p>Merz said the treaty was overdue. “We had you in the European Union and we thought that was enough … but we are now learning that it’s not enough, so we have to do more,” he said.</p> <p>The proposed trilateral alignment was driven by Berlin, but Starmer signalled clear support for closer cooperation with Germany and France, describing the UK’s relationship with Merz’s government as a “statement of our ambition to work ever more closely together”.</p> <p>Merz reiterated his regret about Brexit – “I personally deplore this deeply,” he said – but his call for three-way cooperation revives elements of the “core Europe” vision first proposed by his mentor, Wolfgang Schäuble, in the 1990s. He envisaged a tightly integrated group of European powers leading the continent, though at the time Britain was not included.</p> <p>In the post-Brexit world, Merz and Starmer are positioning the UK as too important to exclude, even without rejoining the EU.</p> <p>As Europe faces renewed threats from Russia and uncertainty over Washington’s future role in Nato, both leaders stressed the need for stronger continental coordination.</p> <p>Merz said the returns agreement signed by the UK and France last week should be expanded into a three-way pact with Germany to mount a more coordinated response to irregular migration. “The cooperation between the United Kingdom and France … has to be complemented by an agreement that we aim to achieve between the three of us: UK, Germany, France,” he said via a translator.</p> <p>“We want to drastically reduce illegal migration in Europe. We are on a good path, but we haven’t reached the target yet.”</p> <p>Starmer confirmed that Germany would amend domestic law to allow authorities to seize boat engines and smuggling components destined for Channel crossings, closing a longstanding enforcement gap.</p> <p>“We’ve discussed this at great length … [The chancellor] is now going to change the law so that we can intervene,” the prime minister said.</p> <p>The Kensington treaty – which was signed by Starmer, Merz, the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and his German counterpart, Johann Wadephul – includes a range of agreements covering:</p> <ul> <li><p>A mutual assistance clause on national security, including shared recognition that Russia poses “the most significant and direct threat” to both countries.</p></li> <li><p>Joint procurement and development of defence technologies including Typhoon jets, Boxer vehicles and long-range missiles.</p></li> <li><p>A joint rail taskforce to explore infrastructure links, including a future <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/17/london-berlin-trains-drawing-board-uk-german-rail-taskforce">London–Berlin train line</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Commitments to boost school exchange programmes and cultural ties.</p></li> </ul> <p>The treaty stops short of creating a formal military bloc, but it aligns the UK more closely with Europe’s two largest powers on migration and security, areas that have become increasingly urgent as a result of war in Ukraine and uncertainty about Washington’s commitment and direction.</p> <p>Merz’s call for a trilateral agreement comes as pressure grows from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland in Germany, where migration and defence spending have become politically volatile. Critics have accused his Christian Democratic Union party of lacking a clear alternative to populist rhetoric, even as Merz tries to position himself as a stabilising force in Europe.</p>
