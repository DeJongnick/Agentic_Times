<p>In a surprise move that seems set to offer Eddie Howe an increased say in player recruitment, Paul Mitchell will leave his role as Newcastle’s sporting director at the&nbsp;end of June.</p> <p>Mitchell, who joined the club last July, is departing by mutual consent without presiding over the acquisition of a major first‑team ­signing. To say the 43-year-old and Howe initially failed to hit it off would be an understatement but, after the manager threatened to leave Tyneside last July if the ­newcomer challenged his autonomy too dramatically, the relationship gradually improved.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/24/premier-league-2024-25-fans-verdicts-stars-flops-and-the-most-loved-referees">Premier League 2024-25 fans’ verdicts: stars, flops, and the most loved referees</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was a further setback last autumn when Mitchell offered journalists a car crash of a group ­interview including an assertion that ­Newcastle’s scouting system was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/sep/13/howe-hits-back-at-claims-newcastles-transfer-strategy-not-fit-for-purpose">unfit for purpose</a>.</p> <p>Yet while that went down very badly with Howe, the pair, once again, eventually brokered an ­apparently enduring peace deal. That truce seemed to be holding as the mana­ger, Mitchell and the outgoing chief executive, Darren Eales, met Yasir al‑Rumayyan, Newcastle’s chair, and a delegation from the club’s Saudi Arabian owners – the kingdom’s ­Public Investment Fund – on Tyneside on Sunday night after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/25/newcastle-everton-premier-league-match-report">team’s 1-0 defeat against Everton</a> at St James’ Park.</p> <p>Despite that result Newcastle qualified for the Champions League and Howe was keen to line up a ­transfer strategy with the contingent that had flow in from Riyadh.</p> <p>Instead the meeting ended with the unexpected decision to part company with Mitchell. There are suggestions he could be replaced by the promotion of two key ­figures already present in the recruitment department, the ­long‑serving Steve&nbsp;Nickson and Howe’s nephew, Andy Howe.</p> <p>Many Premier League managers no longer have the final word on player signings but Eddie Howe has always insisted upon it and now his hand looks to have been strengthened appreciably.</p> <p>Newcastle have failed to sign a single regular first-team player during the past three transfer windows but their worries about meeting ­Premier League profit and ­sustainability regula­tions are now believed to be behind them and this promises to be a big-spending ­summer for the ­Carabao&nbsp;Cup holders.</p> <p>Howe is ­anxious to sign ready-made Champions League players rather than the less-expensive rough diamonds Mitchell was confident could be improved beyond recognition by the manager’s coaching skills.</p> <p>Eales, who recruited Mitchell to Newcastle and previously worked with him at Tottenham, announced last year that he would be stepping down once the Saudis identified a successor. Eales has been diagnosed with a chronic form of blood cancer and needs to concentrate on his ­treatment but has said he will remain in post until a replacement is installed.</p> <p>Outwardly at least, Mitchell – who replaced Dan Ashworth as the club’s sporting director – appeared to leave on amicable terms. “I’d like to thank everyone at Newcastle United for their support over the last year, including Eddie Howe, Becky ­Langley [the women’s team manager], the players, staff, owners and fans,” he said. “It has been an honour to be part of the club and to work with some incredible people.</p> <p>“I’m leaving at a time that is right for me and the club, particularly with Darren Eales – someone who I have worked so closely with in my career – moving on soon.</p> <p>“The club is in great hands on and off the pitch, and is in a fantastic position to continue building. I’d like to wish everyone connected with ­Newcastle United a bright and successful future.”</p> <p>Newcastle said: “Paul leaves with the club’s best wishes and the Board would like to express its sincere thanks to him for his profes­sionalism and diligent service.”</p>
