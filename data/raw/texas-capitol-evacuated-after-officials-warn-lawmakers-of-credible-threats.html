<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a> department of public safety warned state lawmakers and legislative staffers of “credible threats” to their safety, hours after two <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/minnesota-lawmakers-shooting-explainer">Minnesota politicians were targeted</a> early on Saturday.</p> <p>An <a href="https://x.com/TxDPS/status/1933968645681451515">alert was issued just before 1pm</a> local time, alerting legislators planning to attend a “No Kings” anti-Trump rally at the capitol in Austin. The area was evacuated soon after, according to the Texas Tribune, which first obtained a copy of the warning.</p> <p>The alert said the state capitol had been evacuated “out of an abundance of caution” after the DPS received a “credible threat” against state lawmakers. Both the capitol building and surrounding grounds were closed temporarily, and officials did not immediately indicate when they would be reopened.</p> <p>“DPS continues working with our law enforcement partners to address the threat,” the statement said.</p> <p>Later Saturday, spokesperson Ericka Miller said in a statement the department had arrested one person in connection with threats made to state lawmakers after a traffic stop in La Grange.</p> <p>“A short time ago, a Trooper with the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) took one person into custody in connection with the threats made against state lawmakers who planned to attend today’s protest at the Texas State Capitol Complex,” Miller said.</p> <p>DPS said there is no additional active threat.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/minnesota-lawmakers-shooting-explainer">The attacks on Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota: what we know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That came after the state’s lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick, <a href="https://x.com/LtGovTX/status/1933984098499928419">posted on social media</a> that “a credible threat was made to possibly kill members of the Texas legislature at the capitol. “I urge everyone to take appropriate precautions and heed the warning of the Texas department of public safety until that threat is no longer active.”</p> <p>Patrick noted the killings of the Minnesota Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, saying that what happened “in Minnesota is a tragedy and our prayers go out to the families, friends, and those impacted”.</p> <p>Saturday’s protest in Austin, which organizers have said will be nonviolent, is sponsored by the chair of the Texas house Democratic caucus, Gene Wu. The Democratic state representative John Bucy III, the Democratic state senator Sarah Eckhardt and the Democratic representative Greg Casar were expected to attend.</p> <p>Republican representative Charlie Geren later told colleagues in an email that the Minnesota suspect – identified by police as Vance Boelter, 57 – had a list of potential targets.</p> <p>“It seems to be an isolated incident. However, we’re always concerned about copycats and those who the attack might inspire,” Geren wrote. “Your safety is our top priority, and we are taking all necessary precautions to address any potential threats.”</p>
