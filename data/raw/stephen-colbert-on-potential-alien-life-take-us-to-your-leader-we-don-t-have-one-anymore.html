<p>Late-night hosts spoke about the Easter weekend, potential alien life and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/17/giorgia-meloni-trump-meeting">meeting</a> with the Italian prime minister.</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyKExGUtbvg"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RyKExGUtbvg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On The Late Show, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> pointed out that this year’s Easter Sunday also falls on 4/20, the unofficial holiday for weed enthusiasts.</p> <p>He joked that it would be “the Sunday he is risen and you is high”.</p> <p>This week saw Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/17/giorgia-meloni-to-try-to-act-as-bridge-between-eu-and-us-with-trump-meeting">meet with</a> the rightwing Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni. Some had hoped she might “ease the tariff tension” as she is often referred to as a “Trump whisperer”.</p> <p>He then played footage of Meloni speaking in Italian to Trump who complimented her directly after. “I’ll have the same thing she ordered but double meatball, double parm,” Colbert joked.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/apr/17/stephen-colbert-trump-immigration-tourism">Stephen Colbert: ‘People from overseas are frightened to come here’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meloni has now made an offer to Trump to make an official visit to Italy, a place Colbert said he would feel at home as he “looks like a pile of prosciutto with a little spaghetti on top”.</p> <p>Due to massive cuts to the Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA might <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/17/fda-suspends-quality-control-food-testing-staff-cuts">have to stop inspections at food facilities</a>. Colbert joked that we would know get to enjoy Tyson’s tangy buffalo beaks and thumbs.</p> <p>The administration is “actively trying to make health officials dumber” with halted efforts to collect data on many issues. It will now lead to “TLC’s sexy new reality show Drug-Resistant Gonorrhea Island”.</p> <p>This is all “just the tip of the cutberg” with the weather service also in trouble, seeing 300 employees let go as severe storm season ramps up, “when we need the weather people the most”.</p> <p>Colbert said that Twisters “will soon be the only programming on the weather channel”.</p> <p>He said that some are scrambling to make major discoveries “before science ends forever” such as this week’s reveal that there is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/17/scientists-hail-strongest-evidence-so-far-for-life-beyond-our-solar-system">possible signature of life</a> on a distant planet.</p> <p>Officials have said that further studies are needed but Colbert expressed excitement, saying: “Please aliens take us to your leader, we don’t have one anymore.”</p> <p>Conspiracy theorists have also claimed that this week’s controversial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/14/blue-origin-rocket-launch">all-female Blue Origin space stunt</a> was faked. “Oh, I don’t know if I believe that,” he said. “Maybe Kubrick could fake the moon landing but you could never fake Gayle King’s sheer terror.”</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y7hSzUYlJM"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0y7hSzUYlJM?start=1&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live!, the host also spoke about Easter. “If Jesus comes back and sees what’s going on, we are in deep trouble,” he said.</p> <p>Kimmel noted that he was “not sensing a lot of Easter spirit this year” and that Easter Sunday falling on 4/20 will lead to “some very long and confusing egg hunts”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/10/egg-prices-break-record-high-consecutive-months-inflation">Egg prices remain high</a>, which has seen an “outpouring of tips for other stuff you can colour instead” such as potatoes and marshmallows, but Kimmel said Jesus would only come back for “boiled eggs”.</p> <p>In response to the sky-high prices, he asked: “Is anyone else tired of all the winning yet?”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump has given the White House an “extreme makeover” with plenty of gold added. His press secretary called it “the golden office for the golden age”, which Kimmel called “quite the spin”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/apr/16/colbert-kimmel-trump-harvard-late-night-roundup">Stephen Colbert: ‘We’re not on our way to a dictatorship, we’re on the ship’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He joked that for someone anti-DEI, he has the “same taste as Liberace” before asking: “Do you think Donald Trump understands that the story of King Midas is a cautionary tale?”</p> <p>He also spoke about the Meloni visit, joking that Trump probably took her to an Olive Garden to “make her feel at home” before airing a clip of him showing off “his vast knowledge of other lands”.</p> <p>Trump referred to the Congo and said: “I don’t know what that is.” Kimmel asked: “When is someone gonna show that man a map?”</p> <p>He said the government is running like a “well-soiled machine” before moving on to the alien planet news, detailing that researchers have found an equivalent of sea scum. Kimmel joked that we “may have found a new home for Ted Cruz”.</p> <p>The planet is 120 light years away, so Kimmel said “off you go Elon and Jeff, time to climb into those space dildos and boldly go away”.</p> <p>He also joked that we have a “better chance of being visited by aliens than Canadians” with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/america-tourists-fears-us-travel-trump">tourism</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/trump-tariffs-tourism-business">rates down</a> post-tariffs.</p>
