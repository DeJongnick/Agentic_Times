And as with the wider economy, most of that growth in sales was from earlier last year and the year finished with very little momentum. </p> <p>Indeed, the level of sales volumes in December was just 0.1% higher than in June and the 3m/3m growth rate has slowed from a healthy +1.2% in September to -0.8% in December. That said, the breakdown was a bit more encouraging with sales rising in four of the seven sub-sectors. Admittedly, food and online sales both fell by 1.9% m/m.</p> <p>But the rises in sales in department, clothing and household goods stores suggests that, after big falls in October and November, households were holding back some of their spending for the Christmas period and may be in a better position than the recent retail weakness suggests.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jacqui</strong> <strong>Baker</strong>, head of retail at <strong>RSM</strong> <strong>UK</strong>, says December’s drop in sales marks a disappointing end to tough year:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Despite record-breaking sales for some retailers over Christmas, plus the later than usual Black Friday event, it was a disappointing end to 2024 for the sector. A lacklustre Golden Quarter is particularly concerning after a tough year as retailers would have been hoping for a Christmas boost. However, retail sales excluding fuel did increase 2.9% year-on-year due to poor sales figures in December 2023.</p> <p> “Many retailers had little choice but to launch their Boxing Day discounting early to maximise sales and clear as much stock as possible ahead of the seasonal slowdown in January. However, without the ‘golden’ boost to sales many retailers will find it difficult to navigate the imminent headwinds post-Budget and we could see prominent brands struggle to compete in 2025. </p> </blockquote> <p>But there are questions about the data. <strong>Matt Swannell, </strong>chief economic advisor to the<strong> EY ITEM Club, </strong>points out that these figures are volatile.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Seasonal spending has a large impact on the retail sector at the end of the year, and recent shifts in spending patterns can introduce large volatility into official estimates of retail activity, so the EY ITEM Club wouldn’t recommend reading too much into December’s fall.</p> <p>Indeed, December 2023 saw retail activity fall by nearly 4%, also with a collapse in food sales, only for most of this lost ground to be made up in January 2024. However, when considering the last three months, the picture remains soft, with retail sales falling 0.8% across Q4.</p> </blockquote> <p>Retailing analyst <strong>Nick</strong> <strong>Bubb</strong> has his own doubts, saying…</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Well, City economists will lap up the news that the ONS Retail Sales figures for December were down, but they should be asking if the figures are simply wrong, as the ONS must be living on a different planet if it thinks that Large Food Retailers saw sales fall by 0.2% last month (year-on-year, non-seasonally adjusted value), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/07/bumper-christmas-uk-supermarkets-food-price-inflation">given what we’ve heard from </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/07/bumper-christmas-uk-supermarkets-food-price-inflation">Kantar</a></strong> and <strong>Nielsen</strong>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-678a137b8f0800365d4f9ff6" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-01-17T08:30:14.649Z">8.30am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The retail sales picture is rosier if you take an annual view.</p> <p>Compared with December 2023, sales volumes were 2.9% higher last year, while sales values (the amount spent) rose by 3.5%.</p> <p><strong>Kris Hamer, </strong>director of insight at the<strong> British Retail Consortium,</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Retail sales picked up in December, but this unfortunately did not offset the shaky start to the ‘Golden Quarter’.
