<p>Blanche is a lot of things: a mother of eight and a grandmother of 10. A viral TikToker. A survivor of family and domestic violence. A former drug user, clean for nearly two years. And she is, for the moment, housed.</p> <p>To the 49-year-old, the two-bedroom community housing she has in Melbourne’s west feels palatial. She previously spent seven months living in a hotel room with her youngest son, then aged nine. Before that, they were wrapped in blankets on the street. They spent four years bouncing around.</p> <p>“I thought having a drug addiction was hard but being homeless is harder,” she says.</p> <p>Driven by a cost-of-living crisis, exacerbated by growing family violence and priced out of the private rental market, more parents and their children are experiencing homelessness.</p> <p>New <a href="https://www.launchhousing.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Launch-Housing-Insights_BuildingFutures.pdf">data from Launch Housing</a> shows that a lack of stable long-term housing means more families are being housed in emergency accommodation such as hotels, with average stays stretching out to 12 weeks.</p> <p>Last year the organisation supported 230 families in hotel rooms, with stays funded by the Victorian government. It’s unclear how many crisis-supported accommodation rooms for families there are in the state – but Launch runs 11.</p> <p>In the hotel, Blanche and her son lived in one room, sleeping in two beds.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/31/homeless-central-station-sydney-belongings-removed">Homeless people at Sydney’s Central station have belongings removed with advocates condemning ‘heavy-handed’ tactics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I wasn’t allowed to have any visitors or anything,” she says. “Only one power point worked at a time, and I got bloody frostbite sores on my toes. We only had one little heater.</p> <p>“We didn’t have cooking facilities. I bought an air-fryer … Once a week my son and I went to [fast food restaurant] Lord of the Fries and got nuggets for him.</p> <p>“Like any other homeless person, sometimes we choose between eating and our children.”</p> <p>Sitting in her lounge – which also doubles as a bedroom for her daughter and her new grandson, just six weeks old – Blanche is excited.</p> <p>She has taught herself how to use TikTok – a video of her as an AI mermaid has blown up, hitting more than 30,000 views. After escaping family violence, she never had an ID in her life – until last year. As a young girl she was a ward of the state. She had her first child at 15 after she was abused. She doesn’t know how to use a computer. Despite where she’s been and what she’s experienced, she laughs easily.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Throughout their motel stay, her son was going to school, but living there followed him into the classroom.</p> <p>“He suffered at school,” she says. “Kids are arseholes to homeless children and his teachers would ask him questions like, ‘Do you sleep with your mother?’ He didn’t have friends.</p> <p>“And because I have no teeth, I got judged. It was very hard to get a job.”</p> <p>For some of the stay, Blanche did not have government help to pay the rent, so she worked as a cleaner at the motel. For every two hours she cleaned she would get a $50 discount.</p> <p>Launch’s acting group manager for families and new beginnings, Angela Zheng, says fewer than 1% of private rentals are available for families on income support.</p>    <p>“There is also not enough housing out there,” she says. “There’s a lack of community housing, and there are limited options for crisis-supported accommodation.</p> <p>“So the demand is just growing.”</p> <p>The homelessness support system was set up when single male clients were the main group of people requiring support, which is no longer the case, Zheng says.</p> <p>Last year more than 60% of adult homelessness clients across Australia were women, and more than 75,000 were children.</p> <p>“We’re calling for more crisis-supported accommodation,” Zheng says. “That means there is support on site. It’s often co-located with children’s programs, with government services, so it’s a kind of a hub that families can link in with.”</p> <p>The Victorian Department of Housing, Homelessness and Fairness spent more than $14m in 2024–25 to place people in emergency accommodation.</p> <p>“People are doing it tough right across the country, and that’s why we’re investing in the support services that help Victorians sleeping rough not just find temporary accommodation but stay in safe and secure long-term housing,” a spokesperson for the department said, adding: “Each year we invest more than $300 million into specialist homelessness services every year, to assist around 100,000 Victorians who are at risk of or experiencing homelessness.”</p> <h2>‘My son is traumatised’</h2> <p>Tyrone is the father of five children. In 2023 he and his wife spent almost three months living in two studio apartments side by side. Their youngest was four, the oldest 17.</p> <p>“Our most difficult task was trying to make meals,” he says. “We had one electric saucepan, a kettle and a rice cooker. Lucky I’m a chef – I could kind of wing it.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/15/homelessness-is-a-driver-of-poor-health-in-australia-so-why-not-make-housing-part-of-healthcare">Homelessness is a driver of poor health in Australia – so why not make housing part of healthcare? | Ehsan Noroozinejad </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over the course of three months Tyrone watched his kids get more depressed. His wife was home schooling the younger ones but the older ones had nothing to do.</p> <p>“[They] just watched TV until early hours in the morning and then slept all day,” he says. “When I came home from work, we would go across to the park. Just to kick the ball and try and get them outside.”</p> <p>The family is now in a private rental, which Tyrone can just afford on his wage. While they’re all close, he says the hotel stay affected his family.</p> <p>“We were stuck in the same room for so long that we … started to have a few little arguments, or tiffs. Those kinds of pressures.”</p> <p>After almost eight months living in the motel, Blanche was connected with Launch Housing’s family accommodation program, which looks at finding long-term options.</p> <p>“My son is traumatised,” she says. “For the first few months or so, he couldn’t sleep with the door closed; he didn’t close the shower door … It was hard just to transfer away from me.</p> <p>“Now I don’t see him,” she laughs. “He’s just on his bloody PlayStation.”</p> <p>In her new house, there are bright colours everywhere, with walls covered in tie-dye and Disney characters.</p> <p>“But none of this feels like mine, or ours,” Blanche says. “Because it’s not … We’re still living on the edge.”</p> <p>She and her family have fought – to get clean, for this roof over their heads. She says she didn’t ask to be homeless or to be hit by her partner.</p> <p>She has been living in the shallow end of Australia’s housing crisis, and is still seeing the impact of it on her son.</p> <p>“They’ve got to think of the kids. They’ve really got to think of the kids.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
