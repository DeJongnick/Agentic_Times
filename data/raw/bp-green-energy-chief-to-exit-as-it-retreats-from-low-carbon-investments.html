<p>The architect of BP’s failed green energy agenda will leave the embattled oil company within months as it continues its retreat from low-carbon investments amid a sharp fall in profits.</p> <p>The oil company said Giulia Chierchia, the executive in charge of BP’s sustainability strategy, would step back from her role from 1 June 2025 to “pursue other opportunities” outside the company. She will not be replaced.</p> <p>BP announced her departure weeks after its chair, Helge Lund, said he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/04/bp-chair-to-resign-amid-pressure-from-shareholders-helge-lund">step down from the company</a> by next year, and later faced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/17/bp-braces-for-investor-rebellion-at-first-agm-since-climate-strategy-u-turn">shareholder rebellion</a> at its AGM over his role in overseeing BP’s failed green agenda.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/apr/29/hsbc-trade-war-bad-debts-trump-automotive-tariffs-stock-markets-business-live-news">HSBC sounds alarm on trade war; Trump to soften blow of automotive tariffs – business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chierchia and Lund had faced questions over their future in the months since BP <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/11/bp-chief-profits-murray-auchincloss-elliott">abandoned its green strategy</a> in favour of a renewed focus on oil and gas to increase its profits and bolster its flagging market value.</p> <p>The company’s profits dropped by almost 50% in the first three months of this year to $1.4bn (£1.0bn), from $2.7bn in the same period last year. It reported the worse than expected start to the year after its annual profits fell by a third in 2024 to $8.9bn. BP’s shares fell more than 2% on Tuesday.</p> <p>BP’s financial struggles have made the company a target for New York hedge fund Elliott Management, which is notorious for amassing stakes in struggling companies in order to agitate for changes that could increase market value, leading to a profit for the fund.</p> <p>The activist hedge fund has built a 5% stake in BP and has reportedly called on the oil company to U-turn on its green agenda and tighten its financial discipline while undertaking an overhaul of its board.</p> <p>BP’s share price has lagged its industry rivals in recent years after former chief Bernard Looney set the company on course to become a “net zero” energy company under Chierchia – whom he hired months after taking the top job in early 2020.</p> <p>Looney <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/12/bp-boss-bernard-looney-to-resign-after-failing-to-reveal-ties-with-colleagues">left BP abruptly </a>in September 2023 after admitting that he failed to fully disclose his relationships with female colleagues to the board.</p> <p>BP said Chierchia’s sustainability team would be integrated into other parts of BP’s business to “simplify our structure” and enable “quicker decision-making and clearer accountabilities”.</p> <p>The company has also promised investors it will tighten its spending, particularly in low-carbon energy, and increase its plans to sell off parts of the business as part of its efforts to improve the company’s flagging market value.</p> <p>BP plans to lower its planned spending for 2025 by $500m to about $14.5bn this year. It will also divest between $3bn and $4bn of assets, up from its previous plan to sell off business interests worth $3bn this year. The company aims to sell $20bn in total by the end 2027.</p> <p>The BP chief executive, Murray Auchincloss, said: “In February, we announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/26/bp-oil-and-gas-spending-green-energy-scale-back#:~:text=The%20radical%20overhaul%20means%20BP,said%20BP's%20CEO%2C%20Murray%20Auchincloss.">fundamental reset of our strategy</a> – to grow the upstream, focus the downstream and invest with discipline in the transition – and we have already made significant progress.”</p> <p>The company has started up three big oil and gas projects, and made six exploration discoveries.</p>
