<p>Sky has put 900 roles at risk as the broadcaster continues to reshape its business in the streaming era.</p> <p>The company, which employs about 23,000 staff in the UK, expects the consultation process to result in about 600 roles being cut, with 300 redeployed.</p> <p>The latest round of cuts – the third in a little over 18 months – follows a series of product launches including the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/01/sky-glass-gen-2-review-smart-streaming-tv-picture-sound-service">second iteration of the Sky Glass smart TV</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/01/sky-glass-air-review-a-surprisingly-good-budget-smart-tv">budget-friendly Sky Glass Air</a>.</p> <p>The Comcast-owned broadcaster is focused on improving existing services, and the cuts will hit Sky’s technology and product teams and related corporate functions.</p> <p>Sky has cut almost 3,500 roles since the beginning of last year as the broadcaster looks to move away from traditional satellite pay-TV to streaming-based services in the fight against US giants such as Netflix.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/19/sky-comcast-jobs-exclusive-shows-subscribers">Plunging value and a content cliff edge: what’s gone wrong at Sky?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latest round of cuts brings Sky UK’s employee base back down to roughly the <a href="https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blt4b099fa9cc3801a6/bltec7b428f27f4aa13/68b576f16f1cb91ea9ef49b8/Annual-report-2018.pdf">23,000 level at which it stood in 2018</a>, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/23/comcast-30bn-bid-for-sky-what-does-it-mean#:~:text=Why%20has%20Comcast%20bid%20%C2%A3,and%20produces%20its%20own%20content.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/27/comcast-boss-brian-roberts-london-cab-driver-role-sky-bid">Comcast acquired the business for £31bn</a>.</p> <p>Sky estimates that more than 90% of new subscriptions are via internet-based products such as Sky Glass and Sky Stream, a new streaming set-top box.</p> <p>“Over the past few years, Sky has launched a set of market-leading products including Sky Glass, Sky Stream and our full fibre broadband service,” said a Sky spokesperson. “These products are now firmly established and used by millions of customers, strengthening Sky’s reputation for innovation and great service.</p> <p>“As we look ahead, we are shifting our approach to bring customers the next generation of experience by investing in digital-first service, unbeatable content, and even better performance from our products, powered by the best of global innovation.”</p> <p>In March, Sky moved to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/27/sky-to-cut-2000-jobs-at-customer-service-centres-and-close-three-sites-in-uk">cut 2,000 jobs at its customer service centres</a> and closed three sites.</p> <p>The company said the closures would make it “future-ready” as it shifted from dealing with customers over the phone to digital communications.</p> <p>Last January, Sky <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/jan/30/sky-cut-1000-jobs-customers-move-pay-tv-internet">cut about 800 jobs</a>, mainly from its army of workers that install equipment in households, as consumers stop taking traditional pay-TV equipment and shift to “plug-and-go” internet-based products.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Sky <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/09/sky-warner-bros-discovery-deal-hbo-max">struck a deal with Warner Bros Discovery</a>, the owner of the film studio behind Barbie and HBO shows including Succession and The White Lotus, which led to it losing the right to exclusively broadcast programmes.</p> <p>The deal will result in WBD’s HBO Max streaming service being made available via Sky.</p>
