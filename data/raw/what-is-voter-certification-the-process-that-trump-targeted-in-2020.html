<p>With voting completed in the US presidential <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024">election</a>, election officials across the country will now turn to certifying the results before the electoral college meets in December and Congress certifies the vote in January.</p> <p>Until the 2020 election, few paid attention to certification, which was seen as a bureaucratic way of officializing the results of the election. But after 2020, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and allies, who questioned the election results, targeted the certification process as a way of causing confusion. In advance of the presidential election, there were deep concerns that the former president and allies would try and block certification of the election results, starting at the local level.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/trump-election-win-10-key-takeaways">Democrats suffer a drubbing: 10 key takeaways from Trump’s election win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election">victory in the election</a> means that there likely won’t be an effort to block certification of the presidential results. But there still are some close US Senate and House races that could prompt battles over certification. Experts say it is clear that certification is not discretionary and those who refuse to certify could face criminal penalties.</p>  <h2>What is certification?</h2>  <p>Certification <a href="https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification#:~:text=Election%20results%20are%20unofficial%20until,included%20in%20the%20final%20results.">refers generally</a> to the process of making the election results official. The process works differently in each state. Election results are unofficial until they are certified.</p> <p>It takes place after a canvass, the process that takes place after every election to aggregate all of the ballot totals, resolving outstanding disputes over challenged or provisional ballots and reconciling any discrepancies or inconsistencies. Officials investigate any discrepancies, if they exist, in vote totals.&nbsp;</p> <p>The process varies by jurisdiction, but there is usually a board of people which then votes to certify the election. Various state laws make it clear that this is a ministerial responsibility and that officials cannot refuse to do so.</p> <p>For a statewide election, results are certified at both the local and state level.</p> <h2>Is certification when disputes over election results are resolved?</h2>  <p>No. The canvass and certification process is aimed at reconciling vote totals and getting an official count. The process may identify abnormalities that could become the basis for an election contest or challenge later. State laws allow for separate legal processes outside of the certification process to challenge election results. These typically take place in the courts.</p> <h2>What happens if an official or a board refuses to certify?</h2>  <p>Most boards certify the vote on a majority vote, so a single member refusing to certify wouldn’t block certification.</p> <p>But if a majority of the board refuses to certify, a secretary of state or <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-investigations/election-certification-under-threat/">election watchdog group</a> would likely sue them to get a court to force them to certify. Watchdog groups have already warned that those who refuse to certify will face criminal charges.</p> <h2>Could an effort to block certification actually work?</h2>  <p>No. If there were substantial irregularities in an election that could affect the outcome, it would be resolved in court. Experts are confident that the winners of elections will be the ones seated.</p> <p>Despite that confidence, there’s still concern that refusals to certify will allow people to continue to question the election results and seed further doubt about the election.</p> <h2>What happens after certification?</h2>  <p>In a presidential election, there are additional steps after states certify the vote.</p> <p>In nearly every state, the winner of the statewide vote gets all of the state’s electors to the electoral college. A new law, <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/understanding-the-electoral-count-reform-act-of-2022/">the Electoral Count Reform Act</a>, requires the governor of each state to certify the list of their state’s electors no later than six days before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/04/how-electoral-college-voting-works">electoral college</a> meets. This year, that means the electors will be finalized by 11 December and the electors <a href="https://www.eac.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/Electoral_College_2024_Dates_508.pdf">will meet in state capitols</a> across the country on 17 December.</p> <p>Once the electors meet and cast their votes, they transmit them to the National Archives in Washington. Congress will oversee the counting of the vote on 6 January 2025 to make the results official. The constitution says that the president of the Senate – the vice-president – will oversee counting of the votes. That means that Kamala Harris will oversee the counting of the vote this year. Harris, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/kamala-harris-concession-speech">conceded</a> the election to Trump on Wednesday, said in her concession speech that she “will engage in a peaceful transfer of power”.</p>
