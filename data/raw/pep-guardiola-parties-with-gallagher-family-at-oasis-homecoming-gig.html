<p>The homecoming of Oasis in their long-awaited Manchester gig turned into a family affair with the children of Noel and Liam Gallagher pictured together backstage for a gig many in the city thought would never happen.</p> <p>More than 70,000 people descended on Manchester for the concert in Heaton Park, with the Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, among the crowds.</p> <p>Guardiola had the song D’You Know What I Mean dedicated to him by Liam, who referred to the Spaniard as “the boss”, calling him the “greatest manager of all time”, a comment which provided the only divisive moment for the adoring crowd – many of whom hailed from the red half of the city.</p> <p>Guardiola was pictured with Liam’s two sons Lennon, 25, and Gene, 24, and Noel’s three children Anais, 25, Donovan, 17 and Sonny, 14. Gene, whose mother is Liam’s ex-wife Nicole Appleton, shared the image to Instagram, with the caption: “Pic of the century alright now everyone els fuck off.”</p> <p>Noel also dedicated the song Half The World Away to Royale Family actor Craig Cash and his co-star Caroline Aherne, who died of cancer in July 2016, at the age of 52. The song was used as the theme tune in the BBC comedy.</p> <p>At about 8.20pm, the brothers walked on to the stage together to deafening cheers from crowds. Liam, wearing a zipped-up parka in 30C weather, held his older brother’s hand and raised it.</p> <p>The duo started with their song Hello, which was followed by<strong> </strong>Acquiesce. Morning Glory came after in a set that was full of the band’s greatest hits. Fans had to wait until the encore to hear Don’t Look Back In Anger and Wonderwall.</p> <p>Greater Manchester police said the event passed “without incident”, although six men were arrested and in custody for a range of reasons including being drunk and disorderly and on suspicion of drug and fraud offences. Five drones were also seized after breaches of airspace restrictions.</p> <p>Oasis fever gripped the city this week before the gig. Huge pictures of the brothers were splashed on the side of the city’s yellow buses, and Liam Gallagher’s voice made it on to the Metrolink tram network, telling fans: “The next stop is … Heaton Parrrk,” before adding: “Off you go.”</p> <p>The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/11/oasis-manchester-gig-fans-hometown">spoke to fans</a> queueing for the gig before it began, including some who had travelled from as far as the US and Mexico. Many were wearing bucket hats in the scorching heat.</p> <p>In a post on social media, the band urged concertgoers to “wear a (bucket) hat”, put on sun screen, stay hydrated, seek shade and look after one another at Heaton Park.</p> <p>Carley Williams, 27, from Boston, in the US, spent more than $15,000 (£11,000) to visit Manchester for two weeks and see the five home town gigs.</p> <p>“I’ve just never been more excited in my life,” she said. “This is like what I’ve lived my life to do, so I just have never experienced this level of anticipation in my life, and I’m just loving every minute of it.”</p> <p>The five sold-out shows there follow the band’s first comeback gigs in Cardiff last week. In a five-star review, the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/05/oasis-review-playlist-oasis-big-on-the-first-two-albums-with-little-left-to-chance">called</a> it a “triumph in the bag”.</p> <p>After Manchester, Oasis will visit London’s Wembley Stadium, Edinburgh’s Murrayfield Stadium and Dublin’s Croke Park throughout July, August and September.</p>
