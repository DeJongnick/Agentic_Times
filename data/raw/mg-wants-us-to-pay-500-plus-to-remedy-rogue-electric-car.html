<p><strong>Our MG5 </strong><strong>electric car became dangerously out of control, but MG won’t do anything about it.</strong></p> <p><strong>The car suffered a power system malfunction after we had used a charger at a </strong><strong>motorway </strong><strong>service station.</strong></p> <p><strong>It wouldn’t respond to any controls, </strong><strong>including the off button, </strong><strong>so we called the AA. The patrolman managed to get it started, then decided to give it a test drive. My family was on</strong><strong>board</strong><strong> as it was pouring</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>When he put the car into reverse, it shot forward and failed to stop when he applied the brake. It rammed into the AA van and its wheels began spinning and smoking as it tried to accelerate.</strong></p> <p><strong>We all managed to exit the car, and the patrolman eventually succeeded in turning it off from the outside. We were told it was not safe to drive.</strong></p> <p><strong>The AA arranged a transporter to take it to a dealership and paid for the repairs, which cost £2,500. </strong><strong>The patrol van was also damaged.</strong></p> <p><strong>The dealer has investigated the fault, for which we are to be charged £500, but </strong><strong>has found nothing. MG has closed the case, and insists we request a further investigation at our own expense.</strong></p> <p><strong>Six weeks on, the car is still with the dealership. We don’t want to drive it until we know it is safe, but can’t afford to keep paying for investigations.</strong></p> <p><strong>AB, </strong><em><strong>East Lothian</strong></em></p> <p>You are not the only MG owner whose car has seemingly gone rogue. One man was<a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/news/motorist-drives-into-police-van-to-stop-his-car-after-brakes-fail"> forced to drive his car into a police van </a>after his brakes failed.</p> <p>I asked the AA to send me its technician report, which confirms that the car “surged forward” when put into reverse.</p> <p>It’s unsurprising that you are reluctant to get behind the wheel until you know what’s wrong and, since the car is still under warranty you are reluctant to throw your own money at the problem.</p> <p>MG Motor UK seems remarkably unperturbed given the harm that could be caused by an out-of-control EV. Although the dealership had recommended that MG’s technical department review the case and issue guidance, MG, instead, closed it.</p> <p>MG, when you complained, merely apologised for the “inconvenience”.</p> <p>It ignored my questions about whether the review requested by the dealer was conducted before the case was closed, and how many incidents involving power surges or loss it is aware of.</p> <p>However, it speedily commissioned another, more detailed, investigation of the vehicle and conducted a 25-mile test drive after using a range of public charging points. You were not charged for this test and will not now be billed for the previous one.</p> <p>It says: “MG treats all issues where a malfunction may have potentially occurred as a priority. No malfunctions with any of the relevant in-vehicle equipment, or the ability to charge the vehicle using various systems, were detected on the car.</p> <p>“MG, and the authorised dealership, having carefully examined the vehicle, have concluded that an error occurred not related to the car. We will continue to support the customer with information and advice.”</p> <p>This leaves you in a difficult position. Your car has been given a clean bill of health, but you have lost confidence in it. You have therefore decided that your best option is to sell.</p> <p><em>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
