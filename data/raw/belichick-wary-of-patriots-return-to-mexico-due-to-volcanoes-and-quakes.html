<p>The New England Patriots got the result they wanted on their trip to Mexico City on Sunday, beating the Oakland Raiders 33-8. Their coach, however, is in no rush to repeat the experience. </p> <p>“Players did a great job dealing with all the challenges we had to deal with. I think we’re fortunate there was no volcano eruptions or earthquakes, or anything else while we were down there,” Bill Belichick said <a href="http://www.weei.com/blogs/ryan-hannable/bill-belichick-dhk-explains-why-hes-no-rush-play-game-mexico-city-again">in an appearance on WEEI on Monday</a>. “You have two NFL franchises in an area that I don’t know how stable the geological plates that were below us [were], but nothing happened, so that was good.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/21/seattle-seahawks-go-down-to-another-defeat-without-legion-of-boom">Seattle Seahawks go down to another defeat without Legion of Boom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Belichick’s fears are odd considering he has never voiced concerns about traveling to play any of the NFL teams in California along the San Andreas Fault, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault">an area prone to earthquakes</a>. The Patriots have also played in Seattle twice in the past 10 years; the city sits close to the volcanic Mount Rainier and<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3062/"> it is believed an eruption could affect the city</a>. </p> <p>Belichick did, however, cite other concerns about the Mexico City trip.</p> <p>“It’s a long way to go for a game,” Belichick said. “There’s a lot to it in terms of all the logistics of it. They are not used to having a NFL team so you have to go in there and handle a lot of the logistics. It took a lot of manpower, a lot of hours, a lot of energy out of our organization to do that. This week, we’re tired. We are exhausted from the trip. It was a good trip, but it took a lot out of us I think.”</p> <p>Belichick’s statement was seen as insensitive by some in Mexico <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/23/mexico-new-earthquake-oaxaca">after hundreds were killed in earthquakes earlier this year</a>. Poncho Vera of ESPN Mexico <a href="https://twitter.com/ponchovpof/status/932763855918325760">accused the Patriots coach of “outrageous ignorance”</a>. </p> <p>The NFL doesn’t share Belichick’s concerns and has said Mexico City will host a regular season game through until 2021. That will be good news for another member of the Patriots, Tom Brady, who said he had enjoyed the trip.</p> <p>“To be here and play in a different country and to have everyone cheer for our team, cheer for me and cheer for my team-mates is incredible. Hopefully there’s many more games here,” he said. “It’s a great experience. I’ve never been to Mexico City, but I’m definitely coming back. We stayed in a beautiful hotel, I had a beautiful view in my room. Just a very historic stadium. I know there’s been some really important sporting events here.”</p> <p>The Patriots lead the AFC East with an 8-2 record after the win over the Raiders. Their next game is against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday.</p>
