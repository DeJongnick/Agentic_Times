<p><strong>How Centrelink illegally cancelled jobseeker payments</strong></p> 
<p>Australia’s welfare system is often described as a safety net for the most vulnerable, but what happens when that safety net is yanked away? Analysis suggests that hundreds of thousands of Centrelink payments have been illegally cancelled since 2020, with many more suspended. Cait Kelly speaks with Nour Haydar about the automated system linked to the cancellations – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2025/oct/27/how-centrelink-illegally-cancelled-jobseeker-payments-full-story-podcast">and the human toll of a broken system</a>.</p>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>Heavily guarded, Pine Gap – or “the base”, as it is known locally – sits in a secluded, narrow valley near Alice Springs. Little is officially confirmed about its operations, but through leaked documents and whistleblower disclosures its criticality to American global-intelligence gathering is uncontested. Now a protest over the facility’s alleged role in the Gaza war has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/27/pine-gap-protests-spy-base-gaza-war-australia-complicity">refocused attention on the secretive US satellite base</a>.</p> 
<h2>Not the news</h2> 
<p>According to its creator, the new Hot Mama dessert is neither a latte nor a hot chocolate and certainly not melted ice-cream. But if it’s none of these, then what is it? We visited to Smize and Dream in Sydney’s Darling Harbour to try Tyra Banks’ “revolutionary” hot ice-cream. And the verdict? Well, with its lukewarm temperature and peculiar consistency, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/oct/27/tyra-banks-hot-ice-cream-mama-reviews">you can colour us confused</a>.</p>
