<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-10-02T10:00:45Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p>The Thursday quiz likes to believe there is a certain type of news story that regular readers will spot on the Guardian website, and immediately think “that is a shoo-in for the Thursday quiz” and commit every last detail to memory. This week’s quiz features quite a few stories like that, as well as the debut of a brand new exciting regular celebrity general knowledge round. As ever, there are no prizes, but we love to hear how you got on in the comments. Allons-y!</p>

    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:D - It all seems a bit of a rum do if you ask the Thursday quiz, 2:A - It is the only tree in the street, was planted in Victorian times, and stands 23 metres (75ft) tall, so the quiz guesses it is pretty special after all, 3:C - None of us remember it, do we?, 4:C - The 58-year-old Oscar-winning actor petitioned on Tuesday to end her marriage to the 57-year-old Grammy winning country singer in a Nashville court, 5:A - The sixth largest of Saturn’s 274 confirmed moons in its orbit, Enceladus has become one of the leading contenders in the search for bodies that could harbour extraterrestrial life, 6:D - Border officials intercepted almost 259,000 counterfeit toys worth more than £3.5m so far this year, including 236,000 fake versions of the rotten little things, 7:B - The ascent was Andrzej Bargiel’s third attempt at climbing Everest, and the first skied descent without additional oxygen, 8:B - In 2019 she was prime minister for 159 days, or approximately the length of three-and-a-smidgeon Liz Truss premierships, 9:A - It was tight, though, with 50.4% of voters in favour and 49.6% against. So that is sure to go swimmingly, as it always does after a close referendum, 10:A - Apparently only one in 30 million of the critters is that colour, 11:C - It is New Zealand’s fastest bird, capable of flying 124mph (200km/h), and it is the second time it has topped the annual poll, 12:D - Beyoncé has picked up a staggering 35 of the things, 13:C - The Thursday quiz resisted the temptation to ask how many times a visibly annoyed Rory McIlroy dropped the f-bomb in public over the weekend, because it can't count that high, 14:A - The 31-year-old artist, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys and recently starred in Caught Stealing, 15:B - The Thursday quiz isn't convinced that is a real bear name, to be honest</p>
