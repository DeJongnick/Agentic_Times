<h2><strong>Dark Hearts</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Four</strong></p> <p>It’s a second season of this French war drama set in 2016 Iraq from director Ziad Doueiri (of the Oscar-nominated The Insult). We get a sombre start as Group 45 toast goodbye to Olivier, but the action picks up when an intelligence agent comes to help the rescue mission for Sab. However, an attack on the French consulate means all negotiations go out the window. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>Bettany Hughes’ Lost Worlds: The Nabataeans</strong></h2> <p><strong>8.10pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>Have you ever heard of the Nabataeans? This ancient civilisation located in what we now regard as the Middle East has drifted out of universal consciousness, but in terms of power and influence they once went toe-to-toe with the Romans. In this new series, Bettany Hughes uncovers their spectacular hidden history. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>The Count of Monte Cristo</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, U&amp;Drama</strong></p> <p>The heavy-handed adaptation of the classic epic continues with Edmond (Sam Claflin) fizzing with vengefulness as he finally comes face-to-face with his old enemies – and invites them to one hell of an awkward dinner party. Meanwhile, he also sits down with the love of his life – who doesn’t seem to recognise him. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>We Want the Funk</strong></h2> <p><strong>9.10pm, BBC Two</strong></p>    <p>Part concert film and part cultural history documentary, this feature from Emmy-winning director Stanley Nelson Jr takes us on a syncopated voyage through the musical genre of funk. First stop? Berry Gordy’s front parlour, where Black music is about to break free from Motown’s respectability politics and take to dancing in the streets. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2><strong>One Night</strong></h2> <p><strong>9.30pm, ITV1</strong></p> <p>Simone’s (Nicole da Silva) not-so-fictional novel One Night is about to be a smash hit, and old friend Hat (Yael Stone) has clocked that the story is based on secrets from their real lives. As a furious Hat tries to get the book pulled, a journalist is trying to track down the “anonymous” author. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>The Football Interview</strong></h2> <p><strong>11.40pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>Defender Marc Guéhi, who may or may not still be a Crystal Palace player by the time this conversation airs, meets Kelly Somers. In addition to being a silky footballer, Guéhi is a thoughtful man – it will be interesting to hear the background to his decision to augment his rainbow armband with a religious message last season. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Film choice</strong></h2> <p><strong>Shaft</strong>,<strong> 11.30pm, BBC Two</strong></p>    <p>In one way, the lead character in Gordon Parks’s 1971 film is in a direct Hollywood lineage from Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade – a cynical private eye who plays both sides of the law but has a moral compass. However, that Richard Roundtree’s sexy, sardonic John Shaft is Black makes him groundbreaking – a representation of racial confidence rarely seen on screen before. This slick, funky movie doesn’t have any pretensions to high art, though, as Shaft is hired by a Harlem gangster to find his missing daughter, crossing fists with mobsters and militants. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <h2><strong>Live sport</strong></h2> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Man City v Tottenham, 11am, TNT Sport 1 </strong>Followed by Arsenal v Leeds at 5pm on Sky Sports Main Event.</p> <p><strong>Women’s Rugby World Cup: Scotland v Wales, 2.15pm, BBC One </strong>In Salford.
