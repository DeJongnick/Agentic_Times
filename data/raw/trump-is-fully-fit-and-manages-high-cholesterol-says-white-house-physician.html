<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> – the oldest person to ever be elected US president – controls high cholesterol with medication and has elevated blood pressure but is “fully fit”, White House physician Sean Barbabella said in a report released on Sunday.</p> <p>The US navy captain’s report was published two days after Trump underwent a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/12/white-house-promises-details-as-donald-trump-oldest-president-in-us-history-has-medical-check-up">routine physical</a>. It also said he was up to date on all recommended vaccines – despite his national health secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a> having spent years sowing doubt about the safety and efficacy of vaccination.</p> <p>Trump himself has previously spread debunked claims about links between vaccines and autism often <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/rfk-jr-peter-marks-autism">invoked by Kennedy</a>.</p> <p>Barbabella’s report is the most detailed information on the health of Trump, 78, since he returned to the White House in January for a second presidency.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/rfk-jr-peter-marks-autism">RFK Jr giving families ‘false hope’ on autism, says outgoing US vaccine official</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“President Trump exhibits excellent cognitive and physical health and is fully fit to execute the duties of the Commander-in-Chief and Head of State,” Barbabella wrote in his report.</p> <p>The report noted that Trump’s high cholesterol is “well-controlled” with two medications addressing it.</p> <p>The medicines are rosuvastatin and ezetimibe, generic names of the branded drugs Crestor and Zetia. They have improved Trump’s cholesterol over time.</p> <p>Ideally, total cholesterol should be less than 200. At his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223. In early 2019, the reading came in at 196 and it stood at 167 in 2020. In Sunday’s report, it was listed as 140.<br><br>Trump’s blood pressure was 128 over 74. That is considered elevated. And people with elevated blood pressure are likely to develop high blood pressure – or hypertension – unless they take steps to control the condition.</p> <p>The report also noted that Trump has scarring on his right ear, the result of a gunshot wound he suffered when a would-be assassin fired at him during <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donald-trump-pennsylvania-rally-shooting">a campaign rally</a> in Pennsylvania last year.</p> <p>A secret service sniper killed the attacker, who fatally shot one spectator while wounding two others.</p> <p>Barbabella’s report also references Trump’s history with Covid-19. Trump was hospitalized during a serious bout with the virus in October 2020 during a run for re-election that ended in defeat to Joe Biden.</p> <p>Amid questions about his age and mental acuity, Biden then dropped out of an electoral rematch with Trump in November 2024 and endorsed his vice-president, Kamala Harris, to succeed him. Trump won the popular and electoral votes against Harris to return to the presidency.</p> <p>After the exam preceding the report, Trump told journalists on Air Force One: “It went, I think, well ... Every test you can imagine, I was there for a long time, the yearly physical.</p> <p>“I think I did well.”</p> <p>Trump also told reporters he took a cognitive test. Barbabella’s report gave Trump a 30 out of 30 on what is known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/montreal-cognitive-assessment">screening</a> takes about 10 minutes to administer, according to information online. One version available online asks those undergoing the screening to draw a clock, repeat words, name animals and count backwards from 100 at intervals of seven, among other tasks.</p> <p>Trump’s resting heart rate was 62 beats per minute, in line with previous tests. A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 beats to 100 beats per minute. And generally, a lower rate implies better cardiovascular fitness.</p> <p><em>Reuters and the Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 22 April 2025.
