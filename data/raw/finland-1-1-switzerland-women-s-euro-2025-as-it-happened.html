Peng, recently signing for Chelsea, looks like an excellent keeper. There were flashes of quality from Beney, who has just signed for Manchester City. Reuteler and Walti are a formidable duo in midfield and have contrasting and therefore complementary skill sets. Schertenleib is obviously a superstar in the making, and it’s not surprising that she is already at Barcelona. And they do have the strength in depth to change a game, with Wandeler, Crnogorcevic and of course Xhemaili all contributing off the game tonight.</p> <p>If Switzerland do go through to face Spain, I would not completely write them off, particularly in front of this support.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-10T21:15:59.665Z">at 10.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68702b4e8f08087814a70ff4" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-10T21:06:38.728Z">10.06pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>“I was watching the game with a bunch of Finns,”</strong> emails Kári Tulinius. “As a people, they’re not predisposed to expect good things, but as the clock ticked down, they got more and more excited.
