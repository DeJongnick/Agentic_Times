<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has announced deals totaling more than $200bn between the United States and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/united-arab-emirates">United Arab Emirates</a>, including a $14.5bn commitment among <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/boeing">Boeing</a>, GE Aerospace and Etihad Airways, as he pledged to strengthen ties between the US and the Gulf state during a multiday trip to the Middle East.</p> <p>The White House said on Thursday that Boeing and GE had received a commitment from Etihad Airways to invest $14.5bn to buy 28 US-made Boeing 787 and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines. </p> <p>“With the inclusion of the next-generation 777X in its fleet plan, the investment deepens the longstanding commercial aviation partnership between the UAE and the United States, fueling American manufacturing, driving exports,” the White House said.</p> <p>Antonoaldo Neves, the CEO of Etihad, said last month that the airline planned to add 20 to 22 new planes to its fleet of roughly 100 aircraft this year, as it aims to expand to more than 170 planes by 2030 and boost Abu Dhabi’s economic diversification strategy.</p> <p>Etihad, which is owned by Abu Dhabi’s $225bn wealth fund ADQ, has been through a multiyear restructuring and management shake-up, but has expanded under Neves.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/trump-accept-luxury-plane-gift-qatar">Trump says planned gift of luxury plane from Qatar is a very ‘transparent’ deal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said that 10 of the new aircraft this year would be Airbus A321LRs, which the carrier launched on Monday and will start operating in August.

Controversy has dogged the visit after the president announced earlier this week that he planned to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/trump-accept-luxury-plane-gift-qatar">accept a $400m luxury jumbo jet</a> from the government of Qatar, raising numerous ethical concerns.</p> <p>Trump has since doubled down on his plans to accept the airplane as the new Air Force One, and eventually transfer it to his presidential library. “We’re the United States of America. I believe we should have the most impressive plane,” he said on Wednesday.</p>
