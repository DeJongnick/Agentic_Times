<p>An appellate panel on Thursday put on hold an order to wind down operations at the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/26/alligator-alcatraz-detention-camp-removals-florida">Alligator Alcatraz</a>” immigration center in the Florida Everglades, allowing its construction and operation to continue.</p> <p>Last month, a federal judge in Miami <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-alligator-alcatraz-judge-ruling">ordered</a> the closure of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s notorious <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> jail within 60 days, and ruled that no more detainees were to be brought to the facility while it was being wound down.</p> <p>That shock ruling by district court judge Kathleen Williams built on a temporary restraining order she had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/07/trump-immigration-alligator-alcatraz-florida">issued two weeks</a> previously, halting further construction work at the remote tented camp, which has attracted waves of criticism for harsh conditions, abuse of detainees and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/alligator-alcatraz-lawsuit-abuse-immigration">denial of due process</a> as they await deportation, as well as environmental damage.</p> <p>The state of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida">Florida</a>, which funded and built the hastily erected camp and runs it on behalf of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, then appealed.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, a three-judge panel in Atlanta decided by a 2-1 vote to stay Williams’s order pending the outcome of Florida’s appeal, saying the ruling was in the public interest.</p> <p>Ron DeSantis’s administration in late June had raced to build the facility on an isolated airstrip surrounded by wetlands to aid Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">efforts to deport</a> people deemed to be in the US unlawfully.</p> <p>The Florida Republican governor said the location in the swampy and remote Everglades was meant as a deterrent against escape, much like the infamous, now disused, island prison in San Francisco Bay that Republicans named it after.</p> <p>The US president visited the facility and praised its harsh environment for detainees, some of whom have accused the authorities of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/florida-alligator-alcatraz-immigration-velasquez">inadequate medical care</a> and other poor conditions.</p> <p>The 11th US circuit court of appeals ruled in a split opinion that the Trump administration was likely to prevail in a legal battle with environmental groups that say the facility is endangering the fragile Everglades and its wildlife.</p> <p>Two judges sided with the Trump administration, and one judge dissented.<br>The majority ruled that the project, funded by Florida, which is seeking reimbursement fees from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the parent agency of Ice, did not trigger the kind of environmental review needed for federally funded construction projects.</p> <p>Although both DeSantis and the DHS secretary, Kristi Noem, have said the federal government will pay for expanding the detention facility, there is no evidence that federal funds have been used for construction, the court ruled.</p> <p>The detention center cost about $250m to build and covers more than 18 acres (7 hectares). The facility is 37 miles (60km) west of Miami in a vast subtropical wetland that is home to alligators, crocodiles and pythons – imagery that the White House leveraged to show its determination to remove immigrants – and home to many rare birds, plants and creatures such as manatees.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press and Reuters contributed reporting</em></p>
