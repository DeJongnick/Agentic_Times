<p>Paddling through the inky blue water in Stockholm’s outer archipelago, all I can see is scattered islands and birds. Some of the islands are mere skerries – rocky outcrops and reefs so small they can host but a single cormorant drying its outstretched wings – while others, such as our target Bullerön, can be a mile or more in length, with historic fishing huts, summer cottages and wooden jetties sitting among their smoothly weathered rocks and windswept forests.</p> <p>I’m on a two-day sea kayaking tour of <a href="https://www.sverigesnationalparker.se/en/choose-park---list/namdoskargarden-national-park/">Nämdöskärgården</a>, a newly established marine national park, which is a vast 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres) of protected, mostly blue space – it is 97% covered by water – beginning on the outer reaches of the archipelago and stretching well into the Baltic Sea.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/embed-48-zip/giv-32554mgIJIj7JLDt3/" data-alt="Map of Stockholm archipelago"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/embed-48-zip/giv-32554mgIJIj7JLDt3/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>It is Sweden’s second marine national park, alongside Kosterhavet on the west coast, and its creation was approved by Swedish parliament in June this year, a summer in which the country also banned bottom trawling – the destructive fishing practice that Sir David Attenborough has likened to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/ocean-david-attenborough-trawling-fishing-industry-film-documentary">“bulldozing a rainforest”</a> – from its marine national parks and nature reserves by July 2026. It’s the first European country to do so (the UK appears to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/12/the-guardian-view-on-fishing-and-nature-bottom-trawling-boats-dont-belong-in-conservation-zones">rejected whole-site bans</a> in more marine protected areas, despite its earlier pledge to extend these<strong> </strong>– much to the dismay of conservationists). </p> <p>One of the challenges in getting people to care about ocean conservation is that it’s hard to engage with what we can’t see or experience directly, and the idea behind Nämdöskärgården is not just to preserve the area’s unique ecological diversity, but also to make it accessible to visitors in a low-impact way. Sea kayaking – a popular pastime for Swedes throughout the archipelago – is the perfect way to do that.</p>    <p>My guide Johan Montelius, from <a href="https://www.stockholmadventures.com/kayaking/archipelago-tours/">Stockholm Adventures</a>, and I get dropped off by taxi boat on Jungfruskär, which, like many isles in the outer archipelago, is uninhabited. We haul our narrow yellow sea kayaks up on to rocks splattered with grey, green and bright orange lichen, and after a quick safety briefing, Johan shows me our route to Idöborg, an island just outside the marine national park, where we’ll spend the night. It’s a journey of around 5 miles, but he assures me the wind will help push us along in parts and we’ll make plenty of stops along the way.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>The thing that excites me most is the seaweed. It’s a sign of healthy waters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We set off, and after a tricky first 50 metres of paddling into the wind, find ourselves nicely sheltered between two long islands. We settle into an easy, slow rhythm – perfect for tuning into the surrounding natural wonder. There is plenty of birdlife, mostly cormorants, gulls, herons and geese, but we also spot at least five different white-tailed eagles over the two-day trip, as well as a pine marten and a seal. The thing that excites me most, though, is the seaweed, which comes in a host of shades, even the russet colour of autumn leaves. It’s a sign of healthy waters, with the seaweed providing a great nursery for young fish as well as a vital carbon sink – something that absorbs more carbon from the atmosphere than it releases.</p>    <p>We paddle over wonderful seagrass meadows, which glisten when the sun breaks through the clouds, and extensive belts of bladder wrack, or <em>blåstång</em><em>,</em> a dark green seaweed with air pockets. Because the water is so clear, I can see it is also home to lots of periwinkles and other shellfish.</p> <p>We see no other boats or kayaks, partly because it’s a slightly wet and windy day in September – sunny days in July and August are a lot busier, Johan says – but also because with kayaks we can navigate narrow passages between islands that sail boats and other watercraft can’t. At times, we paddle through fields of high reeds, our route no more than the width of a footpath.</p> <p>We stop for lunch on another deserted island, feasting on a delicious fish stew made by Johan the night before. Mindful of leaving no trace in an archipelago where I’ve not seen a speck of single-use plastic all day, we check the spot for litter meticulously before we head off.</p>    <p>The islands are beautiful, but they all look the same to me, so I’ve no idea how Johan is navigating so effectively – he only uses the GPS on his phone once, to check our final crossing to Idöborg as the wind picks up. We stash our kayaks in a sheltered sandy bay on the island and check into our cosy forest cabins, which have full A-frame views of the increasingly agitated ocean. Stockholm Adventures offers wild camping when the weather allows, but tonight I’m glad of a roof over my head.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>We used to groan and say, ‘No more cod,’ but now such fish are far less common and it’s time to protect them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Idöborg is a private island with dense forest, a range of cabin options, and <a href="https://en.idoborg.se/strandbaren">a restaurant</a> that serves tasty, seasonal local food – the jerusalem artichoke soup with seagrass pesto is incredible. It also <a href="https://en.idoborg.se/att-gora-pa-on">has a sauna</a> facing the water, with a wooden jetty that invites dipping in the soft, brackish water in between the waves of heat.</p> <p>When we enjoy it at dusk, the sea still has plenty of energy, but the next morning things are calmer. Our 2.5-mile paddle out to Bullerön, the main island of the Bullerö archipelago, and one of the last islands before the open sea, passes in an easy, meditative haze.</p> <p>The sun comes out, and we visit the former cottage and studio of the influential Swedish nature painter Bruno Liljefors, which now serves as an information centre for Nämdöskärgården, and walk the island’s stunning circuitous footpath. From the highest point, looking out east to the expanse of the Baltic Sea, it feels good to know this stretch of glistening ocean and all that lies beneath it will be protected.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2025/sep/16/steam-baths-and-seaweed-safaris-swedens-spa-island-styrso-gothenburg">Steam baths and seaweed safaris on Sweden’s spa island</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Over breakfast on Idöborg, I chat to Ylva Tenselius, a Stockholm resident and consultant here on a work team-building trip. When she was growing up, her grandfather used to go out and catch cod all the time. “We would groan and say, ‘No more cod,’ when it was served at the dinner table,” she says, adding that she used to catch perch easily herself with a line, but now both are far less common. She welcomes the new marine park and its conservation goals. “We’ve seen the changes and now it’s time to protect it.”</p> <p>When I get home to the UK, I call Charles Clover, co-founder of <a href="https://www.bluemarinefoundation.com/">Blue Marine Foundation</a>, an ocean conservation charity, which is campaigning for bottom trawling to be banned from all UK marine protected areas, to ask what he thinks about Nämdöskärgården. “Anything that protects breeding grounds for fish is a positive step,” he says. “The sea is in such a bad state, particularly the Baltic Sea, so I think these protected areas will bring enormous benefits. They will help repair the sea and help nature help itself.”</p> <p>And he believes low-impact tourism, such as sea kayaking and hiking, can help with that process. “It creates a different use of nature, which is to enjoy it rather than to exploit, and that can only be a good thing.” I couldn’t agree more.</p> <p><em>This trip was provided by </em><em><a href="https://visitsweden.com/">Visit Sweden</a></em><em>.
