<p>Morning everyone. The environment minister, Murray Watt, will warn in a speech today that “it’s now or never” for other parties to back Labor’s nature law changes, while former New South Wales Liberal bigwig Matt Kean has told the Coalition to stop “playing politics” and make a deal so the legislation can pass.</p> 
<p>The mother at the centre of the legal stoush over puberty blockers in Queensland has vowed to keep on fighting, we crunch the numbers on inflation as the US Fed cuts rates, and Donald Trump has fired a federal board as his quest to revamp the White House continues.</p>
