<p><strong>While studying in Glasgow, my daughter lived in a rented flat with a prepayment electricity meter. Shortly after she moved out in the summer of 2022 she was contacted by Scottish</strong><strong>Power about a £1,000 debt.</strong></p> <p><strong>Given it was a pay-as-you-go </strong><strong>meter, we questioned how this was possible</strong><strong>. But instead of </strong><strong>investigating, the debt was passed to a recovery </strong><strong>firm, which started chasing her for money in March 2023.</strong></p> <p><strong>The debt collection firm told us the £1,090 debt had built up between December 2017 and July 2022. In 2017, my daughter was still at school and living at home</strong><strong>. She only lived in the flat from November 2020 to July 2022.</strong></p> <p><strong>Because she was </strong><strong>studying, I offered to sort this out. I went back to </strong><strong>ScottishPower to raise a complaint and threatened to contact the Energy Ombudsman. </strong><strong>Finally, last July, 16 months later, </strong><strong>Scottish</strong><strong>Power confirmed there had been an error during an IT upgrade. </strong><strong>It said the debt had been recalled and the payment default removed from my daughter’s credit file.</strong></p> <p><strong>I thought that was the end of it until last month when I started getting emails and texts from a different debt collection agency. I contacted </strong><strong>ScottishPower but it didn’t respond.</strong></p> <p><strong>Even if I get this new case </strong><strong>closed, how can I be sure that the debt has really been cancelled and that any “black marks” have been removed from her credit file?</strong></p> <p><strong>JL, </strong><em><strong>Perth</strong></em></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/oct/02/scottish-power-billed-my-late-grandfather-for-power-he-didnt-use">Scottish Power billed my late-grandfather for power he didn’t use</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My goodness, what a saga – and one that is genuinely Kafkaesque, given the flat had a prepayment meter that only allowed her to go £5 into the red.</p> <p>In your full letter you correctly point out that under back billing rules, a supplier cannot charge for energy used more than 12 months ago if you were not correctly billed for it. But along the way there have been numerous red herrings.</p> <p>When I asked ScottishPower to investigate, it confirmed the “debt” was written off last year. The issue resurfaced because it then sold written-off debts to a third party. Your daughter’s account was among them even though her case should have been dealt with as a billing adjustment.</p> <p>ScottishPower has now eventually established that payments made by your daughter and her flatmates were being credited to a closed account in the landlord’s name and this was £106 in credit. It is refunding this sum along with a goodwill gesture of £250.</p> <p>A spokesperson for ScottishPower said: “We have withdrawn all action and apologise for the inconvenience this has caused. We’ve issued a goodwill payment in recognition of the customer’s experience and can confirm there will be no adverse effect on her credit rating.”</p> <p><em>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
