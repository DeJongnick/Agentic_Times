<h2><strong>Mrs Robinson</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, Sky Documentaries</strong></p> <p>“Climate change is a man-made problem and requires a feminist solution.” Mary Robinson has one hell of a legacy: Ireland’s first female president – she helped decriminalise homosexuality and legalised female contraception – who later became a UN high commissioner and has put global focus on the climate crisis. As women’s rights are going backwards in the US and the climate challenge is running out of time, she tells her story in this documentary. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>Eisteddfod 2025 With Huw Stephens</strong></h2> <p><strong>7pm, BBC Four</strong></p> <p>The festival of Welsh arts is celebrated in Wrexham this year – with Wrexham FC and its Hollywood owners inspiring the opening show about supporting local teams. Events include a tribute to Dewi “Pws” Morris and a performance by classical harpist Catrin Finch, folk fiddler Patrick Rimes and singer Al Lewis. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Parenthood</strong></h2> <p><strong>7.20pm, BBC One</strong></p>    <p>In India, a pregnant Hanuman langur babysits a mate’s little one to get some practice in. Will she get the hang of it? And how will she stay safe from stray dogs? It’s another round of nature’s sweet and scary parenting moments, this time focusing on animals in the grasslands across the globe. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Ridley</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, ITV1</strong></p> <p>A new case for Adrian Dunbar as the grieving, jazz-loving detective in this Sunday night sleuther. A body found decomposed in thick local woodland belongs to a woman who went missing six years previously. With his team in shock, Ridley has to call on a disgraced ex-officer to help him find the culprit. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</strong></h2> <p><strong>9.20pm, BBC One</strong></p>    <p>The book launch is approaching in the final episode of this impressively realised novel adaptation, and the older Dorrigo is reflecting on his life. He’s still tormented by memories of his wartime experiences but will externalising them allow him a measure of peace? <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>The Veil</strong></h2> <p><strong>11pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>With suspected Islamic State operative Adilah (Yumna Marwan) having escaped her captors, and MI6 agent Imogen (Elisabeth Moss) getting blamed, the two women are separated for much of this episode. But that doesn’t mean their uneasy alliance is over. Meanwhile, has anyone in this show considered the ethics of kidnapping a child for leverage? Seems not. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2><strong>Live sport</strong></h2> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Chelsea v Crystal Palace, 1pm, Sky Sports Main Event </strong>At Stamford Bridge. Followed by Man United v Arsenal at 4pm.</p> <p><strong>Super League Rugby: St Helens v Huddersfield Giants, 2.15pm, BBC Two </strong>From Totally Wicked Stadium.</p>
