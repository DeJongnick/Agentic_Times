class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Murray Watt </strong>has unveiled the scope of the Albanese government’s promised environment protection agency, which confirms the minister will retain the ability to approve projects.</p> <p>The EPA’s power has been among the most contentious parts of Labor’s planned changes to the EPBC Act, with the Coalition, industry and the Greens wanting the minister, rather than an independent body, accountable for major decisions.</p> <p>Under the existing model, the environment minister makes decisions on projects either directly or via an official acting under their delegation.</p> <p>In practice, the minister only personally rules on a small number of significant applications, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/12/north-west-shelf-gas-project-extended-to-2070-with-partial-protection-for-indigenous-rock-art">Woodside’s North-West shelf extension</a> and

90% of decisions.</p>    <p>The new regime will be largely the same except that, rather than delegating decisions to a departmental bureaucrat, that responsibility will fall to officials in the new EPA.</p> <p>The new agency, to be known as the National Environment Protection Agency, will have a range of other functions independent of the minister, including policing nature laws and monitoring compliance with a project’s conditions.</p> <p>Watt said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>At the past two elections we have committed to establish Australia’s first ever National Environment Protection Agency and we intend to deliver on that promise.</em></p> <p><em>An independent NEPA will have strong compliance and enforcement oversight to better protect our precious environment and ensure those who seek to illegally destroy it pay a high price.</em></p> <p><em>But importantly, the minister of the day would still be ultimately responsible for approval decisions, a move that is backed by all sides of politics.</em></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-26T02:34:47.668Z">at 2.34am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div

<p><em>People should be under no illusions that we will be passing these laws through the parliament.
