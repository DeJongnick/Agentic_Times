<p>Reactions on social media to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">murder of far-right activist Charlie Kirk</a> have cost multiple people their jobs as authorities in numerous states clamp down on critical commentary.</p> <p>Among those to have been fired, suspended or censured in recent days for their opinions include teachers, firefighters, journalists, politicians, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/secret-service-employee-who-celebrated-charlie-kirks-assassination-put-immediate-leave">Secret Service employee</a>, a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/nasdaq-terminates-employee-over-social-180948755.html?guccounter=1">junior strategist at Nasdaq</a> and a <a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/panthers-employee-fired-controversial-comments-charlie-kirk-death-raleigh/">worker for a prominent NFL team</a>.</p> <p>The dismissals come as the administration of Donald Trump promises to take action against foreign nationals it deems to be “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/christopher-landau-charlie-kirk-foreigners">praising, rationalizing or making light of</a>” Kirk’s killing, himself a fervent free speech advocate.</p> <p>Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, meanwhile, has ordered staff “to find and identify military members, and any individual associated with the Pentagon, who have mocked or appeared to condone Charlie Kirk’s murder”, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/charlie-kirk-shooter-manhunt-live-updates-rcna230762/rcrd88299?canonicalCard=true">NBC News reported</a> Friday.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/president-elect-to-face-disciplinary-proceedings-for-charlie-kirk-remarks-oxford-union-says">President-elect of Oxford Union to face disciplinary proceedings for Charlie Kirk remarks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The outlet, citing two defense department officials, said several members of the military were relieved of their duties because of social media posts – and that “dozens” more, including civilian Pentagon employees, had been “called out on X”.</p> <p>Along with government efforts to clamp down, a number of conservative figures and groups are attempting to collate and expose examples of commentary seen as objectionable.</p> <p>Others have been subjected to torrents of online abuse or seen their offices flooded with calls demanding they be fired, part of a surge in rightwing rage that has followed the killing.</p> <p>Some Republicans want to go further still and have proposed deporting Kirk’s critics from the United States, suing them into penury or banning them from social media for life.</p> <p>Laura Loomer, a Trump loyalist, <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1965915114072101118">posted to X</a>: “Prepare to have your whole future professional aspirations ruined if you are sick enough to celebrate his death. I’m going to make you wish you never opened your mouth.”</p> <p>Republican congressman Clay Higgins said in a <a href="https://x.com/RepClayHiggins/status/1966114479042593251">post on X</a> that anyone who “ran their mouth with their smartass hatred celebrating the heinous murder of that beautiful young man” needed to be “banned from ALL PLATFORMS FOREVER”. The US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, said <a href="https://x.com/DeputySecState/status/1966114506116927972">on the same site</a> that he had been disgusted to “see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action”.</p> <p>Republicans’ anger at those disrespecting Kirk’s legacy contrasts with the mockery some of the same figures – including Kirk – directed at past victims of political violence, Reuters reported.</p> <p>For example, when former House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, was clubbed over the head by a hammer-wielding conspiracy theorist during a break-in at their San Francisco home shortly before the 2022 midterm elections, Higgins posted a photo making fun of the attack. He later deleted the post.</p> <p>Loomer falsely suggested that Paul Pelosi and his assailant were lovers, calling the brutal assault on the octogenarian a “booty call gone wrong”. Speaking to a television audience a few days after the attack, a grinning Kirk called for the intruder to be sprung from jail.</p> <p>“If some amazing patriot out there in San Francisco or the Bay Area wants to really be a midterm hero, someone should go and bail this guy out,” he said.</p> <p>Loomer and Higgins did not return messages to Reuters seeking comment.</p> <p>Scott Presler, a far-right activist with <a href="https://x.com/ScottPresler">2.3 million followers on X</a>, asked for tips about teachers “celebrating Kirk’s death” – and he has shared posts and social media profiles of alleged wrongdoers, including details of their workplaces, <a href="https://time.com/7316628/charlie-kirk-death-celebrations-social-media-consequences-fired-immigrants-deport/">Time reported</a>.</p> <p>In Florida, the state’s board of education issued a <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G0lTlsRXIAAe-6B?format=jpg&amp;name=large">proactive memorandum</a> specifically warning school employees not to post any personal viewpoints that “may undermine the trust of the students and families that they serve”.</p> <p>Two educators in Clay county were <a href="https://www.claytodayonline.com/stories/ridgeview-elementary-teacher-suspended-for-celebrating-kirks-murder-on-facebook,164654">removed from their classrooms</a> and placed under state investigation on Thursday, one an elementary school teacher who posted to her personal social media account an article about the shooting, and the words: “This may not be the obituary we were all hoping to wake up to, but it is a close second for me.”</p> <p>The other, a high school counselor, alluded in a post to Kirk’s position, expressed in 2023, that it was “worth it” to have “some gun deaths every single year” to protect the “God-given right” of gun ownership.</p> <p>The counselor wrote, “37 years in public education, ready to take a bullet for my kids. No I’m not shedding a tear, he chose to sacrifice himself for the rights [to] be protected. Karma’s a bitch.”</p> <p>The comments were “egregious” and “hateful”, Jennifer Bradley, a Republican state senator, said in a statement.</p> <p>Arguably the most prominent individual to lose employment was Matthew Dowd, a veteran political analyst <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/msnbc-fires-matthew-dowd-charlie-kirk-shooting">fired by MSNBC</a> for suggesting on air that Kirk’s radical rhetoric may have contributed to the violence that killed him.</p> <p>“Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” Dowd said, adding: “You can’t stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and then not expect awful actions to take place.”</p> <p>The network and Dowd issued separate apologies. But in <a href="https://matthewdowd.substack.com/p/a-time-to-see-with-new-eyes?r=95pvg&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;triedRedirect=true">a Substack article</a> published Friday, Dowd said he was the victim of a “rightwing media mob”, and that his words had been misconstrued because he spoke before knowing Kirk was the target or had been fired upon.</p> <p>Most of those who have been fired or suspended, however, are people in regular jobs whose comments displeased their employers or were otherwise exposed. They include a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/secret-service-employee-who-celebrated-charlie-kirks-assassination-put-immediate-leave">Secret Service agent</a> who said Kirk “spewed hate and racism on his show” and “you can’t circumvent karma”.</p> <p>The Carolina Panthers, an American football franchise, <a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/panthers-employee-fired-controversial-comments-charlie-kirk-death-raleigh/">fired a communications coordinator</a> who asked on Instagram: “Why are y’all sad? Your man said it was worth it,” another reference to Kirk’s previous comments on the constitution’s second amendment, guaranteeing Americans the right to bear arms.</p> <p>A reporter covering pro basketball’s Phoenix Suns lost his job for posting comments including: “Truly don’t care if you think it’s insensitive or poor timing to decline to respect an evil man who died.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/trump-fox-friends-charlie-kirk-shooting">Trump declines to call for unity after Charlie Kirk killing in stunning move</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A New Orleans firefighter was <a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2025/09/11/new-orleans-firefighters-social-media-comments-regarding-charlie-kirks-death-being-investigated/">reportedly</a> thrust under investigation by her employer after posting – then deleting – a social media comment that called the bullet that struck Kirk “a gift from god”.</p> <p>Delta Air Lines announced it had suspended employees over “social media content related to Kirk’s killing that the company judged to have gone “well beyond healthy, respectful debate”. According to a statement signed by Delta’s chief executive officer Ed Bastian, the suspensions would remain in effect pending an investigation, and the company made it a point to say “violations of our social media policy can carry meaningful consequences, including termination”.</p> <p>Separately, American Airlines issued a statement on social media saying “employees who promote such violence on social media were immediately removed from service”.</p> <p>“We will continue to initiate action with team members who display this kind of behavior,” American Airlines’ statement <a href="https://x.com/AmericanAir/status/1966950145972396299">said</a>.</p> <p>The Hill <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/5499708-why-are-yall-sad-teachers-firefighters-officials-on-leave-or-fired-over-charlie-kirk-posts/">gave numerous other examples</a> of workers, including nurses, university employees, and others, fired or disciplined for their comments. A teacher in Oregon, it said, lost their job for saying Kirk’s death had “really brightened up my day”.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed reporting</em></p>
