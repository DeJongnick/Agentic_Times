<p>Stefan Stern’s article on CEOs and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives was very timely, and resonated strongly with me (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/18/ceo-donald-trump-anti-diversity-agenda-dei-initiatives-oval-office-workforce">To the CEOs who’ve joined Trump’s fight against diversity, I say this: you’re making a big mistake, 18 February</a>). We live in times where individualism is preferred over community, and connectedness means being connected with our own group, not with the wider world. Those of us in leadership positions have to show some bravery and stand up for what we believe, in the face of the most challenging attacks western democracy has faced since the second world war.</p> <p>While the application of DEI policies should always be critiqued for effectiveness and improvement, it is clear that the current anti-DEI campaign is mainly designed to protect the historic status quo for those in power and to marginalise others. It is based on ideology, not on any serious analysis or research.</p> <p>My support goes to leaders who demonstrate that they are serious about bringing the world together for the benefit of everyone, not just for their own narrow interests. The institutions of democracy and regulated capitalism, while far from perfect, have achieved a huge amount over the last 80 years. They are now being seriously tested, and it is incumbent on all of us, particularly those of us in leadership positions, to show our mettle.<br><strong>Simon Bazalgette<br></strong><em>Kew, London</em></p>
