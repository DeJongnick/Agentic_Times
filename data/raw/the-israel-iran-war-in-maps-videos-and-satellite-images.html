<p>The conflict began on Friday when Israel launched predawn strikes that hit more than 100 targets, including nuclear facilities and missile sites, and killed senior military commanders and scientists. That attack set off an escalating series of tit-for-tat exchanges, raising fears of a wider, more dangerous regional war.</p> <p>Residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out. As of Monday, Iran’s health ministry said 224 people had been killed and 1,277 injured. On Tuesday, Israel said 24 people had been killed and 592 injured.</p> <h2>What has Israel hit?</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/iran_airstrikes_17_jun/giv-32554viS1ZyMyzeGE/" data-alt="Reported Israeli airstrikes on Iran"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/iran_airstrikes_17_jun/giv-32554viS1ZyMyzeGE/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Nuclear facilities<br></strong>Israel’s operation has included strikes on Iran’s uranium enrichment sites at Natanz and Fordow, and a uranium conversion facility at Isfahan.</p>    <p>Video footage posted online on Friday showed the aftermath of an explosion at Natanz, Iran’s most significant nuclear enrichment facility.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F13%2FIranLoop3.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F13%2FIran_loop3.mp4" data-alt="Natanz footage from Friday."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F13%2FIranLoop3.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F13%2FIran_loop3.mp4">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gbrumfiel.bsky.social/post/3lrigtna5ws26">Satellite imagery showed</a> damage to the electrical substation that powers the plant, and the above-ground pilot fuel enrichment plant, which hosts hundreds of centrifuges.
