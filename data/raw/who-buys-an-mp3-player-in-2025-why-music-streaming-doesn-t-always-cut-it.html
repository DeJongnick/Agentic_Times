<h1>Who buys an MP3 player in 2025? Why music streaming doesn’t always cut it</h1>

<p>When I was 18, I bought a heavily reduced MiniDisc player. This wasn’t even what you could charitably call “fashionably late”, given the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/sep/24/sony-minidisc-20-years">format was already on its last legs</a>, but I loved it, and because nobody else was interested, blank discs were dirt cheap. I have a vague recollection of grabbing packs at Poundland, allowing me to create a glorious self-curated library of cheap music, five years before the birth of Spotify.</p> <p>I’m reminded of this because this week I’ve published a piece on the Filter about the portable audio technology that killed them: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/12/best-mp3-players-uk">MP3 players</a>. Or digital audio players, to give them their more accurate name, given MP3 playback is just one of many supported file formats.</p> <p>For some time, I’ve had a nagging feeling that music streaming wasn’t cutting it. Yes, having all the world’s music at your fingertips is a technological marvel, but you have to deal with “kid in a sweetshop” choice paralysis – and even more importantly, it’s not <em>your</em> music.</p> <h2><strong>Rage against the algorithm</strong></h2> <p>While collecting modern players for the piece, I was delighted to find I wasn’t alone in experiencing this disconnect from the modern streaming world. Chris Laidler, office manager at <a href="https://www.advancedmp3players.co.uk/">Advanced MP3 Players</a>, gave me an insight into the kinds of people who reject streaming modernity. My kind of people.</p> <p>When he started in 2017, the customer base was primarily the niche audiophile community, “pursuing high-res audio as a hobby”, he says. People who “talk more about the tech than they do about the music”.</p> <p>But since Covid, these buyers have been joined by a new, more casual customer. For some, there’s an element of nostalgia, but there are more logical reasons, too.</p> <p>“It gets them off an algorithm,” Laidler says. “It’s music they’re seeking out themselves. But it also means they have a device that can store music that they actually own, rather than leasing it from Spotify.”</p> <p>And for audiophiles, smartphone audio just doesn’t cut it. “When you think about it, if your phone’s about that size,” Laidler says, gesturing with his hands, “it means that the DAC [digital-to-analogue converter] that’s in there is only going to be one tiny component of this thing.” Whereas, with dedicated MP3 players, “the entire infrastructure is designed for as accurate music recreation as possible.” And yes, that means wired audio ports as standard. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/25/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-ditching-iphone-7-headphone-jack-would-tick-people-off">Take that, Apple!</a></p> <p>Some people will balk at the price of entry, even if they like the idea in principle. For the purposes of the piece, I capped the eligible price at £650, although the technology can go into the thousands. Don’t worry too much, though. Not only is my budget pick, the excellent <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/236196744286">Snowsky Echo Mini, from an astonishing £66.99</a>, but after a certain price point, it becomes more about chasing a specific sound signature than any noticeable increase in quality.</p> <h2><strong>The tyranny of choice</strong></h2> <p>Ironically, there are so many devices that trying to choose one can echo the paralysis you feel when opening Spotify. “At the audio trade shows, people come in with their little notebooks, and they go around each room making notes about the character of each player and the price,” Laidler says. “But then you see these same people come back the next year, and you ask them, ‘Oh, which one did you end up going for?’ and they’re still deciding.”</p> <p>Should you buy an old MP3 player? Probably not, due to limited storage, weak file-format compatibility and the lack of warranty. “As a nostalgic thing, I think they’re great,” Laidler says, recalling his first one: a “hideous-looking thing” built in to headphones that wrapped around your head.</p> <p>“I like when people bring out these old players and show them off to me when I’m doing trade shows and meetings. We still have an iPod Classic rattling around in the office because we just can’t bring ourselves to part with it. We should really start a museum or something.”</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>This week’s picks</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/11/best-beauty-advent-calendars-2025-tested-uk">The best beauty Advent calendars in 2025, tested (yes, we know it’s early!)</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/13/interiors-experts-choose-under-100-pound-buys">The finishing touch: great buys for under £100 to lift your living space, chosen by interiors experts</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/09/sustainable-swaps-that-worked-readers">‘It’s better than plastic and cheaper’: 20 sustainable swaps that worked (and saved you money)</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/14/how-to-get-your-garden-ready-for-autumn">How to get your garden ready for autumn: 17 expert tips you can do now – and what to skip</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/13/best-supermarket-gherkins-tasted-rated">‘The crunch?
