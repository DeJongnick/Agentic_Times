<p>A 30-year-old man arrested over the Manchester synagogue attack has been rearrested at an airport shortly after being released.</p> <p>Counter-terror police detained the man at Manchester airport on Thursday on suspicion of failing to disclose information about potential terrorist acts. The arrest came within 24 hours of the man being released from custody, where he had been held since the attack at Heaton Park synagogue on Yom Kippur last Thursday.</p> <p>In a statement, Counter Terrorism Policing North West said it did not believe there was any continuing threat to the public after last week’s incident, which led to the deaths of two worshippers.</p> <p>Jihad Al-Shamie, a Syrian-born UK citizen, was shot dead by police after ramming his car into congregants before attacking others with a knife while wearing a fake suicide belt.</p> <p>Shamie, 35, called 999 and pledged allegiance to the extremist group Islamic State while attempting to storm the synagogue, shouting: “This is what you’re going to get for killing our children.”</p> <p>Melvin Cravitz, a 66-year-old father of three, was killed along with Adrian Daulby, 53, who is believed to have been inadvertently shot by police as he ran to block the synagogue doors to stop Shamie getting inside.</p> <p>Three men and a woman were initially arrested by counter-terror police last week on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. All four were released on Wednesday night.</p> <p>However, police said one of those men was then rearrested at 12.34pm on Thursday at Manchester airport on suspicion of failing to disclose information to officers.</p> <p>The man was held under section 38B of the Terrorism Act 2000, which makes it an offence to withhold information that could prevent a terrorist act or that could lead to a prosecution under terror laws. He had since been released on conditional bail, police said.</p>
