<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> signed an executive order on Thursday that instructs the US education secretary, Linda McMahon, to start dismantling the education department, seemingly attempting to circumvent the need to obtain congressional approval to formally close a federal department.</p> <p>The administration may eventually pursue an effort to get Congress to shut down the agency, Trump said at a signing ceremony at the White House on Thursday, because its budget had more than doubled in size in recent years but national test scores had not improved.</p> <p>The federal government does not mandate curriculum in schools; that has been the responsibility of state and local governments, which provide 90% of the funding to schools. Nevertheless, at the White House, Trump repeated his campaign promise to “send education back to the states”.</p> <p>Democrats on Capitol Hill denounced the executive order and warned it could leave in jeopardy millions of low-income families, who rely on federal funding in schools.</p> <p>Hakeem Jeffries, the US House minority leader, said in a statement: “Shutting down the Department of Education will harm millions of children in our nation’s public schools, their families and hardworking teachers. Class sizes will soar, educators will be fired, special education programs will be cut and college will get even more expensive.”</p> <p>Here are the key <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics">US politics</a> story from Thursday:</p>  <h2>Trump orders dismantling of education department</h2>  <p>The executive order targeting the education department, which has been expected for weeks, directed McMahon to take all necessary steps to shut down key functionalities.</p> <p>Trump added at the signing ceremony that he hoped McMahon would be the last education secretary.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/20/trump-executive-order-education-department"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US rejects Mexico’s request for water</h2>  <p>The United States has for the first time refused a request by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico">Mexico</a> for water, alleging shortfalls in sharing by its southern neighbor.</p> <p>“Mexico’s continued shortfalls in its water deliveries under the 1944 water-sharing treaty are decimating American agriculture – particularly farmers in the Rio Grande valley,” the state department said.
