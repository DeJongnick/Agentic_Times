<p>Re your article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2024/sep/13/third-spanish-people-local-area-too-many-foreign-tourists-survey">Third of people in Spain say local area has too many foreign tourists, 13 September</a>), as a Spaniard living in Barcelona, I want to explain why tourism has become a major concern for us. While noise, littering and security are issues for many councils of touristic cities, the most severe impact is on housing. We may tolerate crowded streets, local businesses turning into tourist spots and disappearing, or emergency rooms overwhelmed during tourist season. But the real tragedy is how unaffordable housing has become.</p> <p>Whenever an article promotes a “new fantastic place to visit and live in Spain”, it signals its decline for locals soon after. Once concentrated in a few coastal cities, this problem has now spread to the Canary and Balearic islands, Seville, Valencia, Cádiz, Málaga and&nbsp;even Madrid.</p> <p>Tourist rentals and short‑term lets are more profitable, so greedy property owners and investors prioritise them, driving up prices and making long-term rentals scarce and expensive. Last year, <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/economia/20230330/8863582/alquiler-extranjeros-triplica-llega-43-pisos-barcelona.html">43% of new rentals in Barcelona were signed by foreigners</a>, as locals&nbsp;can no longer afford the rising costs.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.elperiodico.com/es/hospitalet/20240411/el-salario-de-referencia-en-el-area-de-barcelona-se-situa-en-los-1-516-euros-mensuales-100864570">average annual net salary</a> in&nbsp;Barcelona is €18,192, while the <a href="https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20240314/9559481/precio-alquiler-medio-barcelona-1-136-40-euros-2023-10-67-mas-agenciaslv20240314.html">average annual long-term rent</a> reached €13,632 in 2024 – around 75% of a single salary to pay rent. Many families dedicate more than a&nbsp;salary just to keep a roof over their&nbsp;heads. Young people <a href="https://www.lasexta.com/noticias/economia/precio-vivienda-lastre-jovenes-64-18-34-anos-todavia-viven-sus-padres_202404116617c9d88e6602000156fb91.html">cannot&nbsp;afford to move out</a> and elderly residents are struggling&nbsp;to&nbsp;pay rent on their&nbsp;pensions.</p> <p>Locals are being <a href="https://metropoliabierta.elespanol.com/el-pulso-de-la-ciudad/20240414/barcelona-pierde-poblacion-local-mientras-los-expats-se-apoderan-de-la-ciudad/847165363_0.html">displaced by tourists and digital nomads</a>. This is eroding our communities and creating a societal crisis. We urge our politicians to address this issue.&nbsp;This must be put to an end. We have the right to live in our own&nbsp;cities. It should not be difficult&nbsp;to understand.<br><strong>Manuel Arias</strong><br><em>Barcelona, Spain</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
