<p>Queensland authorities are investigating the deaths of thousands of fish that washed up on a popular Gold Coast beach.</p> <p>The state environment department said dead baitfish had been observed at The Spit, at the northern end of the Gold Coast since last Wednesday, but no obvious source of pollution had been found.</p> <p>A spokesperson said water quality monitoring “indicated high water temperature and low dissolved oxygen in the area”, which can cause fish deaths.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/24/worlds-oceans-fail-key-health-check-as-acidity-crosses-critical-threshold-for-marine-life">World’s oceans fail key health check as acidity crosses critical threshold for marine life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Concerned locals posted videos showing dead fish along the shores of the popular spot over the weekend and expressed frustration that warning signs did not appear to be in place for swimmers.</p> <p>The president of Save Our Southern Gold Coast, Kath Down, said “there were thousands of fish that had obviously been there a long time”.</p> <p>“It smelt terrible.

He said policies to help build resilience in marine species populations, including species that were commercially important, would be essential.</p> <p>The Queensland environment department’s spokesperson said council staff had collected water samples and results would be reviewed as soon as they became available.</p> <p>They encouraged members of the public to report any fish deaths to the department’s pollution hotline on 1300 130 372.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
