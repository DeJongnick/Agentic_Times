<p>Good morning. Madelyn Train – whose parents killed two Queensland police officers and a neighbour at a remote property last month – has spoken to Guardian Australia about her mother, father and uncle’s spiral into conspiracy theories before they committed their “evil” crime. Nathaniel, Stacey and Gareth Train were killed by police in the incident that left six people dead at Wieambilla – but before that, their daughter says, she had to mute notifications from them and grew concerned for their mental health.</p> 
<p>Elsewhere, 10 people are dead after a mass shooting at a dance studio in California, and Queensland will join NSW in banning a controversial AI chat website in schools.</p>

<p>Australia is now competitive with the United States when it comes to a per capita comparison of how much cosmetic “work” we’re getting done, Van Badham writes. But, she says, rational appraisal suggests the motivation for surgical de-ageing is “based in an increasingly outdated understanding of what youth represents.” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/23/the-fetishisation-of-youth-might-be-undergoing-a-makeover-when-has-ageing-ever-looked-this-fun">In short: when has getting older ever looked this fun?</a></p>
