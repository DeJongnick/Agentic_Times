And you see the mothers, they love them so much and there’s just nothing they seem to be able to do”, Trump said. “They got to get them food, and we’re going to get them food.”</p> <p>Earlier in the informal news conference, however, Trump had suggested that the blame lies not with Israel, the occupying power that has cut off humanitarian aid deliveries to the besieged Palestinian territory for months, but Hamas.</p> <p>“I think Israel wants to do it, actually”, Trump said to a reporter who asked if Israel could be relied on to provide aid to the starving population. “I can tell you that they want to do it. They don’t want Hamas stealing the money or stealing the food, and that’s what they’ve been doing.”</p> <p>International aid groups have said for months that there is no evidence that Hamas is stealing aid intended for the civilian population of Gaza, and on Saturday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/26/world/middleeast/hamas-un-aid-theft.html">the New York Times reported</a> that Israel’s military “never found proof that the Palestinian militant group had systematically stolen aid from the United Nations”.</p> <p>Trump also told reporters that he was confident that Israel “can do a good job” of overseeing the distribution of food in the Gaza Strip. “They want to preside over the food centers to make sure the distribution is proper”, an apparent endorsement of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/22/food-aid-gaza-deaths-visual-story-ghf-israel">chaotic and deadly system</a> run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a collaboration between Israel’s military and US private contractors, which has led to the killing of more than 1,000 Palestinians since May.</p> <p>Trump also told reporters that he has not yet given up on his scheme to ethnically cleanse the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population, the majority of whom were previously displaced from what is now Israel. “It’s a concept that some people fell in love with and some people don’t. We really have to see how it all works out before we do that”, Trump said. “You could do something spectacular, but that’s a different concept. You could also probably do it if you let some, some are leaving automatically, some would like to leave, I think many would like to leave if they were given an alternative”.</p> <p>“But certainly that was a concept that was really embraced by a lot of people”, the president claimed, “but also some people didn’t like it.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-688953ae8f089a8b8998785d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-29T23:23:07.983Z">12.23am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">House oversight committee rejects Ghislaine Maxwell's demand for immunity to testify</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>A Republican-led congressional committee rejected the convicted sex trafficker <strong>Ghislaine Maxwell</strong>’s demand that she be granted immunity before agreeing to testify about the crimes of the late sex offender <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> to Congress.</p> <p>Maxwell, who was convicted in federal court in New York in 2021 of helping Epstein sexually abuse multiple minor girls over the course of a decade, is serving a 20-year sentence in Florida.</p> <p>Amid the uproar over the Trump administration’s decision not to release documents from the federal investigation into Epstein, who socialized with Donald Trump for more than a decade, Maxwell was subpoenaed to testify privately to the House oversight committee.</p> <p>The committee wants to depose Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, on 11 August 11 at the federal prison where she is being held in Tallahassee.</p> <p>But Maxwell’s lawyer, <strong>David Markus</strong>, wrote to the committee’s chair, Republican congressman James Comer, that “Ms Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity”.</p> <p>Comer’s spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement: “The oversight committee will respond to Ms Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony.”</p> <p>Markus, who has suggested that Maxwell might ask Trump for a pardon, is also asking the supreme court to overturn Maxwell’s conviction, on the grounds that a non-prosecution agreement a federal prosecutor in Florida offered Epstein in 2008 should have barred the later prosecution of Maxwell in New York in 2020.</p> <p>Her lawyer also told Comer that his client would only agree to testify if the deposition was conducted somewhere other than the prison and if she is provided with the committee’s questions in advance.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-30T00:31:15.255Z">at 1.31am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6889471f8f0805ff5de50168" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-29T22:27:09.180Z">11.27pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Congresswoman <strong>Summer Lee</strong>, a Pennsylvania Democrat who has been outspoken in her criticism of Israel’s assault on Gaza, condemned the mistreatment of the American labor activist <strong>Chris Smalls</strong> by Israeli soldiers after they raided the Handala, an aid ship that attempted to reach Gaza as part of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition.</p> <p>“Chris Smalls—a Black American labor leader—was trying to feed Palestinians being starved in Gaza.

Giuffre was hired away from Mar-a-Lago in 2000, but two years later, Trump spoke highly of Epstein to a reporter, and made a point of his friend’s taste for young women. “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy”, Trump told <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/#print" title="">New York magazine</a> in late 2002. “He’s a lot of fun to be with.

The poll was conducted from 7-21 July, while reports of starvation in Gaza led to international criticism of Israel’s decision to restrict food aid but before <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/28/trump-acknowledges-real-starvation-in-gaza-and-tells-israel-to-let-in-every-ounce-of-food">expressed concern over the worsening humanitarian situation</a>.</p> <p>The findings underscore the Israeli government’s dramatic loss of support within America. <strong>But not everyone is shifting — instead, the war has become more politically polarizing</strong>. The rising disapproval is driven by <strong>Democrats</strong> and <strong>independents</strong>, who are much less likely to approve of Israel’s actions than they were in November 2023, weeks after Hamas’ 7 October attacks.</p> <p><strong>Republicans, on the other hand, remain largely supportive of both Israel’s military actions and Netanyahu</strong> (though <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/israel-gaza-war-united-states-right">cracks are indeed emerging</a> in the American right’s typically iron-clad support for the state of Israel).</p> <p>The new poll finds that about 6 in 10 US adults disapprove of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza, up from 45% in November 2023.</p> <p>Support for the war has been dwindling in Gallup’s polling for some time. In March 2024, about half of US adults disapproved of Israel’s military action in Gaza, which fell slightly as the year wore on.</p> <p>In a new low, only 8% of Democrats and one-quarter of independents say they now approve of Israel’s military campaign.</p> <p>Young adults are also much more likely to disapprove of Israel’s actions. <strong>Only about 1 in 10 adults under age 35 say they approve of Israel’s military choices in Gaza</strong>, compared with about half of those who are 55 or older.</p> <p>Views of Netanyahu have also grown less favorable over the past few years, with more viewing him negatively than positively in measurements taken since the war in Gaza began.</p> <p><strong>About half of US adults, 52%, now have an unfavorable view of Netanyahu</strong> in the new poll, which overlapped with his recent visit to the US. Just 29% view him positively.</p> <p>Republicans have a much more positive view of Netanyahu than Democrats and independents do. About two-thirds of Republicans view him favorably, which is in line with last year. About 1 in 10 Democrats and 2 in 10 independents feel the same way.</p> <p>“<strong>This is the first time we’ve seen a majority of Americans, with an unfavorable view of him</strong>,” said Gallup senior editor <strong>Megan Brenan</strong>. “All of these questions in this poll show us basically the same story, and it’s not a good one for the Israeli government right now.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/letter-sanctions-israel-gaza-starvation">Israeli public figures call for ‘crippling sanctions’ on Israel over Gaza starvation</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-29T19:10:30.669Z">at 8.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-688916d28f089a8b89987728" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-29T18:52:12.131Z">7.52pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>As Senate Democrats plan to continue to keep up the pressure on the Trump administration over <strong>Jeffrey Epstein </strong>this week, minority leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> took to the Senate floor earlier to call on the FBI to undertake a counterintelligence threat assessment of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s Epstein connections. </p> <p>Calling for a risk assessment to examine whether foreign countries might have tried to access the Epstein files and possibly exploit the information as leverage over Trump, Schumer said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Americans are right to be angry over the lack of transparency.

What kind of risk could that pose to our national security?</p> </blockquote> <p>He went on:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>National security is not – and should never be – a partisan issue. We need to do everything we can to make sure we’re protecting the US and American families every single day.

The request asks the officials to provide the total number of non-citizens who had their voter registrations cancelled since 2020 as well as a copy of their voter registration records, voting history, date of birth, driver’s license numbers, and the last four digits of a social security number. The department sent a similar request to Orange county last month and then sued the county after officials redacted some information.</p> <p>“It’s deeply troubling,” said David Becker, the executive director for the <strong>Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research</strong>. “It reflects a pretty shocking misunderstanding of federal law regarding list maintenance.”</p> <p>The request for information on non-citizens comes as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has arrested and moved to deport thousands of immigrants. Submitting a voter registration form while ineligible to vote is a crime so non-citizens that do so could be prosecuted and potentially deported.

Some conservative commentators have <strong>walked back their support for Israel’s wa</strong>r; the <strong>US’s famously Zionist ambassador to Israel rebuked the actions of Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank</strong>, and an <strong>unresolved rift over foreign intervention</strong> continues to plague the <strong>Maga</strong> world.</p> <p>You can read the complete analysis here:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/israel-gaza-war-united-states-right">‘The war needs to end’: is the US right turning on Israel?</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-29T17:30:48.747Z">at 6.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6888fe7e8f089a8b89987620" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-29T17:07:06.392Z">6.07pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Further to my last post regarding representative <strong>Marjorie Taylor Greene</strong> becoming the first Republican member of Congress <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jul/29/four-killed-shooting-manhattan-new-york-donald-trump-us-politics-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6888f3f88f087e999b40fd58#block-6888f3f88f087e999b40fd58">to call Israel’s assault on Gaza a genocide</a>, <strong>Steve Bannon</strong>, Trump’s influential former adviser, has told Politico:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It seems that for the under-30-year-old Maga base, <strong>Israel has almost no support</strong>, and Netanyahu’s attempt to save himself politically by dragging America in deeper to another Middle East war <strong>has turned off a large swath of older Maga diehards</strong>.</p> <p>Now President Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/28/trump-acknowledges-real-starvation-in-gaza-and-tells-israel-to-let-in-every-ounce-of-food">public</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/28/trump-netanyahu-starvation-gaza">repudiation</a> of one of the central tenants of Bibi’s Gaza strategy - ‘starving’ Palestinians - will only hasten a collapse of support.</p> </blockquote> <p>Politico also notes vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong>’s remarks in Ohio yesterday, speaking of the “heartbreaking” images from Gaza.

Thursday, four days after the president hailed the “powerful deal” reached with the EU and just hours before a new round of punishing import duties is set to come into effect.</strong></p> <p>Trump has underpinned his tariff policy with an emergency power that is now being challenged as unlawful in the federal courts. On Thursday the US court of appeals for the federal circuit will hear oral arguments in the case, <a href="https://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/opinions-orders/25-1812.ORDER.6-10-2025_2518126102025.pdf">VOS Selections v Trump</a>.</p> <p>A group of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-small-business">small business</a> owners are suing the US president on grounds that he lacks legal authority from Congress to impose severe tariffs that could damage their bottom line. The Trump administration has invoked a 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), claiming that various national emergencies – including US trade deficits with trading partners and the scourge of fentanyl trafficking – demand urgent action.</p> <p>But the plaintiffs <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105.92.0.pdf">have countered</a> that the IEEPA does not give the president the power to impose tariffs, and has never been used in such a way in its almost half a century on the statute books.</p> <p>The case has the potential to derail Trump’s most significant tariff deals and negotiations, which he has made a centrepiece of his second presidency. Given how much is riding on it, the suit is likely eventually to be settled by the US supreme court under its current 6-3 supermajority of hard-right justices.</p> <p>In the short term, the challenge under the IEEPA looms as a black cloud over Trump’s desire to claim victory on the tariff front, as his controversial strategy of slapping hefty import duties on major trading partners continues to roil global trade and markets. On Sunday, Trump struck a deal at his golf club in Scotland with the European Commission chief, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ursula-von-der-leyen">Ursula von der Leyen</a>, that will see 15% import tariffs on most EU goods entering the US.</p> <p>Then on Friday, a day after the appeals court hears oral arguments, Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/07/business/trump-tariffs-trade-deals-august-1.html">latest round</a> of potentially destabilizing import duties is set to kick in.

He was working off-hours as a security guard at the time, New York mayor Eric Adams told reporters, describing him as a “true blue hero”.</p> <p>Authorities offered few details about the three other victims killed by the suspect – two men and a woman. A third male was gravely wounded by the gunfire and was “fighting for his life” in a nearby hospital, the mayor said.</p> <p>Jessica Tisch, the New York City police commissioner, <a href="https://x.com/NYPDPC/status/1949981438842941663">confirmed</a> that “the lone shooter has been neutralized”.
