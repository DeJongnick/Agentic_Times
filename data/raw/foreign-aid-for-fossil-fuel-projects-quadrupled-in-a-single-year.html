<p>Foreign aid for fossil fuel projects quadrupled in a single year, a <a href="https://www.cleanairfund.org/resource/air-quality-funding-2024/">report</a> has found, rising ​​from $1.2bn in 2021 to $5.4bn in 2022.</p> <p>“This shocking increase in aid funding to fossil fuels is a wake-up call,” said Jane Burston, CEO of nonprofit the Clean Air Fund, which conducted the research. “The world cannot continue down this path of propping up polluting practices at the expense of global health and climate stability.”</p> <p>International public funding “does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge” and often does not reach the most affected people, said Adalberto Maluf, national secretary of the urban environment and environmental quality in Brazil, which holds the G20 presidency and will host the Cop30 climate summit next year.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/09/climate-crisis-hurricane-election">Our dystopian climate isn’t just about fires and floods.

In 2022, the G7 group of nations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/30/g7-countries-to-stop-funding-fossil-fuel-development-overseas">agreed</a> on stronger language to end taxpayer funding to projects that create energy by burning coal, oil and gas.</p> <p>While some fossil fuel aid goes to projects that lack clean alternatives even in rich countries, such as making fertilisers or cement, they also include projects in the energy sector for which renewable sources are readily available. The cost of capital for clean energy projects in poor countries is more than double that in rich ones, according to the <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/227da10f-c527-406d-b94f-dbaa38ae9abb/ReducingtheCostofCapital.pdf">International Energy Agency</a>, with high upfront costs and poor loan terms forcing poor countries to keep burning fossil fuels.</p> <p>The report precedes a climate summit in Azerbaijan in November, in which negotiators hope to agree new financial promises.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/09/andrew-forrest-says-net-zero-is-fantasy-so-his-goal-is-real-zero-what-does-he-mean-and-can-he-achieve-it">Andrew Forrest says net zero is ‘fantasy’ so his goal is ‘real zero’.
