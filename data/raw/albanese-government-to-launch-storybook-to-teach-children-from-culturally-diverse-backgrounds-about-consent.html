<p>The Australian government will launch a storybook aimed at teaching children from multicultural backgrounds about body safety and consent on Thursday, but experts say “there is still more to do”.</p> <p>The book, <a href="https://www.childsafety.gov.au/storybook">titled My Superhero Voice</a>, is part of the government’s One Talk at a Time campaign, aimed at preventing child sexual abuse. It was developed by the National Office for Child Safety and consulting agency Cultural Perspectives.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/26/labor-sexual-consent-campaign-children-safety">‘Parents need to step up’: Labor to launch $40m sexual consent campaign to combat ‘confusion’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Project lead Sarah Migliorino said she hoped the book would empower children to speak up when something unsafe or uncomfortable happened.</p> <p>Research <a href="https://www.childsafety.gov.au/resources/national-child-safety-campaign-exploratory-and-developmental-research-final-report">underpinning the campaign</a> highlighted that child sexual abuse was a taboo topic within certain communities and often not discussed. A lack of clarity around what constituted inappropriate behaviour was also identified, which could lead to such behaviour being excused.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The director of research at the National Centre for Action on Child Sexual Abuse, Prof Andrea de Silva, said the storybook was an excellent first step but was concerned the book “puts the onus on the child to speak up”.</p> <p>She said it could often be difficult owing to stigma or shame and the book did not address how a parent should respond.</p> <p>Migliorino said resources around the campaign reiterated that it was never the child’s responsibility to protect themselves from abuse, and the storybook – which features advice from adults about how they react to unsafe situations – was designed to be a conversation starter.</p> <p>There are currently no plans to make the book available in schools, but Migliorino hoped the book, which is available online, would be shared widely among community organisations.</p> <p>“There’s not many resources that actually take cultural identity and look at the way that impacts parents … and the way they raise their children.”</p> <p>The book features references to community members, connections to the land and traditional dance, though Migliorino was careful not to single out a particular religion or culture.</p> <p>Its protagonist, Nour, learns from role models in her community about consent and how to manage feeling uncomfortable and unsafe.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/07/australia-federal-police-sadistic-child-sextortion-warning">Australian police are warning about ‘sadistic sextortion’. Here’s how it works, and the red flags for parents</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, de Silva said the book did not explore the “cultural dimensions of the issue”, such as behaviours common in certain cultures that might limit children’s body autonomy – for example, greeting adults through kissing – which might be considered an important sign of respect that a child was expected to obey.</p> <p>Dr Leanne Beagley, the chief executive of the National Centre for Action on Child Sexual Abuse, said the book did not teach parents to recognise when their children were feeling unsafe: “There needs to be a strong message that adults should be protecting children … We still have more to do.”</p> <p>The book’s Ugandan-Canadian author, Yvonne Sewankambo, said different cultural wisdoms fuel the protagonist’s superpower, allowing parents, carers and community members to see how their beliefs and practices could be included in conversations with children.</p> <p>“Every child and young person has the right to safety, and it is everyone’s responsibility to prevent child sexual abuse,” the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said.</p>
