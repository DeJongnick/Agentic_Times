<p>Police searching for German backpacker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/09/carolina-wilga-german-backpacker-missing-in-rural-western-australia">Carolina Wilga, who is missing</a> in a remote part of Western Australia, have found an abandoned van believed to have mechanical issues.</p> <p>The 26-year-old has not been seen or heard from since she visited a general store in the small town of Beacon, in WA’s north-east Wheatbelt region, on 29 June.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon police found the Mitsubishi Delica that Wilga had been driving, but the backpacker was not at the scene, WA police said in a statement.</p> <p>“The vehicle was located abandoned in the Karroun Hill area, in the north-east Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, and is believed to have suffered mechanical issues.</p> <p>“The search to locate her is continuing, with additional resources being deployed to the area.”</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/embed-3-zip/giv-32554dBxUlD2R9ooR/" > <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/embed-3-zip/giv-32554dBxUlD2R9ooR/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Det Sen Sgt Katharine Venn on Thursday described the search as a missing person investigation with “no indication that there’s any third party involvement in her disappearance”.</p> <p>But her phone is not switched on and police have said they are “very concerned” for Wilga, who has been backpacking in Australia for two years.</p> <p>Helicopters, planes and other vehicles were combing the Beacon area, more than three hours north-east of Perth.</p> <p>Her mother has pleaded for help to find her daughter, writing on Facebook that she was “sorely missed”.</p> <p>“I’m her mother and need her help, as I can’t do much from Germany,” Katja Will wrote. “If anyone has any information, please contact the police. Please keep your eyes open!!”</p> <p>Wilga is slim, with long wavy brown hair, brown eyes, and tattoos including symbols on her left arm.</p>    <p>The day before the Beacon sighting, Wilga went to a convenience store in Toodyay, which is also in the Wheatbelt region.</p> <p>Venn said police were taking the case “very seriously” but that it was also possible Wilga was visiting picturesque, but “very remote” tourist spots.</p> <p>“She could be off-grid, not have access to her phone, and she certainly had the capacity in the vehicle she was travelling in to be self-sufficient for quite some time,” Venn said.</p> <p>“[Her] family are understandably distraught, very worried, as any of us would be with a young family member the other side of the world, missing in such unusual circumstances.</p> <p>“Someone out there must have some vital information which can assist WA police in bringing Carolina back to her family and friends.”</p> <p>Police have urged anyone with information to make contact.</p> <p>They have also asked anyone with footage in Beacon or the surrounding north-east Wheatbelt area between 29 June and 4 July to<a href="https://wapf.au.evidence.com/axon/community-request/public/carolinawilga"> upload it directly here</a>.</p>
