<p>Australian households could save as much as $4,300 a year by switching to solar panels, installing batteries and driving an electric car, according to Treasury modelling, though renters may miss some of those benefits.</p> <p>The new analysis was included as part of the Climate Change Authority’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/19/labors-2035-emissions-target-may-be-middle-of-the-road-but-it-shows-theres-no-going-back-on-climate">recommendation</a> that the government pursue a 2035 emissions reduction <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/18/what-is-a-climate-target-australia-2035-global-comparison">target</a> of 62-70%.</p> <p>Treasury also concluded that an “orderly transition” towards net zero would leave wholesale electricity prices 10% below the historical average, and warned that power costs would be substantially higher over the coming decades if action to reduce emissions were delayed or even scrapped.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/18/albanese-unveils-responsible-new-climate-target-to-slash-emissions-over-next-decade">Bowen says cutting emissions by more than 70% ‘not achievable’ as 2035 target criticised from all sides</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chris Bowen, the climate change and energy minister, seized on the modelling, saying it backed the argument “that action on climate change and action on cost of living is not a choice”.</p> <p>“What’s good for your pocket is also good for the planet,” Bowen said.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/6AIHY/1/" data-alt="Electrification savings Australia"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/6AIHY/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The Treasury analysis showed that a typical household over the longer term could cut their energy cuts by $1,000 a year by electrifying their household appliances, heating and hot water systems – even after accounting for upfront costs.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Also installing solar panels, a home battery and driving an EV could slash the energy bills by about 40%, or $4,300 a year – again after accounting for the purchase, installation and financing costs.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, was quick to dismiss the modelling as a “fantasy” that would be proved as wrong as Labor’s 2022 commitment to reduce power bills by $275.</p> <p>Wary of tying the government to a precise number, Bowen said the latest prediction of lower energy costs under a net zero transition was “not a political promise”.</p> <p>“It’s a statement of modelling by expert agencies.”</p> <p>Alison Reeve, the director of the Grattan Institute’s energy and climate change program, agreed that the push to renewable energy and electrification would deliver both a greener economy and cheaper power bills.</p> <p>The exact savings were hard to predict, but “the thrust of it is right”.</p> <p>“It’s already really clear how people have benefited from this transition over the past decade, and that’s a really positive story,” she said.</p> <p>Many Australians already have a stake in the clean energy transition.</p> <p>About 4.2m homes have installed rooftop solar systems, or about 40% of all the households, alongside 271,000 battery systems, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-09-16/cheap-evs-abundant-solar-calm-net-zero-backlash-in-australia">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p> <p>Reeve said the challenge now was to ensure that all households were able to benefit from electrification.</p> <p>“If you’re renting, it’s hard to access these savings. Battery rebates are great, but we still have one-third of households who rent and who can’t even get rooftop solar,” she said.</p> <p>“There has to be a real focus to make sure it’s not just well-off homeowners who benefit from that electrification story.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
