<p>It was a setting fit for a Nancy Meyers film. We were in Oregon wine country, in a rustic-chic barn that reeked of stealth wealth, for a friend’s rehearsal dinner. “This venue is perfect,” I told the groom-to-be. He leaned in as if to tell me a secret: “I found it on ChatGPT.”</p> <p>I smiled tightly as this man described using generative AI for the initial stages of planning the wedding. (They also hired a human wedding planner.) I responded politely. Inside, however, I resolved: if my future spouse came to me with wedding input courtesy of ChatGPT, there would be no wedding.</p> <p>Some people have the typical relationship non-negotiables. Doesn’t smoke, is a cat person, wants kids. Over the past few months, as warnings of an impending AI-induced doomsday have dominated my news feed and party conversations, I’ve come up with a new one. I will not date someone who uses ChatGPT. (Or any generative AI program really, but with <a href="https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/">700 million weekly users</a>, ChatGPT is by far the most popular and thus the object of my scorn.)</p> <p>I’ve heard all the “what if’s”. <em>What if I use it for my job, but I hate it otherwise? What if I use it to help people? What if I only use it as a proofreading tool – I’d never use it to “write” anything. </em>To all that I say: there are people out there for you. But I am not one of them.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/01/gen-z-dating-rules">Golden retriever boyfriends and ick lists: gen Z’s dating rules are making them ‘constantly disappointed’</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/01/gen-z-dating-rules">“Getting the ick”</a> is what we sometimes call being turned off. Part of having an ick is not really understanding <em>why</em> you found someone’s behavior so unseemly. For instance, I once got the ick watching a man drink a smoothie from a straw. At first, my ChatGPT aversion felt like a mere ick, a kneejerk feeling of disgust that lacked any solid reasoning.</p> <p>But here we are, in fall 2025, and using the program even for benign tasks such as figuring out a fitness routine or deciding what to wear feels an increasingly political choice. We know that the energy-intensive tech <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/09/big-tech-datacentres-water">drains our water supply</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/16/what-the-data-center-boom-means-for-americas-environment-and-electricity-bills">hikes electricity bills</a>. It is sold as a placebo for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/30/teenage-boys-using-personalised-ai-for-therapy-and-romance-survey-finds">human connection</a>; lonely, disconnected people finding companionship or even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships">falling in love</a> with code is not as much a sci-fi plot point as it is just the way things go now. The megarich tech bros in charge of all this think in terms of profit first and people second.</p> <p>OK, so ChatGPT helps you write your grocery list. Does your individual convenience outweigh the societal harm it can cause?</p> <p>As if it hadn’t done enough already, ChatGPT has somehow made dating even worse. A good friend recently told me that she spent a night with a man, and in the morning suggested they get breakfast together. He took out his phone, opened ChatGPT, and asked for restaurant suggestions. Why get close to someone who outsources decisions, including the fun ones like picking where to eat? If someone is so lazy they’ll hit up ChatGPT to plan a first date, imagine how little effort they’ll spend six months in.</p> <p>I just cannot imagine forming a deep, lasting connection with someone who regularly interacts with a technology that’s kneecapping our collective attention spans and perhaps heralding total apocalypse. Intellectual curiosity, creativity, originality – I probably won’t find what I value in someone who thinks “productivity” means asking an app to summarize a movie plot so they don’t have to waste their time, you know, watching it.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Ask yourself if your [dating] preference is truly serving your long-term goals</p> <footer> <cite>Ali Jackson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ali Jackson, a dating and relationship coach based in New York, uses ChatGPT for some tasks – but she is not an evangelist. In the past six months or so, she says “every one” of her clients has come to her complaining about “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/12/chatgpt-ed-into-bed-chatfishing-on-dating-apps">chatfishing</a>” or people who use AI to generate everything on their dating apps – all the way down to the DMs they send. I asked Jackson if my strike against ChatGPT chumps was too harsh. She said no, go forth and judge, though it might limit my dating pool –<strong> </strong>about 10% of the adult population now <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/pdf/a253471f-8260-40c6-a2cc-aa93fe9f142e/economic-research-chatgpt-usage-paper.pdf">uses</a> the tech.</p> <p>“Ask yourself if your preference is truly serving your long-term goals,” Jackson said. “In your case, I would assume that’s one of your values, and it’s important to find someone whose values are aligned with yours.”</p> <p>Other people get the AI ick, and not just when it comes to dating. Ana Pereira, 26, lives in Brooklyn and does sound for various live music venues across the city. She fantasizes about going into her phone settings and deactivating AI features on all her apps, though tech platforms from Google to Spotify make it nearly impossible to opt out. Pereira thinks that using ChatGPT “shows such a laziness”.</p> <p>“It’s like you can’t think for yourself, and you have to rely on an app for that,” she said.</p> <p>Two of Pereira’s friends recently had a messy breakup. She sided with one of them after learning the other went to ChatGPT, a notoriously awful therapy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/27/chatgpt-suicide-self-harm-openai">alternative</a>, not their partner, when they wanted to talk about their feelings. “It’s like they didn’t want to sit through any uncomfortable human feelings,” she said. “They just wanted to process something and move on, which is not how things work.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Suddenly I couldn’t do it by myself.

Your life is probably not that hard. We can make the list together.”</p> <p>When director Guillermo del Toro said he would “<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/guillermo-del-toro-would-rather-die-than-use-generative-ai-1236597071/">rather die</a>” than use generative AI, it made headlines. Ditto for SZA’s Instagram stories <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sza-ai-use-environmental-racism-pollution-1235387310/">tirade</a> against the tech warning about “environmental racism” and expressing fear over users who are “codependent on a machine”.

I think these quotes go viral for a reason: people agree with them.</p> <p>Even, to an extent, the people who power the tech industry. Last month, Pinterest added a filter that lets users <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ai-is-ruining-pinterest-heres-why-its-such-a-big-problem/">turn off</a> AI content. Meta lets users mute, but not entirely deactivate, similar slop on Instagram. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/rise-cursor-resistance-techies-want-ignore-ai-coding-tools">reported</a> that “cursor resistance” is on the rise, as some Silicon Valley techies won’t use AI to write their code.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/09/ai-chatbot-love-relationships">The women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Luciano Noijeen, a lead software engineer based in Greece and the Netherlands, told me that he enthusiastically used AI in the past to write or punch up his coding. Over time, he found he could not code on his own. “I’d done it on autopilot in the past,” said Noijeen, who is 27. “Then suddenly I couldn’t do it by myself. I was too reliant on AI to do the most basic things [at work].”</p> <p>Noijeen stopped using AI to code, and uses it very sparingly in his personal life. He will make fun of friends who use it too much. He recently met up with an old friend who lives a three-hour train ride away. They decided to meet in the middle. The friend said he would use ChatGPT to find the right spot, but Noijeen just looked at a map. “There’s a city exactly between us,” he said. “Why do you need to ask ChatGPT for that?”</p> <p>It’s not that I want to date a machine-smashing luddite (though I wouldn’t be <em>opposed</em>). Naive as it may sound, I want to live a life free of ChatGPT’s chokehold. I recently put this stance on a dating app profile, answering Hinge’s “You should *not* go out with me if” prompt with: “you use ChatGPT for literally anything.” It helps get the point across.</p>
