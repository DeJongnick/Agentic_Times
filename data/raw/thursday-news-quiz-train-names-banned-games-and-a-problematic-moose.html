Italy haven't qualified for the last two men's World Cups. Coincidence?, 3:D - The portrait was completed in July 1943 and was only displayed a handful of times before it disappeared into a private collection. The Thursday quiz can recommend the new Picasso exhibition at Tate Modern in London, 4:B - Trainy McTrainface didn't get a look in, 5:A - Every good train nerd knows that the pub was built 200 years ago at the end of the Yarm branch of the Stockton &amp; Darlington railway, 6:A - Emil had to be moved after occupying one of the country's busiest railway lines, halting traffic for four hours, and appeared ready to something similar on an autobahn, 7:A - Dr Hugo Lassauce recorded the (ahem) 'saucy' event. You see what we did there, right?, 8:B - The bigger question here is why someone who earns a reported £4.25m a year insists their 75-year-old father still needs to go out to work at 2am every night, 9:A - Not perhaps the most inspiring of titles, to be honest, 10:C - It was indeed Austria's capital, which needed to get this out of the way so it is free to host the 70th edition of Eurovision next year, 11:D - The artist, whose real name was Keith McIvor, had been diagnosed with an untreatable brain tumour, which he announced in July. His partner in Optimo was Jonnie Wilkes, 12:D - To be honest, the quiz has made a light-hearted question out of it here, but it sounds like it has been a nightmare for Bailey and several other animals inside the Northern Ireland prison system, 13:B - He recorded a time of just under three hours. Well done that man!, 14:A - So slightly over the duration of two Liz Truss premierships, 15:B - The company, which commissioned the display, said it was 'out of line with Arc’teryx’s values'</p>
