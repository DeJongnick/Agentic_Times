These usually involve the very largest businesses and so could prompt a significant knock-on impact in terms of jobs and supply chains if they continue to rise.

The buzzword here is tokenised deposits – a bit of a mouthful, but really it is the application of digital technology to the form of money that we have today. The challenge is to apply this to both domestic and cross-border and cross-border currency payments.</p> <p>To be clear, I am not against stablecoins, but they do have to meet the test of singleness of money. I am not against Central Bank Retail Digital Currency, but I question why it is needed if innovation proceeds as I think it should.</p> </blockquote> <p>(Tokenized deposits are digital tokens issued by regulated banks that represent claims on bank deposits. which allow bank account balances to be represented on a blockchain).</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6855115f8f081eab3065a3e4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-20T08:07:25.420Z">9.07am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Markets rise as Trump sets two-week window to decide on Iran attack</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>European stock markets are rallying in early trading, after Donald Trump opened a two-week window for a diplomatic solution to the conflict between Israel and Iran.</strong></p> <p>Last night’s news that Trump will decide in the next two weeks whether the U.S. will get involved in the Israel-Iran war has created some relief in the markets.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/trump-iran-attack-plans-denial">Trump denies approving Iran attack plan but will make decision ‘within two weeks’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Germany’s <strong>DAX</strong> share index is up almost 1%, and France’s <strong>CAC</strong> is 0.75% higher.</p> <p>In London, the <strong>FTSE</strong> <strong>100</strong> index has gained 44 points or 0.5%, with airline shares higher but oil companies falling.</p> <p>The price of Brent crude oil has dropped by 2.3% to $77 per barrel, as worries of US involvement in Middle East ease.</p> <p><strong>Neil</strong> <strong>Wilson</strong>, UK investor strategist at <strong>Saxo</strong> <strong>Markets</strong>, says some of the “geopolitical risk premia affecting global markets heading into the weekend” has diminished, adding:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>European ministers are due to meet Iran’s foreign minister in Geneva today to hash something out.

The good news is that cumulative borrowing for the first two months of the fiscal year is £2.9bn lower than the OBR forecast in March, which will give the chancellor something to cheer.</p> <p>“On the details, government spending came in at £99bn, slightly below the OBR forecast due to a smaller increase in debt payments. Tax receipts were £82.5bn, also slightly below forecast, but there were signs the increase in employment taxes is feeding through into higher receipts as national insurance receipts exceeded the forecast. Crucially, the current budget deficit, which is now what matters for the fiscal rules, came in £0.2bn below the OBR forecast.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tighter fiscal policy could encourage the Bank of England to lower interest rates, after leaving borrowing costs unchanged yesterday <strong>Pugh</strong> adds:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Looking ahead to the budget in the autumn, the under performance of the economy and higher borrowing costs mean the chancellor may already have lost the £9.9bn of fiscal headroom that she clawed back in March. Throw in the tough outlook for many government departments announced in the spending review and u-turns on welfare spending and the chancellor will probably have to announce some top-up tax increases after the summer.</p> <p>“We are pencilling in tax increases of £10-£20bn.
