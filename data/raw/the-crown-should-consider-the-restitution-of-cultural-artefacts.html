<p>Your report on the return of art looted by the Nazis (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2024/nov/10/the-spoils-director-says-film-forces-art-world-to-confront-loaded-issue-of-restitution">10 November</a>) also refers to campaigns for returning artworks now held in the global north to their countries of origin. Mentioned are collections in museums and other institutions. Among those institutions should be the crown, which holds unparalleled collections of art of various kinds, the great majority of it never seen in public. While we might wish the British Museum or an Oxbridge college to reconsider their policies towards their various treasures, at least they can argue that some of the public can actually see them. Is&nbsp;it really the case that it is only the crown that is capable of guarding great works of art and should have privileged access to them?<br><strong>Mary Evans</strong><br><em>Patrixbourne,</em> <em>Kent</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
