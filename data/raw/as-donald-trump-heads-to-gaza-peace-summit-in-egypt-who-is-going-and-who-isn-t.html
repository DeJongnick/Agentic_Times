<p>Donald Trump and Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/donald-trump-and-abdel-fattah-al-sisi-to-chair-gaza-peace-summit">co-host a summit of more than 20 world leaders</a> in Sharm El Sheikh on Monday, after the US president first visits Israel to speak at the Knesset and meet families of the hostages.</p> <p>The summit’s aim is “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability”, according to the Egyptian presidency.</p> <p>The impressive aims of the meeting are matched by a similarly impressive guest list, many of whom have played a vital role in securing the ceasefire and hostage release deal that is currently in place.</p> <p>The continuing success of the deal – and how closely the next stages match up to Trump’s 20-point peace plan – are all expected to be up for discussions at Monday’s meeting.</p> <h2>Who is going to the Gaza ‘peace summit’?</h2> <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong></p> <p>The US president will be seeking to advance his peace, with several crucial elements – including how Gaza is to be ruled when fighting ends, and the ultimate fate of Hamas – still unconfirmed. Still, Trump is riding high on his current successes, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/12/trump-israel-gaza-war-hostages">telling reporters on Sunday</a> “the war is over”.</p> <p><strong>Abdel Fatah al-Sisi</strong></p> <p>Egypt has played a leading role in negotiations between Israel and Hamas over the course of the two-year conflict. Al-Sisi’s invitation for Trump to take a “victory lap” of the region will help ensure the ceasefire sticks, a source told Reuters.</p> <p><strong>Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani</strong></p> <p>Qatar’s Emir was reportedly among the Arab leaders pushing to bind Trump to the peace process, hoping that tying it to the president would help ensure its success.</p> <p><strong>Mahmoud Abbas</strong></p> <p>Trump’s peace plan left open the possibility of a role for Abbas’s Palestinian Authority in Gaza – contingent on various reforms – but Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected such an idea.</p> <p><strong>Also in attendance:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>French President: <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong></p></li> <li><p>Turkish President: <strong>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</strong></p></li> <li><p>UK’s prime minister: <strong>Keir Starmer</strong></p></li> <li><p>Spanish prime minister: <strong>Pedro Sánchez</strong></p></li> <li><p>Italian prime minister: <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong></p></li> <li><p>European council president: <strong>Antonio Costa</strong></p></li> <li><p>UN secretary-general: <strong>António Guterres</strong></p></li> <li><p>Arab League secretary-general: <strong>Ahmed Aboul Gheit</strong></p></li> <li><p>Jordan’s King <strong>Abdullah II</strong></p></li> <li><p>Kuwait’s prime minister: <strong>Ahmad Al Abdullah Al Sabah</strong></p></li> <li><p>Bahrain’s King <strong>Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa</strong></p></li> <li><p>Indonesia’s President: <strong>Prabowo Subianto</strong></p></li> <li><p>Azerbaijan’s President: <strong>Ilham Aliyev</strong></p></li> <li><p>German Chancellor: <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong></p></li> <li><p>Dutch prime minister: <strong>Dick Schoof</strong></p></li> <li><p>Greek prime minister: <strong>Kyriakos Mitsotakis</strong></p></li> <li><p>Armenian prime minister: <strong>Nikol Pashinyan</strong></p></li> <li><p>Hungary’s prime minister: <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong></p></li> <li><p>Pakistan’s prime minister: <strong>Shehbaz Sharif</strong></p></li> <li><p>Canada’s prime minister: <strong>Mark Carney</strong></p></li> <li><p>Norway’s prime minister: <strong>Jonas Gahr Store</strong></p></li> <li><p>Iraq’s prime minister: <strong>Mohammed Shia al-Sudani</strong></p></li> </ul> <h2>Who is not going to the summit?</h2> <p><strong>Israeli officials</strong></p> <p>Israel will not send a representative to the peace summit, a spokesperson for prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday.</p> <p><strong>Representatives from Hamas</strong></p> <p>A Hamas political bureau member said the group “will not be involved”, adding that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous talks on Gaza.</p> <p><strong>Iranian officials</strong></p> <p>Iranian state media reported that Egypt had invited Iran to attend the summit, but on Monday the country confirmed that neither its President Masoud Pezeshkian nor foreign minister Abbas Araghchi would take part.</p> <p>On Monday, Araghchi posted on X: “Neither President Pezeshkian nor I can engage with counterparts who have attacked the Iranian People and continue to threaten and sanction us,” in reference to the United States.</p> <p>Washington briefly joined Israel in attacks that targeted Iran’s nuclear sites during a 12-day war in June.</p>
