It sort of demonstrates the way over the last six or seven years that the criminal gangs have got an absolute foothold in the tragic trafficking of people across the Channel.”</p> <p>Smith added:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>Our borders bill, which is currently going through parliament, will also enable there to be even stronger terrorist style powers to help us to challenge the gangs and the criminals who are profiting from people’s distress and who are behind this terrible trade … </em></p> <p><em>It’s concerning if people think we don’t have a grip on our borders, as we’ve seen over recent years. And it’s concerning because this is a terrible trade in which people die and are exploited for profit, and that’s why the practical steps that we’ve taken in terms of the deal with the French, in terms of more powers for our Border Force, in terms of more people to be able to make the sort of arrests that I’ve been talking about, in terms of the doubling of the asylum claims that we’ve been able to process, because in the end, what will put people off is understanding that if you get to the UK decisions will be made quickly about you. </em></p> <p><em>And if you don’t have a right to be here, you will be returned and we’re already seeing that with the French scheme.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The government said last week that the new “one in, one out” returns deal with France was up and running. </p> <p>The deal will allow the UK to return one person who has entered the country by irregular means in return for taking someone in France whose claim for asylum in the UK is expected to have a greater chance of success. </p> <p>But Home Office sources <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/05/uk-to-bear-transport-costs-of-one-in-one-out-asylum-seeker-deal-with-france">told the Guardian’s Home affairs editor</a>, Rajeev Syal, it will only apply to about 50 asylum seekers at first. </p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-689afd7d8f08bfc62530e905" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-12T08:46:29.212Z">9.46am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Several assertions made by senior politicians about immigration have been disputed or debunked in recent days and weeks.

Here is one example:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>Conservative <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, the shadow justice secretary, said on Radio 4’s Today programme last Monday that 40% of sexual crimes in London last year were committed by foreign nationals.</em></p> <p><em>The claim was sourced from <a href="https://www.migrationcentral.co.uk/p/up-to-47-of-sexual-offence-charges">the Centre for Migration Control</a> (CMC), a thinktank and blog that describes its purpose as “controlling and reducing migration to Britain”. It is run by the Reform UK activist Robert Bates …</em></p> <p><em>CMC’s claims come from the Metropolitan police’s <a href="https://www.migrationcentral.co.uk/p/up-to-47-of-sexual-offence-charges">response to a freedom of information request</a>. The Met issued a breakdown of the number of people who had been proceeded against – ie brought before a court – for sexual offences by nationality. This does not mean they have been found guilty of committing the offence as Jenrick said. For example, there were 14,242 defendants brought to court for sexual offences at magistrates courts in England and Wales in 2024, but 8,098 convictions, according to Ministry of Justice statistics.</em></p> <p><em>“Some of the data we’re seeing is very striking,” Jenrick also said. “Afghans and Eritrean nationals are 20 times more likely to be convicted of a sexual crime than a British national.” The statistic about Afghans has been repeated by Reform UK’s chair, Zia Yusuf.</em></p> <p><em>This is a muddled figure that also came from the CMC, after it submitted freedom of information requests to the MoJ. It is based on population statistics from 2021 but data on offences covering the years between 2021 and 2023. </em></p> <p><em>That means the statistic is likely to be based on a significant underestimate of the number of Afghan and Eritrean nationals in the UK – meaning the comparison with British rates is unlikely to be 20 times as high. Immigration to the UK from Afghanistan has risen significantly since 2021 because of the Taliban’s return to power, while Eritrean migration has also risen due to wars in Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia.</em></p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-689afb278f08f4cafb5adf17" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-12T08:36:08.755Z">9.36am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Reform MP for Runcorn and Helsby, <strong>Sarah Pochin</strong>, told journalists yesterday that women are at risk of sexual assault and rape from small boats migrants.</p> <p>During a press conference for Women for Reform, she accused illegal migrants from “predominantly Muslim” countries of having a “medieval view of women’s rights fundamentally alien to our own western values”.</p> <p><strong>Jacqui Smith</strong>, an education minister, told LBC this morning that Reform is wrong to single out small boat migrants as a threat to women’s safety.</p> <p>Smith, a former home secretary, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>No I don’t think they’re right to single those people out.
