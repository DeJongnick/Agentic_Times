<h1>Monday briefing: How the two-year effort to keep the Afghanistan data breach secret fell apart</h1>

<p>Good morning. It has been described as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/15/thousands-relocated-data-leak-afghans-who-helped-british-forces">the worst data breach in British history</a>. A British defence official sent an email in 2022 containing the names and details of more than 18,700 people in Afghanistan who had applied for asylum under the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme; but somehow, some of the information on the spreadsheet was later leaked on a Facebook group.</p> <p>The Afghan people named in that spreadsheet became immediate and obvious targets for reprisals by the Taliban, and so the British government scrambled to resettle 900 individuals affected, along with 3,600 family members. While the resettlement route is now closed, the government has promised to honour 600 invitations already made to any named person still in Afghanistan and their immediate family. The cost of the whole operation is expected to reach £850m. </p> <p>Amid the shocking details of this scandal, what is perhaps most extraordinary is that, until last week, the majority of the British public had no idea that it had happened. We were not legally allowed to know about the leak, or to know that thousands of Afghans who worked with British forces were put at risk, or to know that thousands were resettled in the UK. This continued for two years because of an unprecedented superinjunction – the longest in British history.</p> <p>To understand the lengths the government went to cover up the crisis and the impact this will have on public trust, I spoke to the Guardian’s defence editor<em><strong> Dan Sabbagh</strong></em>. That’s after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Health </strong></em>| The NHS is facing an “absolutely shocking” £27bn bill for maternity failings in England, after a series of hospital scandals, resulting in hundreds of babies and women dying or suffering life-altering conditions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/20/nhs-facing-absolutely-shocking-27bn-bill-for-maternity-failings-in-england">triggered a record level of legal claims</a>.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Middle East </strong></em>| Pope Leo XIV has condemned the “barbarity” of the war in Gaza and the “indiscriminate use of force” as Gaza’s health ministry said at least 85 Palestinians had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/20/pope-condemns-barbarity-of-israel-war-gaza">killed queueing for food</a>.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK news </strong></em>| More than four decades after the violent policing at Orgreave during the miners’ strike and a failed prosecution criticised as a police “frame up”, the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/20/government-launches-orgreave-inquiry-40-years-after-clashes-at-miners-strike">has established an inquiry</a> into the scandal.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Protest </strong></em>| Four people were arrested on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/21/four-arrested-under-terrorism-act-during-liverpool-pro-palestine-protest">suspicion of terrorism offences</a> during a pro-Palestine protest in Liverpool city centre on Sunday afternoon, police said. Merseyside police said material in support of campaign group Palestine Action was reportedly seen in the possession of a small number of protesters.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>UK weather </strong></em>| Half a month’s rainfall <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/20/uk-weather-half-a-months-rainfall-could-hit-country-in-next-24-hours-says-met-office">could hit the UK</a> in the next 24 hours, the Met Office has said. Yellow weather warnings for rain and thunderstorms were in place in Northern Ireland, Scotland and the north and south-west of England until 10pm on Sunday, with more warnings coming into force in other areas on Monday.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: ‘A massive commitment to conceal the fact of the error’</h2>    <p>The previous Conservative government became aware of the leak 18 months after the incident – in August 2023 – after the spreadsheet was published on Facebook. The government then took action to get the post removed but journalists became quickly aware of the breach, prompting the government to take an extraordinary court injunction to stop the data leak going public. The judge went further, granting the government a superinjunction – a mechanism which prevents disclosure of the very existence of the injunction itself.</p> <p>It’s worth noting why this was granted: there are real and founded fears that the Afghans on that list would face retaliation from the Taliban for working with British forces. Yet there are also significant questions to be asked about the length of the injunction, and its scale (“against the whole world”): was it about protecting vulnerable Afghans? Or was it about protecting the British government from scandal? Legal campaigners have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/17/afghan-leaks-britain-state-superinjunction-government">condemned the superinjunction</a> for using national security to provide legal cover for what they argue is a political crisis.</p> <p>The legal injunction came into force in September 2023, and “the Tories let it run,” Dan Sabbagh tells me. “The timeline shows they wanted it hushed until after the election. Mr Justice Chamberlain rules twice to maintain the injunction, then a third time says, ‘no, it’s too big’. That’s around May 2024. The election is called around then, but the government appeals and delays it past the election.”</p> <p>Dan spoke of his astonishment that a leak of such a serious nature was covered up for years. “And then on top of that, a remedial scheme was cooked up over a succession of cabinet meetings, expanding in size, costing more and more money. So a real, massive commitment was being agreed in order to conceal the fact of the error. And all this was kept secret from the press, from parliament, and ultimately the public.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The impact on Afghans</strong></p> <p>There has been a great deal of scrutiny on the secrecy and the impact this will have on the public. I’ll get into that with Dan later, because first I want to take the time to highlight the people in Afghanistan whose lives have been devastated by this leak.</p> <p>“People have previously spoken about the western involvement in Afghanistan, the catastrophic withdrawal and the thousands of people who built their lives around the western presence who had all that taken away. But it’s important to know that nowhere near enough of those people were helped. Some of them are still in hiding, some of them have been killed. There’s genuine worry about their safety under the Taliban,” Dan said.</p> <p>One Afghan who worked as an interpreter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/16/when-that-data-falls-into-the-hands-of-the-taliban-it-will-lead-to-my-arrest-torture-and-death">told the Guardian</a> “it felt like my blood had turned to ice” when he found out his name was leaked. He hasn’t been able to bring himself to tell his family of the nightmare they have been engulfed in. Other members of his family are in hiding, some have been killed.</p> <p>Another interpreter simply said: “The Taliban has been actively hunting down those who worked with UK forces. I am ashamed that I put my children’s lives at risk for a foreign power.”</p> <p>The thousands of Afghans who have not been evacuated to Britain are not expected to receive any compensation, according to a report by The Times.</p> <p>Dan was keen to add that Labour have since shut down the scheme that was launched to resettle applicants affected by the leak. “They’ve also shut down the other two Afghan schemes. So now there’s no legal route to come to the UK from Afghanistan. When Afghans do come, they generally get asylum, so we might see more of them in Calais.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Soldiers and spies named</strong></p>    <p>The spreadsheet had a “key notes” column near the name of every Afghan applicant, providing extra information. This included things such as: “worked with British military,” “was Afghan special forces,” “case expedited,” or even “secretary of state says no”, Dan told me. Sometimes, entries named specific UK figures vouching for people. That’s how the names of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/17/spies-and-sas-personnel-among-100-plus-britons-included-in-afghan-data-leak">more than 100 officials and soldiers</a>, as well as a handful of MI6 officers, also got out.</p> <p>“We couldn’t report that until [Thursday] due to residual restrictions. There was another hearing in front of Mr Justice Chamberlain who said, ‘I’m now going to hear all this in public.’ But the Ministry of Defence immediately wanted an hour in closed session to talk about national security,” Dan said.</p> <p>How useful is this information about British forces and intelligence for Britain’s enemies? “The British state really doesn’t like the names of secret service or informants coming out,” he said.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>The scale of the secrecy</strong></p> <p>While leaks and data breaches are not uncommon, this scandal that followed is unparalleled in its scope.</p> <p>“The unprecedented bit is the secrecy. The superinjunction to cover up what was initially just a mistake, though potentially dangerous, yes. But then, the extraordinary secrecy, the massive policy response that was also secret, which was kept from parliament, the press and public? It’s absolutely unprecedented,” Dan said.</p> <p>Dan told me that much of the decision to keep this a secret was taken by the Conservatives. Ben Wallace was defence secretary until the end of August 2023, and his only role was to seek the injunction. Grant Shapps was in that role through the period of the cover-up and in charge when the superinjunction was being fought, then expanded. Other ministers, such as deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden and armed forces minister James Heappey, also knew, Dan said. </p> <p>The only Labour figures who knew before the election were then shadow defence secretary John Healey and speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle, both subject to the superinjunction. Due to the severity of the legal threat, Healey did not tell his party leader Keir Starmer about it. When Labour won the election, they rolled the scheme and injunction for six months, then commissioned a review in January 2025.</p> <p>So what’s happened since? Former Tory government ministers, such as Grant Shapps, have since defended <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/18/grant-shapps-defends-use-of-superinjunction-to-suppress-afghan-data-leak">the use of the superinjunction</a>, while Keir Starmer said former Conservative ministers have “serious questions to answer” over the breach.</p> <p>It’s hard to properly digest the impact this could have on public trust, Dan added. “If you believe there’s a deep state out there working against the public’s interest, this is your proof. And it touches on migration, which is the most politically toxic issue of the moment.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Rowena Mason and Ben Quinn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/20/suella-braverman-jacob-rees-mogg-liz-truss-reform-unofficial-plan-tory-big-beast">have a cracking report</a> on <strong>Reform</strong>’s “scattergun campaign” to turn a Tory big beast to the cause.
