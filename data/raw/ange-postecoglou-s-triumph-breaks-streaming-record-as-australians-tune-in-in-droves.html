<p>Ange Postecoglou’s Europa League triumph has delivered a record audience for Stan, which has been on a spree of acquisitions to consolidate its status as a major rival to the Dazn-owned Kayo Sports amid heightened competition in Australian sports broadcasting.</p> <p>Stan’s live audience for Tottenham’s 1-0 win over Manchester United on Thursday was the highest for a Europa League match since the streaming service obtained the Uefa club competition rights in 2021.</p> <p>The number of viewers also eclipsed the audience for every Stan broadcast of the Champions League – the most prestigious European football competition – apart from the 2022 decider between Real Madrid and Liverpool, when the provider still offered a 30-day free trial and saw a spike in temporary sign-ups likely from Reds fans.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/picture/2025/may/22/david-squires-on-ange-postecoglou-winning-europa-league-australia">David Squires on … Ange Postecoglou winning the Europa League for Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ben Kimber, director of Stan Sport, said the audience watching Spurs and Postecoglou’s victory was double the previous Europa League record.</p> <p>“Off the back of a momentous morning for Ange Postecoglou and Australian football as a whole, we saw Aussies tuning into the blockbuster clash between Tottenham and Man United in droves,” Kimber said.</p> <p>“It underlines our commitment to premium sport and world-class football, and shows the appetite that exists for it in this country.”</p> <p>The Europa League final and record-breaking audience caps off a busy period for Stan, amid increasing activity in the broader sports broadcasting sector and growing speculation around the division of football rights in Australia.</p> <p>The first benefits for Kayo Sports subscribers under new owner Dazn was confirmed this week when the Fifa Club World Cup – which has an international arrangement with Dazn – was confirmed to be broadcast by Australia’s leading sports streamer in June.</p> <p>The arrangement is another step in the splintering of football across streaming providers. However, some relief could be imminent according to reports that Optus Sport is considering relinquishing its English Premier League rights to the content-hungry Stan.</p> <p>Stan and Nine secured a deal last week to show international rugby union including the home men’s 2027 and women’s 2029 World Cups, a month after securing access for Wallabies, Wallaroos and Super Rugby Pacific matches until 2030.</p> <p>Its other recent deals include the Sonny Bill Williams and Paul Gallen fight, and the fast-growing mixed martial arts league Professional Fighters League on top of its existing stable of rights which includes tennis, cycling and motorsport such as World Rally Championship, Indycar and Formula E.</p> <p>The chief executive at Stan owner Nine, Matt Stanton, confirmed this month the network was also interested in Formula One rights when they become available next year. They are currently held by Foxtel and Kayo Sports.</p> <p>This week Amazon Prime also confirmed details around more than 100 NBA and WNBA games and additional coverage starting next season available to all Prime members.
