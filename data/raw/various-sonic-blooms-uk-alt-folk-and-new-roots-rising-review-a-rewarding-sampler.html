<p><a href="http://www.folkandhoney.co.uk/ireland/a-major-new-project-from-folk-and-honey-n187/" title="">This compilation</a> of a score of up-and-coming Brit acts has plenty to commend it, but its adopted “alt-folk” tagline proves fanciful. Most tracks are by gentle singer-songwriters of conventional hue, while the wilder reaches of wyrd folk - encounters with shape-shifters on stormy moors – are almost entirely absent. There are some forceful characters on display nonetheless. <a href="http://brookesharkey.co.uk/" title="">Brooke Sharkey</a> offers airy, Anglo-French chamber folk. <a href="http://ferrisandsylvester.co.uk/" title="">Ferris and Sylvester</a> combine dreamy pop with spiky sentiments on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oC_a2EAXKSc" title="">Save Yourself</a> (alt Simon and Garfunkel perhaps) and seven-piece <a href="http://www.mishapedpearls.org/" title="">Mishaped Pearls</a> bring a cinematic sweep to Six Dukes. A rewarding sampler of a vibrant live scene, and <a href="https://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/sonicblooms" title="">not-for-profit</a> with it.</p>
