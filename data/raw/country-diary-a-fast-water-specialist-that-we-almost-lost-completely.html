<p>As I lean over the bridge’s parapet, a sudden slap draws my gaze upstream to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/02/country-diary-the-brown-trout-lurks-in-the-dusky-pools">dark pool</a>. All that’s left of the trout’s leap are a few bubbles encircled by slowly widening ripples. I look back to where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Mile_Water">Six Mile Water river</a> races across stony shallows. Waving languidly in the spate are long, emerald-green scarves of river water crowfoot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranunculus_fluitans"><em>Ranunculus fluitans</em></a>. <a href="http://webidguides.com/_templates/group_batracium.html">Water crowfoots </a>are a branch of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranunculus">buttercup family</a>. However, compared with its landlubber cousins, <em>R. fluitans</em> is another kind of being entirely – one that long ago made a completely different bargain with a changing world.</p> <p>Most of our several species of water crowfoot have two types of leaf: hair-like ones that are submerged in water; and broad flat ones that float on the surface. The floating leaves betray the group’s terrestrial origins, and species like pond water crowfoot,<em> </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranunculus_peltatus"><em>R.&nbsp;peltatus</em></a> use them as a raft for their flowers. However, the fast-water specialist <em>R. fluitans </em>has dispensed with floating leaves. Instead, like daisies&nbsp;woven through a girl’s long hair, its blooms emerge from the sinuous underwater leaves directly&nbsp;on to a river’s surface.</p>    <p>Under such conditions, it’s perhaps not surprising that the flowers produce few seeds. Indeed, <em>R. fluitans</em> had to find another way to survive and spread, as it <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-98292-6">evolved</a> into new riverine habitats at the end of the last ice age. In the turbulent waters of melting glaciers, it found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetative_reproduction">vegetative reproduction</a> – a form of self-propagation whereby stems&nbsp;and leaves can detach to form new plants – to be a more favourable&nbsp;strategy.</p>    <p>The Six Mile Water is the only river in Ireland where <em>R. fluitans</em> is found. The species’ range may have contracted in the 18th and 19th centuries when rivers were harnessed to power the <a href="https://belfasthills.org/history-culture/time-periods/mills-industry/">mills</a>. While the species enjoys <a href="https://www.habitas.org.uk/priority/species.asp?item=2725">legal protection</a>, unfortunately the Six Mile Water does not; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7632405.stm">industrial waste discharge</a> almost wiped out this isolated population of river water crowfoot in 2008.</p> <p>But for the commitment of the local angler <a href="https://www.total-fishing.com/antrim-angler-named-rural-hero-at-uk-ireland-awards/">Michael Martin</a>, who <a href="https://www.wildtrout.org/wttblog/sprite-method-re-establishing-ranunculus-post-industrial-rivers">manually assisted</a> the survivors to re-propagate, it might have vanished altogether. The population is also threatened by seemingly intractable local <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crggr227jg8o">agricultural pollution</a>. For how much longer will I be able to admire these bewitching water‑combed tresses and wonder at life’s capacity to respond to a changing world?</p> <p>• Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-changing-skies-9781783353101/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=article">guardianbookshop.com</a> and get a 15% discount</p>
