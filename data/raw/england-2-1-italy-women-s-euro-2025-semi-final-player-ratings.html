<h2>England</h2> 
<p><strong>Hannah Hampton</strong> Looked strong aerially and made a crucial save on 86 minutes, keeping England alive. <strong>7/10</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Lucy Bronze</strong> Made good runs but lacked a decisive pass. Had a header cleared off the line. <strong>6</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Leah Williamson</strong> Defended some awkward bouncing balls well. Sacrificed when England went for the jugular late in normal time. <strong>6</strong></p>

</aside> 
<p><strong>Esme Morgan</strong> Looked very composed, did well to halt several Italy breaks and fully justified her inclusion. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Alex Greenwood</strong> Beaten for Italy’s opener. Did not find her passing range. Defended well in extra time. <strong>6</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Keira Walsh</strong> Tried and tried to get England going, spreading the ball wide in the second half whenever she could. <strong>6</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Georgia Stanway</strong> Tougher and more energetic in the second half after a relatively quiet first half. <strong>6</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Ella Toone</strong> Plenty of good movement, again. Adventurous in attack but lacked that killer final ball. <strong>6</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Lauren James</strong> Had a good chance saved. Never quite found top gear. Withdrawn with an injury. <strong>6</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Alessia Russo</strong> Not afforded any room by Italy’s three centre-backs. Perhaps tired after playing 120 minutes last time. <strong>6</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Lauren Hemp</strong> Found space but could not find her crossing range. Lacked composure in front of goal. <strong>5</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Substitutes<br>Beth Mead </strong>(James h-t) Did well despite being asked to switch inside and play out of position in midfield again, <strong>6</strong>;<strong> Chloe Kelly </strong>(Stanway 77) Should have been brought on a lot sooner, <strong>8</strong>;<strong> Michelle Agyemang </strong>(Williamson 85) Is 19 years of age too young to receive a damehood? She was simply outstanding, <strong>9</strong>;<strong> Aggie Beever-Jones </strong>(Russo 85) Headed wide at the end of second-half stoppage time but it was merely a half-chance, <strong>6</strong>;<strong> Grace Clinton </strong>(Walsh 106) <strong>6</strong>;<strong> Jess Carter </strong>(Greenwood 120) <strong>6</strong>.</p> 
<h2>Italy</h2> 
<p><strong>Laura Giuliani</strong> Saved well from James early on. Dealt well with England’s crosses. Parried the late penalty. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Elisabetta Oliviero</strong> Looked very quick over 10 yards. Defended well against Hemp when they battled one-on-one. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Martina Lenzini</strong> A decent performance to help frustrate England before she was replaced after 89 minutes. <strong>6</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Cecilia Salvai</strong> Looked strong for the first 80 minutes but she was outperformed by Agyemang after the striker’s introduction. <strong>6</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Elena Linari</strong> Showed good strength and anticipation for an hour. Poor foul meant she was deservedly booked. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Lucia Di Guglielmo</strong> Had a very good game initially but was powerless to stop Kelly’s mazy runs. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Sofia Cantore</strong> Skilful player. Denied by a second-half Hampton save, although it was straight at the keeper. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Arianna Caruso</strong> A terrific player who had a very impressive tournament. Good signing for Bayern Munich. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Manuela Giugliano</strong> Helped to stop England’s midfield clicking into gear for much of the contest. Clever, technical player. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Barbara Bonansea</strong> Took her goal superbly. Italy were notably weaker once she was taken off in the 73rd minute. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Cristiana Girelli</strong> Linked play superbly. Looked heartbroken to go off injured, which changed the game. <strong>7</strong></p> 
<p><strong>Substitutes<br>Martina</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>Piemonte </strong>(Girelli 64) Put herself about, headed over with a half-chance, <strong>7</strong>;<strong> Michela Cambiaghi </strong>(Cantore 73) <strong>6</strong>;<strong> Emma Severini </strong>(Bonansea 73) <strong>6</strong>;<strong> Julie Piga </strong>(Lenzini 89) <strong>6</strong>;<strong> Giada Greggi </strong>(Giugliano 89) <strong>6</strong>.</p>
