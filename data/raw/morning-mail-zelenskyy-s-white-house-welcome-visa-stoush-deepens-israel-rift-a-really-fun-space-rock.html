<p>Morning everyone. Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received a warmer welcome in Washington overnight compared with last February, and there were encouraging noises from Donald Trump about possible security guarantees for Ukraine, but a ceasefire did not seem to be on the table.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Jim Chalmers’ much-hyped economic summit is the big setpiece political event of the day, though it risks being overshadowed by a diplomatic stoush with Israel which has cancelled some diplomatic visas. Plus: we explain why scientists are excited about a “really fun space rock”.</p>
