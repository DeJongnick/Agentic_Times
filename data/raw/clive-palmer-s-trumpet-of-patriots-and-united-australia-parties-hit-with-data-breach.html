They have also been advised to keep alert for potential scams arising from the breach.</p> <p>Under the mandatory data breach notification scheme, organisations have 30 days to assess whether a breach is serious enough to require reporting to the OAIC and to those affected. OAIC guidelines state if it is not possible to contact everyone affected, an organisation must put the notification on their website, and promote the notification through email or social media or other channels.</p> <p>The OAIC has been contacted for comment.</p> <p>Palmer’s party failed to pick up any seats in the federal election, despite spending what the billionaire estimated was up to $60m in advertising to promote the party across the country, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/02/trumpet-of-patriots-spam-text-messages-are-they-legal-federal-election">sending millions of unsolicited text messages</a> to Australians through the election campaign.</p> <p>In the 2023-2024 financial year, the ASD responded to 121 ransomware incidents, making up 11% of all incidents dealt with by the agency.</p> <p>The OAIC reported that in the same time frame, of the 413 cybersecurity incidents that resulted in a data breach, 26% involved ransomware.</p>
