<p><strong>Name:</strong> Bee Movie</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 10 years old.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> insect-based, feature-length animation.</p> <p><strong>Do you mean Antz? </strong>No. Antz is about ants. This one’s about bees.</p> <p><strong>What about A Bug’s Life? </strong>That’s another insect-based animation, but it’s not this one.</p> <p><strong>I don’t think I’ve ever seen Bee Movie. </strong>You’re not alone. Greeted with mixed reviews, Bee Movie has the distinction of being Dreamworks Animation’s third lowest grossing computer-animated film.</p> <p><strong>What’s it about? </strong>It’s about a bee called Barry B Benson – voiced by Jerry Seinfeld – who rebels against the beehive mentality of, um, the beehive.</p> <p><strong>So it’s no good. </strong>Well, some people like it. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/dec/14/animation.family">The Guardian awarded it four stars when it was released</a>. And one obsessive UK Netflix subscriber <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/fanatics-can-t-live-without-daily-fix-of-favourite-film-qk25wdwtg">watched it 357 times last year</a>.</p> <p><strong>Who? </strong>Netflix didn’t release the name, just the figure.</p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> For publicity. Netflix wants you to know how popular the service is, but it doesn’t want to give away any actual ratings for particular films or series.</p> <p><strong>So instead it is warning us about an unstable individual in our midst? </strong>To be fair, Bee Movie does have a kind of cult status.</p> <p><strong>One troubled loner watching the same cartoon every day for a year does not constitute a cult. </strong>There’s another person in Spain who has seen it 281 times.</p> <p><strong>Two still isn’t enough, even if they write to each other. </strong>Even before this, Bee Movie was an established internet meme.</p> <p><strong>I’ll have you know I barely understand what a meme is. Until last month I was still pronouncing it me-me. </strong>Let’s just say the film has garnered a measure of ironic affection over the years. People have posted versions where the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMG1Nl7uWko">movie gets faster every time someone says “bee”</a>, or slower, or more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szzaXlIPkDc">pixelated</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why would they do that? </strong>Who knows? The entire screenplay of Bee Movie is also regularly used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shitposting">shitposting</a>.</p> <p><strong>Sorry, shitposting? </strong>The posting of awkwardly large amounts of mediocre or ironically appropriated content to a social media site for the purposes of annoying everyone.</p> <p><strong>People do seem to have a lot of free time these days, don’t they? </strong>They do indeed.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Honestly, I’ve never even seen the whole thing. I just leave it on for the cats when I go to work.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “When’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jerryseinfeld/status/759236173265039361?lang=en">Bee Movie 2</a> coming out?”</p>
