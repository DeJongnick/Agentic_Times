class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Rachel Reeves will pledge to reverse huge cuts in public investment in her budget next week after she said that rules limiting her spending power will be overhauled.</strong></p> <p>Confirming revelations in the Guardian on Wednesday, Reeves said she was not prepared to see public investment fall even further behind the levels seen in other major economies.</p> <p>She told reporters in Washington DC today:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I can confirm today that will be changing the way that we measure debt in the budget statement next week, but I’ll set out the details of that to Parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>Concerns in financial markets that Labour will allow a spending bonanza, mimicking Liz Truss’s infamous mini budget in 2022, were scotched by the chancellor, who said she would maintain strict limits on Whitehall budgets and would not spend all the extra investment funds in her first budget.</p> <p>Speaking at the IMF’s annual meeting in Washington, she said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“It’s really important for the sustainability of public finances, that we give confidence to markets that we’re not borrowing to pay for the day-to-day functioning of government.</p> <p>“And we’ll work with the National Audit Office and the Office for budget responsibility to make sure that all those investments are properly validated, she added.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-671a541e8f081d096f9f835d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time

way to go</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Bank of England interest rate-setter Catherine Mann has warned that the cooling of price growth in Britain’s services sector still had “a long way to go” for the central bank to hit its 2% inflation target over the medium term.</strong></p> <p><strong>Mann</strong>, one of the hawkish policymakers at the BoE, welcomed a recent fall in inflation in Britain, which dropped to just 1.7% in September.</p> <p>Speaking on the sidelines of this week’s IFM Annual Meeting, she said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Our headline price print ... was lower than projected in the August Monetary Policy Report. Services, which, of course, we have looked at very carefully for persistence, came in under 5% for the first time in a very, very long time.”</p> </blockquote> <p>But <strong>Mann</strong> – who opposed August’s interest rate cut – added:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“A little bit of a concern, goods prices are a little bit higher. In order to get to a target consistent (with a) 2% inflation rate, services still have a long way to go.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Mann</strong> also sounded coy about the chances of backing an interest rate cut at the Bank’s next meeting in November, saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p> “If you have structural persistence in the relationship between wages and price formation that lasts, that is persistent and embedded, then it’s premature to start cutting until you purge those behaviours.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-671a47738f08791c139f6a20" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-10-24T13:28:37.081Z">2.28pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Reeves: Taxes must rise to meet our stability rule</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Away from the IMF, Rachel Reeves has written an article in the Financial Times about her fiscal rules – without giving full details of what the new rules will be.</strong></p> <p><strong>Reeves</strong> explains that next week’s budget will “turn the page on years of instability and uncertainty”, and declares that her fiscal rules will be “the rock of stability at the core of my Budget”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7258f7ff-7bc7-4371-9bb7-44dcf4bdf654">The chancellor writes</a>:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>They will set the basis for stable fiscal policy, prudent management of day-to-day spending and responsible investment for growth.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Reeves</strong> confirms that the first fiscal rule is the “stability rule”, under which day-to-day spending will be matched by revenues (<a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/labours-fiscal-plan/">as was promised in Labour’s manifesto</a>).</p> <p>And she warns that this rule will “bite hardest” and mean higher taxes, given the state of the public finances and the need to invest in our public services.</p> <p>She adds:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Alongside tough decisions on spending and welfare, that means taxes will need to rise to ensure this rule is met. I will always protect working people when I make these choices, while taking a balanced approach.</p> </blockquote> <p>The chancellor adds that this stability rule will also cover the interest on the UK national debt. She pledges that she won’t cut capital budgets to make up for shortfalls in the day-to-day running costs of departments.</p> <p>But what about the second rule (which is currently to show debt falling as a share of GDP in five year’s time)? </p> <p><strong>Reeves</strong> says her fiscal rule will avoid the cuts to investment planned by her predecessor – an admission that there will be changes.</p> <p>She says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>My second fiscal rule, the investment rule, will get debt falling as a proportion of our economy. That will make space for increased investment in the fabric of our economy, and ensure we don’t see the falls in public sector investment that were planned under the last government.</p> </blockquote> <p>So she’s not confirming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/23/reeves-to-announce-major-change-to-fiscal-rules-releasing-50bn-for-spending">the Guardian’s report</a> that she will shift to use the Public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) measure of debt, which would free up over £50bn of extra borrowing.
