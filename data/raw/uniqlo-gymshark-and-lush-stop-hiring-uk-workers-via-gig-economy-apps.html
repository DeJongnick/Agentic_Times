<p>Lush, Uniqlo and Gymshark have stopped using freelance retail workers hired through apps such as YoungOnes and Temper, after unions criticised the gig economy companies.</p> <p>The TUC wrote to the retailers urging them to stop using freelance retail workers amid concerns they were missing out on significant employment rights.</p> <p>Some retailers recruited temporary shop assistants for the busy festive period through gig economy apps, including <a href="https://youngones.com/">YoungOnes</a> and <a href="https://go.temper.works/en-gb/business">Temper</a>, which are promoted by online influencers with hundreds of thousands of followers, as first revealed by the Observer last month.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/15/uk-stores-gig-economy-workers-retailers-christmas-unions">UK retailers accused of recruiting young shop workers without rights over Christmas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The trade union body said in the letter to retailers, seen by the Guardian, that the rise in the use of freelancer apps by retailers was “extremely worrying”.</p> <p>Kate Bell, the assistant general secretary of the trade union group, wrote to the chief executives of the three retailers: “We urge you to end this practice immediately and ensure that all your workers receive the rights and protections that they deserve as directly employed or agency workers.</p> <p>“Trade unions and the workers we represent will fight to ensure that this practice is driven out of the retail sector.”</p> <p>The TUC said that, as a result of the workers being classed as self-employed, it was concerned they were at risk of being denied vital rights including the legal minimum wage, sick pay, ⁠holiday pay, rest breaks and ⁠protection from unfair dismissal.</p> <p>Bell wrote: “Anyone looking at this arrangement from outside would consider it laughable that the person serving them was a self-employed worker akin to a visiting tradesman, rather than the permanent or temporary worker for your business.”</p> <p>Uniqlo said it only briefly used the Temper app to hire workers to supplement its full-time team and had now ceased hiring people via such systems.</p> <p>The Japanese-owned fashion retailer said: “Following a brief trial period with Temper, Uniqlo no longer sources freelance workers for temporary store-based roles. We instead recruit for our temporary and permanent positions directly or through other channels to ensure all our staff are eligible for applicable employment benefits.</p> <p>“We are committed to treating our employees fairly, while maintaining our high service standards.”</p> <p>Lush, which is understood to have hired fewer than six people through the apps for a short period, said: “This was the first and only time that staff have been recruited this way and there are no plans to use this method in the future.”</p> <p>Gymshark declined to comment but is also understood to have ceased using the apps for recruitment in the light of concerns.</p>
