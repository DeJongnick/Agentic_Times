<h2>Glastonbury 2025</h2> <p><strong>10pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>To Worthy Farm for an event the BBC now has down to a fine art, with a mix of live broadcasts, red button choices and iPlayer action. This year’s headliners range from gnarled veteran Neil Young to pop star Olivia Rodrigo. Elsewhere, there’s Britpop (Supergrass) and hip-hop (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/19/loyle-carner-hopefully-review">Loyle Carner</a>). And who the hell are Patchwork, the mystery band billed to play at 6.15pm on Saturday? Lauren Laverne, Clara Amfo, Jamz Supernova and Huw Stephens host events. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Pushers</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Rosie Jones’s sitcom challenges received notions of disability by being funny and daring. Emily and Ewen are both in relationships now but drug-dealing and romance aren’t always a comfortable combination: when a double date goes wrong, it threatens to derail their operation. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Dispatches: Will Nigel Farage Be Prime Minister?</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Will the Reform rabble-rouser get his reactionary populism into government? With the next election probably more than four years away, this documentary feels premature – but journalist Fraser Nelson assesses Nigel Farage’s prospects all the same. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Marie Antoinette</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong></p>    <p>As anyone with a working knowledge of European history will know, this series was never destined to end well for the queen of France. However, the climax is effectively realised, as, imbued with the entitlement of power, Marie still struggles to understand the reasons for the tumult, even as the Bastille is stormed. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Taskmaster</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>The series approaches its end, and while the formula certainly doesn’t feel box-fresh any more, it shows no real sign of faltering either. In this penultimate episode, Fatiha El-Ghorri continues her enjoyably stagey antagonism with Alex Horne, Rosie Ramsey faces her fear of heights and Stevie Martin creates a spectacular fishing line. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>The Mortician</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Documentaries</strong></p>    <p>“I don’t put any value on anybody after they’re gone … Love ’em when they’re here. Period.” That’s David Sconce – a California mortician convicted of mutilating corpses and performing mass cremations – who speaks in the final two episodes of this stomach-churning series about his family funeral home. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p>
