<p>Morning everyone. Our Essential poll published today shows grows growing scepticism with the Aukus nuclear submarine deal and whether it will make Australia more secure.</p> 
<p>Plus, the government has declared a change of heart on whether YouTube should fall under the proposed social media ban for under-16s, Naplan results reveal the state of our education system, the UK says it will recognise a Palestinian state, and there’s a tough draw for the Matildas in next year’s home Asian Cup.</p> 
<h2>Australia</h2> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><em><strong>YouTube ban | </strong></em>Children will be banned from having YouTube accounts from December, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/29/children-to-be-banned-from-having-youtube-accounts-as-albanese-government-backflips-on-exemption">with the federal government backflipping </a>on an earlier decision to exempt the video platform from the national under-16s social media restrictions.</p></li> 
 <li><p><em><strong>Essential poll | </strong></em>The majority of Australians believe the defence force will never receive the Aukus submarines <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/30/guardian-essential-poll-most-australians-doubt-we-will-ever-receive-aukus-submarines-amid-trump-uncertainty">as doubts grow</a> over America’s commitment to the military pact and the reliability of the US president, Donald Trump. The analyst <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2025/jul/29/all-the-way-with-donald-j-albaneses-second-term-will-be-defined-by-how-he-handles-the-elephant-in-the-room">Peter Lewis says</a> this is the latest evidence of a shift in opinion in Australia and that “convening our own review and asking own pointed questions seems to be the least we should do”.</p></li> 
 <li><p><em><strong>‘It’s 2025’ | </strong></em>The Liberal National party MP Terry Young <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/29/terry-young-gender-quotas-speech-parliament-canberra-ntwnfb">has rubbished</a> the opposition’s push for gender quotas, drawing a rebuke from Labor that his Tony Abbott-style comments showed that the parties were out of touch.</p></li> 
 <li><p><em><strong>Naplan failings | </strong></em>One in three students <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/30/one-in-three-students-fail-to-meet-naplan-benchmarks-as-disadvantaged-fall-behind">have failed </a>to meet Naplan benchmarks, according to the results of this year’s tests released this morning, as thousands of disadvantaged students continue to fall through the cracks. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/30/schools-more-to-a-good-education-than-naplan-results">this heartwarming story</a> proves there’s more to good education than test results.</p></li> 
 <li><p><em><strong>DV failures | </strong></em>Family violence services are regularly failing to contact offenders who have been referred to them for support, a Victorian coroner investigating the death of a woman who was murdered by her estranged husband <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/29/victoria-coroner-family-violence-services-failing-to-contact-offenders-ntwnfb">has found</a>.</p></li>

 <li><p><em><strong>NFL shooting link |</strong></em> The gunman identified in the mass shooting in New York on Monday that killed four victims left a note complaining that playing American football <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/29/new-york-shooting-gunman-cte">had given him the brain injury</a> known as CTE, and police are investigating whether he was targeting the NFL offices.</p></li>
