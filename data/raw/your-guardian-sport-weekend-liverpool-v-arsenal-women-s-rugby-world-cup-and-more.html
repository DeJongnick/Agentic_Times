They’ll spin through the headlines from overnight, including Friday night’s Midlands Championship clash between Leicester and Birmingham, as well as flagging the day’s big Football League and Scottish Premiership action, with team news and all the latest breaking transfer stories before the summer window closes on Monday. Jacob Steinberg will also be doing a Q&amp;A from Stamford Bridge before Chelsea v Fulham. </p> <p>12.30pm</p> <p>Chelsea v Fulham live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Fulham won this fixture 2-1 last season, ending a 21-game winless streak away to Chelsea in all competitions. Two 1-1 draws and a Carabao Cup win in midweek signal a fair start to this term for Marco Silva’s side, despite a glaring lack of new faces arriving in the summer, though Raúl Jiménez has impressed. That said, they’ve never won consecutive visits to Stamford Bridge. Chelsea, meanwhile, failed to score in their opening game then thumped West Ham 5-1 at the London Stadium. Their outstanding performer has been João Pedro, with four goals in four starts for the Blues. <strong>Rob</strong> <strong>Smyth </strong>steers our live blog, while <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> reports from the west London derby.</p> <p>2pm</p> <p>Dutch Grand Prix qualifying</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>Formula One kicks back into action after its summer shutdown, with Lando Norris resuming his title tussle with his McLaren teammate, Oscar Piastri. The Briton trails the Australian by nine points with 10 races remaining but won last time out in Hungary, coming out on top in the strategy battle before fending off Piastri’s late lunge to take his fifth win of the season – and his third in the last four races. Saturday’s qualifying, then, comes at a critical point in the season, with <strong>Tom Bassam</strong> covering the session lap by rapid lap. Our F1 reporter <strong>Giles Richards</strong> is trackside at Zandvoort.</p> <p>3pm</p> <p> Man Utd v Burnley and Wolves v Everton live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Nothing but victory will do against promoted Burnley otherwise Manchester United will head into the first international break of the season in turmoil. Ruben Amorim’s future is up for debate during that period, with a derby at neighbouring Manchester City, a home game against Chelsea and a trip to the unhappy hunting ground of Brentford coming up in September. Your clockwatch host <strong>Emillia Hawkins</strong> will also be monitoring the match at Molineux as Wolves take on Everton, with the hosts having lost just two of their 11 Premier League home games against their opponents. <strong>Will Unwin</strong> reports from Old Trafford and <strong>John Brewin</strong> from Wolves.</p> <p>4.30pm</p> <p>US Open live</p> <p>Tennis</p>  <p><strong>Katy Murrells</strong> picks up the action from NYC. World No 1 Jannik Sinner is back on court, and faces the Canadian Denis Shapovalov. The Italian is in startling form, having lost just four games in his first-round win over Vit Kopriva. The defending champion then swept past Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 in just over two hours. <strong>Tumaini Carayol</strong> will be reporting from Flushing Meadows on the pick of the action.</p> <p>5pm</p> <p>England v Samoa live</p> <p> Women’s Rugby World Cup</p>  <p>Marlie Packer will lead a second-string England into their second World Cup match after John Mitchell made extensive changes to the lineup that thrashed the USA. There are only two survivors from the starting XV that amassed 11 tries in Sunderland, with Packer captain in her first appearance since serving a one-match ban for being sent off for a dangerous clear-out against Spain in a warm-up this month. Zoe Aldcroft, England’s captain for the tournament, is stood down as part of squad rotation for the pool stage, which ends against Australia on 6 September. <strong>Daniel Gallan </strong>is our live blog host, with <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong> and <strong>Andy Bull</strong> providing reports and analysis from Franklin’s Gardens. Later, Daniel returns as the <strong>USA </strong>take on<strong> Australia</strong> from 7.30pm, with <strong>Luke McLaughlin</strong> reporting from York.</p> <p>5.30pm</p> <p>Leeds v Newcastle live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Newcastle arrive at Elland Road with Alexander Isak’s future at the club dominating Eddie Howe’s agenda. Nick Woltemade’s impending arrival from Stuttgart in a club record £70m move could open the door to the Swede’s departure, with the clock ticking down on the transfer window’s closure on Monday. Leeds won 1-0 against Everton in their last match at Elland Road, but Tuesday’s embarrassing Carabao Cup exit at Sheffield Wednesday shows the task still facing their manager, Daniel Farke. The new signing Noah Okafor is a doubt with a groin problem, though Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who made his debut on Tuesday, is expected to face the Magpies. Keeping up with action is <strong>Scott Murray</strong>, with <strong>Ross Heppenstall</strong> reporting from Leeds. </p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p><strong>John Brewin</strong> and <strong>Dominic Booth</strong> trawl through the controversies and updates from Saturday’s games before our unmissable live football countdown blog looks forward to a Sunday packed with compelling action. While there will be live blogs for the Old Firm game, Brighton v Manchester City and the day’s big match – Liverpool v Arsenal – there’s plenty of interest elsewhere with two troubled clubs – Nottingham Forest and West Ham – facing off. You have to say it’s a bleak picture for the winless Hammers, who haven’t scored in any of their last four Premier League visits to the City Ground. The last Hammers player to score there was Michael Hughes way back in September 1996. Let’s not forget the evening fixture between Aston Villa and Crystal Palace. The hosts are unbeaten in their last 19 home Premier League matches but Palace won 4-1 in their last meeting with Villa in February.</p> <p>12pm</p> <p>Rangers v Celtic live</p> <p>Scottish Premiership</p>  <p>Scotland’s big two have certainly been through the mill of late, brought crashing to earth with hapless Champions League qualifying exits. Glaringly, the mood at Ibrox has soured around Russell Martin, who will be scrabbling for his managerial future against Celtic. Defeat in Sunday’s Old Firm game would leave Rangers nine points behind their city rivals after four games. The 6-0 drubbing by Club Brugge<strong> </strong>means the former Southampton manager has won just three of his first 10 matches in charge. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong> helms our live blog, while <strong>Ewan Murray</strong> reports.</p> <p>2pm</p> <p>Brighton v Man City </p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>The 2-0 defeat by Spurs last time out will certainly have made Pep Guardiola determined to recover quickly from an early-season setback. Amid the disappointment with the performance of the goalkeeper James Trafford there is plenty of swirl around the City futures of Stefan Ortega, Manuel Akanji, Nathan Aké and Ilkay Gündogan as Monday’s transfer deadline day crashes into view. Meanwhile, Brighton’s Fabian Hürzeler is still buzzing from the 6-0 Carabao Cup win at Oxford, saying: “It’s so important as it gives you energy. You can feel it in the building today.” The £20m Greek teenager Stefanos Tzimas, who scored twice on his senior debut, may start. <strong>Tim de Lisle</strong> hosts our live blog, with <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong> reporting from the Amex.</p> <p>2pm</p> <p>Dutch Grand Prix live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>A sea of orange will greet Max Verstappen on his return to the Dutch circuit of Zandvoort, despite a fluctuating, troubled campaign for the Red Bull driver. The world champion has not been at his dominant best this season but still expects fervid local support for Sunday’s race. “It brings a smile on my face, seeing that amount of orange is very special,” he says. “It’s not only about the driving, there is quite a bit of a party going on across these three days – unfortunately not for me. But [the fans] seem to have a great time.” Also hoping for uplift is Lewis Hamilton. The seven-time world champion was downbeat after a tough weekend in Hungary last time out, describing himself as “absolutely useless”. The 40-year-old, who is still awaiting a first podium with Ferrari, has arrived in the Netherlands with a renewed motivation and says he wants to approach the final 10 races of the season with a fresh mindset. “We’re going to work hard, keep our heads down, try to change a few things in our approach and start to enjoy ourselves,” Hamilton says. <strong>Dominic Booth</strong> provides lap-by-lap updates, with <strong>Giles Richards</strong> reporting.</p> <p>4.30pm</p> <p> Liverpool v Arsenal live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Last season’s top two collide in the weekend’s marquee game, with Arne Slot admitting his Liverpool side have to improve, with the champions’ recent set-piece performances a concern. “If you then look at all the quality they have and especially one thing that stands out in the season until now – and what stands out in a negative way for us is we have conceded, if I include the [Athletic] Bilbao game, [from] four set pieces,” says the Reds’ manager. “Of course, as we all know, that is one of their strengths – not <em>the</em> strength, but one of their strengths.” Arsenal, however, are amid an early-season injury crisis, with Mikel Arteta unable to call on Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Martin Ødegaard, Christian Norgaard, Ben White and Gabriel Jesus. One item of good news is new signing Viktor Gyökeres is fit and scored his first two Premier League goals last time out against Leeds. Your live host is <strong>Will Unwin</strong>, with our peerless team of <strong>David Hytner</strong>, <strong>Andy Hunter</strong> and <strong>Barney Ronay</strong> offering reports, news and analysis.</p> <p>4.30pm</p> <p>US Open live</p> <p>Tennis</p>  <p><strong>Katy Murrells </strong>is back to keep the updates flowing on day eight of the US Open. <strong>Tumaini Carayol</strong> will be reporting from Flushing Meadows on the pick of Sunday’s action.</p>
