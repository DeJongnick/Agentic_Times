<h2>Germanwings: What Happened on Flight 9525?</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Documentaries</strong><strong><br></strong>It has been 10 years since the awful incident of the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash in the French Alps, in which all 150 passengers and crew were killed. The French public prosecutor’s office determined that the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz, who had been treated for severe depression, deliberately crashed the plane. But this is still questioned. In this documentary, experts and journalists piece together what happened. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>The Repair Shop: VE Day Special</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>The unstoppably lovely object makeover show is ideally suited to a VE Day commemoration, as it restores a cockpit clock, a plastic doll, an RAF cap and an autograph book. All have remarkable stories attached; the clock is brought in by a 101-year-old war veteran.<em> Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Race Across the World</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>The third leg, in which our five pairs race from the island checkpoint of Sanya to Shangri-La in the foothills of the Himalayas. (Yes, you read that right: in 2001, the Chinese town of Zhongdian renamed itself after a completely mythical city.) With typhoons leaving ex-couple Yin and Gaz trailing 44 hours behind, every choice is critical. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Saving Lives in Cardiff</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>To be a surgeon in a busy UK hospital is to confront life-or-death decisions every day. In this edition, those decisions pertain to the most painful condition known to medicine, and a rare neuroendocrine tumour. The waiting list numbers are bleak and the risks are huge, but the results can be truly miraculous. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2>Genius Game</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong></p>    <p>Still early days for this elaborate David Tennant-fronted show where all the contestants have notably high IQs but must rely on “social skills” (lying, mostly) to stay in the game. This week revolves around a fiendish codebreaking test, but forget trying to solve it yourself – just enjoy watching the nine remaining eggheads scrambling to survive. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>I, Jack Wright</h2> <p><strong>9pm, U&amp;Alibi</strong><strong><br></strong>Unforgotten creator Chris Lang’s whodunnit thriller continues with Sally (Nikki Amuka-Bird) demanding the exhumation of her ex-husband Jack (Trevor Eve). Meanwhile, police question the family members who all had a reason for bumping off the Wright patriarch after an unjust will reading. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Champions League football: Paris Saint-Germain v Arsenal </strong>7pm, TNT Sports 1.<strong> </strong>The semi-final second-leg tie at Parc des Princes.</p>
