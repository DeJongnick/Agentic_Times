<p>The number of prescriptions being issued in England for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication has risen by 18% year on year since the pandemic, with the biggest rise being seen in London, according to research.</p> <p>Experts said increased public awareness via social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok could be a factor behind the substantial rise in prescription rates, encouraging “more people to seek assessment, diagnosis and treatment”.</p> <p>They warned it is crucial to approach the information with caution, as the accuracy and reliability of the content can vary significantly.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/23/adults-diagnosed-adhd-shorter-life-expectancy-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder">Adults diagnosed with ADHD have shorter life expectancy, UK study shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms including impulsiveness, disorganisation and difficulty focusing.</p> <p>The study by academics at the University of Huddersfield and Aston University and published in the journal BMJ Mental Health found that the number of ADHD prescriptions in England increased from around 25 per 1,000 people in 2019/20, to 41.55 prescriptions in 2023/24, an average annual increase of 18%.</p> <p>The team looked at English prescribing data for the five currently licensed ADHD drugs at national, regional, and NHS integrated care board (ICB) levels.</p> <p>The research found that methylphenidate (which has brand names such as Ritalin, Concerta and Delmosart) remained the most frequently prescribed drug (19 items/1000 people), but the highest increase was for lisdexamfetamine, prescriptions for which increased by 55% year-on-year, rising from 2.86 items/1000 people in 2019-20 to 8.68 items in 2023-24.</p> <p>The researchers say that for long-term conditions like ADHD, one prescription typically provides 28 days of medication.</p> <p>The study also showed there to be regional differences across England in regards to prescription rates. Although ADHD prescriptions rose across all regions, London saw the highest annual increase of 28%, south-east England saw the second highest increase at 19.5%, and the north-east and Yorkshire had the lowest increase at 13%.</p> <p>The analysis also found there to be a strong association between factors such as ethnicity and deprivation and ADHD prescription rates. The researchers said that south-east England and north-west England, which have significant white populations, show higher prescription counts overall compared to more ethnically diverse regions like the Midlands and London.</p> <p>The researchers also said that “widespread disruption and increased psychological stress levels” could be a factor contributing to the rise in prescriptions. They added that their findings reveal that the increase in ADHD prescriptions is higher than reported in previous studies.</p> <p>The researchers said: “The findings of this study have significant implications for health policy and clinical practice. The significant rise in ADHD prescriptions across England highlights the urgent need for policies that address both regional and socioeconomic disparities in ADHD care access. The finding that more people are receiving ADHD treatment is encouraging, particularly given reports of long waiting times between ADHD referral and assessment, as well as variations across different regions in England.”</p> <p>The team called for more research on vetting and moderating ADHD-related information on social media to ensure awareness efforts “do not inadvertently spread misinformation”.</p> <p>They added: “Additionally, the role of professional diagnosis and treatment should be emphasised, balancing the role of social media with evidence-based practices.”</p> <p>Dr Paul Keedwell, a consultant psychiatrist and neurodiversity specialist, said that overdiagnosing ADHD could be a factor behind the rise in prescriptions seen in this study.</p> <p>“There could be a degree of overdiagnosing,” Keedwell said. “Although there is no clear evidence for this, it is important that all individuals receive a holistic assessment with a psychiatrist. Many other mental health conditions can cause ADHD-like symptoms. For example, my own clinical work has revealed many cases where inattention problems were caused by untreated depression rather than ADHD. Also, ADHD is often accompanied by other mental disorders like autistic spectrum disorder, complex trauma, anxiety and depression.</p> <p>“Concerning demographic trends, lower engagement with assessment and treatment among minorities and poorer communities is nothing new and not confined to ADHD. There could be differences in the availability of ADHD services across the country and more research is required.”</p>
