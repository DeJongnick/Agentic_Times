<p>Romania may be home to as many as 13,000 brown bears, almost twice as many as previously thought, the country’s forestry research institute has said, as officials promised new laws to allow communities to deal with “crisis bear situations”.</p> <p>The institute’s study of 25 counties in the Carpathian mountains was the first to use DNA samples from material such as faeces and hair. Previous estimates based on prints and sightings put the bear population at fewer than 8,000.</p> <p>According to environment ministry figures, bears have killed 26 people and severely injured 274 others over the past 20 years in Romania, the most recent fatality being a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/15/romania-to-step-up-cull-of-brown-bears-after-hiker-killed">19-year-old hiker who was mauled to death</a> on a popular Carpathian trail last July.</p> <p>The government last year more than doubled its authorised cull of brown bears, a protected species in the EU, to 481 after recording more than 7,500 emergency calls to signal bear sightings in 2023 – more than twice the previous year’s total.</p> <p>MPs argue “overpopulation” is leading to an increase in attacks, an assertion disputed by environmental groups who say the focus must be shifted towards prevention, by keeping bears away from communities and targeting specific “problem bears”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/aug/02/a-bear-in-the-backyard-a-photo-essay">A bear in the backyard  – a photo essay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Germany’s foreign ministry last week updated its Romania travel advice, noting that bears were increasingly venturing into residential areas and along roads, leading to “dangerous encounters with humans”. It urged travellers to heed local warnings.</p> <p>Based on an analysis of about 24,000 samples collected over three years since 2022, the institute’s study, published late last week, concluded there were between 10,419 and 12,770 individuals living in Romania – by far Europe’s largest brown bear population outside Russia.</p>    <p>World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Romania has since questioned its methods, saying genetic studies were usually conducted over a much shorter period, but <a href="https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/actualitate/ministerul-mediului-peste-10-000-de-ursi-bruni-traiesc-in-romania-3194275">the institute has said</a> it considers the survey 95% accurate.</p> <p>The Romanian environment minister, Mircea Fechet, said he would lobby the European Commission to lift the bears’ protected status. The EU’s habitats directive allows the animal to be killed only in exceptional circumstances and as a last resort.</p> <p>“We have to intervene,” <a href="https://www.digi24.ro/stiri/legislatia-privind-interventia-asupra-ursilor-va-fi-modificata-fechet-suntem-obligati-sa-venim-cu-masuri-de-interventie-3193911">Fechet told local media</a>. “The specialists say the optimal bear population is around 4,000.”</p> <p>He also promised to introduce a law allowing local officials to bypass the current system of “gradual intervention” – which obliges mayors to first try to scare a bear off, or capture and relocate it – and instead put the animal down directly if necessary.</p> <p>Existing methods “have so far proven ineffective”, Fechet said, adding: “I hope my proposal, which is currently under public consultation, will put an end to these tragedies. Human life comes first.”</p> <p>Slovakia this month also authorised a cull of 350 brown bears – about a quarter of its estimated population of 1,300 – after a 59-year-old man was mauled to death. Two other people died last year after being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/27/brown-bear-shot-dead-slovakia-rampage">attacked or chased by bears</a>.</p> <p>Slovaks “cannot live in a country where people are afraid to go into the forest, and where humans become food for bears”, said the country’s populist prime minister, Robert Fico.</p>
