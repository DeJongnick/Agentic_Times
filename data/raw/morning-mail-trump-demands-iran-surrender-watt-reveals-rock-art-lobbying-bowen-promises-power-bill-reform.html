<p>Murray Watt has “personally lobbied” Unesco envoys to persuade them to change their ruling on the Murujuga rock art in Western Australia, Labor will sketch out a plan to stop energy price gouging, and Alex de Minaur’s Wimbledon hopes suffer a blow at Queen’s.</p>

<p>Travis Lovett will today complete a 468km walk from Portland in western Victoria to Melbourne to mark the final report of the truth-telling Yoorrook Justice Commission. Lovett, a deputy on the commission, says he has been joined by hundreds of people on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/18/walk-for-truth-hundreds-of-people-join-486km-trek-from-portland-to-melbourne-for-reconciliation">his “walk for truth”</a>, underlining the desire to reconcile the state’s colonial past. “We want to move forward, but it needs to be underpinned by truth and by justice,” he says.</p> 
<h2>Not the news</h2> 
<p>From a product that pours “like warm honey” to one that appears more suitable for use in the construction industry, the quality of supermarket tahini varies considerably.
