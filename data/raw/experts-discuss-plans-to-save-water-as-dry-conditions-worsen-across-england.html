<p>A nationally significant water shortfall is gripping England, the government has warned, as experts say the conditions could last until mid-autumn.</p> <p>The National Drought Group met to discuss actions to save water across the country, and Steve Reed, the environment secretary, briefed the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Pat McFadden, about the risks posed by the dry weather.</p> <p>Water companies are preparing to take more drastic measures to conserve water as supplies dwindle.</p> <p>Southern Water, some of whose customers are already under a hosepipe ban, has applied <a href="https://www.southernwater.co.uk/media/4uvfgsmz/southern-water-non-essential-use-ban-notice-2025.pdf">for a non-essential use ban</a> that would prohibit businesses from taking actions such as filling swimming pools or cleaning their windows.</p> <p>The company has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/06/southern-water-applies-draw-water-rare-chalk-stream-river-test-hampshire">also applied</a> for an emergency order to take water from a rare chalk stream after it drops below its ecologically safe water flow.</p> <p>The drought is hitting many sectors across the country, with many canals shut to navigation due to low water levels, farmers struggling to grow crops and feed livestock, and higher numbers of fish die-offs being reported by anglers and others who use England’s rivers.</p> <p>Two rivers, the Wye and the Great Ouse at Ely, were at their lowest on record for July, and only 89% of long-term average rainfall was recorded for the month across England. This is the sixth consecutive month of below-average rainfall.</p> <p>Five areas of England are in drought: Yorkshire; Cumbria and Lancashire; Greater Manchester, Merseyside and Cheshire; East Midlands; and West Midlands.</p> <p>Dry conditions could last well into October, the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology has warned, which would put higher pressure on water supplies as rivers, reservoirs and aquifers are at very low points after a very dry spring and summer.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--supporting" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/england-_drought_map/giv-32554xHfvQQYKYLas/" data-alt="dry weather and drought graphic map of England"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/england-_drought_map/giv-32554xHfvQQYKYLas/">Interactive</a> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Its latest hydrological outlook says: “Normal to below normal groundwater levels are likely to persist through both August and the August-October period.” It added the situation would continue for “low river flows across central and southern England”.</p> <p>More parts of the country could be at risk of being plunged into drought conditions as aquifers are depleted. These are underground stores of water which take a long time, and a lot of sustained rainfall, to recharge.</p> <p>These were full after a very wet winter in 2024 and the start of 2025, but the dry conditions have caused them to become depleted.</p> <p>At the moment, it is mainly areas reliant on reservoirs and chalk streams that are facing drought and hosepipe bans, as areas such as London have been able to use the resources from the chalk aquifer.</p> <p>The hydrological forecast warns: “The outlook for August is for normal to below normal levels, with notably to exceptionally low levels for the southern chalk and carboniferous limestones in central southern England, south Wales and the South Downs. Over August-October, normal to below normal levels are the most likely outcome.”</p> <p>The National Drought Group – which includes the Met Office, the government, regulators, water companies, the National Farmers’ Union, the Canal &amp; River Trust, anglers, and conservation experts – used the meeting to highlight the water-saving measures each sector is taking.</p> <p>Dr Will Lang, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “This week is starting off warmer than of late across England and Wales, with temperatures getting towards the mid-30s celsius for some in the south.</p> <p>“As we move into the second half of August there are indications of high pressure building and therefore largely settled conditions overall. Although dry weather is more likely, rain, showers or thunderstorms cannot be ruled out.”</p> <p>The Environment Agency’s director of water and the National Drought Group chair, Helen Wakeham, said: “The current situation is nationally significant, and we are calling on everyone to play their part and help reduce the pressure on our water environment.</p> <p>“Water companies must continue to quickly fix leaks and lead the way in saving water.</p> <p>“We know the challenges farmers are facing and will continue to work with them, other land users and businesses to ensure everyone acts sustainably.”</p>
