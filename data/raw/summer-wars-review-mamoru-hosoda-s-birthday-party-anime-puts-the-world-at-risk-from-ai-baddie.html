<p>This virtual reality thriller-cum-family drama from 2009 was an early solo success for Mamoru Hosoda, who along with Your Name’s Makoto Shinkai is one of the leading new-school anime auteurs. Made after he withdrew from directing Howl’s Moving Castle for Studio Ghibli, it flits between a fraught, soap-operaish saga about a family reunion near the city of Ueda and the metaverse of Oz. It isn’t as sophisticated perhaps in its understanding of the online/real-world interface as his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/belle-review-anime-that-makes-for-an-intriguing-big-screen-spectacle">2021 film Belle</a>, but the multilayered storytelling still shows plenty of panache, especially on the visual front.</p> <p>Maths boffin Kenji (voiced by Michael Sinterniklaas in the English-language dub) is browbeaten by schoolmate Natsuki (Brina Palencia) into attending her great-grandmother Sanae’s (Pam Dougherty) 90th birthday on her family estate; she needs a willing victim to pose as her boyfriend to impress the matriarch. Fending off his new in-laws, the teenager – also a part-time moderator for Oz – solves an encrypted math problem that opens a backdoor for a malevolent AI called Love Machine to corrupt the network. With much of the world dependent on the services hosted by Oz, much more than the birthday party is at stake.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc8_JO4NAI0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Rc8_JO4NAI0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Hosoda shows a novelistic attention to detail that puts Summer Wars a cut above genre anime: from the sense of history underpinning the sprawling Jinnouchi family, always harping on about being descending from famously uncowable samurai, to the baseball game that is a meta-commentary on the unfolding online catastrophe. The deep texturing also extends to the images: not only the translucent and, from a 2025 perspective, somewhat utopian-looking online realm, but also piercing touches of IRL beauty. Sanae’s flowers blooming by night as Kenji solves his maths puzzle is a particularly delicate touch.</p> <p>Insisting, via Sanae, on family solidarity and civic spirit in the face of existential challenges, Hosoda also shows something of a moralistic streak. But in the case of Summer Wars, this conviction dissipates somewhat in a gabbled finale that leans into the film’s frantic tempo and assigns every Jinnouchi a supposedly key role in defeating Love Machine. Battling an apparently motiveless AI – whose link to bad boy prodigal son Wabisuke (J Michael Tatum) is underexploited – it feels increasingly consequenceless, as virtual action often does. But the narrative complexity and bravura imagery still impress.</p> <p>• Summer Wars is in UK cinemas from 3 August.</p>
