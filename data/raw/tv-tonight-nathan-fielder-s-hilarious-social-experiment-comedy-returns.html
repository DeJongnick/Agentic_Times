<h2>The Rehearsal</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Sky Comedy</strong><strong><br></strong>Ever wondered how many planes have crashed because the co-pilot was “uncommunicative?” Nathan Fielder has – and it’s the premise for series two of his mind-bending social experiment comedy, in which real people “rehearse” in his simulated scenarios. He reconstructs a cockpit and an airport lounge, and even starts TV singing competition Wings of Voice. The blurred line between reality and construction creates something bizarre and uproariously funny. Strap in! <em>Matthew Pearce</em></p> <h2>Jamie Cooks: Georgia</h2> <p><strong>7pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>In this one-off special, Jamie Oliver explores the cuisine of Georgia, soaking up inspiration from its colourful ingredients, techniques and traditions. He dives in to Tbilisi’s herbaceous food markets and the rustic wine region, gets to know what the locals love, and understands how to well and truly eat like a Georgian. <em>MP</em></p> <h2>Jane Austen: Rise of a Genius</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>Jane Austen’s sister burned their personal letters, meaning that history’s most famous female writer is also the most enigmatic. But Helen Fielding, Candice Carty-Williams and other fans get inside Austen’s mind in this docudrama series. It starts with Jane’s first novel, Lady Susan, inspired by her cousin Eliza, and the observation that widowed women are free. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>The Last of Us</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic</strong></p>    <p>It is the season finale and we last saw Ellie (Bella Ramsey) about to get her bloody revenge on Abby (Kaitlyn Dever). Will she go through with it? And if so, can she pull it off? This season has been slowed down by Joel’s absence and Ellie’s endless guitar renditions – but maybe it will end on a thrilling note. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Elsbeth</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Witness</strong><strong><br></strong>A former child star with sobriety issues wakes up with a love bite and zero memory of the night before. Then she is accused of murder. Luckily, sleuth Elsbeth (Carrie Preston) is on hand to tackle the mystery, dressed up as Holly Golightly because all this wackiness unfolds over Halloween. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Virgin Island</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>As this experimental intimacy course nears its climax, episode five sees the group of virgins take lessons on how to achieve an orgasm. Some have never masturbated before, others have never had a kiss. Can the experts help them understand what it means to have sex? <em>MP</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>The Importance of Being Earnest (Anthony Asquith, 1952), </strong><strong>11.10pm, Talking Pictures TV</strong></p>    <p>Oscar Wilde’s scintillating dialogue transfers well from stage to screen in Anthony Asquith’s definitive 1952 version of his drawing-room comedy. Michael Redgrave and Michael Denison are the two young men whose romantic designs on Joan Greenwood and Dorothy Tutin’s English roses lead them into a pseudonymous tangle. But, despite the comic skills of Greenwood and Margaret Rutherford as governess Miss Prism, it’s Edith Evans’s intimidating Lady Bracknell who rules the roost. “A handbag?” will never sound the same again. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>League One </strong><strong>football, AFC Wimbledon v Walsall</strong><strong> </strong>2pm, Sky Sports Main Event.<strong> </strong>The play-off final at Wembley.</p> <p>• The caption for the image from The Importance of Being Earnest film was amended on 26 May 2025 – it shows Edith Evans, not Margaret Rutherford.</p>
