<h2>France (4-3-3)</h2> <p><strong>Pauline Peyraud-Magnin </strong>Scarcely tested by England until late on. Saved superbly from Agyemang in the 90th minute. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Élisa De Almeida</strong> Roamed forward dangerously and caused Jess Carter extensive problems. Occasionally looked vulnerable defensively but England didn’t trouble her enough. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Maëlle Lakrar</strong> A fairly solid performance, particularly in the absence of France’s captain Griedge Mbock at centre-back. <strong>7</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/05/france-england-womens-euro-2025-match-report">Baltimore fires France to opening win against England to end Wiegman’s Euro record</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Alice Sombath</strong> Face a tough task against the athleticism of Alessia Russo but held her own fairly impressively. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Selma Bacha</strong> Looked like a top-class, natural left-back, something England haven’t really had available in their player pool for a generation. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Sakina Karchaoui</strong> Technically impressive on the ball, with a good work rate to match. Got the better of Georgia Stanway repeatedly. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Oriane Jean-François </strong>Struggled against Lauren James early on when the Lionesses were briefly on top but improved as the match went on. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Grace Geyoro </strong>Showed good energy to put pressure on Keira Walsh, especially in the first half, and thwarted England’s gameplan. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Delphine Cascarino </strong>She has the most assists in the NWSL so far in 2025 and contributed another here, tormenting England at times. <strong>8</strong></p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=france&amp;player=20" data-alt="Cascarino"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/atoms/2025/06/player-profiles/embed-profile/embed/embed.html?team=france&player=20">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Marie-Antoinette Katoto </strong>Good movement in the box for her goal and linked up play nicely. A textbook number nine. <strong>7</strong> </p> <p><strong>Sandy Baltimore</strong> Chelsea’s best player of the season produced another excellent performance, though England will feel her goal should not have stood. <strong>8</strong></p> <h2>Subs</h2> <p><strong>Kadidiatou Diani</strong> (on for Delphine Cascarino, 62 mins). Wasn’t able to show her typical skill, pace and power but, by the time she came on, France’s prime focus was to conserve the lead. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Melvine Malard</strong> (on for Sandy Baltimore, 62 mins). A lively cameo, running at the England defence to good effect. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Clara Matéo</strong> (on for Marie-Antoinette Katoto, 62 mins). Has been in good form but had to do as much defending as attacking after coming on. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Melween </strong><strong>N’Dongala</strong> (on for Elisa De Almeida, 80 mins). <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Sandie Toletti</strong> (on for Sakina Karchaoui, 80 mins). <strong>6</strong></p>    <h2>England (4-3-3)</h2> <p><strong>Hannah Hampton </strong>Looked nervous a few times, and almost fumbled the ball in for what would have been a third France goal. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Lucy Bronze </strong>Usually so reliable and exemplary at major tournaments, this was one of her poorer performances in an England shirt, in attack and defence. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Leah Williamson </strong>Produced some important blocks and tackles but will have been frustrated that England left the whole back four with too much to do. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Alex Greenwood </strong>Not how she would have wanted to celebrate her 100th England cap. She was sacrificed late on when England threw extra players into the attack. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Jess Carter </strong>Struggled repeatedly in a difficult first half as France got in behind her again and again as France exploited England’s left. <strong>4</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/05/wales-netherlands-womens-euro-2025-match-report">Miedema hits 100th Netherlands goal to upset Wales’ grand debut at Euro 2025</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Keira Walsh </strong>Was not at her best for much of the game but she improved and took her goal really well to give England late hope. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Georgia Stanway</strong> She was dispossessed a bit too often. She missed the second half of the season with a knee injury, so understandably won’t be at her peak yet. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Beth Mead </strong>Put in some good tackles early on, but you’re hoping for much more from your wingers creatively. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Lauren James </strong>Made an impressive start and looked a threat every time she was on the ball, but was she fully fit, off the ball? Sarina Wiegman may have brought her back too soon. <strong>5</strong></p>    <p><strong>Lauren Hemp </strong>It was disappointing not to be able to see her running at the defence more often, and she did not offer much cover defensively. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Alessia Russo</strong> Showed her instinctive qualities in the box for her goal that was disallowed, but otherwise had a quiet night. <strong>6</strong></p> <h2>Subs</h2> <p><strong>Niamh Charles</strong> (on for Jess Carter, 60 mins). Possibly made a case to start ahead of Jess Carter on Wednesday. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Ella Toone</strong> (on for Lauren James, 60 mins). Booked for a late challenge but did help England start to apply a bit of pressure in the closing stages. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Chloe Kelly</strong> (on for Beth Mead, 60 mins). Did not play badly but will have been disappointed not to have more of an impact off the bench. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Grace Clinton</strong> (on for Georgia Stanway, 77 mins). Showed good energy and physicality but fired over the bar with her best half chance. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Michelle Agyemang</strong> (on for Alex Greenwood, 86 mins). Looked a handful immediately and perhaps should have been brought on a lot sooner in the second half. <strong>6</strong></p>
