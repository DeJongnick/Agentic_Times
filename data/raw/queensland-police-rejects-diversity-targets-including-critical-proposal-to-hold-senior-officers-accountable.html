<p> The Queensland Police Service has formally rejected key recommendations of a landmark workforce diversity review, including calls for police leadership to be held accountable for addressing the lack of women and First Nations people in the ranks.</p> <p>The review, conducted by the state Human Rights Commission, was demanded by the 2022 commission of inquiry that found a “failure of leadership” had allowed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/21/queensland-police-failure-of-leadership-has-allowed-sexism-racism-and-fear-to-take-hold-inquiry-finds">culture of sexism, misogyny and racism</a> to flourish.</p> <p>Human rights commissioner Scott McDougall’s report found that significant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/10/senior-queensland-police-culture-report-sexism-misogyny-racism-ntwnfb">“resistance” to reform remained within the police service (QPS</a>), in particular among the “most senior leaders” of the organisation. His review called for diversity targets to address very low numbers of women, First Nations people and people from culturally and linguistically diverse (Cald) communities joining the QPS.</p> <p>The police service accepted most of the recommendations but “declined” the call to establish minimum diversity targets at each rank.</p> <p>The QPS also declined to implement performance indicators – prioritising diversity and inclusion – that would measure whether members of the executive leadership team had contributed to reform.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>McDougall described the recommendation as “critical” and said he was disappointed it had been rejected.</p> <p>“This response confirms our findings about the strength of resistance within the service that continues to act as a barrier, particularly to the progression of women in the service.”</p> <p>In the report, the Human Rights Commission identified “significant organisational and individual resistance” within the QPS to reform. It said resistant views were “most strongly held by QPS’s most senior leaders in the executive leadership team, noncommissioned officers and male officers”.</p> <p>“Throughout the review the commission heard from many dedicated police officers – from all levels and backgrounds – who want real change,” the report said.</p> <p>“They are officers who joined the police motivated by the opportunity to serve the community, remain deeply committed to QPS and its mission, and have made significant personal sacrifices for this cause. However, their belief in QPS’s capacity for change is being tested.</p> <p>“Positive change requires reconstructing some of QPS’s most deeply held values and ways of working, permanently altering power dynamics and how benefits are distributed.”</p> <p>McDougall said it was also disappointing the QPS had ceased taking advice from an advisory panel established to guide the review process.</p> <p>“The review made 36 recommendations to drive equality across the service,” he said.</p> <p>“The commission’s extensive research found that to access the best talent, and get the most out of its workforce, QPS needs to dismantle structural disadvantages to women, First Nations and culturally diverse peoples.</p> <p>“The commission’s review was informed by input from over 2,700 QPS members, police liaison officers and recruits. I am pleased that QPS has accepted, without limitations, to embed victim-centred and trauma-informed practices into their policies.”</p> <p>In a statement on Wednesday – released hours before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/25/brisbane-olympics-2032-david-crisafulli-new-stadium-victoria-park-election-promise">the announcement of Olympic venues in Brisbane</a> – the QPS said it had accepted or partially accepted many of the recommendations. Some were accepted subject to the resourcing decisions by the state government.</p> <p>“Where recommendations are unable to be progressed, the proposed work is either considered out of scope, the intent can be delivered through other means, or there are significant impediments to making progress at this time,” the statement said.</p> <p>“Additionally, some of the recommendations align with ongoing work resulting from the commission of inquiry into QPS responses to domestic and family violence.”</p> <p>Acting deputy commissioner Mark Kelly said it might take “some time” to implement the accepted recommendations, but that the “QPS is committed to driving meaningful change and striving to become a more inclusive organisation that better reflects the diversity of our community”.</p>
