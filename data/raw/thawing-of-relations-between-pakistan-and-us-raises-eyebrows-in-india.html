<p>After years in the diplomatic deep freeze, US-Pakistan ties appear to be quickly thawing, with Donald Trump’s effusive welcome for Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, signalling a possible major reset.</p> <p>Once snubbed so badly that former prime minister Imran Khan had to board an ordinary airport shuttle after arriving in the US rather than being whisked off in a limousine, Pakistan is now enjoying top-level access in Washington, including a White House lunch for Munir on Wednesday and meetings with top national security officials.</p> <p>Trump’s perceived friendliness with Munir, coupled with what India considers to be a glossing over of Pakistan’s record on terrorism, has raised Indian eyebrows, especially amid sensitive trade negotiations with the US.</p> <p>In a phone call with Trump on Tuesday, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, strongly rejected the US president’s repeated claims that he had personally brokered peace in the four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May. </p> <p>The next day, while calling Modi a “fantastic man”, Trump described Munir as “extremely influential” in halting the brief but intense war. “I love Pakistan,” Trump said, before repeating: “I stopped the war between Pakistan and India.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/who-is-gen-asim-munir-army-chief-leading-pakistan-military-over-india-crisis">Who is Gen Asim Munir, the army chief leading Pakistan’s military amid India crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the phone call, Modi made it “absolutely clear”, said India’s foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, that hostilities ceased only after Pakistan requested a ceasefire, and that no third-party mediation took place. “India has not accepted mediation in the past and never will,” Misri said.</p> <p>Adding to the confusion, a White House press officer said Munir had been invited after suggesting Trump be nominated for the Nobel peace prize for ending the conflict, which followed a terror attack that killed 26 mainly Hindu holidaymakers in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p> <p>Munir’s red-carpet treatment in Washington and high praise from US Central Command hint at a strategic recalibration.</p> <p>Gen Michael E Kurilla, the head of Central Command, recently called Pakistan a “phenomenal” counter-terrorism partner, citing Islamabad’s role in helping to capture the alleged Islamic State Khorasan Province planner behind the 2021 Abbey Gate bombing at Kabul airport, an attack that killed 13 US troops and more than 170 Afghan civilians.</p> <p>Munir’s five-day US tour includes meetings at the Pentagon, the state department, and Central Command headquarters in Florida. Such access is extraordinary for a Pakistani general.</p> <p>“Senior US officials often meet with Pakistani generals. But they don’t get entertained at the White House,” noted Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based south Asia analyst. “Ayub Khan and Zia ul-Haq were exceptions but they came as heads of state.”</p> <p>The shift in tone is stark. India has long positioned itself as the more reliable partner for the US as the world’s largest democracy, a bulwark against China, and a hub for expanding trade and intelligence-sharing. Pakistan, by contrast, has been dogged by accusations of sheltering terrorists and undermining civilian rule.</p> <p>Just a few years ago, Trump himself accused Pakistan of offering “nothing but lies and deceit”. Joe Biden later called it “one of the most dangerous nations in the world”. </p> <p>Indian officials continue to point to Pakistan’s links to major terror attacks, including on its parliament in 2001 and in Mumbai in 2008. Against that backdrop, Washington’s embrace of Munir strikes a jarring note in Delhi, where critics say the US is engaging with the same military establishment long accused of enabling cross-border militancy.</p> <p>Analysts say the pivot may be driven by more than just strategic cooperation. For Trump, it could be personal. “He has a thing for strongmen,” said one US analyst. </p> <p>“He sees something in Munir – the mystique, the military credentials, the aura of control. Trump responds to dominance, and Munir projects it.”</p> <p>That may help to explain why Munir was granted access usually reserved for heads of state. “He probably relished the opportunity to size Munir up,” Kugelman said. “Trump knows that in Pakistan it’s the army chief who really runs the show.”</p> <p>But Munir’s visit is taking place as the Middle East is in turmoil, with Israel striking Iranian targets and Iran firing missiles in retaliation. The US may be hoping that Pakistan, one of the few countries with diplomatic ties to Tehran, could play a role in de-escalation.</p> <p>There’s also a more delicate calculation, with Israel pushing the US to join its military campaign against Iran, which shares a 900km border with Pakistan. That geography puts Islamabad in a pivotal position. Some analysts believe the US may be probing whether Munir would allow surveillance flights or logistical cooperation.</p> <p>But Pakistan’s room for manoeuvre is limited, with public opinion strongly pro-Iran. “Even privately, Pakistan’s military would likely balk at the risks,” Kugelman said. “They can’t afford to be dragged into this. The backlash would be enormous.”</p> <p>For Indian officials, Munir’s reception has revived old memories of the US tendency to tilt towards Pakistan at critical junctures, such as in the cold war moments or post-9/11. But this time, analysts say, the reset may also involve commercial opportunity.</p> <p>Pakistan is actively courting US investment in two of the most volatile and potentially lucrative global commerce sectors: cryptocurrency and critical minerals. </p> <p>“The Trump-Munir meeting shouldn’t be seen only through the lens of the Israel-Iran war,” Kugelman said. “There’s been US-Pakistan engagement on crypto, minerals and counter-terrorism, and Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these.”</p> <p>He added: “This is classic Trump: ‘What can you do for me? What can I get out of this?’”</p>
