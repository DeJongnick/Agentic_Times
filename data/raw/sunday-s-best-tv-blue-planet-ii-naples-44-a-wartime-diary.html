<h2>Blue Planet II </h2> <h2>8pm, BBC One</h2> <p>Another welcome dip into high-definition aquatic majesty, this week exploring life in the sunken jungles of kelp, algae and seagrass. As well as vivid nightmare fuel such as a 10-armed sea cucumber cramming starfish eggs into its terrible maw like Return of the Jedi’s Sarlacc pit, there are more soothing vignettes, including a diligent Garibaldi damselfish dealing with insurgent urchins and a frisky cuttlefish with a bold cuckolding strategy. <em>Graeme Virtue</em> <br><br></p> <h2>Howards End </h2> <h2>9pm, BBC One</h2> <p>Hayley Atwell continues to shine as Margaret, who gets an offer she can’t refuse when Henry (Matthew Macfadyen) proposes. But they’ve hardly planned the honeymoon when a face from the past turns up to threaten their romantic union. As Henry reacts with trademark awkwardness, the families are flung together by the drama. There’s trouble afoot for Leonard Bast, too: after the Schlegels advised him to get a new job, he’s now poor and starving. <em>Hannah Verdier</em><br><br></p> <h2>Expedition Volcano </h2> <h2>9pm, BBC Two</h2> <p>Proving that scientific excitement goes far beyond Bunsen burners, Chris Jackson, Xand Van Tulleken and Aldo Kane travel to Congo, where a team of scientists set up camp to study Mount Nyiragongo, one of Earth’s most spectacular active volcanoes. As if the risk of waking to find lava lapping at your tent flaps wasn’t enough, tests include monitoring the risks of sickness or suffocation by living near the volcano. One hell of a field trip. <em>Mark Gibbings-Jones</em><br><br></p> <h2>Guy Martin vs the Robot Car </h2> <h2>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>With Guy Martin’s very raison d’être threatened by the biggest upheaval in automotive history, he becomes the first man to race against an autonomous racing car, the prototype Roboracer. Lest we forget, this is a man with a tractor piston tattooed on his leg, so for a petrolhead as obsessive as he is, there is much at stake with the advances being made in the realm of driverless cars. He even has a go himself, making a robotic Ford Transit in his shed. <em>Ben Arnold</em> <br><br></p> <h2>Naples ’44: A Wartime Diary </h2> <h2>11pm, BBC Four</h2> <p>In 1943, British officer Norman Lewis entered Naples with the American army and diarised everything he saw. What followed was a journey through a city turned upside down and inside out – overflowing with sex and death, violence and ingenuity. People ate cats and stole anything that wasn’t nailed down. Children turned feral. Unexploded mines made life even more of a lottery. And then Vesuvius erupted. Horrifying and thrilling. <em>Phil Harrison</em><br><br></p> <h2>Dark Files </h2> <h2>9pm, History</h2> <p>As any conspiracy theorist will tell you, there’s no such thing as a conspiracy theorist – the government just wants you to think that. This feature-length doc attempts to take a balanced view of a hot topic among “believers”. Namely, that Camp Hero on Long Island, a military installation decommissioned in 1981, continues to trial mind-control experiments. A former CIA man and a sceptical journalist join documentarian Steve Garetano to investigate. <em>John Robinson</em> <br><br></p> <h2>Babylon Berlin </h2> <h2>9pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>What Sky calls “the first chapter” of the Weimar republic procedural concludes in impressive fashion in this double bill. There’s some key backstory as, via Rath’s invitation to an evening out with colleagues, we learn more about the specific roots of his PTSD – and, a factor in Nazism’s rise, why some German veterans came to see social democracy as a “betrayal”. Meantime, in a city growing ever more dangerous, Lotte is still out freelance investigating. Series two begins next week. <em>Jonathan Wright</em><br><br><br></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Men in Black 3, (Barry Sonnenfield, 2012), 6.05pm, Channel 4</strong><br>Wisecracking Will Smith and hatchet-faced Tommy Lee Jones are a terrific double act as alien regulators Agent J and Agent K, but they’re outshone by Josh Brolin’s inspired turn as Jones’s younger self in this snappy sci-fi sequel. His Agent K, 1969 version, is recruited by J to confound the plans of creepy extraterrestrial Boris the animal (Jemaine Clement). <em>Paul Howlett</em><br><br></p> <p><strong>Fury, (David Ayer, 2014), 9pm, Channel 5</strong></p>    <p>Brad Pitt as grizzled, taciturn tank commander “Wardaddy” Collier leads this old-fashioned second world war film, which is much in the tradition of Saving Private Ryan. Logan Lerman is a scared young clerk warily taken under the veteran’s wing when he is plunged into action. The weary crew, having fought their way through France, make a somewhat cliched stand at a nameless German crossroads; the combat is muddy, bloody and brutal. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Good Kill, (Andrew Niccol, 2014), 12.10am, Channel 4</strong><br>Ethan Hawke is US air force pilot Major Tom Egan, who is fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan from an air-conditioned cubicle in the Nevada desert. He’s a drone pilot, administering death from half a world away, and slowly his work is eating away at his conscience. He hits the bottle, and relations with his wife Molly (January Jones) are strained to breaking point. Niccol’s intelligent and persuasive film is well aware of the human cost of these remote-control killings. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Alléluia, (Fabrice du Weiz, 2014), 1.40am, Film4</strong><br>The pitfalls of online dating are laid horribly bare in this violent, riveting psychological thriller. Almodóvar stalwart Lola Dueñas is Gloria, a Belgian single mum who meets Michel (Laurent Lucas) on a website. It’s a perfect joining of two warped minds, as his habit of seducing and swindling women interlocks with her jealous thirst for blood. A creepy tale of sex and gory madness, loosely based on the real-life Lonely Hearts Killers of 1940s America. <em>Paul Howlett</em> </p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Southampton v Everton</strong> With Huddersfield Town v Manchester City to follow. 12.30pm, Sky Sports Main Event</p> <p><strong>Premiership Rugby Union: Saracens v Exeter Chiefs</strong> Top-flight action from Allianz Park. 2.30pm, BT Sport 2</p> <p><strong>Ashes Cricket: Australia v England</strong> The final day of the first Test from Brisbane. 11.30pm, BT Sport 1</p>
