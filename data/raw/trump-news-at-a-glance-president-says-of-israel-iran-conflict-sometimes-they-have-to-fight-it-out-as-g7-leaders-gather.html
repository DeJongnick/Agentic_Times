<p>As heavy exchanges of missile fire continue and the death toll mounts on both sides, European leaders want to pin down Donald Trump on his Iran strategy – including getting a definitive response on whether he will use his influence over Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to have the warring parties call a ceasefire or instead let them continue fighting.</p> <p>Predicting “peace soon” between Israel and Iran, Trump appeared to have learned little from his 2024 election boast that he could stop the Russia-Ukraine war in “24 hours”. If Israel and Iran can be convinced to call a ceasefire, it might allow the rescheduling of US talks with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> on its civil nuclear programme that had been set for Sunday but were cancelled after Israel launched its assault on Thursday night.</p> <p>Before leaving for the G7 summit in Canada on Sunday, Trump was asked what he was doing to de-escalate the situation. “I hope there’s going to be a deal. I think it’s time for a deal,” he told reporters, adding “sometimes they have to fight it out.”</p>  <h2>European leaders to press Trump on Israel-Iran strategy at G7 meeting</h2>  <p>European leaders gathering for a G7 summit with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> in the Canadian Rockies plan to spend the opening day asking him to justify his confidence and largely unsubstantiated remarks that Israel and Iran will make a deal that will mean “peace soon”. </p> <p>The president has boasted that “we can easily get a deal done between Iran and Israel, and end this bloody conflict”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/european-leaders-plan-to-ask-donald-trump-to-justify-his-confidence-of-israel-iran-ceasefire"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump vetoed Israeli plan to kill Iran’s supreme leader – report</h2>  <p>Donald Trump vetoed an Israeli plan in recent days to kill Iran’s supreme leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ayatollah-ali-khamenei">Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</a>, two anonymous US officials told Reuters on Sunday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/15/trump-vetoed-israeli-plan-to-kill-iran-supreme-leader"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Macron criticises Trump’s threats to take over Greenland during visit</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a> criticised Donald Trump’s threats to take over Greenland as he became the first foreign head of state to visit the vast, mineral-rich Arctic territory since the US president began making explicit threats to annex it. </p> <p>“I don’t think that’s what allies do,” Macron said as he arrived in the Danish autonomous territory for a highly symbolic visit aimed at conveying “France’s and the EU’s solidarity” with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/greenland">Greenland</a> on his way to the G7 in Canada.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/emmanuel-macron-criticises-donald-trump-threats-take-over-greenland"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>‘No Kings’ demonstrator dies after being shot at Utah protest, police say</h2>  <p>A demonstrator died after being shot on Saturday during Salt Lake City’s “No Kings” protest, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah">Utah</a> police said.
