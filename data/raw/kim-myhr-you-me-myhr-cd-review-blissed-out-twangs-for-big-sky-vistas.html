<p>Here’s an album that feels beautifully out of season. Norwegian composer/experimental guitarist Kim Myhr is a master of slow-morphing rhythms and sun-dappled textures that seem to glow from the inside. His electronics are mellow and inviting; his 12-string acoustic guitar has a loose, blissed-out twang.

It’s an album to bolster the spirits and ground the nerves: travelling music for big-sky vistas.<br tabindex="-1"></p>
