<p>A day after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/22/us-attacks-on-iran-inflicted-major-destruction-pentagon-officials-say">Iranian missiles struck</a>, workers were still clearing rubble from the charred remains of an apartment block in Ramat Aviv, a quiet suburb in north-west Tel Aviv.</p> <p>Bystanders stopped and stared at the destruction, some posing for selfies in front of the impact site, other flipping through a diary belonging to one of the building’s residents, which had been thrown on the pavement.</p> <p>“This feels like one long day, it’s non-stop,” said Liat, the CFO of an entertainment firm in Tel Aviv, as she surveyed the destruction. “You have to go to the shelter three or four times in a day. We want to go back to regular life, to have fun again.”</p> <p>The neighbourhood in Tel Aviv was one of 10 sites hit across Israel on Sunday, in the most intense Iranian barrage yet, which left 23 people injured. It came just a few hours after the US military attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/22/hegseth-iran-nuclear-sites-pentagon">which it said “devastated” Iran’s nuclear capabilities.</a></p> <p>A day after the strike, Israelis were wondering how long the war with Iran would last, as Israeli officials issued contradictory statements.</p> <p>Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, said on Sunday night: “Once we achieve the goals, we will not continue beyond what is necessary. But we won’t end it prematurely either. </p> <p>“We will not be drawn into a war of attrition. But nor will we end this action, this historic operation, before we achieve all its goals.”</p> <p>Fighting started on 13 June after Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes on Iran in what it said was a military operation designed to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran quickly responded with a barrage of missiles and drones, kicking off a steadily escalating war now in its second week.</p> <p>Previously, the Israeli military said its goals were to cripple Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programme, as well as stop what they said was an Iranian plan to destroy Israel.<br><br>On Monday, it seemed unclear if Israel’s goals had expanded, with Donald Trump floating the idea of regime change in a social media post and Israeli strikes on internal security forces’ headquarters in Tehran.</p> <p>In Israeli media, senior defence officials were cited arguing that Israel should seize the opportunity and forge a rigid deal with Iran while it was on the back foot.</p> <p>To Liat, the prospect of a prolonged war was daunting. Iran, unlike Hamas or Yeman’s Houthi rebels, she said, was a proper state with proper missiles. </p> <p>Israel is still fighting in Gaza, where nearly 60,000 people have been killed in its military campaign over the last 20 months – a war launched after the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200.</p> <p>Liat said: “This war has to end. It’s been almost a week and a half and its enough. When the Houthis would strike us, we would stay in bed, it wasn’t scary. But buildings are collapsing, you think: ‘It could be me.’”</p> <p>Iranian strikes have killed 24 people in Israel and wounded hundreds more. Israeli strikes have killed at least 430 and wounded more than 3,500 in Iran.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/fears-in-iran-we-are-very-afraid-regime-might-respond-to-the-us-attack">The view from Iran: ‘People have returned to Tehran, although the bombing hasn’t stopped’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thousands have been displaced across Iran, particularly from the nation’s capital, Tehran, which has experienced heavy bombing over the last 10 days.</p> <p>On Monday, the effects of Sunday’s strikes in Israel were still plain to see, with broken glass littering the promenade of a nearby mall. </p> <p>Many businesses across the country were closed as the Israeli home front limited large gatherings so as to ensure adequate space in bomb shelters distributed across the country. <br><br>Life seemed to continue with some sort of normality. Across the street from the blast site, people sipped coffee at a cafe, stickers still affixed to the newly installed windowpanes. People jogged on the streets of Tel Aviv as the Israeli military announced it had just completed a series of strikes in western Iran.</p> <p>Despite Iran launching missiles at Israel that morning, there were no injuries from that salvo.</p> <p>The war with Iran has widespread support in Israel, even among the country’s opposition, with Yair Lapid, Israel’s opposition leader, praising Israel’s strikes as “justified and necessary”.</p> <p>There have been very few protests against the war within Israel, particularly as the home office’s restrictions prohibited gatherings.</p> <p>Gil, a 32-year-old tech worker who lives near the strike site in Ramat Aviv, said: “I think there is a broad understanding that it’s absolutely necessary, I don’t think any civilian is in any position to say when and how the war should end – we just don’t have the data.”</p>
