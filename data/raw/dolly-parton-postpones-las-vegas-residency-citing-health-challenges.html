<p>Dolly Parton has postponed her upcoming Las Vegas concert residency due to health issues.</p> <p>Parton, 79, was due to begin a six-concert run at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace on 4 December. She announced on social media that she has “been dealing with some health challenges, and my doctors tell me that I must have a few procedures”.</p> <p>She did not give details about the procedures but added light-heartedly: “As I joked with them, it must be time for my 100,000-mile checkup, although it’s not the usual trip to see my plastic surgeon!”</p> <p>She continued: “In all seriousness, given this, I am not going to be able to rehearse and put together the show that I want you to see, and the show that you deserve to see. You pay good money to see me perform, and I want to be at my best for you. While I’ll still be able to work on all of my projects from here in Nashville, I just need a little time to get show ready, as they say. And don’t worry about me quittin’ the business because God hasn’t said anything about stopping yet. But, I believe He is telling me to slow down right now so I can be ready for more big adventures with all of you. I love you and thank you for understanding.”</p> <p>It was set to be Parton’s first extended run of concerts in Las Vegas in 32 years.</p> <p>Parton has kept up a regular release schedule in recent years, and reached the US and UK Top Five with her 2023 album Rockstar, featuring collaborations with pop and rock legends including Elton John, Debbie Harry, Sting and, on a cover of Let It Be, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. In 2024, the album Smoky Mountain DNA: Family, Faith and Fables, featured collaborations with Parton family members.</p> <p>More recently, Parton collaborated with rockers Mötley Crüe on a new version of their song Home Sweet Home, released in June. A musical based on her life, Dolly: A True Original Musical, premiered in Nashville in July, ahead of a hoped-for Broadway run.</p> <p>Her husband of nearly 60 years, Carl Dean, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/03/carl-dean-husband-dolly-parton-dies">died in March</a> aged 82.</p>
