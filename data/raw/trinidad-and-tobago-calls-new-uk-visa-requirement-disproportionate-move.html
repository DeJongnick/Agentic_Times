<p>Trinidad and Tobago has described Britain’s new visa requirement for tourists from the twin island state as a disproportionate and disappointing response to the issue of false asylum applications.</p> <p>Trinidad and Tobago nationals previously could visit the UK without a visa, only requiring the electronic travel authorisation (ETA), which was introduced in January for all visa-exempt nations.</p> <p>But on Wednesday the Home Office announced that people from Trinidad and Tobago were joining nationals of just two other Commonwealth Caribbean countries – Jamaica and Dominica – in requiring visas to visit the UK as tourists.</p> <p>The decision was reportedly made after a nine-fold increase in asylum applications from Trinidad and Tobago nationals, with claims <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/uk-scraps-visa-free-entry-from-trinidad-and-tobago-after-asylum-surge-sml2q58ww">rising from</a> an average of 49 a year between 2015 and 2019 to 439 last year.</p> <p>Trinidad and Tobago’s minister of foreign and Caricom affairs, Dr Amery Browne, told local media the UK’s actions were disproportionate. He said: “This move is within their rights as a sovereign nation, but we do not see it as a proportionate response to what UK authorities conveyed to us, which was their observation that a relatively small number of Trinidad and Tobago nationals were misusing the UK immigration system by being processed for an ETA in the normal existing process and then suddenly applying for asylum after arrival.”</p> <p>He added: “We have indicated our disappointment with the new visa requirement and will continue our consistent engagement with our UK counterparts. We are not of the view that regular travellers to the UK should be negatively affected by a relatively small number of persons who have been trying to abuse the British immigration system.”</p> <p>A statement from the British high commission in Trinidad and Tobago confirmed that the changes would come into effect immediately, though there would be a six-week transition period lasting until 23 April “during which time visitors who booked their travel and obtained an ETA before the changes can still enter the UK without a visa”.</p> <p>The statement said that the relationship between Trinidad and Tobago remained a “strong and friendly one”.</p> <p>The British high commissioner to Trinidad and Tobago, Jon Dean, said: “The changes announced today align Trinidad and Tobago with many other visa national countries with which the UK shares close and friendly ties. We understand that travel is important for families, businesses and cultural connections. The introduction of visitor visas is designed to support safe and secure travel while ensuring the UK’s borders remain protected.</p> <p>“The British high commission in Port of Spain has worked closely with the UK government to put in place arrangements that allow Trinidad and Tobago nationals to apply for their visitor visas right here at home. We remain committed to welcoming visitors and look forward to continuing the strong ties between our people. As a valued Commonwealth partner, Trinidad and Tobago remains an important part of the UK’s global community.”</p> <p>Rodney Charles, an<strong> </strong>opposition MP and former permanent representative of Trinidad and Tobago to the UN, said Wednesday’s announcement sent a message that the country “must be more nimble, intentional, nuanced and sophisticated to navigate the turbulent, ‘might is right’ season of Trump-era geopolitics”.</p> <p>He added: “If, as reported, almost 800 [Trinidad and Tobago] citizens in the last two years attempted to ‘abuse’ the immigration system in the UK, then they have affected the immigration status of the remaining 1.4 million of us. In the unforgiving geopolitics of the Trump era, we must all be mindful of the fact that even individual actions can have national consequences.”</p>
