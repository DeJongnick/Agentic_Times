<p>Felicity Rorke’s rental property is a little different from most. As well as providing a secure, comfortable home for the person who lives there, it is helping to end homelessness.</p> <p>Rather than using a general real estate agency, Rorke has chosen <a href="https://www.homegroundrealestate.com.au/" rel="nofollow">HomeGround Real Estate</a> to manage her house. A for-purpose agency that reinvests profit back into the community, this social enterprise has, for 10 years, been proving real estate can provide an opportunity for meaningful change. It manages almost 400 properties across Melbourne.</p> <p>“I heard about it through a friend and colleague and I thought, that’s a great idea,” Rorke says. “So, I switched. I’m fully aware of the impact of the housing crisis and cost of living, and I thought, I should do something where money is going back into ending homelessness.”</p> <p>HomeGround is an ethical real estate agency that directs 100% of its profits to its operator, <a href="https://www.launchhousing.org.au/" rel="nofollow">Launch Housing</a>, a homeless services and community housing provider. Last year, Launch Housing provided more than 14,000 people in Melbourne with housing and support, including more than 2,000 families, and has a goal to end rough sleeping across the city by 2030.</p> <h2>Ethical real estate that gives everyone a chance to go home</h2> <p>The real estate industry has a reputation for profit-driven decisions and behaviour. But Kristina Kourtis, the head of the property management department at HomeGround, says her workplace is different.</p> <p>“Ethical real estate refers to practices within the real estate industry that prioritise social responsibility, sustainability and fairness,” she says. “Overall, ethical real estate aims for positive outcomes for individuals, communities and the environment, balancing profit with purpose.”</p> <p>As well as providing the usual property management services, HomeGround works with owners who want to make life easier for people struggling to find affordable housing. Last year, 40% of its managed properties were offered below market rent. With very few rental properties in Melbourne available to low-income earners, it gives socially minded property owners the opportunity to make a difference and help the agency work towards its mission.</p> <p>“Housing is considered affordable when it costs no more than 30% of a person’s income,” Kourtis says. “HomeGround offers options for property owners who want to offer slightly lower rent. Affordable rent – 10% or more below full market rent – can make a big difference to a low-income family. Property owners will still receive the same premium property management service as always and can even claim the discount as a <a href="https://www.homegroundrealestate.com.au/ato-ruling-information/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20ATO%20ruling,the%20end%20of%20financial%20year." rel="nofollow">tax deduction</a> at the end of the financial year.”</p> <h2>Social good that doesn’t compromise quality property management</h2> <p>HomeGround knows it needs to provide excellent service if it is to achieve its mission. Rorke says she was drawn to the agency’s “quality and consistency” – as well as its deep understanding of and compassion for the people it aims to help.</p> <p>“I thought about competence, experience, reputation and that gut feeling of confidence and comfort with the people who I’ll be working with,” Rorke says. “I want to know that the people who are in my property are being treated in a fair and humane way and that those in charge use an approach that takes people’s lived experience into account.”</p> <p>Kourtis says HomeGround prides itself on offering the same high level of management that owners expect from for-profit real estate and property management agencies.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Photograph: Launch Housing</p></li> </ul> <p>“A recent independent market research survey found that people who had properties managed by HomeGround Real Estate were more satisfied when compared to those managed by mainstream real estate agencies,” she says. “In fact, twice as many rental providers said they were ‘highly satisfied’ with HomeGround Real Estate compared to other agencies.”</p> <p>Rorke is a happy HomeGround client. She says: “The idea that you can have a commercial venture that invests back into a system that’s benefiting a range of people is such a good thing.”</p> <h2>Property management that takes real steps towards equitable housing</h2> <p>Nationwide, an undersupply of social housing and low rental affordability is amplifying a housing crisis. According to <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/housing/estimating-homelessness-census/latest-release" rel="nofollow">census data,</a> more than 30,000 people were estimated to be experiencing homelessness in Victoria in 2021 – a number that had increased by about 24% since <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/housing/estimating-homelessness-census/2016" rel="nofollow">2016</a>.</p> <p>The impact of homelessness can be devastating, affecting a person’s physical and mental wellbeing, and their ability to work and access education. People experiencing homelessness are much more likely to be victims of <a href="https://www.aic.gov.au/publications/crm/crm66" rel="nofollow">violence</a> and develop <a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/australias-health/health-of-people-experiencing-homelessness" rel="nofollow">chronic health conditions</a> than the general population.</p> <p>“If you have any sense of social justice, you understand the issue of homelessness and the importance of having a home,” Rorke says. “HomeGround allows you to charge market rent, or you can look at a reduced rent. So, it caters for everyone. If you want your fees to go to changing people’s lives, it’s a no-brainer.”</p> <p>The impact of renting a property via HomeGround is two-fold: it creates a potential home in the market and directs funding to homelessness services.</p> <p>Kourtis says: “We believe that everyone deserves a safe night’s sleep. But even in a wealthy country like Australia, families face homelessness every day. People who have a property to lease can make a difference by opting to use the services of an ethical real estate agency that reinvests all its profits back into the community to provide housing solutions and help end homelessness.”</p> <h2>Ethical real estate is vital – and urgent</h2> <p>Kourtis says there has never been a greater need for relief from the pressures and risks of rental stress. And, she says, many of us are closer than we might realise to experiencing homelessness ourselves.</p> <p>“Too many people in our city are just a pay cycle or two away from homelessness,” she says. “Rents in Melbourne are at a record high, there are not enough rental properties, and they just aren’t affordable. We are changing lives through the profits we invest into Launch Housing’s work to end homelessness in Melbourne.”</p> <p>For Rorke, it comes down to what it means for a person to be able to come home. “All other issues are better dealt with when you have stable accommodation,” she says. “Having an affordable and well-maintained home is a basic human right.”</p> <p>HomeGround knows the truth of that better than most. Kourtis says: “An ethical property manager is fair and responsive. They understand that the property they manage is not only your investment, but someone’s home, and they never lose sight of that.”</p> <p><em><strong><a href="http://homegroundrealestate.com.au" rel="nofollow">Discover more about ethical real estate with HomeGround Real Estate.</a></strong></em></p>
