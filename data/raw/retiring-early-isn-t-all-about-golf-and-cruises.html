<p>Phillip Inman writes that “Early retirement is a wealthy indulgence that needs to be discouraged” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/26/why-early-retirement-isnt-good-for-uk-plc">Get&nbsp;early retirees off the golf course and back to work – why early retirement&nbsp;isn’t good for UK plc, 26 July</a>). He elicits cliches of golf courses and cruises enjoyed by older people who are not working. The reality for many, however, is very different.</p> <p>The average age of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/economic-labour-market-status-of-individuals-aged-50-and-over-trends-over-time-september-2024/economic-labour-market-status-of-individuals-aged-50-and-over-trends-over-time-september-2024">labour market exit</a> is rising, reaching a new high last year of 65.7 for men and 64.5 for women. However, we know that many people struggle to remain in work in the years before they reach&nbsp;the state pension age.</p> <p>Poor health and providing care for loved ones are two key reasons. The current labour market offers inadequate support and flexibility for these challenges, and people receive little in the way of retraining or help to use transferable skills. All of this reduces the potential for people to work. This leaves many facing real hardship in retirement, years before they can draw a pension.</p> <p>The wealthy baby boomer stereotype masks a problem – there is significant and increasing inequality in pensioner incomes. We must abandon ageist stereotypes and talk about this group in a more nuanced way if we are to make the right calls on pensions policy – for all our sakes.</p> <p>Fair access to work in later life is already an urgent imperative, and will only become more so if the state pension age is to continue rising.<br><strong>Dr Carole Easton</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Centre for Ageing&nbsp;Better</em></p> <p>• What an insulting and stereotyped picture Phillip Inman paints of early retirees. I earned my choice to retire at 55 by working for almost 40 years and paying into a pension from my early 20s. I’ve never played golf and the idea of a cruise is anathema to me. I’m not working my way through a bucket list and I haven’t left England since I retired. But I do volunteer, putting back into my community along with thousands of other retirees who donate thousands of hours of their time each year. Where would charity shops, community centres, Citizens Advice bureaux be without early retirees? Who would look after all those grandchildren whose parents can’t afford childcare? Mr Inman should widen his outlook rather than write off a whole section of the community with his sweeping comments.<br><strong>Jenny Chittenden</strong><br><em>Maldon, Essex</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
