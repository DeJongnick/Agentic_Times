<p>The UK’s most hazardous nuclear site, Sellafield, has pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to cybersecurity failings brought by the industry regulator.</p> <p>Lawyers acting for Sellafield told Westminster magistrates’ court on Thursday that cybersecurity requirements were “not sufficiently adhered to for a period” at the vast nuclear waste dump in Cumbria.<br><br>The charges relate to information technology security offences spanning a four-year period from 2019 to 2023. It <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/28/sellafield-nuclear-waste-dump-to-be-prosecuted-for-alleged-it-security-offences">emerged</a> in March that the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) intended to prosecute Sellafield for technology security offences.</p> <p>Late last year the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/series/nuclear-leaks">Nuclear Leaks</a> investigation revealed a catalogue of IT failings at the site dating back several years.</p> <p>Sellafield pleaded guilty to a charge that it had failed to “ensure that there was adequate protection of sensitive nuclear information on its information technology network”, the Financial Times reported.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/15/dismantling-sellafield-epic-task-shutting-down-decomissioned-nuclear-site">Dismantling Sellafield: the epic task of shutting down a nuclear site</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Guardian reported last year that the site systems had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/04/sellafield-nuclear-site-hacked-groups-russia-china">hacked by groups linked to Russia and China</a> in December last year, embedding sleeper malware that could lurk and be used to spy or attack systems. At the time, Sellafield said it did not have evidence of a successful cyber-attack.</p> <p>Paul Greaney KC, acting for Sellafield, told the court: “It is important to emphasise there was not and has never been a successful cyber-attack on Sellafield.” <br><br>Greaney added that Sellafield’s systems were now robust and said media reports of hacks were “false”.<br><br>An ONR spokesperson said: “We acknowledge that Sellafield Limited has pleaded guilty to all charges.<br><br>“There is no evidence that any vulnerabilities have been exploited,” the spokesperson said, adding that due to ongoing legal proceedings the ONR could not offer further detail at this time.</p> <p>Sentencing is expected to take place on 8 August.</p> <p>The site has the largest store of plutonium in the world and is a sprawling rubbish dump for nuclear waste from weapons programmes and decades of atomic power generation.<br><br>The Guardian investigation revealed a string of IT issues, including concerns about external contractors being able to plug memory sticks into its computer system while unsupervised.</p> <p>The investigation found problems had been known by senior figures at the nuclear site for at least a decade, according to a report dated from 2012, which warned there were “critical security vulnerabilities” that needed to be addressed urgently.</p> <p>Sellafield’s computer servers were deemed so insecure that the problem was nicknamed Voldemort after the Harry Potter villain, according to a government official familiar with the ONR investigation and IT failings at the site, because it was so sensitive and dangerous.</p> <p>At the time, Sellafield said that “all of our systems and servers have multiple layers of protection”.</p> <p>“Critical networks that enable us to operate safely are isolated from our general IT network, meaning an attack on our IT system would not penetrate these,” a spokesperson said.</p> <p>Britain’s public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/feb/15/spending-watchdog-launches-investigation-into-sellafield">launched an investigation</a> into risks and costs at Sellafield earlier this year.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sellafield said: “We have pleaded guilty to all charges and cooperated fully with ONR throughout this process. The charges relate to historic offences and there is no suggestion that public safety was compromised.</p> <p> “As the issue remains the subject of active court proceedings, we are unable to comment further.”</p>
