<p>On Glastonbury’s Pyramid stage in June, Celeste appeared wearing smeared black eye makeup and a leather jacket moulded with the impression of feathers, latched at the throat. She evoked glamour and tragedy, a bird with its wings clipped. “My&nbsp;first album came out nearly five years ago and I didn’t expect it to take so&nbsp;long,” she said of its follow-up. “But&nbsp;I’m here now.”</p> <p>Celeste broke through in 2020, her voice reminiscent of Billie Holiday’s racked beauty, but sparkling with a distinctly British lilt: a controlled, powerful vibrato that stirs the soul. Despite her jazz-leaning balladry not being obvious chart fodder, she became the first British female act in five years to reach No 1 with her debut album, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jan/30/celeste-not-your-muse-review-debut">Not Your Muse</a>, which was&nbsp;nominated for the Mercury prize. She also won the BBC’s Sound of 2020 poll and the Brit award for rising star and was nominated for an Oscar for best original song (for Hear My Voice from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/25/the-trial-of-the-chicago-7-review-aaron-sorkin-sacha-baron-cohen">The Trial of the Chicago 7</a>) the year after&nbsp;– but her chance to capitalise on those accolades was stalled by the pandemic. She had to&nbsp;halt her touring ambitions. Of the&nbsp;years since, she&nbsp;says: “Sometimes you&nbsp;worry: are&nbsp;you&nbsp;on&nbsp;your&nbsp;path?”</p> <p>Celeste was haunting and spectacular when I saw her at Glastonbury, but now, as we stroll through Hyde Park in central London, she is relaxed and laughs easily. She becomes distracted by a carousel ride – “They’re my favourite! I love the music” – then she is back to talking about the five-year struggle to make her excellent second album, Woman of Faces, which will be released in&nbsp;November.</p>    <p>“The title was kind of a diagnosis of how I feel sometimes; a device to help me begin to understand my own complexity,” she says. She was born Celeste Waite in California to a mother from Dagenham, east London, and a Jamaican father. Her mother had found her way to Hollywood as a makeup artist and Celeste was born “quite quickly” after her parents met there. They separated when Celeste turned one and she and her mother moved to England to live in Celeste’s grandparents’ home. “It was almost like my mother was my sister, because we were both being looked after by my nan and&nbsp;grandad.”</p> <p>These are happy memories, but she has “these different weathers in my brain … I’ve always had this little tinge of melancholy.” Maybe, she says, it stems in part from a lack&nbsp;of rootedness: “You move from&nbsp;America to England and you don’t really remember it, but you know that there’s people that you’ve known there and built connections with. And then you don’t have that.” She wondered if she would end up with a mental health diagnosis, “something more clinical later on down the line. But I didn’t feel I really needed that.” Instead, she found solace in other artists’ music,&nbsp;“people’s lyrics and&nbsp;emotions and melodies, even how they dress themselves&nbsp;– that’s always been quite a big remedy without needing to have a&nbsp;professional”.</p> <p>While she is frequently compared to Adele and Amy Winehouse, unlike them Celeste did not attend the Brit school of performing arts, instead studying music technology at sixth-form college in Brighton and working in&nbsp;a pub as she got her career off the&nbsp;ground. “I’m really glad I taught&nbsp;myself to sing,” she says, arguing that it gives her “rawness and authenticity”. Her venture into&nbsp;music was galvanised by the death of her father from lung cancer when she was 16: “When you lose someone, every day you wake up and you’re stunned by the&nbsp;fact that&nbsp;they’re gone. And there’s a certain point where you say to yourself: I&nbsp;can’t do this any more, and that’s when you start to&nbsp;either go to the gym or get into a practice. For me, that was where I&nbsp;picked up music and became really focused.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>People’s lyrics, emotions and melodies, even how they dress themselves – that’s always been quite a big remedy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the mid-2010s, she started uploading music to YouTube and SoundCloud and got a manager. She was picked up as a guest vocalist for producers such as Avicii, while Lily Allen’s label released her debut single. “I worked double shifts in a pub on weekends to afford to go to the studio,” she says. “It took my energy away and&nbsp;I wasn’t able to&nbsp;sing as well any&nbsp;more.”</p> <p>But she carried on doggedly, got signed to the major label Polydor, bagged the 2020 John Lewis Christmas ad soundtrack and&nbsp;beguiled listeners on songs such as Strange, in which her vocal tone expresses every contradictory emotion in a breakup&nbsp;– resignation, hurt, bafflement, poignancy, even a&nbsp;kind of helpless amusement at how awful it all is – in just four&nbsp;minutes.</p> <p>She is clear that she has received plenty of support and encouragement within Polydor: “The people that signed me came into music with the intention to make meaningful, poignant, credible music.” But at the commercial end of the industry, there is still “a huge pressure to make money. If you’re not in the top 2% of acts who have such a huge fanbase, you maybe don’t get the freedom” to do adventurous work. She says that developing her initial sound caused friction. “I&nbsp;was hanging around all these jazz&nbsp;musicians like <a href="https://www.steamdown.co.uk/">Steam Down</a> and <a href="https://www.nubyagarcia.com/">Nubya Garcia</a>, real innovators, and it wasn’t easy for me to go into the label and be like: this is what I&nbsp;want to do.”</p>    <p>She has managed to preserve a sense of strangeness and singularity. Unlike her earlier peppy soul-pop hit Stop This Flame, familiar to millions as backing music on Sky Sports, most of the songs on Woman of Faces don’t even feature percussion – almost unthinkable in 21st-century pop – and there aren’t many British singers on major labels doing symphonic jazz. She wanted “a cinematic feel” and referenced <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19101268">Bernard Herrmann</a> – a composer for films by Hitchcock, Welles and Scorsese – in the studio as she worked with the conductor Robert Ames and the London Contemporary Orchestra. “Herrmann was a real innovator and it’s reflected in people like Busta Rhymes sampling him [on Gimme Some More] all those years later. So we wanted to make sure that if we went into that territory of a cinematic string orchestra, it didn’t feel like an impression of the 1950s – it sounded like something new.”</p> <p>With this ambitious scope and Celeste shuttling between sessions in Los Angeles and London, it took a lot longer than expected to complete Woman of Faces. It was originally due to be finished by the end of 2022 and released a year later. “I didn’t expect it to take so long,” she says. “And if I’m really honest with you, at the end of&nbsp;2021, into 2022, I experienced some heartache and&nbsp;I&nbsp;fell into such&nbsp;a depression about it all.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUA9fxmuvx8"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zUA9fxmuvx8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for On With the Show.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>A relationship had ended. “When you lose the person from your life that you really love, there’s a grief that comes over you,” she says. The album’s first single, On With the Show, was written at her lowest point. “I didn’t really want to go to the studio; I didn’t really feel like I actually wanted to live at that point. I didn’t find meaning and purpose in the music.” She just had the song title, which she shared&nbsp;with her collaborator Matt Maltese. “I didn’t even have to explain to him what it would be about, because he just knew. We&nbsp;spoke about the song and what&nbsp;it&nbsp;needed to be.”</p> <p>She had also recently seen Marius Petipa’s <a href="https://www.ballet.org.uk/blog-detail/need-know-ballet-raymonda/">1898 classical ballet Raymonda</a>. “It’s about a woman in the Crimean war and she has two lovers: one is in Russia and one is in Crimea,” she says. “I&nbsp;could relate, because she was torn between these two entities: at&nbsp;that point, my dedication to music and my dedication to a person. And&nbsp;one was taking the energy from the other. So On With the Show was about me having to find the courage to let go of something, to meet back in with the path of my&nbsp;life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;singer.”</p> <p>Worse, she says, “social media had come in to erode my relationship”. As a public figure on social media, “people can view your relationship and have so much awareness of the fact that you’re even in one. There’s this really strange, invisible, intangible impression that interactions in that space can leave upon your living reality. I was upset at how much that had come to affect my personal, real life.” On Could Be Machine, a curveball industrial pop song inspired by Lady Gaga, Celeste explores the idea that “the more time we spend with this technology, the more we become it”.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>When you lose the person you really love, a grief comes over you. I didn’t find meaning and purpose in the music</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>“My phone had become this antagonist in my life, via communication that I didn’t want to receive and the fact it could just be in your hand. It was quite alien, in a way. I hadn’t grown up with a phone stuck to my hand and it was something that I had to become more and more ‘one’ with in my music career.”</p> <p>She says that, during the relationship, love had reverted her to a kind of “child-like state … a really pure version of yourself, before the world has seeped in and shaped you”. Losing the person who brought her into that state meant that she had to “learn how to steer and guide” herself to rediscover it.</p> <p>She is leaning on other musicians to help her understand these difficult years. She cites Nina Simone’s song Stars, a ballad about the cruelty and melancholy of being a professional musician. “It&nbsp;says so much about the tragedy of where her life is at that moment in time, but then there’s so much triumph in the fact she even gets to express herself in that way.” Another inspiration for Woman of Faces was the 1951 musical romantic comedy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/mar/17/an-american-in-paris-gene-kelly-stage">An American in Paris</a> and one of its stars, Oscar Levant, who spent time in mental health institutions. “I was really moved by what he seemed to carry in his being. And, I suppose, I relate a lot to artists who carry this pain, but their work eases it.”</p>    <p>Whereas Celeste was previously in thrall to American blues and R&amp;B (“the older sense of what R&amp;B was in the 1940s”), down to the way she might “time things and phrase things and even pronounce things”, she has “learned what my true voice is and who I really am as a person. I&nbsp;still have some of that phrasing and pronunciation there, but I exist a lot more as myself, therefore I sing a lot more&nbsp;as&nbsp;myself.”</p> <p>Buoyed up by her and others’ art, does she feel happy? “Yes!” She&nbsp;grins and throws her hands in&nbsp;the air. “The main thing is finding&nbsp;happiness within the relationships I maintain around me and making sure those are kept&nbsp;really positive and nourishing.” She is glad to be in her&nbsp;30s: “Age&nbsp;becomes kind of taboo for a woman in the music industry – but then you hear people&nbsp;like Solange speak about women really coming into their true sense of who they are within their work. There’s been a shift.” </p> <p>And if the happiness in her career ever dissipates, she has decided she&nbsp;will simply move on. “I&nbsp;don’t really see the need to live in a feeling of oppression, when I know there’s so much freedom outside this world. And anyway, I’m sure I&nbsp;would find my way back to it again. But on my own terms.”</p> <p>• Woman of Faces is released on 14 November on Polydor</p> <p>• In the UK and Ireland, <a href="https://www.samaritans.org/">Samaritans</a> can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.org">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href="mailto:jo@samaritans.ie">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.
