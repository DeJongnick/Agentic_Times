 <h2 class="block-title">O'Brien family double the highlight on a fine day for Europe</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The European team had two winners on the first day of the 2025 Breeders’ Cup meeting at Del Mar as Aidan O’Brien took sole control of the record for winners at the meeting with 21 following an easy win for <strong>Gstaad </strong>in the Juvenile Turf.</p> 
  <p><strong>Gstaad’s</strong> victory completed an excellent day for the O’Brien family, after his son, Donnacha, had earlier registered his first Breeders’ Cup success, with <strong>Balantina</strong> in the Juvenile Fillies Turf.</p> 
  <p><strong>Christophe Soumillon</strong>, whose only previous winner at the meeting was 20 years ago, made light of a difficult draw in stall 14 on Gstaad and had the 6-5 favourite settled three wide at the first turn. He then made steady progress down the outside going to the final turn, before taking it up at the top of the stretch.</p> 
  <p>The win took Aidan O’Brien one clear of the American legend D Wayne Lukas’s total of 20 Breeders’ Cup victories.</p> 
  <p>There were some significant withdrawals from the European squad in the hours before Friday’s opening-day card, as Aidan O’Brien’s <strong>Precise, </strong>the hot favourite for the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf, and <strong>Military Code, </strong>a leading fancy for the Juvenile Turf Sprint, were both ruled out. In the absence of Precise, however, O’Brien’s younger son, Donnacha, enjoyed the first Breeders’ Cup success of his career, as Oisin Murphy extracted <strong>Balantina</strong> from a tight pack of runners on the home turn to run out a comfortable winner.</p> 
  <p><strong>Balantina</strong> was just a second winner at the meeting for Murphy, who had a turbulent year that included a car crash in April and a subsequent conviction for drink-driving, before he emerged as Britain’s champion jockey for a fifth time.</p> 
  <p>“To be honest, she took to the track very well,” Murphy said. “Donnacha was very upbeat [about] the way she trained in the mornings. And she’s incredibly athletic and she handled the track like it was made for her. That’s my seventh Group One win of the year, and a lot have been on bigger priced horses.”</p> 
  <p>Donnacha O’Brien has many memories of family trips to the Breeders’ Cup as a child.</p> 
  <p>“We’ve been coming here a long time, since we were babies, really,” he said. “To watch Dad do it year in and year out, and [his brother] Joseph to get winners. It’s nice to be on the board.”</p> 
  <p>The European team came up short in the opening turf race, the Juvenile Turf Sprint, as <strong>Cy Fair </strong>made the most of a good break from the stalls and held the late charge of Aidan O’Brien’s <strong>Brussels, </strong>who lost several length with a slow start.</p> 
  <p>In the card’s races on the dirt, meanwhile, <strong>Ted Noffey</strong>, the odds-on favourite, ground out a one-length win in the Juvenile while John Sadler’s <strong>Super Corredora</strong> took the Juvenile Fillies.</p>

He came home an easy winner and <strong>Aidan O’Brien </strong>is now the out record-holder for Breeders’ Cup victories with 21. </p>

  <p>That was a bit more of a struggle for <strong>Ted Noffey</strong> that seemed likely a furlong out, when he ranged up alongside the front-running <strong>Brant </strong>and threatened to stride clear. He took just half a length out of the leader, though, and the closers were starting to chase them down. Ted Noffey dug a little deeper to put the race to bed, but it was more workmanlike than spectacular. </p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Juvenile Turf, 1m, turf</strong></p> 
  <p>Aidan O’Brien’s last chance today to take sole control of the record for Breeders’ Cup winners, as <strong>Gstaad, </strong>a winner in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot in June, attempts to defy a shocker of a draw in stall 14. He has been beaten in all three of his starts since that Ascot win, but was just three-quarters of a length behind the winner in the Dewhurst Stakes and has several pounds in hand of this field on ratings. His biggest threats from the US-trained contingent look likely to be <strong>Bottas</strong>, unbeaten in two starts including a Grade Two, and Wesley Ward’s <strong>Outfielder, </strong>owned by Kia Joorabchian’s Amo Racing operation, who went the other way earlier in the season and lined up for the Prix Morny at Deauville, where he was a good fourth, around two-and-a-half lengths behind second-placed Gstaad. <strong>Argos </strong>is worth a second look too after his win in the Grade One Summer Stakes at Woodbine.</p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Juvenile Fillies’ Turf, 8f, turf</strong></p> 
  <p>All change in the betting for this race after <strong>Precise </strong>was ruled out due to an infection earlier today, and Frankie Dettori’s mount <strong>Imaginationthelady </strong>is now among the market leaders. She won the Grade Two Jessamine Stakes at Keeneland in October, coming from midfield with a perfectly-timed run. <strong>Time To Dream</strong> was just over a length behind her in third and also has obvious prospects now that Precise is a scratch, while <strong>Queen Of Hawaii </strong>is also a big runner from stall two for Joseph O’Brien. She’s only won at Group Three level thus far but has progressed with every race and has clearly been aimed at this from a long way out by a trainer with an excellent Breeders’ Cup record. <strong>Brave Deb, </strong>meanwhile, is an outsider to consider, she won the Surfer Girl Stakes at Santa Anita last time.</p>

  <p><strong>Brussels</strong> was finishing best of all in that race, and appeared to lose more ground than he was beaten by with a very poor start, reminiscent of days of yore when Aidan O’Brien’s Breeders’ Cup runners routinely fell out of the stalls and gifted the field a lead. <strong>True Love, </strong>who never figured, was slow to stride too. </p> 
  <p>Taking nothing away from <strong>Cy Fair, </strong>though. Irad Ortiz jun rode a perfect race on the 5-1 shot from an iffy draw in 10.</p>

  <p><strong>PREVIEW: Juvenile Fillies, 1m 110yd, dirt</strong></p> 
  <p>Bob Baffert has a strong hand here with <strong>Explora </strong>and <strong>Bottle Of Rouge, </strong>the first two fillies in the betting at present, and there is a direct form line to ponder as <strong>Bottle Of Rouge </strong>was a one-length winner of the Grade One Del Mar Debutante Stakes over 7f in September with Explora in second. Explora made the running and Bottle Of Rouge ground her way past inside the final furlong, but Explora subsequently improved to run out a highly impressive winner of the Oak Leaf at Santa Anita and is favourite to reverse the earlier form with Bottle Of Rouge today. <strong>La Wally</strong>, meanwhile, was third in the Debutante and staying on well at the death, so should be suited by the extra distance here. <strong>Tommy Jo </strong>arrives with two Grade One wins already, in the Spinaway at Saratoga over seven furlongs and then the Alcibiades<strong> </strong>over an extended mile at Keeneland. She was hugely impressive in Spinaway, sitting a couple of lengths off a strong page (22.22sec for the quarter-mile then 44.54sec for the half), powered into the on the turn and went clear. The Alcibiades was closer, though, as <strong>Percy’s Bar</strong> set a fair pace, was first past the post but then demoted, having given Tommy Jo a bump halfway down the stretch. The other big trial for this is the Frizette Stakes at Aqueduct in New York, won extremely narrowly this year by <strong>Iron Orchard, </strong>with the third home over four lengths further back.</p>

  <p><strong>Preview: Juvenile Turf Sprint</strong></p> 
  <p>Aidan O’Brien’s <strong>True Love, </strong>the winner of the Group One Cheveley Park Stakes, was the early favourite for this race and still heads the market despite picking up a distinctly sub-optimal draw in stall nine. She beat <strong>Havana Anna, </strong>trained by O’Brien’s younger son, Donnacha, by three-quarters of a length there and it looks like the strongest form on offer, although O’Brien also fields <strong>Brussels, </strong>second in both the Middle Park Stakes and then the Cornwallis, as useful backup. Brussels also has a decent draw in one, though he has had six races already this season including four since 8 August. Other interesting runners include Frankie Dettori’s mount, <strong>Aspect Island, </strong>from the burgeoning dual-purpose James Owen stable, who was just behind Brussels in the Cornwallis, while the front-running <strong>Schwarzenegger </strong>is the shortest-priced US-trained runner. Wesley Ward’s colt posted some very warm fractions at Keeneland last time out and is an interesting each-way chance, even from a tricky draw in stall 11. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Preamble</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hello from the wonderful <strong>Del Mar</strong> racetrack 20 miles north of San Diego, where <strong>Bing Crosby</strong>, no less, was a founding member of the board – and also sold the first ticket on opening day in 1937. The walls of the magnificent main stand are covered with photographs and memorabilia from nearly a century of racing here – famous names to have won here include <strong>Seabiscuit</strong>, <strong>Bill ‘The Shoe”</strong> <strong>Shoemaker</strong>, <strong>Zenyatta</strong> and many more – and there will be more racing history to be made later today on the first afternoon of the <strong>2025 Breeders’ Cup.</strong></p> 
  <p>The five Breeders’ Cup races on the Friday card are all for two-year-olds – two on the dirt and three on the turf – but the early news here is of disappointing late scratches from the European team, with both Aidan O’Brien’s <strong>Precise, </strong>the warm favourite for the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf, and <strong>Military Code, </strong>a leading fancy for the Juvenile Turf Sprint (21.45 GMT) both now out of their respective races.</p> 
  <p>Precise’s absence is blow for the meeting, but it does leave the locally-trained <strong>Imaginationthelady, </strong>ridden by a certain, soon-to-be-retired jockey called <strong>Frankie Dettori</strong>, as one of the favourites for the Grade One event at 23.45 GMT.</p> 
  <p>Even with Military Code out, though, the European challenge for the <strong>Juvenile Turf Sprint</strong> remains strong, with runners trained by various members of the O’Brien family filling four of the top five spots in the betting.</p> 
  <p>Previews of the five Breeders’ Cup events, including video form to assist in the finalising of selections, will be along soon, and the 2025 Breeders’ Cup will be underway in just under an hour, so stay tuned - or keep refreshing – for all the news, betting moves, results, post-race comments and more as one of the world’s most exciting and valuable race meetings goes through the gears.</p>
