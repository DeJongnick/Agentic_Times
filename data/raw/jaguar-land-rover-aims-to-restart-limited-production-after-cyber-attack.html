<p>Some factory workers at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) returned to work on Monday, with the British manufacturer hoping to start making a limited number of cars as soon as this week after a crippling cyber-attack.</p> 
<p>The first factory expected to restart production is at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/29/jaguar-land-rover-to-restart-some-manufacturing-after-cyber-attack">Wolverhampton in the West Midlands</a>, where JLR makes engines. Some workers are understood to have returned to the site on Monday.</p> 
<p>Suppliers have also been told JLR may look to restart limited production at its factories in Nitra, Slovakia, and Solihull in the West Midlands by the end of this week, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. Nitra makes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/30/new-land-rover-defender-to-be-built-in-slovakia-not-the-uk">JLR’s Land Rover Defender</a>, while Solihull – JLR’s biggest site – produces the Range Rover, its flagship luxury model.</p> 
<p>The cyber-attack on the last day of August <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/20/jaguar-land-rover-hack-factories-cybersecurity-jlr">forced JLR to shut down key systems</a>, from vehicle design software, the flow of millions of parts, manufacturing and sales.</p> 
<p>Any initial vehicle production will be aimed at verifying that systems are working properly after a complicated IT rebuild. High-volume manufacturing is thought to be several weeks away at least, and plans could change given the complex nature of the recovery.</p> 
<p>Getting JLR’s plant at Halewood in Merseyside back up and running may take slightly longer, the sources said.</p> 
<p>The UK government last week said it would step in to help JLR and its supply chain by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/27/jaguar-land-rover-plans-to-restart-engine-manufacturing-in-early-october-report-says">guaranteeing £1.5bn in private sector loans</a> to Britain’s largest automotive employer. However, more than a week after that announcement – and several public statements from business secretary, Peter Kyle, and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves – it is thought that no deal has been formally signed.</p> 
<p>Instead, JLR is expected to try to expedite payments as soon as this week to its suppliers in order to help with cashflow issues.</p> 
<p>The Confederation of British Metalforming, a lobby group representing many JLR suppliers, told the Guardian last week that it was crucial for cash to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/01/jaguar-land-rover-suppliers-asked-to-put-up-homes-as-loan-security-after-hack">reach smaller companies further down the supply chain</a>, many of which have been unable to access emergency funds.</p> 
<p>JLR declined to comment on the schedule for restarting production. A spokesperson said: “As the controlled, phased restart of our operations continues, we are taking further steps towards our recovery and the return to manufacture of our world-class vehicles.</p> 
<p>“We have informed colleagues, retailers and suppliers that some sections of our manufacturing operations will resume in the coming days.</p> 
<p>“We continue to work around the clock alongside cybersecurity specialists, the UK government’s [National Cyber Security Centre] and law enforcement to ensure our restart is done in a safe and secure manner.”</p>
