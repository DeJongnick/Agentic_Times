<p>The drama on Wisteria Lane looks set to continue with a new iteration of the hit ABC show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/oct/03/i-cant-believe-they-went-there-20-years-of-the-silly-sexy-and-utterly-outrageous-desperate-housewives">Desperate Housewives</a> in development.</p> <p>The show is scheduled at Onyx Collective, with Kerry Washington to executive-produce along with Pilar Savone and Natalie Chaidez. The latter, who recently worked on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/26/the-flight-attendant-review-kaley-cuoco">The Flight Attendant</a>, will also write the spin-off series, currently titled Wisteria Lane.</p> <p>The series, first reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/desperate-housewives-reboot-wisteria-lane-kerry-washington-1236379573/">Deadline</a>, will purportedly be a fun, dark, sexy soap/mystery set among five different frenemies who live on a picture-perfect cul-de-sac with the same name as the original series. “On the surface, all the Wisteria neighbors are living the dream: beautiful homes, gorgeous families, shiny SUVs in the driveway,” according to the initial report. “But behind those white-picket fences and smiling Insta posts are SECRETS.”</p> <p>The original series, created by Marc Cherry starring Teri Hatcher, Eva Longoria, Nicolette Sheridan, Felicity Huffman and Marcia Cross, became a quick hit in 2004. It ran for eight seasons and more than 200 episodes on ABC, racking up 38 Emmy nominations and a win for Huffman, for best comedy actress, in 2005.</p> <p>It’s unclear whether Washington will star in the new series, which falls under her Simpson Street banner. Cherry was not involved in the pitch but may still collaborate on the project, sources told Deadline.</p> <p>The news comes on the heels of the 20th anniversary of Desperate Housewives’ premiere last fall, which brought a new wave of nostalgia and speculation over a reboot. In November, Cherry told <a href="https://people.com/desperate-housewives-creator-marc-cherry-has-an-idea-for-a-reboot-exclusive-8751845">People</a> that “about 70,000 people” had asked him about a reboot, but that he would probably set it in an earlier period. “I would probably want to do the idea maybe in an earlier decade. Because the character I miss writing the most is actually Wisteria Lane,” he said. “That was the most fun playground anyone in the history of television has ever had, because we owned the whole street.” The show’s set remains a tourist attraction at Universal Studios and has been used for numerous films and commercials.</p> <p>The original cast have engaged with reboot talk, as well, with Longoria telling <a href="https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/i-literally-slept-with-everybody-on-the-street-eva-longorias-desperate-housewives-confession/news-story/1e5f792d3cd9bd700753d0d0a251caeb">Stellar Magazine</a> earlier this month that she “would be the first person” to sign up for a new Desperate Housewives. As of now, there are no plans for any of the original cast members to appear on the new Wisteria Lane.</p>
