<p>Hype too often influences policymakers when it comes to regulating markets. So it was reassuring to hear <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/andrew-bailey-speech-at-the-annual-financial-and-professional-services-dinner-mansion-house">Andrew Bailey</a>, the governor of the Bank of England, resist the momentum behind cryptocurrencies. In his July Mansion House speech, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/07/digital-currencies-pose-threat-to-economy-warns-bank-of-england">reiterated</a> his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-20/boe-s-bailey-raises-doubts-over-digital-pound-for-consumers">scepticism</a> over the need for a “Britcoin” central bank digital currency or a UK stablecoin, with tokens issued by finance houses and backed by their sterling reserves. As Donald Trump signs <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/crypto/genius-act-new-crypto-law-stablecoins-explained-rcna219658">stablecoins</a> into US law and rebrands private dollars with political colours, Mr Bailey’s caution isn’t just prudent, it’s essential.</p> <p>The governor’s <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/andrew-bailey-cautions-banks-against-070030456.html">view</a> is that UK banks should not be allowed to issue their own stablecoins. Nor should the Bank effectively run <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/12/the-guardian-view-on-the-digital-pound-an-impetuous-idea-with-a-risky-momentum-of-its-own">Britcoin</a> bank accounts&nbsp;without clear public benefit. These are not the&nbsp;views of a luddite, but of a regulator worried, correctly, about creating a new class of imprudent assets. The key question is not whether new technologies can be adopted in finance, but whether they should be – especially when the consequences of&nbsp;failure could affect the wider economy.</p> <p>George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor who advises a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/31/george-osborne-coinbase-cryptocurrency-us-court"> large cryptocurrency exchange</a>, argued that Mr Trump’s embrace of stablecoins, which are privately&nbsp;issued digital money, means Britain must sign up to remain relevant. The former Labour cabinet&nbsp;minister Ed Balls <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ng/podcast/could-the-epstein-files-cost-trump-his-maga-base/id1706536336?i=1000717776980">considered</a> this naive, given&nbsp;recent history. He was right.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/05/the-dark-side-of-cryptocurrency">The dark side of cryptocurrency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Stablecoins are not, despite the branding, stable. These private digital tokens purport to be backed one for one by real money, often US dollars. But the peg is only as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/central-bank-body-bis-delivers-stark-stablecoin-warning-2025-06-24/">trustworthy</a> as the institution making the promise. When a commercial bank issues a stablecoin, it is effectively minting its own currency&nbsp;– without, as the <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/arpdf/ar2025e3.pdf">Bank for International Settlements</a> noted, the backing, oversight or “lender of last resort” guarantees of a central bank. This creates a parallel financial market, one prone to runs, crashes and contagion – just as happened in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States">19th-century America’s free banking era</a>, when half the new banks collapsed, many unable to honour the notes they had issued.</p> <p>Yet Mr Trump is pressing ahead by letting banks and even non-banks issue dollar-pegged crypto assets. He is also <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/sale-trump-leveraging-power-office-reap-profits-family-123858027">leveraging</a> the power of his office for personal gain in plain sight. One of the Trump family’s cryptocurrencies is conservatively estimated to have pulled in at least $320m since January, while another received a $2bn investment from a foreign government wealth fund. A third has sold at least $550m in tokens. Steven Levitsky of Harvard University spoke for many when he told the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/trump-crypto-memecoin-corruption">Guardian</a> this summer that he had “never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhere”.</p> <p>Cyber-libertarians <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0065-0">view</a> cryptocurrencies as a tool to evade state control, regulation and taxation, aligning with radical rightwing ideas about government as a problem. This seems to be the view of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6675a4b9-a2e9-4171-a1d8-704de946bce3">Paul Marshall</a>, the UK hedge fund tycoon and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/sep/10/gb-news-paul-marshall-deal-buy-spectator-redbird-imi">media baron</a>, who sees a Manichean world of central bank fiat versus free-market cash. Such ideological takes don’t help with stable capital markets or effective consumer protection. Britain’s <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2022/01/10/inside-britains-financial-revolution/">financial sector</a> should be <a href="https://www.ippr.org/articles/is-the-uk-s-outsized-financial-sector-worth-it">smaller</a> for the country’s long-term health, but it must still remain competitive – on regulatory terms that preserve stability, not simply to keep pace with Trump-era financial populism or <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/05/the-future-of-cryptocurrency-in-the-gulf-cooperation-council-countries?lang=en">petro-state</a> opportunism. Crypto is a gamble not just on technology, but on the very meaning of&nbsp;money and who gets to control it.</p> <p><em><strong>• Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
