Whilst we apologise for any inconvenience and disruption, the safety and security of everyone at the airport was our No 1 priority as we worked through this incident with police partners.”</p> <p>West Midlands police said the airport was “partially evacuated” so a vehicle could be searched and assessed. “Following a search by the explosive ordnance disposal team the vehicle was deemed to be safe. The vehicle is no longer being treated as suspicious. The safety of all was our primary concern and there is no wider risk to the public,” the force said.</p> <p>“The airport has resumed normal business with minimal disruption. We would like to thank the public for their patience and support while we dealt with this incident.”</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday the airport had said its operations were affected and advised all passengers to stay away.
