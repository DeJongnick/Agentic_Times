<p>Two men have been convicted in Zambia of planning to use witchcraft to kill the president, Hakainde Hichilema.</p> <p>Leonard Phiri, a village chief, and Jasten Mabulesse Candunde, a Mozambican citizen, were arrested in December after a cleaner reported hearing strange noises. Authorities said they were found to be in possession of a live chameleon and other “assorted charms”, including a red cloth, an unidentified white powder and an animal’s tail.</p> <p>“The motive of the crime was to kill the head of state,” the magistrate Fine Mayambu said in his ruling at a court in Lusaka. “The convicts were not only enemies of the head of state but all Zambians.”</p> <p>The men were sentenced to two years in prison with hard labour.</p> <p>The prosecution said they had been hired by the brother of the opposition MP Emmanuel “Jay Jay” Banda, who is facing trial for robbery, attempted murder and escaping custody.</p> <p>The conviction, under a British colonial-era law that criminalises so-called witchcraft, comes as Hichilema has faced growing criticism for cracking down on free speech and political opposition.</p> <p>Hichilema is using the courts to suppress his opponents, appointing allies to the election commission and “rewriting constitutional rules” for his own benefit before national elections next year, Sishuwa Sishuwa, a senior lecturer at Stellenbosch University said in a <a href="https://mg.co.za/thought-leader/2025-09-15-zambias-2026-election-how-hichilema-is-tilting-the-playing-field-against-opponents/">column</a> for the Mail &amp; Guardian, a South African newspaper.</p> <p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025/country-chapters/zambia">Human Rights Watch said</a> in its 2024 annual global human rights report: “The administration of President Hakainde Hichilema increasingly exhibited tendencies toward authoritarianism … the authorities harassed and intimidated journalists, youth activists and political opposition leaders for expressing dissent or criticism of the government.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, a furious row is raging over the burial of Hichilema’s predecessor and bitter rival Edgar Lungu, who died in South Africa in June. Lungu’s family have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/zambian-presidents-feud-with-late-rival-continues-over-site-of-funeral">fighting the repatriation of the body</a> for a state funeral, claiming he did not want Hichilema to attend. A South African court is weighing whether to allow the Lungus to appeal against an earlier decision that the body should be sent back to Zambia.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/us-destruction-contraceptives-denies-african-women-girls-lifesaving-care-ngo">US destruction of contraceptives denies 1.4m African women and girls lifesaving care, NGO says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Accusations of witchcraft are not uncommon in Zambian politics. Amid the legal battle over Lungu’s funeral, rumours have been circulating that Hichilema wants to use the body for occult purposes.</p> <p>“Personally I don’t believe in witchcraft, never believed in witchcraft, as a person, as a family, as a Christian,” Hichilema told the journalist Martine Dennis last month when asked about the allegations on her Africa Here &amp; Now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGhuWHucd_g&amp;list=PLdXKjXVnJ8X2Z3h5y5gFQuFGJuGStE5wj">podcast</a>.</p> <p>However, many people in Zambia argue that traditional spiritual beliefs should not be criminalised.</p> <p>“I hate that colonial piece of legislation that attempts to outlaw a practice that it does not understand,” Gankhanani Moyo, a cultural heritage lecturer at the University of Zambia, told Associated Press.</p> <p><em>Agence France Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>
