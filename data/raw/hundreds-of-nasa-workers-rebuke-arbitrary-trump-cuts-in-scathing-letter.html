<p>Almost 300 current and former US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa">Nasa</a> employees, including at least four astronauts, have issued a scathing dissent opposing the Trump administration’s sweeping and indiscriminate cuts to the agency, which they say threaten safety, innovation and national security.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.standupforscience.net/nasa-voyager-declaration">The formal letter</a>, titled The Voyager Declaration, is addressed to the <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F07%2F09%2Fpolitics%2Fsean-duffy-named-interim-nasa-administrator&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjackie.wattles%40cnn.com%7C6255ac6d68e34efae5cd08ddc7c69ec7%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638886378086354262%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=HP7csNUZS9sghtWmzG2HXRlc%2F71MT%2F0sf3h0vGsFJbU%3D&amp;reserved=0">acting Nasa administrator</a>, <a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2025%2F07%2F09%2Fpolitics%2Fsean-duffy-named-interim-nasa-administrator&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjackie.wattles%40cnn.com%7C6255ac6d68e34efae5cd08ddc7c69ec7%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638886378086354262%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=HP7csNUZS9sghtWmzG2HXRlc%2F71MT%2F0sf3h0vGsFJbU%3D&amp;reserved=0">Sean Duffy</a>, a staunch Trump loyalist appointed on 7 July who is also his transportation secretary. The declaration, which is dedicated to 17 astronauts who have died in past spaceflight incidents, warns of catastrophic consequences if the proposed cuts to science grants, staffing and international missions are implemented.</p> 
<p>“Major programmatic shifts at Nasa must be implemented strategically so that risks are managed carefully,” the letter said. “Instead, the last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on Nasa’s workforce.</p>

<p>“We are compelled to speak up when our leadership prioritizes<a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/07/trump-administration-moves-to-tighten-the-noose-around-nasa-science-missions/"> political momentum</a> over human safety,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nasa-terminates-chief-scientist-role-closes-policy-office-2025-03-10/"> scientific advancement</a>, and<a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/nasa-2026-budget-proposal-in-charts"> efficient use of public resources</a>. These cuts are arbitrary and have been enacted<a href="https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-appropriations.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/meng-letter-to-nasa-7.10.25-3%29.pdf"> in defiance of congressional appropriations law.</a> The consequences for the agency and the country alike are dire.”</p> 
<p>The letter sounds the alarm over suggested changes to Nasa’s Technical Authority, a system of safety checks and balances established in the wake of the 2003 Columbia shuttle disaster that killed seven astronauts. “The culture of organizational silence promoted at Nasa over the last six months already represents a dangerous turn away from the lessons learned after the Columbia disaster,” the declaration states.</p> 
<p>The declaration has 131 named signatures – including at least 55 current Nasa employees – and 156 anonymous signatories. Interim administrator Duffy, a former television host who was appointed after the ousting of a longtime Nasa employee, Janet Petro, is the final step in the chain of Technical Authority command.</p> 
<p>Trump’s billionaire donor and former ally Elon Musk oversaw the loss of at least 2,600 of Nasa’s 17,000-plus employees<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/09/nasa-staff-departures-00444674">, according to Politico</a>, before the billionaire businessman stepped back from the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge). <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I3qXx1XDLKukqAd9U6zVp7S861XUAKZaAp0vrmsDJpg/edit?gid=0#gid=0">So far, at least $120m in Nasa grants</a> have been terminated, and the White House has proposed slashing a quarter of the agency’s total budget for next year. International missions have been cancelled, and almost half the agency’s science budget could be cut in 2026.</p> 
<p>The signatories said they dissent from the indiscriminate cuts to Nasa research which supports national security by ensuring the US role as a global leader in science and technology. “Basic research in space science, aeronautics, and the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45348"> stewardship of the Earth</a> are inherently governmental functions that cannot and will not be taken up by the private sector,” the letter says.</p> 
<p>The Voyager Declaration, named after the twin Nasa spacecraft that are exploring interstellar space, is only the latest formal dissent against Trump’s unprecedented assault on science and federal agencies.</p>
