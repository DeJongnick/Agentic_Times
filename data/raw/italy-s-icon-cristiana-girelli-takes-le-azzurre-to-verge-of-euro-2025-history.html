<p>The clock showed 89 minutes and 18 seconds. That was how close a weary Italy were to extra time against Norway in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/16/norway-italy-womens-euro-2025-quarter-final-match-report">tense quarter-final in Geneva</a>. It was clear from the frayed nerves and unusually dishevelled appearance of the coaching staff on Italy’s bench that they were concerned those on the field did not have much left in the tank. All their stamina and emotions had been left on the pitch after almost 90 energy‑sapping minutes of a game they knew they should be winning.</p> 
<p>What they seemed to forget for a minute, however, was that they have Cristiana Girelli. Their talismanic centre-forward can do many things on a football pitch but nothing is more certain than her scoring goals. They needed just one chance, one delivery and the odds were on that their captain would take it. </p>

<p>That moment came: a pinpoint Sofia Cantore cross, an intelligent run by Girelli to lose the full-back, and an angled header that had one destination.</p> 
<p>It was a goal emblematic of Girelli’s career, which has spanned the best part of two decades, and sent Italy into a European Championship semi-final for the first time since 1997. With 122 caps and 61 goals across 12 years, Girelli has been at the forefront of <em>Le Azzurre</em>’s past six major tournament appearances and is widely considered among her peers and fans as one of the best to pull on the shirt.</p> 
<p>Girelli has played her entire career in Italy, bridging the gap from amateur to full-time, with Serie A Femminile going fully professional in 2022. She has spent seven seasons with Juventus and finished the last campaign as the league’s top scorer with 19 goals that propelled <em>Le Bianconere</em> to their first title in three years.</p>

    <p><b>Italy 1-5 England, 27 Feb 2024, Algeciras</b></p>
    <p>The Lionesses started preparations for the Euro 2025 qualifiers perfectly, with a dominant win over Italy in south-west Spain. Lotte Wubben-Moy gave England the lead inside the first minute and Lauren Hemp scored twice to put England 3-0 ahead after 34 minutes. <i>Le Azzurre</i> got one back just before half-time through Michela Cambiaghi, but England cemented their dominance with second-half goals from Ella Toone and Rachel Daly to round off an impressive performance.</p>

    <p><b>England 2-1 Italy, 19 Feb 2023, Coventry</b></p>
    <p>England made it two out of two wins in the Arnold Clark Cup, thanks to two Daly headers either side of Sofia Cantore’s 62nd-minute equaliser. Italy could not contain Daly, who in addition to her goals, hit the crossbar just before half-time. The Lionesses broke the attendance record for a sporting event at the CBS Arena, drawing a crowd of 32,128.</p>

    <p><b>England 1-1 Italy, 7 April 2017, Stoke</b></p>
    <p>England were held to a frustrating draw in their penultimate home match before Euro 2017. Italy scored with their only attempt on goal, which came from Valentina Cernoia minutes after Jodie Taylor opened the scoring in the 70th minute. The Lionesses dominated Mark Sampson’s 50th match in charge, with a whopping 23 shots to Italy’s six. <b>Eze Obasi</b></p>

<p>She is not a conventional No 9. Although her movement in the area, aerial ability and instinctive finishing are second to none, she is more than a penalty box poacher. She loves to drop deeper and help to build from the pocket, is potent from free-kicks and, as shown in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/portugal-italy-womens-euro-2025-match-report">Group C draw with Portugal</a>, has the ability to score from distance. </p> 
<p>In the quarter-final, she not only scored twice but made six recoveries and led the way for Italy in terms of duels won (eight), touches in the opposition box (seven) and shots on target. It was a performance that illustrated her capabilities at defending from the front as much as her threat in front of goal.</p> 
<p>Girelli wears her heart on her sleeve. The emotion she feels representing her country and bringing them success runs deep. This has never been more evident than when the final whistle blew on Wednesday night. Having barely had time to rest after being substituted, she ran on to the field in disbelief, hands to her head, before embracing Barbara Bonansea, a player with whom she has spent so much of her journey.</p> 
<p>The two centurions’ careers have been inextricably linked, their national team debuts coming six months apart and Girelli moving to Juventus a year after Bonansea. The latter deserves just as much credit for Italy’s development. The tears flowed and the celebrations were euphoric. Girelli turned photographer temporarily for a picture in front of Italy’s fans as they started to realise what they had achieved.</p> 
<p>“It’s a dream come true,” Girelli said. “It’s really something special. I felt something different – something special – in this team. I’ve seen a special light in the eyes of my teammates … It’s history for Italian women’s football. I’m so happy and proud for this team.”</p> 
<p>The progress of the women’s game in Italy has been slow, with less investment and accessibility than in other top European footballing nations. It has meant that Girelli has failed to receive due praise, something Italy’s manager, Andrea Soncin, alluded to on Wednesday. “Throughout her career, she’s received less recognition than she truly deserves, both for her technical ability and her character,” he said.</p> 
<p>In the semi-finals await England, where there has been no lack of support in recent years. For Girelli, it could be her last appearance at a major international tournament. It is uncertain how long she can continue and she told AFP on Saturday that this would be her last European Championship.</p> 
<p>However, she and her teammates will be determined this journey does not end just yet. Italy are on the verge of something monumental, one win from a game that could massively improve the trajectory of the sport back home. Girelli’s legacy is written but her last contribution to a nation she has served for so long could yet be the biggest of all.</p>
