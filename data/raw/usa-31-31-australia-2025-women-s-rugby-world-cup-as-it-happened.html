To compensate for the unjust inequities, the blatant sexism and the years of neglect. There’s also an understandable need to focus less on results and the quality of rugby and shine a light on the stories of the individuals involved, to champion those heroes who have sacrificed so much to represent their nations.</p> <p>No need on this one. This was just a brilliant, breathtaking dig-dong affair. Two wonderful sides, producing moments of magic with just enough error to keep things open. </p> <p>It was by a distance the game of the tournament and will take some beating before the whole show comes to an end.</p> <p><strong>Luke McLaughlin </strong>was fortunate enough to see it with his own eyes in York.

That won’t happen.</p> <p>A bonus point for four tries scored or a defeat of seven points or less will also be enough. I don’t either of those things will happen either.</p> <p>So it’ll come down to points differences – in my opinion.</p> <p>Currently the USA are 135 points behind Australia so it would need to be a dramatic swing. Australia beat Samoa 73-0. The USA, you’d think, would need to better that.</p> <p>As Group A stands, England are on top top 10 points. Australia are second with 8.

I fully agree. The World Cup has had everything apart from jeopardy and close games. This one promises both.</p> <p>The Wallaroos are a team on the rise. Quarterfinalists three years ago, they’ve benefited from an influx of sevens stars and increased attention and funding. Their most recent game against the Eagles ended with a 27-19 victory in the Pacific Four Series in May and they’ll be full of confidence after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/23/australia-samoa-womens-rugby-world-cup-match-report">thrashing Samoa in an 11-try, 73-0 rout</a>. </p> <p>Does that make them favourites? Not accordinng to Alivia Leatherman, the USA’s prop who told reporters this week, “We should win,” adding, “we have everything we need” to get the result.</p> <p>I love it. I want a bit of needle and a bit of chest thumping in the sport I consume and there’ll be plenty of that, I’m sure of it.</p> <p>Australia’s coach Jo Yapp has said she’s not interested in her team playing “pretty” rugby. All she cares about is the win.</p> <p>That sort of do-or-die attitude is what makes World Cups the unmissable showstoppers that they are. I can’t wait for this one!</p> <p>Team news, some quality reading and other bits and bobs to follow.</p> <p><strong>Kick off is at 7.30pm BST/4.30am AEST/2.30pm EDT.</strong></p> <p><a href="mailto:daniel.gallan.casual@guardian.co.uk">Wherever you are in the world I’d love to hear from you.</a></p> </div>   </div>
