<p>For patients who have experienced injury or trauma as a result of a car accident or stroke, physiotherapy rehabilitation services can be crucial in helping them get their lives back to normal.</p> <p>Physiotherapists who are part of a multidisciplinary early supported discharge (ESD) team start working with patients while they’re in hospital and continue to support them once they go home. </p> <p>“Once they’re stable, it’s about getting them home at the earliest opportunity so they can continue their rehabilitation,” says physiotherapist Emma Cork, neuro-rehabilitation service lead at Northern Devon healthcare trust. The trust offers ESD for patients that have had strokes and is looking to expand the service to patients with acquired brain injuries.</p> <p>Cork says: “Patients feel safe and really benefit psychologically. And the rehabilitation can be tailored around everyday life.”</p> <p>Another benefit is the way the system allows the therapist to support the patient’s family or carer. And it saves money, says Cork: “Previously [patients] were kept in for their rehab because of the long waits to see community teams. Getting them home frees up beds in the acute stroke unit for new patients.”</p> <p>At Airedale NHS foundation trust there is a move to improve the availability of community rehabilitation services to patients in more remote, rural areas using telemedicine, which the trust already employs in prisons and care homes.</p> <p>Cath Gregson, head of therapies and rehabilitation at the trust, says that while it can be difficult for commissioners to prioritise rehabilitation under current financial constraints, she’s optimistic that its importance is being recognised: “If you read the NHS outcomes framework there’s a clear focus on rehab services,” she says. </p> <p>Yet a survey by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) into the treatment of patients with hip fractures found “disturbing” gaps in rehabilitation after patients left hospital – with fewer than half being offered a service. </p> <p>If patients are immobile at home they’re at risk of complications, such as pressure sores, chest infections and deep vein thrombosis, the CSP warns, all associated with hospital readmission. Its director of practice and development Natalie Beswetherick says: “Investing in rehabilitation gives people the chance to live their lives again.”</p> <h2>Case study: trauma</h2> <p><strong>Major Paul Rennie is the military physiotherapy lead in complex trauma at Headley Court, the armed forces’ dedicated rehabilitation centre in Surrey.</strong></p> <p>“When I left the Royal Corps of Signals after nine years’ commissioned service, I decided to try for a medical career. I’d received physiotherapy for injuries I’d sustained while in service, so the profession interested me. </p> <p>On getting a degree in physio I worked in the NHS for a couple of years, but I missed the military life and thought, because of my background, I could make a difference there.</p> <p>I work with complex trauma cases, including battle casualties from Iraq and Afghanistan, and those who have been injured in road traffic accidents and on exercise and adventurous training. </p> <p>The most severe conflict injuries result from the detonation of improvised explosive devices: amputation and significant soft tissue loss if someone was on foot; severe fractures in the lower limbs or spine if people were in a vehicle.</p> <p>Patients come in to the centre unable to move. We use exercise therapy, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, soft tissue work, and work with prosthetics to ensure that patients leave here ready to live independent lives. </p> <p>The challenges are the complexity of the injuries and their psychological impact. We therefore work with other professionals to give holistic care. </p> <p>It can be distressing, because many patients will not be able to remain in the military. Countering that is the reward of seeing the progress they make, both physically and in their private lives, from being at their lowest point. It’s quite wonderful.”</p> <p><strong><br></strong></p>
