    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:D - To put that in some context, West Ham have already conceded 18 this season., 2:B - It was a very good one, to be fair. He scored five tries in a 65–14 win against Sale Sharks., 3:B - Thibaut Courtois was vocal in his opposition to the idea, saying: “This decision distorts the competition. Playing at home is not the same as playing away. In La Liga, playing away is very difficult. Villarreal away is tough. It’s not fair to change the rules mid-season without consulting us.”, 4:B - Bezzecchi was a bit freaked out by the incident but recovered to win the race. “It was pretty hard,” he said. “Because at the beginning I hit a big bird – unfortunately for him, but also for me because I got scared. Fortunately nothing was broken on the bike.”, 5:B - Docherty had a long and varied managerial career. In his five years at Manchester United in the 1970s he experienced relegation, promotion, a defeat in an FA Cup final and a victory in an FA Cup final., 6:B - Dyche scored a penalty as Chesterfield drew 3-3 with Middlesbrough in the semi-finals in 1997. Chesterfield lost the replay 3–0., 7:A - In 1985, when Alex Ferguson was their manager. Hearts host Celtic on Sunday in what feels like a massive game in this season’s title race., 8:A - The three Tests will be played in London, Liverpool and Leeds over the next three Saturdays. , 9:C - England beat Australia in the opening game of the World Cup in 1995, but Australia beat England in the final a few weeks later. , 10:A - They won the title – the first in their history – in style. They wrapped it up with three games to go., 11:B - The hosts were beaten by Australia, South Africa and England in the group but turned it around and scraped into the last four. , 12:A - At the World Gymnastics Championships, which have been taking place in Indonesia this week., 13:B - England captain Zoe Aldcroft also captains the club. , 14:A - Wardley has had an intriguing career – he worked for a recruitment agency while making his way as a boxer.</p>
