<p>While statistics show that there is clearly a problem with some children, or their families, not valuing their time in school, I take issue with Anne Fine’s suggested solution (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/sep/07/anne-fine-children-should-allowed-learn-online-instead-school">Anne Fine: children should be allowed to learn online instead of going to school, 7 September</a>).</p> <p>She is right to suggest that young people react badly to being considered empty vessels into which information is poured. Good teachers in our education system have avoided this model of learning for some time. However, the idea that children who find it difficult to work cooperatively would be better learning remotely fills me with&nbsp;dismay.</p> <p>My experience as a headteacher for more than 30 years is that where children are encouraged to be curious, to question and to collaborate, their learning becomes more relevant to them and more enjoyable. Working in isolation would not provide these&nbsp;opportunities.</p> <p>Perhaps we should look elsewhere for the reasons why many pupils are not motivated to attend school. In recent years, it has become more difficult for teachers to plan creatively to match the interests of their learners. The nonsensical prescriptive and irrelevant requirements introduced to the curriculum by Michael Gove, coupled with the terror of Ofsted, have helped to suck the joy from many classrooms. </p> <p>It takes a teacher with a track record of success and a supportive headteacher to step out of line and design activities that will make their classrooms exciting.<br><strong>Jim McManners</strong><br><em>Trimdon Grange, County Durham</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
