<p>Britain’s exports of plastic waste to developing countries have soared by 84% in the first half of this year compared with last year, according to an analysis of trade data carried out for the Guardian.</p> <p>Campaigners described the rise in exports, mostly to Malaysia and Indonesia, as “unethical and irresponsible waste imperialism”.</p> <p>In 2023, the EU <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/17/waste-plastic-eu-ban-exports-non-oecd-countries">agreed to ban exports of waste to poorer nations</a> outside a group of mainly rich countries within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The ban comes into force in November 2026 for two and a half years and can be extended. The UK does not have a similar ban in place.</p> <p>Data analysed by the The Last Beach Cleanup, a US group campaigning to halt plastic pollution, showed that the increase in UK exports in the first half of 2025 was mainly to Indonesia (24,006 tonnes in 2025, up from 525 tonnes in 2024) and Malaysia (28,667 tonnes, up from 18,872 tonnes in 2024).</p> <p>Total plastic waste exports remained relatively high in the first half of 2024 and 2025, at 319,407 and 317,647 tonnes respectively. The percentage of UK plastic waste going directly to non-OECD countries was 20% of total plastic waste exports in 2025, up from 11% in 2024.</p> <p>The Last Beach Cleanup analysed data from the UN Comtrade database to reach its findings. Jan Dell, who works for the group, accused UK ministers of “hypocrisy” by failing to ban exports to poorer nations.</p> <p>“The UK is hypocritically saying, ‘we’re part of the high ambition coalition’, at the plastics talks. But behind the scenes, it is refusing to set a date to stop exporting to poorer countries,” she said. “We see it is increasing exports of its own plastic waste to places like Malaysia and Indonesia.”</p> <p>She added: “It is unethical and irresponsible waste imperialism.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/15/plastic-pollution-talks-geneva-treaty">After the collapse of the UN plastic treaty talks</a> in August, Emma Hardy, under-secretary of state at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra),<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/15/plastic-pollution-talks-geneva-treaty"> </a>said she was “hugely disappointed” an agreement had not been reached but was proud of the UK’s work towards an ambitious treaty.</p> <p>Britain was part of a “high ambition” coalition of nations calling for the treaty to include binding obligations on reducing plastic production and consumption, she said.</p> <p>Campaigners are calling for the UK, one of the top three countries <a href="https://www.letsrecycle.com/news/uk-is-third-highest-exporter-of-waste-says-cleanhub/">exporting plastic waste,</a> at about 600,000 tonnes a year, to follow the EU and ban exports to non-OECD countries. They also want to close a loophole that makes it cheaper to export plastic waste rather than recycle it in the UK.</p>    <p>The Conservative government said in 2023 that it <a href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2023-10-16/202759">intended to ban plastic waste exports to non-OECD countries</a> – but it never happened.</p> <p>Wong Pui Yi, a Malaysia-based consultant for Basel Action Network, a group championing global environmental health and justice, said there were “good guys and bad guys” in the waste trade.</p> <p>“A lot of waste traders are looking to reduce costs,” she said. “If waste falls into the hands of the bad actors, one of the easiest ways to reduce costs is to avoid environmental controls. In developing countries, it is easier to avoid environmental controls due to weaker laws and lower enforcement capacity.”</p> <p>In July, the UK’s exports of plastic waste to Malaysia dropped to 2.8% (1,500 tonnes), most likely due to the country’s new import restrictions. But as one country bans or tightens imports, as happened with China in 2018, the trade shifts elsewhere.</p> <p>The rise in UK plastic exports to Asia is likely to be an underestimate, experts say, because a lot goes to the Netherlands and other European countries where it can be shipped on. The UK also exports plastic to Turkey.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/24/single-use-plastics-ban-tabby-fletcher-jura-petition-scottish-parliament-msp">‘You don’t get to aim big when you are somewhere small’: A teenager’s fight to end single use plastics on her Scottish island</a> </p> </aside>  <p>James McLeary, the managing director of Biffa Polymers, a UK recycling firm, said the UK should take responsibility for its plastic waste.</p> <p>“It is just common sense as a human being” he said. “I don’t want my rubbish to end up in Malaysia. I don’t want to wonder if there is a boy whose life is wasted somewhere because of me throwing something in a bin outside my house.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/23/boy-wasted-podcast-uk-rubbish-turkey-recycling-centres">an investigation called Boy Wasted</a> revealed that, for the last decade, two people were crushed, ripped, or burned to death in the recycling sector in Turkey every month.</p> <p>Adnan Khan, a Canadian journalist whose work on refugee labour in Turkey sparked the investigation, said that while Turkey had a licence system for recycling plastic waste, “my research shows that it is pretty easy to get a licence and the oversight is low. It’s a broken system.”</p> <p>All EU plastic waste exports should be banned to anywhere outside the EU, he said. “I would go further and say every country should take care of its own trash.”</p> <p>A Defra spokesperson said: “The export of waste is subject to strict controls set out in UK legislation.</p> <p>“Our collection and packaging reforms will underpin £10bn worth of investment to support UK based recycling, reducing our dependency on exports of plastic waste.” </p>
