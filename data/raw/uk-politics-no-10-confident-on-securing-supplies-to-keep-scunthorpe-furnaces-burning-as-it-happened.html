Prof Rob Gross, the director of the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/energy">Energy</a> Research Centre said: “The clean power mission can actually help save the steel industry.</p> <p>“High energy prices in the UK undoubtedly play a role in the problems faced by steelmakers. But high energy prices are absolutely not created by net zero policies. Britain is acutely exposed to fluctuations in gas prices, and the gas price also drives UK electricity prices more than in other countries.</p> <p>“Britain’s amazing wind resources offer the potential for cheap, stable energy prices. We need to build the infrastructure of clean power so we can have cheap power for decades. The drive for clean energy also creates a large demand for steel, for wind farms, nuclear power stations and pylons.”</p> <p><strong>Read more from Helena Horton here: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/14/rightwing-media-blames-ed-miliband-uk-steel-crisis-net-zero">Rightwing media falsely blame Ed Miliband for UK steel crisis, experts say</a></strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/14/rightwing-media-blames-ed-miliband-uk-steel-crisis-net-zero">Rightwing media falsely blame Ed Miliband for UK steel crisis, experts say</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67fd14ae8f0819448f7d846f" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/jasper-jolly"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-14T14:01:34.249Z">3.01pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The largest steelworkers’ union has welcomed the promotion of two British Steel veterans to lead the company under government control.</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Community</strong> union said it welcomed the appointments of <strong>Allan Bell</strong> as chief executive and <strong>Lisa Coulson</strong> as chief commercial officer, after a near-total breakdown in relations between workers and British Steel’s Chinese owners, Jingye.</p> <p>Assistant general secretary <strong>Alasdair McDiarmid</strong> added “We have enjoyed a constructive relationship with Allan and Lisa in their previous roles, and we know that they will fulfil the government’s ambition of maintaining reliable and professional leadership on site.

It laid the groundwork for long-term investment.</p> <p>And it guaranteed enhanced protections for every Tata employee in Wales.

As it is not a budget, it will not change Scotland’s tax regime (including the lowest income tax rates in the UK for the less well-off and the highest for higher earners) or economic subsidies, or cut departmental budgets.<br><br>He said the Scottish National Investment Bank, which is theoretically independent, would instead be given new priorities for its £200m in spending, as would Scotland’s three enterprise agencies.<br><br>There was scope too for redirecting £150m in offshore renewables receipts and unallocated spending in this year’s budget. That could all help bolster inward investment from particularly US companies eyeing up business opportunities in Scotland.<br><br>Swinney said he had urged <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>, the prime minister, during a phone call on Friday, to relax the UK Treasury’s “self-imposed” fiscal rules to allow more borrowing, and to immediately approve UK spending on the <a href="https://theacornproject.uk/">Acorn carbon capture project</a> in north east Scotland and <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/news/2023/edinburgh-to-lead-new-era-of-uk-supercomputing">a new “exascale” super computer</a> at Edinburgh university.<br><br>That “doesn’t require a fundamental realignment of the budget, but there is a need to challenge ourselves on policy, to make sure that the policy interventions that we take are commensurate with the scale of the challenges that we now face,” he said.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67fce99f8f08532673048a6d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-14T11:01:55.275Z">12.01pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">China tells UK not to 'politicise' British Steel crisis, urging 'fairness' towards Jingye</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>China responded to the British government stepping in to take control of Chinese-owned British Steel at the weekend by telling the UK not to “politicise” the process, with the Chinese embassy calling for fairness.</strong></p> <p>In a statement the Chinese embassy said “We are following closely the developments of British Steel involving the Chinese private company.</p> <p>“We have urged the British side to act in accordance with the principles of fairness, impartiality and non-discrimination and to make sure the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese company be protected.”</p> <p>The statement continued “It is an objective fact that British steel companies have generally encountered difficulties in recent years,” adding “It is hoped that the British government will actively seek negotiation with the relevant Chinese company to find a solution acceptable to all parties.”</p> <p>Separately, carrying a threat about future Chinese investment in the UK, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry urged the British government on Monday to “avoid politicising trade cooperation or linking it to security issues, so as not to impact the confidence of Chinese enterprises in going to the UK.”</p> <p>“When it comes to the operational difficulties currently faced by British Steel, the two sides should negotiate a solution on the basis of mutual benefit,” Reuters reports spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular news briefing in Beijing.</p> <p>Beijing said it hoped London would “treat Chinese businesses that have invested and operate in the UK fairly and justly, protect their legitimate and lawful rights and interests.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67fce4408f08532673048a34" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-14T10:34:22.923Z">11.34am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The director general of <strong>UK Steel</strong>, the trade association for the steel industry in the country, has issued a statement on the latest developments with the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe. <strong>Gareth Stace</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The Act passed this weekend by the Government gives British Steel and its workers breathing space while a long-term situation for the site’s operations is found.</p> <p>The next and most immediate step is securing the iron ore and coking coal needed to keep the furnaces operating.

We understand that, and we support the government. Do you want to do that this morning?”</p> <p>Baldwin replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Well, I think that, you know, I know that it was looked at very rigorously at the time. It was welcomed by the unions. And I think we need to recognise that 2025 is very different from 2019. And we need to focus on the future of this critical national infrastructure in this industry in our country.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if the opposition would back full nationalisation of the plant in Scunthorpe if the alternative was for it to go completely under, Baldwin said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think it’s always got to be a last resort. But, you know, there was a period when the government owned it, before Jingye came in, and so I think you should never have anything off the table, but I think that does need to be a last resort.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was again pointed out that the Conservatives did the deal to sell the business to Jingye, Baldwin said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It was a deal that was welcomed by the unions and local communities at the time. So can we put that in the past and focus on the future of this critical industry.</p> </blockquote> <p>She accused the Labour government of “scrambling at the last minute, scrambling to recall parliament, and scrambling to run a steel company now,” claiming “that shows that this is a failure of negotiation by the current government.”</p> <p>Baldwin was then asked “Is this a wider problem of privatisation for the Conservatives. You know, we look at Thames Water and what’s happening here. This is a failure of 14 years of Conservative rule, isn’t it not?”</p> <p>The MP replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think there’s a general consensus. If you hear the chancellor today talking about investment in our infrastructure, she’s always looking for partnerships with private equity capital. She’s looking for your pension and my pension to be investing in some of these infrastructure.</p> <p>I think there is always going to be a role for private capital in all of these organisations. And I think it means that there’s less competition in terms of financing for the schools, for the hospitals, which do require exclusive public funding.</p> <p>So yes, I think there’s always going to be a role for private investment, and I think that’s an argument that’s already been won.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67fcc6188f0893c437a03ebc" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-14T08:30:34.015Z">9.30am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The UK government’s intervention to try to keep the blast furnaces in Scunthorpe running has drawn some criticism from the SNP, who have attempted to compare it unfavourably with the treatment of the potential closure of Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland.</strong></p> <p>SNP Westminster leader <strong>Stephen Flynn</strong> challenged business secretary <strong>Jonathan Reynolds</strong> over it in parliament in London on Saturday.</p> <p>Labour’s Midlothian MP, <strong>Kirsty McNeill</strong>, who also acts as parliamentary under-secretary of state for Scotland, commented on the row while appearing on the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland radio programme.</p> <p>Claiming that the previous Conservative administration in Westminster and the Scottish government had “no industrial strategy to speak of”, she told listeners:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>These situations are different, which is why this interventionist UK government has an industrial strategy that matches solutions to the problems at hand.</p> <p>I would contrast the speed with which they [the SNP] can take to social media and take to the airwaves to air their grievances and the speed at which they move to secure Scottish jobs.</p> <p>In the end, they’re having a conversation about Grangemouth today because they’re manufacturing a grievance.

The government does not expect Jingye to re-enter negotiations but Reynolds added that recent events had raised a “high trust bar” for Chinese firms seeking to invest in key British industries.</p> <p>Increasing volatility in global markets, particularly in light of the Trump administration’s stance on European security and trade tariffs, has perhaps also put pressure on the government to keep the British steel industry afloat.</p> <p><strong>You can read more from Nimo Omer here: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/14/first-edition-british-steel-nationalisation">Monday briefing – is nationalisation the answer to the British Steel crisis?</a></strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/14/first-edition-british-steel-nationalisation">Monday briefing: British Steel is in crisis – is nationalisation the answer?</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email">Sign up for the First Edition newsletter: our free daily news email</a></em></p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67fcbb5d8f085326730488d4" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-14T07:41:52.049Z">8.41am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Another union official, <strong>Roy Rickhuss</strong>, who has been general secretary of the Community Union since 2013, also appeared during the media round today, talking about the government’s efforts to keep the blast furnaces in Scunthorpe in operation.
