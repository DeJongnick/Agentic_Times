<p>State and territory disability ministers have threatened to boycott an upcoming NDIS meeting with the Albanese government after being given just two minutes to contribute to discussions.</p> <p>In a joint letter from all jurisdictions sent on Thursday to the health and disability minister, Mark Butler, and the NDIS minister, Jenny McAllister, ministers warned they were “no longer able to confirm” their attendance at the meeting next Friday unless given the opportunity to “meaningfully contribute”.</p> <p>The letter stated each minister would be offered just two minutes of speaking time after a 20-minute update from the federal government on the latest proposal to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/20/children-with-autism-to-be-diverted-off-ndis-under-2bn-program-announced-by-albanese-government">shift children with mild to moderate developmental delays</a> or autism from the NDIS to state-run programs.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/20/children-with-autism-to-be-diverted-off-ndis-under-2bn-program-announced-by-albanese-government">Children with autism to be diverted off NDIS under $2bn program announced by Albanese government</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is not reasonable or acceptable and would effectively prevent disability ministers from using this forum as intended – to drive national reform in the interests of people with disability, their families and our communities,” the letter read.</p> <p>“While our jurisdictions are participating in good faith with the Commonwealth’s new negotiating group and officials’ group, our engagement through these forums was never intended to restrict disability ministers from representing our jurisdictions through the DRMC [Disability Reform Ministerial Council].”</p> <p>The ministers said they would reconsider their attendance if given at least 10 minutes each.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>A spokesperson for Butler said the meeting was vital for working on the recommendations of the disability royal commission and on cracking down on fraud within the NDIS.</p> <p>“People with disability across Australia expect states and the Commonwealth to get on with this important work,” they said.</p> <p>Next week’s meeting will follow Butler’s announcement in August to develop the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/21/what-are-the-changes-to-the-ndis-and-how-will-it-affect-those-already-using-it">$2bn Thriving Kids program,</a> which will begin rolling out from mid-2026.</p> <p>Under the new proposal, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/20/children-with-autism-to-be-diverted-off-ndis-under-2bn-program-announced-by-albanese-government">children with mild to moderate developmental delays</a> or autism will be diverted from the NDIS and offered other programs.</p> <p>While details of how the program will run remain unannounced, state and territory politicians have been critical of the decision, and claim <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/12/states-react-to-labor-ndis-changes-autism-services-thriving-kids">they were blindsided</a> by the federal government.</p> <p>Victoria’s premier, Jacinta Allan, and the state’s disability minister, Lizzie Blandthorn, both said in August they first learned of the proposed program when it was revealed at Butler’s press club address.</p> <p>Butler has dismissed the suggestions, saying the plans had been on the table for almost two years.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
