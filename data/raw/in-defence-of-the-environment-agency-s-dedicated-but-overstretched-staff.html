<p>The long read (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/13/dirty-waters-how-the-environment-agency-lost-its-way">Dirty waters: how the Environment Agency lost its way, 13 June</a>) does a disservice to the Environment Agency’s dedicated and loyal but underpaid staff that I represent. Although it is a category one responder – equivalent to the emergency services – its incident response services are woefully underfunded, relying on depleted volunteers. To safeguard its future, we need to see commitments for increased resourcing, continued independence and a reversal of the recruitment and retention crisis.<br><strong>Sue Ferns</strong><br><em>Senior deputy general secretary, Prospect union</em></p> <p>• Zoe Williams writes: “This should be the climate crisis election ... Instead, we’re in fantasyland” (G2, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/18/sane-world-sandi-toksvig-politician-nigel-farage-entertainer">18 June</a>). Indeed it should, and can, be. This Saturday, Extinction Rebellion will be in central London – with all the flair, intelligence and fun the public has come to expect – to ensure that what follows is a climate election. Get there if you can. If not, join your local XR branch and help turn dream into reality.<br><strong>Caroline Roaf</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>• It says a great deal about the state of the world that the G7 agreed to send $50bn to help Ukraine protect itself from Russian aggression (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/13/g7-biden-zelenskiy-ukraine">Report, 13 June</a>) on the same day that an already unbelievably wealthy man was given almost the same sum for a year’s work (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/13/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musk-pay">Tesla shareholders approve CEO Elon Musk’s $45bn pay package, 13 June</a>).<br><strong>Adrian Riley</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>• Haven’t we suffered enough?
