<p>Good morning.</p> <p>More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/25/journalists-killed-israeli-strikes-hossam-shabat-mohammed-mansour-press-freedom-groups-condemn">170 journalists have been killed in Gaza since 2023</a>, with some estimates putting the toll as high as 206. It is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2024/dec/23/palestine-journalists-killed">deadliest conflict</a> for media workers in recent history. In a sobering report, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/17/in-gaza-a-press-vest-makes-you-a-target-the-journalists-who-have-paid-a-price-for-reporting-on-the-war">Thaslima Begum</a> gathered some of their stories. And attacks on journalists worldwide <a href="https://www.ifj.org/media-centre/news/detail/category/press-releases/article/ifj-publishes-2024-annual-report-on-journalists-and-media-staff-killed">are on the rise</a>, with deaths occurring everywhere from the Middle East to Europe.</p> <p>Just this week, Hossam Shabat, a 23-year-old reporter, was killed in Gaza. Shabat had feared death since Israel accused him of terrorist activity. He had already written a message to be published in the event of his death: “For the past 18 months, I have dedicated every moment of my life to my people. I documented the horrors in northern Gaza minute by minute, determined to show the world the truth they tried to bury … I risked everything to report the truth, and now, I am finally at rest – something I haven’t known in the past 18 months.”</p> <p>For today’s newsletter, I spoke with Palestinian journalist <em><strong>Hind Khoudary</strong></em>, who has been reporting from Gaza since the start of the war, about the situation on the ground for reporters and Guardian journalist <em><strong>Ruth Michaelson</strong></em> about what is driving the decline in press freedom around the world. That’s right after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>UK economy </strong></em>| Lower-income households are on track to become £500 a year poorer by the end of the decade as a result of the UK chancellor’s spring statement, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/27/rachel-reeves-statement-poorest-500-a-year-worse-off-thinktank">according to analysis</a> by the Resolution Foundation.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Monarchy </strong>| </em>King Charles required<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/27/king-charles-undergoes-hospital-observation-due-to-cancer-treatment-side-effects"> hospital observation on Thursday after experiencing “temporary side-effects”</a> as part of his medical treatment for cancer, Buckingham Palace said.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Canada </strong></em>| Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/us-allies-worldwide-decry-trump-car-tariffs-and-threaten-retaliation">the era of deep ties with the US </a>“is over” as governments from Tokyo to Berlin and Paris sharply criticised Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on car imports, with some threatening retaliatory action.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Asia-Pacific </strong></em>| Japan has for the first time released plans to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/28/japan-taiwan-evacuation-plan-conflict-china">evacuate more than 100,000 civilians from some of its remote islands near Taiwan </a>in the event of conflict amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Taipei.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Environment </strong></em>| Supporters of the climate group Just Stop Oil have announced that after three years of disruptive protests they are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/27/just-stop-oil-hangs-up-the-hi-vis-after-three-years-of-climate-action">ending their campaign of civil resistance</a>. Hannah Hunt, whose speech on Valentine’s Day 2022 marked the beginning of the campaign, made the announcement outside Downing Street in London on Thursday.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: ‘No Palestinian journalist is too high-profile to be targeted or harmed’</h2>    <p>This week, two Palestinian journalists were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/24/israeli-airstrikes-kill-at-least-65-people-in-gaza-in-24-hours">killed in Israeli airstrikes</a>: Al Jazeera’s Shabat (above left), who died in Beit Lahiya, and Palestine Today’s Mohammed Mansour (above right), who was killed in his home alongside his wife and son. Israeli forces deny targeting journalists, but in this case the IDF confirmed it had deliberately killed both reporters, calling them terrorists. Shabat, widely known for his reporting from northern Gaza, had already <a href="https://x.com/HossamShabat/status/1849162170661052417">rejected such claims</a> when they were first levelled against him in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable”.</p> <p>Israel has barred foreign journalists from entering Gaza, an unprecedented move in modern times, leaving the task of documenting the violence solely to Palestinian reporters working on the ground without protection. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/21/israel-idf-accused-targeting-journalists-gaza">Within months of the war starting</a>, press freedom organisations accused the Israeli military of targeting journalists and their families. In the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, reporters face growing hostility from Israeli forces. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/08/26/joint-statement-requesting-eu-action-israels-unprecedented-killing-journalists-and">Human Rights Watch</a> has said the Israeli government “has taken an unprecedented series of steps to curtail media freedom, effectively resulting in the establishment of a censorship regime”.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Life as a journalist in Gaza</strong></p> <p>Journalists in Gaza are not only working under heavy bombardment. Like every other civilian, they are contending with perilous conditions. Khoudary, who has been displaced in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip for the past year and a half, does not remember the last time she saw her family, who evacuated to Cairo. “Since then I have been on my own,” she says. “All I want is a hug after a very harsh day. I want to sit on my mother’s lap and hug my brothers. It has been so hard losing everything you own and love. I never thought that I would ever live this in my life.”</p> <p>Khoudary says the situation has been particularly bad since the collapse of the ceasefire and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/halting-aid-to-gaza-is-aimed-at-giving-israel-upper-hand-in-talks-with-hamas">renewal of the total blockade of aid</a>. “Journalists have been literally living everything they have been reporting – we have been displaced, starved, dehydrated, not sleeping,” she says. Making things harder, she adds, is the distress of learning that colleagues and friends have been injured or killed.</p> <p>Shabat’s death was felt particularly acutely because he was one of the few journalists who remained in northern Gaza. “There was an intimacy to his coverage, the way he documented his home and what was happening there, and because of this the outside world had grown to know him,” Ruth says. “The other thing Shabat said was that he felt like he was being hunted, and that is a sentiment we hear time and time again from our colleagues reporting in Gaza – that they feel like they are being singled out for attack.” </p> <p>The Israeli government has strenuously denied targeting journalists, or has said that those who have been targeted were involved in violent activity. </p> <p>This is not the first time Israeli authorities have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/grey-zone-how-hamas-linked-journalists-legitimate-targets">made such claims</a>. Last year they designated six Al Jazeera journalists based in Gaza as members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), an allegation the network vehemently <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/al-jazeera-says-israels-claim-that-six-of-its-journalists-are-terrorists-is-a-baseless-fabrication-13240578">denies</a>. The Committee to Protect Journalists has previously condemned Israeli authorities for the “smearing of killed Palestinian journalists with unsubstantiated ‘terrorist’ labels”.</p> <p>Foreign media have been pressuring the Israeli government to allow them into Gaza, but Ruth points out that this slightly obscures the reality that Palestinian journalists are already reporting for international outlets. Khoudary says Palestinian journalists have been marginalised and neglected: “People have been using us as tools for their media agencies. Most of us don’t have protection gear, we are working with the bare minimum of tools to tell the story.</p> <p>“Sometimes people forget the fact that we are also humans,” Khoudary continues. “We have been reporting with zero break, no days off, because there is no days off. I just want the world to know that we are very tired and overwhelmed and we do not want to lose more.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>West Bank and East Jerusalem</strong></p> <p>The attacks on media are not limited to Gaza. In September, Israeli forces raided Al Jazeera’s office in the occupied West Bank and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/22/al-jazeera-office-west-bank-raid-israeli-forces-media">banned its operations in Israel</a>. And last weekend <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-03-25/ty-article/.premium/unjustified-illegal-germany-condemns-israels-arrest-of-german-journalist-in-west-bank/00000195-cd36-db0b-a5f5-cdfe25340000">a German journalist</a> was arrested by Israeli police in the occupied West Bank for allegedly assaulting a settler, despite video footage showing settlers blocking him and acting threateningly. A few days later Oscar-winning director Hamdan Ballal was attacked by settlers and then arrested, in what he says was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/26/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-director-hamdan-ballal-recounts-attack-by-settlers-in-west-bank">retaliation for his documentary</a> on the displacement of Palestinians in Masafer Yatta. “As we tragically saw with the killing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2023/mar/21/the-killing-of-shireen-abu-akleh-what-one-morning-in-the-west-bank-reveals-about-the-occupation">Shireen Abu Akleh</a> in 2022, no Palestinian journalist is too high-profile to be targeted or harmed,” Ruth says.</p> <p>The latest data from the <a href="https://cpj.org/2025/02/arrests-of-palestinian-journalists-since-start-of-israel-gaza-war/#:~:text=As%20of%20March%2025%2C%202025,began%20on%20October%207%2C%202023.">CPJ</a> shows that 75 journalists have been arrested in the Palestinian territories of the occupied West Bank and Gaza, as well as in Jerusalem. In 2024 Israel was added to the list of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/18/journalists-jailed-imprisoned-israel">“worst jailers of journalists”</a> for the first time and <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/09/un-experts-urge-israel-stop-attacks-and-harassment-against-journalists">according to the UN</a>, Israeli forces have fired live ammunition at journalists or their vehicles while they were reporting on military operations and civilian casualties. The image that emerges is one of a country deeply hostile to and suspicious of critical coverage, willing to go to great lengths to clamp down on it.</p> <p>The Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank has also mirrored Israeli crackdowns on the press, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/6/palestinian-authority-shuts-down-several-al-jazeera-websites">suspending Al Jazeera</a> from broadcasting due to its coverage of fighting between the PA and Palestinian armed groups. “The PA has a track record of detaining journalists and curbing coverage it doesn’t like,” Ruth says. “It is, unfortunately, not a free media environment, and that is really cutting off visibility to the outside world.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>It’s a problem everywhere</strong></p> <p>In the past few months alone, the press has faced an onslaught. In the US, the Trump administration has moved to withdraw funding for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/20/exiled-russian-journalists-us-cuts-radio-free-europe-radio-liberty">Radio Free Europe and Voice of America</a>, threatened media outlets with lawsuits, and revoked press credentials of organisations critical of the White House. In Turkey this week, journalists have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/27/bbc-reporter-mark-lowen-arrested-and-deported-from-turkey-after-covering-protests">arrested and deported</a>. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/28/intimidation-journalists-indonesia-pig-heads-rats">Indonesia</a>, reporters are facing increasing intimidation, with decapitated pigs and rats being sent to their offices.</p> <p>Media crackdowns can also take the form of seemingly mundane bureaucratic obstacles. In India, the government has been <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/inside-modis-crackdown-foreign-press-india">refusing to renew work permits</a> for some foreign journalists. </p> <p> “When a journalist is mistreated, it should be an international incident,” says Ruth. “One of the consequences when it isn’t is this increasing climate of impunity towards journalists, which we’ve seen over at least the past decade, since 2012, when <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17124786">Marie Colvin and Rémi Ochlik</a> were killed in Syria.” </p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Can a £20 pot from Aldi really match up to a £300 <strong>Le Creuset</strong>? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/27/pot-luck-can-a-1999-aldi-pan-beat-a-305-le-creuset">Dale Berning Sawa puts heavy bottomed pans</a> to the test so you don’t have to … <em><strong>Toby Moses, head of newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/27/sewage-dumps-windermere-must-end-says-activist-matt-staniek">Sandra Laville and Michael Goodier</a> have spoken with activists who are urging the government to do more about the <strong>sewage</strong> that is still being pumped into Britain’s waterways, including in Windermere, a lake once known for its beauty but marred by pollution. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/27/confederacy-trump-republican">Lloyd Green is fascinating</a> on how the spirit of the <strong>confederacy is alive and well</strong> in Trump’s Maga movement: “He has even heaped praise upon Robert E Lee, the leader of the losing army during the US civil war.” <em><strong>Toby</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>“The lessons are clear: understand the science and check the small print.

Keir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy standing together are the front-page picture – and while we’re on Vladimir Putin’s war the <strong>i</strong> leads with “UK sends military chiefs to Kyiv, as Trump goes after Ukraine’s gas, oil and metals”. A “Coalition course” is what Starmer and Emmanuel Macron are setting with their Ukraine plans, says the <strong>Metro</strong>. “Billionaire Mittal to leave Britain after tax crackdown on ‘non-dom’ residents” – that’s the <strong>Financial Times</strong>. “King in hospital for cancer side effects” reports the <strong>Telegraph </strong>while the <strong>Express</strong> headlines that story with “King suffers ‘bump in the road’ during cancer care” and the <strong>Mirror</strong> sees it similarly: “King cancer ‘bump in the road’”. “Charles is forced to cancel full day of visits” says the <strong>Daily Mail</strong> and the <strong>Times</strong> does likewise: “King has to cancel visits after return to hospital”.</p> <h2>Something for the weekend</h2> <p><em>Our critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read, play and listen to right now</em></p>    <p><strong>TV</strong><br><strong>The Studio | ★★★★☆</strong><br>The chair of Continental Studios, Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston) is keen to deliver a decisive blow with the hammer of his newly acquired IP. He has just fired his long-serving studio head, Patty Leigh (Catherine O’Hara), for her preference for art over commerce and is on the verge of promoting studio executive Matt Remick (Seth Rogen) to the big job. What’s a guy to do – even if he is a devoted cinephile who dreams of adding his contribution to the illustrious roll call of meaningful movies? He kisses the ring. And with that we are off to the races for 10 fast, furious and farcical episodes of Rogen’s new Hollywood satire The Studio, created with his partner since their Superbad-minting days, Evan Goldberg. <em><strong>Lucy Mangan</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Film<br>The End | ★★★★★</strong><br>Michael Shannon and Tilda Swinton play the last super-rich couple in the world. He is a breezily self-assured energy magnate and she a former ballerina. After an environmental catastrophe 25 years ago, they retreated from civil disorder, deep underground into an eerily well-appointed suite of rooms with food, air and medicines in which they keep their colossal fine art collection. </p> <p>They carry out emergency drills with survival suits, and practise on the firing range in case a member of the angry underclass shows up. This worst case scenario becomes a reality when a young woman (Moses Ingram) somehow finds her way into the compound. <em><strong>Peter Bradshaw</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Music<br>Lucy Dacus: Forever Is a Feeling | ★★★☆☆<br></strong>Last February, the American “indie rock supergroup” Boygenius – AKA Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus – announced an indefinite hiatus. The first “Boy” to return with a solo album, Dacus’s comeback is audibly not much interested in attention-grabbing gestures. It is understated, almost to a fault. There are songs with beautiful melodies here. More often, they settle for being perfectly nice rather than particularly arresting: nothing really grabs you, a state of affairs compounded by the album’s unobtrusive sound. <em><strong>Alexis Petridis</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Podcast</strong><br><strong>Journey Through Time<br></strong>The first big historical event retold by David Olusoga and Sarah Churchwell in their new series is a terror attack on New York – but no, it’s not 9/11. They want to tell us about the world-shaping moments we’re not taught about, which in this case was the Black Tom 1916 bombing. England’s great storm of 1703 – one of the worst natural disasters ever – and female pirates of the Caribbean Anne Bonny and Mary Read are also on the meaty agenda. <em><strong>Hollie Richardson</strong></em></p> <h2>Today in Focus</h2>    <p><strong>From the Oscars to Israeli detention: the attack on No Other Land director Hamdan Ballal</strong></p> <p>What does the attack on an Oscar-winning Palestinian director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/mar/28/from-the-oscars-to-israeli-detention-the-attack-on-no-other-land-director-hamdan-ballal-podcast">say about the situation in the West Bank today</a>?
