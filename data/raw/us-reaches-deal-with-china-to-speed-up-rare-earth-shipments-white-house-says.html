<p>The US has reached an agreement with China to speed up rare-earth shipments into America, officials confirmed on Friday. The news sent US stock markets to fresh highs amid news of wider <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/11/us-china-trade-talks-framework-deal-amid-dispute-over-rare-earths">efforts to end the trade wars</a> between the US and the world’s biggest economies.</p> <p>Donald Trump said on Thursday that the US had signed a deal with China the previous day, without providing additional details, and that there might be a separate deal coming up that would “open up” India.</p> <p>But the trade news was complicated on Friday afternoon when Trump announced he had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/27/trump-canada-tariffs-trade-tax">called off</a> talks with Canada over a digital sales tax. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq turned negative before recovering their losses.</p> <p>China confirmed the details of the deal on Friday, and reiterated that it will continue to approve the export permits of controlled items. The news sent US stock markets to new highs on Friday morning with both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hitting record levels.</p> <p>During <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/us-china-trade-talks-geneva-intended-de-escalate-tensions-lutnick">US-China trade talks in May</a> in Geneva, Beijing committed to removing non-tariff countermeasures imposed against the US since 2 April, although it was unclear how some of those measures would be walked back.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/china-rare-earths-baotou-life-metallic-elements">The world wants China’s rare earth elements – what is life like in the city that produces them?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As part of its retaliation against new US tariffs, China suspended exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/china-trade-war-us-arms-firms-rare-earths-supply">upending the supply chains</a> central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.</p> <p>“The administration and China agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement,” a White House official said on Thursday.</p> <p>The understanding is “about how we can implement expediting rare-earth shipments to the US again”, the official said.</p> <p>A separate administration official said the US-China agreement took place earlier this week.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/DUxRs/1/" data-alt="Rare earth minerals chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/DUxRs/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>China has a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/china-rare-earths-baotou-life-metallic-elements">virtual monopoly</a> on the global supply of rare earths, having grown to dominate production and processing in the 1990s and the 2000s. Some of the rare earths mined in China are used in US military equipment, a vulnerability that has been laid bare in the US-China trade war.</p> <p>The US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told Bloomberg: “They’re going to deliver rare earths to us” and once China did that, “we’ll take down our countermeasures”.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Friday that he hoped the US could reach trade agreements with more than a dozen nations by September – comments that suggest the White House has all but scrapped the 9 July deadline it had set to conclude negotiations before reimposing its more draconian “reciprocal tariffs”.</p> <p>“I think we could have trade wrapped up by Labor Day [1 September],” Bessent said on Fox Business Network. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Thursday that the 9 July deadline was “not critical”.</p> <p>While the agreement shows potential progress after months of trade uncertainty and disruption since Trump took office in January, it also underscores the long road ahead to a final, definitive trade deal between the two economic rivals.</p> <p>China has been taking its dual-use restrictions on rare earths “very seriously” and has been vetting buyers to ensure that materials are not diverted to US military uses, according to an industry source. This has slowed down the licensing process.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported this week that China has told rare-earth companies to provide the government with a list of workers with technical expertise and has asked some to turn in their passports to prevent them from taking unauthorised overseas trips. China wants to ensure that its commercially valuable rare earths knowledge is not shared with foreign adversaries.</p> <p>Car manufacturers have already complained about factories being brought to a near halt because of supply chain shortages of rare earths and the magnets they are used in. A Ford executive said this week that the company was living “hand to mouth”.</p> <p>The Geneva deal had faltered over China’s curbs on critical minerals exports, prompting the Trump administration to respond with export controls of its own, preventing shipments of semiconductor design software, aircraft and other goods to China.</p> <p>In early June, Reuters reported that China had granted temporary export licences to rare-earth suppliers of the top three US automakers as supply chain disruptions began to surface from export curbs on those materials.</p> <p>Later in the month, Trump said there was a deal with China in which Beijing would supply magnets and rare-earth minerals while the US would allow Chinese students to study in its colleges and universities.</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed </em><em>reporting</em></p>
