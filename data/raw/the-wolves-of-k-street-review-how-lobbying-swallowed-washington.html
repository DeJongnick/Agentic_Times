<p>Donald Trump decries the proverbial Washington swamp. Congress does next to nothing. The band plays on: lobbying remains big business. In 2023, <a href="https://thehill.com/lobbying/4621934-several-k-street-giants-kick-off-2024-with-record-revenues/">the industry</a> hit a <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/summary?inflate=N">$4.3bn</a> payday. This year shows <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/23/progressives-stare-down-primary-challengers/">no end in sight to the trend</a>. As the US gallops toward another election, The Wolves of K Street befits the season.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/21/new-cold-wars-review-david-sanger">New Cold Wars review: China, Russia and Biden’s daunting task</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Brody-Mullins/156463980">Brody Mullins</a>, a Wall Street Journal investigative reporter and Pulitzer prize winner, and his brother, <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/authors/Luke-Mullins/156463997">Luke Mullins</a>, a contributor at Politico, deliver a graduate seminar on how lobbying emerged and became a behemoth, an adjunct of government itself, taking its collective name from the street north of the White House where many of its biggest earners sit.</p> <p>Smoothly written, meticulously researched, The Wolves of K Street informs and mesmerizes.</p> <p>“This is a book about men – for they were almost exclusively men – who built K Street,” Brody and Luke Mullins write.</p> <p>They have produced a tightly stitched, 600-plus-page tome that begins as a true-crime story. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-a-k-street-renegade-1487001918">The suicide of Evan Morris</a>, a lobbyist for big pharma, takes center stage. In the opening scene of the book, at a posh Virginia golf club on a balmy evening in July 2015, Morris, 38, turns a gun on himself.</p> <p>The seemingly almost idyllic backdrop to his death is actually a tableau of excess, complete with $150,000 initiation fees, an abandoned Porsche, an emptied bottle of $1,500 bordeaux and a scenic sunset.</p> <p>Millions of corporate dollars were missing and untaxed. An anonymous letter and an FBI investigation helped ignite Morris’s untimely and violent end.</p> <p>“The allegations would touch off <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rise-and-fall-of-a-k-street-renegade-1487001918">a years-long case</a>,” the brothers Mullins write.</p> <p>Morris’s wife and estate settled with Genentech, his employer, the Internal Revenue Service and the commonwealth of Virginia. The government never charged anyone with a crime. Death had taken its toll.</p> <p>The Wolves of K Street is about way more than just one man. It is an engrossing lesson in how lunch-bucket sensibilities and the accommodation between big business and the New Deal gave way to neoliberalism, corporate activism and the decline of industrial unions.</p> <p>The Democratic party, to name just one major part of American life, would never be the same again. The Mullins brothers are keenly aware of the social forces that buffet and drive US politics. They recall how Jimmy Carter’s defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980 left the party of FDR, Truman and JFK to wonder how it was no longer the political home of working-class America. Democrats wonder to this day.</p> <p>The Wolves of K Street traces how the US reached this point, and lobbying attained its present stature, by following “three lobbying dynasties – one Republican, two Democratic – over the critical period from the 1970s to today, when the modern lobbying industry was created, corporate interests came to power in Washington, and the nature of our economy was fundamentally changed”.</p> <p>The late Tommy Boggs, son of Hale Boggs, once a Democratic House majority leader, stands out as the patriarch and pioneer of Democratic lobbying. His name came to grace Patton, Boggs and Blow, a storied DC law firm now subsumed in Squire Patton Boggs, a sprawling global entity nominally based in Ohio. Evan Morris stood out as Boggs’s “prized pupil” – or apostle.</p> <p>Next came the Republicans: Charlie Black, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone and the late Lee Atwater, who would manage the 1988 presidential campaign of George HW Bush.</p> <p>“[They] used their links to the Reagan revolution to erect Washington’s signature GOP house of lobbying,” the Mullins write. “Each member of the partnership had his own distinct role.”</p> <p>Together, they bridged the gap between corner offices and the universe of conservative activists. Furthermore, Donald Trump was a client of Black, Manafort and Stone. Stone helped boost Maryanne Trump Barry, the property magnate’s late sister, on to the federal bench.</p> <p>That history is why Manafort and Stone emerged as part of Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016; why the pair were caught in the special counsel’s net when it came time to investigate Russia’s attempts to help Trump; why they received presidential pardons before Trump left office; and why they stand to be back for one more rodeo as Trump runs for the White House again.</p> <p>Tony Podesta, brother of the Democratic White House veteran John Podesta, is the keystone of the third lobbying dynasty examined by Brody and Luke Mullins, an “avant-garde political fixer [who] used his experience as a brass-knuckled liberal activist to advance the interests of Wall Street and Silicon Valley”.</p> <p>The paths taken by Manafort and Podesta would eventually entwine. Out of the limelight, Manafort came to represent the interests of Ukraine’s anti-Nato Party of Regions and its head, Viktor Yanukovych. In 2012, seeking to stave off sanctions, Manafort enlisted Podesta to his cause.</p> <p>“I used to call them the dynamic duo,” Rick Gates, Manafort’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/24/wicked-game-review-rick-gates-trump-republicans-russia">convicted</a> acolyte, tells the Mullins brothers.</p> <p>The Wolves of K Street is also newsy, disclosing for the first time Manafort’s attempt to have Yanukovych congratulate Joe Biden in summer 2012.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/mar/09/the-lie-detectives-review-sasha-issenberg">The Lie Detectives: Trump, US politics and the disinformation damage done</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I am thinking of recommending a call from VY to Biden to congratulate Biden on his [re-]nomination” as vice-president to Barack Obama, Manafort emailed Gates, who forwarded the note to Podesta. The brother of Bill Clinton’s chief of staff cum Obama counselor approved.</p> <p>“‘Only downside is [if] biden [sic] presses him personally on politics of criminal prosecutions of his political’ opponents, Podesta responded. ‘I would say worth the risk.’”</p> <p>•••</p> <p>The Wolves of K Street ends on a weary note: “No matter what new obstacles have emerged, K Street has always managed to invent new ways to exercise its power over Washington,” the Mullins brothers conclude. “New fortunes to be made, new rules to be broken. New stories to be told.”</p> <p>One might well reach for Ecclesiastes, son of David: “The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Wolves of K Street is</em> <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-wolves-of-k-street-the-secret-history-of-how-big-money-took-over-big-government-luke-mullins/20712498?ean=9781982120597">published in the US</a></em> <em>by Simon &amp; Schuster</em></p></li> </ul>
