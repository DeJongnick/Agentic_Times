<h2>Canada</h2> <p><strong>Julia Schell</strong> A few good runs that put her team on the front foot in behind the England defence. Spent a lot of time defending. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Alysha Corrigan</strong> Carried the ball plenty but turned possession over a couple of times. An individual representation of Canada’s whole performance. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Florence Symonds</strong> Handled by Meg Jones and too often was shovelling on poor ball as the defensive pressure mounted. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Alex Tessier</strong> A fantastic 50:22 early in the second half was typical of her classy kicking, but struggled under pressure of the relentless targeting by England’s midfield defence. <strong>6</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/27/england-outclass-canada-to-capture-glorious-womens-rugby-world-cup-triumph">England outclass Canada to capture glorious Women’s Rugby World Cup triumph</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Asia Hogan-Rochester</strong> Raised hopes with a typical classy finish after a couple of minutes, and did so again with try in second half. Always a handful. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Taylor Perry</strong> An anonymous outing for the most part, struggled in the face of the white wall in front of her. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Justine Pelletier</strong> Tried to make the best of the poor ruck ball she was presented with but could not inject the required zip. Gave away a silly ruck penalty for side entry. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>McKinley Hunt</strong> Was at the mercy of the England scrum from five minutes in. Hooked at half time. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Emily Tuttosi</strong> Her first malfunctioning lineout throw led to the opening Kildunne try, it didn’t get any better at the set piece for the hooker. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>DaLeaka Menin</strong> Crumpled under the considerable pressure from Botterman. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Sophie de Goede</strong> Top tackler and carrier for her team, but her metres per carry figure was a paltry 0.9m. This typified both her effort and what she was up against. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Courtney O’Donnell</strong> All over the shop in the lineout and absent in the loose. Came out a long way behind in a forwards dominated match. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Caroline Crossley</strong> Worked hard, but found diminishing returns with both her carries and her ruck clearances. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Karen Paquin</strong> Won a couple of dominant turnovers, one of which off a restart was wasted by her team. Along with De Goede the most prominent forward for Canada. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Fabiola Forteza</strong> One of the few who put England’s forwards on the back foot with her carrying power, but didn’t do it often enough. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Replacements:</strong> <strong>Gillian Boag</strong> (for Tuttosi, 65) Shored up the lineout possession in the latter stages <strong>6</strong>. <strong>Brittany Kassil</strong> (for Hunt, 40) Tone was set when penalised for not driving straight in first scrum <strong>5</strong>. <strong>Olivia DeMerchant</strong> (for Menin, 68) Reduced number of penalties on her side of the scrum <strong>6</strong>. <strong>Tyson Beukeboom</strong> (for O’Donnell, 52) Always offering to carry, and the lineout improved <strong>6</strong>. <strong>Letitia Royer</strong> (for Crossley, 65) Little impact on ability to get over the gainline <strong>5</strong>. <strong>Gabrielle Senft</strong> (for Paquin, 65) Didn’t make a single tackle in 15 minutes <strong>4</strong>. <strong>Olivia Apps</strong> (for Pelletier, 52) An excellent break and increased speed of service summed up her pacy intervention in the game <strong>6</strong>. <strong>Shoshanah Seumanutafa</strong> (for Schell, 72) Very little impact in the dying minutes <strong>5</strong>.</p>    <h2>England</h2> <p><strong>Ellie Kildunne</strong> So often the flame that lights up an England display, and so it proved again. A dazzling run for the opening try and excellent in defence as well. <strong>9</strong></p> <p><strong>Abby Dow</strong> Chased kicks and played her part in the defensive effort, but not much attacking threat and was outshone by her opposite number. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Meg Jones</strong> A performance of quiet class, with her intelligent link play and organisation vital on both sides of the ball. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Tatyana Heard</strong> Saved her most influential performance for the final. Prominent with her carrying game and led the midfield blitz that stymied Canada’s verve. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Jess Breach</strong> Worked hard all game, but a plan designed to keep the ball mostly in the narrow parts of the field made it hard for a winger to shine. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Zoe Harrison</strong> Floated around, stony-faced and calm, directing the play and giving the territory that the forwards exploited. Excellent from the tee. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Natasha Hunt</strong> A busy display, including an assist among the forwards for the first Matthews try. Energy belied her veteran status. <strong>8</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/27/kildunne-and-dusted-red-roses-dialled-up-to-11-for-emotional-world-cup-victory">‘Kildunne and Dusted’: Red Roses dialled up to 11 for emotional World Cup victory | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Hannah Botterman</strong> A nuisance at the breakdown, winning two penalties, as well as being part of the bruising scrum. Daft yellow card for a tip tackle. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Amy Co</strong><strong>kayne</strong> Poor throw gifted possession for Canada’s first try, but more than made up for it with a score of her own and brilliant darts from then on. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Maud Muir</strong> Dominant in the set piece but was held up over the line and also gave away the penalty that led to Cockayne’s second try being scrubbed off. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Morwenna Talling</strong> 22 tackles and a huge carry late on that set up the game-killing second Matthews try. An absolute boatload of work from the lock. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Abbie Ward</strong> Made a mess of Canada’s lineout all match. Tuttosi will be seeing her in nightmares for months. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Zoe Aldcroft</strong> A real blindside’s performance as well as a captain’s one. Tireless in defence and stole her fair share of possession. Lost a few as well, though. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Player of the Match: Sadia Kabeya</strong> A true hybrid performance of ferocious defence, often out in the backline, combined with big carries and intelligent handling. <strong>9</strong></p> <p><strong>Alex Matthews</strong> Made plenty of hay from the base of a dominant scrum, including two tries and an assist for Ward’s score. Relentless. <strong>9</strong></p> <p><strong>Replacements:</strong> <strong>Lark Atkin-Davies</strong> (for Cockayne, 60) Increased the intensity at scrum and lineout <strong>7</strong>. <strong>Kelsey Clifford</strong> (for Muir, 58) Drove Canada backwards in scrum and loose <strong>7</strong>. <strong>Sarah Bern</strong> (for Botterman, 60) solid set piece, but not her usual self in the loose <strong>6</strong>. <strong>Rosie Galligan</strong> (for Talling, 69) Kept up the energy in the second row, secured the final lineout <strong>6</strong>. <strong>Maddie </strong><strong>Feaunati</strong> (for Ward, 69) Strangled Canada with late defensive efforts <strong>6</strong>. <strong>Lucy Packer</strong> (for Hunt, 60) Kept the tempo up from scrum-half to close out the match <strong>6</strong>. <strong>Hollie Aitcheson</strong> (for Harrison, 66) Calm and intelligent with her kicking <strong>7</strong>. <strong>Helena Rowland</strong> (for Breach, 66) Led the late defensive effort out wide <strong>6</strong>.</p>
