<p>Scores of Ryder Cup fans were denied glimpses of the opening tee shots at Bethpage Black due to stringent security measures put in place before the arrival of Donald Trump.</p> <p>The US president took his place behind, and briefly on, the 1st tee as the fourball session teed off in the afternoon. By that time, organisers had breathed sighs of relief that early morning issues had resolved themselves. Tee times could not be and were not adjusted for congestion, due to tight Ryder Cup schedules. The PGA of America had warned fans, who paid $750 for standard ground tickets for the opening day, to arrive earlier than usual but many still encountered frustration.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/26/ryder-cup-2025-day-one-golf-europe-usa-bethpage-black-live">Ryder Cup 2025: USA 1-3 Europe after day-one foursomes – live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anticipated heavy congestion was in evidence at and around the main spectator entry point from early morning as tens of thousands gathered to see the start of this eagerly anticipated contest.</p> <p>Tournament staff audibly complained at being in the same lengthy queues as the public. Airport-style security, which was deployed for a second time near to the 1st hole, led to the competition organisers opening gates at 5am local time – more than two hours before play began – but heavy congestion was still clear as the event got under way.</p> <p>Traffic issues also led to spectators leaving tournament shuttle buses and walking through residential areas to Bethpage. One Ryder Cup attendee posted footage on social media of a power line exploding near the course; nobody is understood to have been injured but it served as an example of a chaotic morning.</p> <p>Trump, in the company of his granddaughter Kai, landed nearby on Air Force One shortly after 11am before being driven to the Bethpage clubhouse. The secret service were visible, including on the clubhouse roof, as part of a huge security operation.</p> <p>This marks the first time a sitting president has attended the Ryder Cup. Trump was greeted by players, including Europe’s Rory McIlroy, as they walked to the 1st tee having taken advice to avoid the morning session, with organisers fearing greater disruption than that which transpired.</p>
