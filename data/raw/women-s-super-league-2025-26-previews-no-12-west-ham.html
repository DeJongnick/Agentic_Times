<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position:</strong> 11th (NB: this is not necessarily Sophie Downey’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> <p><strong>Last season’s position:</strong> 9th</p> <h2>Prospects</h2> <p>Consistency and stability have been core elements of West Ham’s off-season as Rehanne Skinner hopes to build on the progress her side made last campaign. After taking time to find their feet with positive performances not always matching their results, the Hammers went on an unbeaten run that kept them in the picture for fifth place. In the end, they finished just five points off Brighton who claimed that spot.</p> <p>Their turn in fortunes very much came with the return of Shekiera Martinez from her loan spell at Freiburg. The 24-year-old spearheaded the attacking line, developing a relationship with the influential Viviane Asseyi, who enjoyed one of her best seasons in east London. In 12 appearances, Martinez scored 10 goals and finished just two below joint Golden Boot winners Bunny Shaw and Alessia Russo with a shot conversion rate of 32%.</p> <p>The Germany forward will be integral once again this season and the club’s ability to hold on to her and most of Skinner’s preferred 15 players was crucial over the summer. While there have been significant outgoings with players such as Dagny Brynjarsdóttir, Shannon Cooke and Kirsty Smith departing, the majority were on the fringes with limited game time.</p> <p>One concern will be the relatively few number of signings that have been made this window. Yu Endo brings experience to the back line while the Wales international Ffion Morgan has proved her talent after four years at Bristol City. Sarah Brasero , brought in from Estoril, and Leila Wandeler, who arrives from Lyon, are exciting youngsters at a key stage of their development as footballers.</p> <p>A pre-season tour to Prague provided valuable preparation for the campaign ahead. That was followed by a win over Liverpool and loss to Arsenal in readiness for an opening-day derby at Tottenham, a game that has traditionally proved to be entertaining and competitive.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/mUf5t/1/" data-alt="West Ham finished 9th in 2021, 6th in 2022, 8th in 2023, 11th in 2024 and 9th in 2025 "> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/mUf5t/1/">Interactive</a> <figcaption>West Ham will hope to improve on last season’s 9th place finish.  </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The manager</h2> <p>Skinner is entering her third season at the club and is starting to see the rewards of her rebuild. Before last season, she brought up the issue of short-term contracts leading to high player turnover and the club have responded. Honest with her players and willing to speak about wider issues in the game, she has worked to build an industrious team that is good in possession and always looking to attack. Smart recruitment has brought in Katrina Gorry, Manuela Pavi and Martinez, all of whom have helped the team progress.</p> <h2>Off-field picture</h2> <p>West Ham are in talks to sell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/28/west-ham-in-talks-over-selling-stake-in-womens-team-to-us-private-equity-fund">a stake in their women’s team to Monarch Collective</a>, the world’s largest female-dedicated sport fund. The private equity group, which is hoping to buy 49% of the club – valued at around £55m – and has a strong history of investing in NWSL clubs. The Hammers’ existing ownership would retain a controlling interest. Should the deal go through, additional money for the playing squad would be prioritised, something that has been lacking in recent years, as well finding a solution to the London Stadium issue. The club are the only WSL team not to hold any fixtures at their main stadium due to rental costs.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/N1Rtg/1/" data-alt="Last season West Ham won six, drew five and lost 11"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/N1Rtg/1/">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Last season West Ham won six, drew five and lost 11.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Star signing</h2> <p>Endo might not be a name many WSL fans would have heard of before her signing for West Ham but the 27-year-old brings with her a wealth of experience. The Japan full-back made the move to England after nine years with Urawa Reds where she made 171 appearances. She helped the Saitama side gain promotion to the W-League in 2020 before going on to win back-to-back league titles and lifting the 2023 AFC Women’s Club Championship trophy. Technical, tenacious and consistent, she also has the ability to play in the middle of the park.</p>    <h2>Stepping up</h2> <p>The 20-year-old Sarah Brasero earned her WSL move this summer, signing a three-year deal with the club. The England youngster arrived from Estoril after a season playing in Portugal’s top division. A creative and diligent midfielder, she started her career at Ipswich before moving to Lewes. She has played for England at under-19 and under-23 level, making the step up to Emma Coates’s under-23 side towards the end of 2024.</p> <h2>It was a good summer for …</h2> <p>Leila Wandeler was one of the exciting young talents that played a role in Pia Sundhage’s Switzerland squad at this year’s European Championship. The 19-year-old made three appearances from the bench for her nation who went on a historic quarter-final run. Experiencing a home Euros will have been hugely memorable for the forward, who made her move to West Ham from Lyon in August. “It was crazy, amazing,” she told club media. “I couldn’t believe it at first because I hadn’t really been in the national team that much … The games were so amazing, I had chills every time I saw the Switzerland fans.”</p>    <h2>Main initiative to attract more fans</h2> <p>The women’s team continue to play at Dagenham &amp; Redbridge’s Chigwell Construction Stadium and tickets are on sale for their first five matches, home and away. The club have been gathering feedback about the providing coach travel for away fixtures.</p>
