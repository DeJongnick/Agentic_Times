<p>Hamas said on Saturday that it had submitted its response containing some amendments to a proposal presented by Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to mediators, the most concrete sign of progress towards a ceasefire since March.</p> <p>The Palestinian group said in a statement that under the deal it would release 10 living hostages and 18 bodies in return for Israel’s release of Palestinian prisoners – a change to the US’s latest proposal that will make it more difficult for Israel to resume fighting if talks on a permanent ceasefire are not completed by the end of the truce.</p> <p>The updated proposal includes a demand for an end to the war, which had previously been a red line for Israel, and envisions the release of the Israelis held captive in Gaza being spread out more throughout the 60-day truce, rather than in two batches on the first and seventh day as the US offer suggested.</p> <p>Witkoff responded on Saturday evening by saying the Hamas response was “totally unacceptable and only takes us backward”.</p> <p>“Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,” he said. “That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have at the proximity talks substantive negotiations in good faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire.”</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister’s office said: “While Israel has agreed to the updated Witkoff outline for the release of our hostages, Hamas continues to adhere to its refusal … Israel will continue its action for the return of our hostages and the defeat of Hamas.”</p> <p>A senior Hamas official responded that the group “did not reject” the hostage release proposal, and that Witkoff’s response to their answer was “unfair” and showed “complete bias” in favour of Israel.</p> <p>Several rallies were held on Saturday evening across Israel demanding a ceasefire and the release of the hostages.</p> <p>Speaking at the Hostage Square in Tel Aviv, Sharon Aloni Cunio, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/27/who-are-the-israeli-hostages-freed-by-hamas-during-gaza-truce">freed hostage</a> whose husband, David Cunio, remains in captivity, said: “Now is the time to make a deal. Return the fathers to our children. Don’t make them orphans.”</p> <p>A statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said: “We call upon the prime minister from here. The time has come for a deal. For the sake of our children’s future. One comprehensive deal to bring them all home. Right now.”</p> <p>Earlier on Saturday, the Israeli military confirmed that it killed Mohammed Sinwar, Hamas’s Gaza chief, on 13 May. Sinwar was the target of an Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza earlier this month. Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he had been killed.</p> <p>He was the younger brother of Yahya Sinwar, the Palestinian militant group’s deceased leader and mastermind of the October 2023 attack on Israel. Hamas has not confirmed his death.</p> <p>The Hamas response to the US proposal appears close to a previously reported version of the deal, which specified that the group would release 10 hostages, as well as a number of hostages’ remains, during the ceasefire in exchange for 1,100 Palestinian prisoners.</p> <p>The Hamas statement said: “This proposal aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and ensure the flow of aid to our people and our families in the Gaza Strip.”</p> <p>It said its response came “after conducting a round of national consultations”.</p> <p>“There are some notes and amendments to some points, especially on the US guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces,” a senior official with the group told the Associated Press.</p> <p>The US ceasefire proposal reportedly involves a 60-day pause in fighting and a redoubling of efforts towards long-term peace, as well as guarantees from Israel that it will not resume its offensive after Hamas releases hostages, which the country did in March.</p> <p>Israeli negotiators accepted the deal, but Hamas’s initial reaction to the proposal was lukewarm. On Friday, the militant group said it was holding consultations with other factions operating under its rule in Gaza including Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</p> <p>Hamas’s response came after two days in which the militant group had indicated that the US proposal was more biased in favour of Israel than previous proposals.</p> <p>A leading Hamas official, Basem Naim, said on Thursday that the US proposal “does not respond to any of our people’s demands”, including lifting the humanitarian blockade on the Gaza Strip that has led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/30/gaza-hungriest-place-earth-all-people-risk-famine-un">famine-like</a> conditions among the population of 2 million.</p> <p>The group’s reaction provoked the ire of their Israeli counterparts. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, threatened the group on Friday with “annihilation” if it did not accept. “The Hamas murderers will now be forced to choose: accept the terms of the ‘Witkoff deal’ for the release of the hostages – or be annihilated,” said Katz.</p> <p>Israel has not yet officially responded to Hamas’s response, but an official <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog-may-31-2025/">told Israeli reporters</a> on condition of anonymity that Jerusalem was treating Hamas’s changes as an “effective rejection”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/may/08/israels-plan-to-conquer-gaza-podcast">Israel’s plan to ‘conquer’ Gaza – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Deep differences between Hamas and Israel have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire that broke down in March after only two months.</p> <p>Israel has insisted that Hamas disarm completely and be dismantled as a military and governing force, and that all 58 hostages still held in Gaza be returned before it will agree to end the war.</p> <p>The Israeli government fears that a lasting ceasefire and withdrawal would leave Hamas with significant influence in Gaza, even if it surrenders formal power. With time, the Israelis worry Hamas might be able to rebuild its military and launch more 7 October-style attacks.</p> <p>On the other hand, Hamas fears that Israel could break the ceasefire – as it did last March – and resume the war, which the Israeli government would be permitted to do after 60 days under the terms of the deal.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2025/mar/19/israel-shatters-gaza-ceasefire-full-story-podcast">previous ceasefire collapsed</a> in mid-March after Israel refused to move to a planned second phase that could have led to a permanent end to the war, and instead restarted its offensive in the Gaza Strip. Negotiators have met in the months since in an attempt to reach a ceasefire, with little progress to show for it.</p> <p>More than 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel launched its war on the besieged Palestinian territory on 7 October 2023. The Israeli offensive was in retaliation for a Hamas attack on the same day, which saw the group kill about 1,200 people and take 250 hostages. About 20 hostages are believed to still be alive and their return is a key demand of ceasefire negotiations.</p> <p>As negotiations over a ceasefire continued, Israel’s offensive in Gaza has ramped up. At least 60 people have been killed by Israeli strikes in Gaza over the last 24 hours, health officials said, while 72 people were killed on Thursday.</p> <p>Israel stopped allowing almost all humanitarian aid into Gaza when it resumed hostilities in the Palestinian territory. The nearly three-month Israeli blockade on Gaza has pushed the population of more than 2 million to the brink of famine. While pressure has slightly eased in recent days as Israel allowed some aid to enter, aid organisations say far from enough food is getting in.</p> <p>“After nearly 80 days of a total blockade, communities are starving – and they are no longer willing to watch food pass them by,” the World Food Programme said on Saturday. The UN aid agency had been allowed to bring 77 trucks loaded with flour into Gaza overnight, but the trucks were stopped en route by crowds of hungry people.</p>
