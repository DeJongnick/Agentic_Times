<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/trump-new-car-tariffs">said the US would impose a 25% tariff</a> on foreign-made cars, drawing condemnation from America’s traditional allies and trading partners.</p> <p>The announcement, on Wednesday, came just days before the US president is expected to announce yet more wide-ranging taxes on other imported goods, as he continued to ramp up a trade war that has caused jitters in global markets.</p> <p>“What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff for all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “We start off with a 2.5% base, which is what we’re at, and go to 25%.” The announcement was immediately criticized by Canada and the European Commission, while Japan said it would be considering “all options”.</p> <p>Trump then threatened further tariffs if the EU cooperated with Canada “in order to do economic harm to the USA”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>When will they </strong><strong>come into force?</strong> Trump claimed they will be effective from 2 April and that the US will start collecting them the next day.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Republican senators call for investigation of </strong><strong>Pentagon’s leaked attack plans</strong></h2>    <p>Top Republican <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/signal-investigation-republican-senators">senators are calling for an investigation</a> into the scandal of top US officials sharing sensitive plans for bombing Yemen on a group chat, arguing it would become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly.</p> <p>It is the latest in the continuing fallout after the Atlantic’s revelation on Monday that its editor in chief had been accidentally added to a group chat on which security heads were discussing striking targets in Yemen.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the publication revealed further details of the sensitive information discussed in the group, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/donald-trump-us-signal-scandal-passwords">while the German media outlet Der Spiegel reported</a> that private data of top US security advisers was available online.</p> <p>“This is what happens when you don’t really have your act together,” the Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski told the Hill.
