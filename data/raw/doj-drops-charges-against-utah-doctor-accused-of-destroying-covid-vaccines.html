<p>The US Department of Justice dropped charges on Saturday against Michael Kirk Moore, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah">Utah</a> doctor accused of destroying more than $28,000 worth of government-provided Covid-19 vaccines and administering saline to children instead of the shot.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a>, the US attorney general, announced the news in a statement on the social media platform <a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1944081479459369090">X</a>, saying the charges had been dismissed under her direction.</p> 
<p>“Dr Moore gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so,” Bondi said. “He did not deserve the years in prison he was facing.”</p> 
<p>According to a 2023 press <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ut/pr/utah-doctor-and-co-defendants-charged-running-covid-19-vaccine-scheme-defraud-government">release</a> from the US attorney’s office in Utah, Moore distributed at least 1,937 fraudulent vaccination record cards in exchange for either direct payment or required donations to a specific charity. The minors he gave saline shots to were under the impression, at the request of their parents, that they were receiving a Covid-19 shot. Moore ran the operations from a plastic surgery center in Midvale, Utah, and was charged, along with three other co-defendants, with conspiracy to defraud the United States.</p> 
<p>Far-right congresswoman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marjorie-taylor-greene">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> thanked Bondi in a statement on <a href="https://x.com/RepMTG/status/1944087817685958911">X</a> and called Moore a “hero who refused to inject his patients with a government-mandated unsafe vaccine”.</p> 
<p>The Utah senator Mike Lee also weighed in, saying on <a href="https://x.com/SenMikeLee/status/1944100112155701565">X</a> that he was glad Moore could remain a free man and that countless Americans endured lies and lockdowns during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Moore was indicted by the justice department in 2023. He pleaded not guilty to the charges, which also included conspiracy to convert, sell, convey and dispose of government property, and the conversion, sale, conveyance and disposal of government property.</p> 
<p>The fake vaccination records were sold under Moore’s scheme for $50 each, and operations allegedly ran between May 2021 and September 2022. Attorneys for Moore argued that the regulations set at the time by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were unconstitutional.</p> 
<p>The charges against Moore were brought in when Joe Biden was president, but Covid-19 conspiracists and skeptics have been embraced in the new administration under Trump.</p> 
<p>Recently, the Trump administration canceled a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/mrna-vaccines-trump-rfk-jr">$766m </a>award to Moderna on the research and development of H5N1 bird flu vaccines, and officials announced new restrictions and regulations for Covid mRNA vaccines.</p> 
<p>The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has for decades baselessly sowed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles">doubt</a> about vaccine safety, contrary to scientific research, thanked Moore in a statement on X back in April.</p> 
<p>“Dr Moore deserves a medal for his courage and his commitment to healing,” Kennedy Jr <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1916896371505795088">said</a>.</p>
