C4 says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>More In Common asked voters who they thought would be most effective in governing the country - 41% responded: ‘None of the above’.</p> <p>The second most popular choice was Reform’s Nigel Farage with 23%, followed by the Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, with 19%, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch with 8%, the Lib-Dem’s Ed Davey on 6% and the Green’s co-leaders, Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay, coming last with 2%.</p> </blockquote> <p>More in Common polled people in England living in areas where local elections are taking place (mostly shire areas, not big cities). In these areas, the poll also found Reform UK in the lead, on 26%, with the Conservatives on 25%, Labour on 18%, the Lib Dems on 17% and the Greens on 8%.</p> <p>Commenting on the poll findings, <strong>Luke Tryl</strong>, executive director of More in Common UK, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The public mood going into these elections is one of deep disillusionment, voters are impatient for change but aren’t confident any party can deliver it. As results trickle in on Friday this polling suggests we will see that the fragmentation of the electorate in last year’s general election has only accelerated since then.</p> <p>For many their vote on Thursday will be an expression of deep frustration with the status quo. Nigel Farage’s Reform UK look set to be the big winners of the night, leading in our polling, while the Conservatives on these numbers would lose scores of seats in elections being contested on normally solid turf - both to Reform UK and the Liberal Democrats.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yesterday, in <a href="https://x.com/LukeTryl/status/1916966965777760267">a thread on social media</a>, Tryl said that he was returning home after conducing focus groups in Beverley, Hull, Scunthorpe and Peterborough and that he thought the “disillusionment” he had heard was the worst he had experienced in his time as a focus group organiser. Here are some of the points he made.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Views of politicians went beyond healthy cynicism ranging from them not getting it to being useless to being actively corrupt. This wasn’t a partisan thing, it applied to everyone Tory, Labour, Lib Dem, Reform, being part of the political class was more telling than party.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The demand for change was palpable, but there was a lack of faith it was going to happen, again not limited to one party but instead there was a sense politicians weren’t up to it or weren’t willing to take on vested interests. From pot holes to the NHS it was all going wrong.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>While some people were still willing to give the government the benefit of the doubt and time - most were disappointed or angry at the pace of change, but more than that there was a common view of no difference between Labour and the last Conservative Government.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>All in all a bleak picture. If politics can’t be shown to make genuine improvements in people’s lives people will lose faith entirely, switch off, look elsewhere or demand something else - which is why I don’t think what I’ve heard this weekend is sustainable.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-30T09:09:41.973Z">at 10.09am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6810f6578f08f0938cf48cfe" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T16:04:46.577Z">5.04pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Badenoch says Spanish power cuts probably partly caused by reliance on renewables - as No 10 says these claims 'unfounded'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Downing Street</strong> has said suggestions that a reliance on renewable energy contributed to blackouts in Spain are “unfounded claims and speculation”.</p> <p>Echoing a theory promoted prominently by the Daily Telegraph <a href="https://x.com/sgfmann/status/1916964878167728352">in its splash story</a> on the power cuts in Spain and Portugal, <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> said she thought it was likely that having a grid reliant on renewable energy was a factor.</p> <p>She told journalists:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’ve heard different theories about what’s happened.</p> <p>Some have said that it’s cyberterrorism, but the more likely issue is the grid – that when you have an electricity supply that’s reliant on renewables, you need a lot of battery storage. And quite often, what we’re seeing is renewables running ahead of the storage facilities, which means that when you have surges one way or another, you end up with blackouts.</p> <p>And this is one of the reasons why I’ve been saying that the net zero plans we have are not thought through.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Dowing Street said these were “unfounded claims”. At the afternoon lobby briefing, asked about the theory that there was a renewable energy link to the power cuts, a <strong>No 10 spokesperson</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In terms of the claims of reliance on net zero energy leaving countries affected vulnerable to power cuts, these are unfounded claims and speculation at this stage.</p> <p>It is too early to confirm the exact cause of the incident, and the priority has obviously been the restoration of power.</p> <p>Switching fossil fuelled generation for home grown, clean energy from renewables and other clean technologies offers us security, electricity supply that fossil fuels simply cannot provide.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-30T09:08:54.761Z">at 10.08am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6810f4ec8f08f0938cf48cd1" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T15:53:35.095Z">4.53pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Farage claims Reform UK 'winning the argument' on net zero after Blair says current policies not working</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the Reform UK leader, has claimed his party is “winning the argument” on net zero in the light of Tony Blair now arguing that current policies are failing.

Polling suggests that, in the UK, at least some aspect of the net zero agenda are popular. For example, YouGov published <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/03/18/c4b0f/1">a poll </a>recently saying more than half of Britons support the government’s target of getting emissions to net zero by 2050. The government carries out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/desnz-public-attitudes-tracker-summer-2024/desnz-public-attitudes-tracker-net-zero-and-climate-change-summer-2024-uk">its own tracker polling</a>, and that shows 54% of people think the transition to net zero will have a positive impact on the economy over the long term.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Blair says people in developed countries don’t think their governments’ climate policies will make much difference.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In developed countries, voters feel they’re being asked to make financial sacrifices and changes in lifestyle when they know that their impact on global emissions is minimal. Whatever the historical responsibility of the developed world for climate change, those with even a cursory knowledge of the facts understand that in the future the major sources of pollution will come principally from the developing world.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is quite similar to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/23/pmqs-uk-politics-live-keir-starmer-kemi-badenoch-conservatives-labour-reform?page=with%3Ablock-6808aa078f0887d718c2e5aa#block-6808aa078f0887d718c2e5aa">what Nigel Farage was arguing only last week.</a></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Blair says people in developing countries also resent the push to net zero.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>For that developing world, there is an equal resentment when they’re told the investment is not available for the energy necessary for their development because it is not “green”. They believe, correctly, that they have a right to develop and that those who have already developed using fossil fuels do not have the right to inhibit them from whatever is the most effective way of developing.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Blair says the current climate policies around the world are “inadequate” and not working.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Because of the levels of growth and development, present policy solutions are inadequate and, worse, are distorting the debate into a quest for a climate platform that is unrealistic and therefore unworkable.</p> <p>So, the movement now needs a public mandate, attainable only through a shift from protest to pragmatic policy. Too often, political leaders fear saying what many know to be true: the current approach isn’t working.</p> </blockquote> <p>(The line about politicians not saying “what many know to be true” sounds like an extract from a Kemi Badenoch speech. In fact, she would probably agree with almost all of what Blair is saying in this foreword.)</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Blair says current policies are not curbing the rise in rise in the production of fossil fuels.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Despite the past 15 years seeing an explosion in renewable energy and despite electric vehicles becoming the fastest-growing sector of the vehicle market, with China leading the way in both, production of fossil fuels and demand for them has risen, not fallen, and is set to rise further up to 2030. Leaving aside oil and gas, in 2024 China initiated construction on 95 gigawatts of <em>new</em> coal-fired energy, which is almost as much as the total current energy output from coal of all of Europe put together. Meanwhile, India recently announced they had reached the milestone of 1 billion tonnes of coal production in a single year.</p> <p>Airline travel is set to double over the next 20 years.</p> <p>By 2050, urbanisation is expected to drive a 40 per cent increase in demand for steel and a 50 per cent increase in demand for cement – core inputs to development, but materials with a significant emissions footprint.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He says that is why trying to phase out fossil fuels in the short term is “doomed to fail”.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>These are the inconvenient facts, which mean that any strategy based on either “phasing out” fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail.</p> </blockquote> <p>Blair does not define “short term” in this context.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>He says there should be much more focus on carbon capture – the technology that would mitigate the impact of climate emissions by in effect sucking them out of the atmosphere.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We need to recognise that without turning some of the emerging technologies into financially viable options, the world will choose the cheapest option. This applies to everything from nuclear fusion to sustainable aviation fuel, to green steel and low-emissions cement.</p> <p>We should put carbon capture – directly removing carbon as well as capturing it at source – at the centre of the battle. At present, carbon capture is not commercially viable despite being technologically feasible – but policy, finance and innovation would change this. The disdain for this technology in favour of the purist solution of stopping fossil-fuel production is totally misguided.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He also calls for more use of nuclear power.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Nuclear power is going to be an essential part of the answer. The confusion of this with nuclear weapons and consequently the irrational fear of it, intensified by hyperbolic campaigning, has led the world to an egregious policy error with many countries turning their back on it from the 1980s onwards, when embracing it would have significantly changed the trajectory of global emissions. The new generation of small modular reactors offers hope for the renaissance of nuclear power, but it needs integrating into nations’ energy policy.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He calls for more focus on “adaption” as a response to climate change.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>And adaptation to climate change must also move up the agenda because the impacts that are already locked in cannot all be mitigated in the time available. But adaptation has always been the poor relation of climate action because it seems to accept that some climate change is inevitable.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/23/labour-keir-starmer-donald-trump-us-election-uk-politics-latest-news?page=with%3Ablock-67190df48f08509e45b96642#block-67190df48f08509e45b96642">an argument that Badenoch has made.</a></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Blair suggests the Cop climate crisis summits have become counter-productive.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>[At Cop summits] political leaders argue for days in public about wording like “ending”, “phasing out”, “reducing” fossil fuels, proclaiming that we can still meet the 1.5 degrees target on limiting global warming, about who bears “responsibility” for climate change, and “loss and damage” compensation, in a forum that frankly doesn’t have the heft to drive action and impact.</p> <p>Because – agree with it or not – most political leaders are decent people who do want to do the right thing, in recent times the Cops have become uncomfortable for many leaders. They would like to start taking some of the hysteria out of the climate debate but are reluctant to be the first to do so.</p> <p>The Cop process will not deliver change at the speed required.

In<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/milkshake-tax-labour-childhood-obesity-7ncbfwz6s"> their story</a>, <strong>Max Kendix </strong>and<strong> Chris Smyth</strong> say:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Milkshakes and lattes are set to be hit by a sugar tax for the first time as Labour moves to extend the levy to hundreds more soft drinks including Pepsi and Ribena.</p> <p>Pre-packaged milkshakes and coffees will be covered by the levy, ministers signalled on Monday, ending an exemption they described as an anomaly. The present laws have mainly affected fizzy drinks.</p> <p>In a move that goes further than expected, ministers said it was time to be more ambitious on unhealthy drinks, announcing that they will also lower the sugar content threshold at which the tax applies, catching some of Britain’s best-known brands and supermarket products which had changed recipes to avoid the previous levy.</p> <p>Tax rates on sugary drinks will also rise 27 per cent over the parliament to make up for a freeze since 2018, ministers confirmed.</p> </blockquote>    <p>Asked about this in her interview on BBC Breakfast, <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> said that she was not keen on the sugar tax anyway, even the original version introduced by her party. She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I wasn’t a fan of it when this law was brought in. It actually first came in under the Conservatives. I thought it was a bit too much nanny state.</p> <p>But we have a sugar tax already. My worry is that the government doesn’t have any plans, didn’t have any strategy, and so they’re just looking for what else they can tax.</p> <p>Taxing is not the way to get the economy growing. Just simply going back for more and more taxes at a time when businesses are closing down, they’re not hiring – Labour has been making the wrong choices on the economy across the border.</p> <p>I don’t think that this is going to make much of an additional difference. I think the law of diminishing returns tends to apply when you keep just doing the same thing again and again and expecting outsized returns.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-29T09:16:07.272Z">at 10.16am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6810953d8f082de087ab9c7e" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T09:04:05.356Z">10.04am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Readout from Starmer's meeting with Palestinian authority PM Mohammad Mustafa</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>On the subject of Gaza, I was asked yesterday if I could post the Downing Street readout of <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>’s talks yesterday afternoon with <strong>Mohammad Mustafa</strong>, prime minister of the Palestinian authority.

There are two days left until the local elections in England and, conveniently perhaps for Labour campaigners, the government’s main announcement is about a plan to stop sex offenders claiming asylum in the UK. <strong>Rajeev Syal</strong> has the details here.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/28/foreign-sex-offenders-will-be-banned-from-claiming-asylum-in-the-uk-says-home-office">Foreign sex offenders will be banned from claiming asylum in the UK, says Home Office</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government is announcing this now because it will change the law via an amendment to the border security, asylum and immigration bill, which has already finished its committee stage in the Commons and will soon get its report stage (the last chance for an amendment before the bill goes to the Lords). Immigration policy is not a matter for local authorities, but Labour will still be hoping that today’s headlines might be at least marginally helpful as people think about how to vote.</p> <p>With the Conservatives expected to lose around 500 council seats, <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/local-elections-tories-lose-reform-labour-liberal-democrats-b1223946.html">according to one forecast</a>, these should be difficult elections for <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>. But she won’t be taking it personally, she told BBC Breakfast this morning in an interview. Asked if a bad result would be a vote on her own “personal popularity as leader”, Badenoch replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>No, I don’t. We had a historic defeat last year, and it’s going to take some time for us to get back on track. I am working to rebuild public trust, letting the country know that the Conservative party is under new leadership. But as we saw with previous oppositions, it took 14 years, 13 years and 18 years to come back. I’ve only been leader for six months. It’s going to take a while to fix the problems which we had from last year.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is also a byelection on Thursday, in Runcorn and Helsby, where Labour had a majority of almost 15,000 at the last election. The constituency is counting overnight, which means that on Friday morning, when a lot of the local election results won’t yet be in (many councils count on the Friday, not overnight, because it is easier), the election night narrative will be determined largely by the Runcorn result. Reform UK hope they can win, and that would be a formidable show of strength (even though parties that pull off amazing byelection victories don’t normally perform so well at general elections). Given what has happened to the Westminster expectations thermometer, even a narrow Labour win would be a good result for Keir Starmer.</p> <p>And the Conservatives? According to Labour, they have given up totally in the seat. This is what <strong>Ellie Reeves,</strong> Labour’s chair, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/exclusive-senior-labour-minister-accuses-tories-of-gifting-crunch-by-election-to-reform-uk_uk_680f9544e4b000a1c038cebb">told HuffPost UK</a>.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The Tories aren’t doing anything.
