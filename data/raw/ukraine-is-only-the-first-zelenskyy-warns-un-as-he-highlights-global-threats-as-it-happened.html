 <h2 class="block-title">Netherlands to set up national maritime security centre to deal with risks to subsea cables, wind turbines, shipping lanes</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>A national maritime security centre to deal with the threat of subsea cables being cut in the North Sea will be established in the Netherlands</strong>, the army chief of the North Sea infrastructure programme has revealed.</p> 
  <p>It will provide <strong>situational awareness, risk threat assessments and protections to the 1,955 wind turbines around the Netherlands</strong>, <strong>the sub sea cables and to shipping lanes.</strong></p> 
  <p>“It will collect data in one place, analyse [data and threat levels] in one place and give us a clearer picture of what is going on at sea,” said <strong>Eduard de van der Schueren</strong>, programme director for the protection of North Sea infrastructure at the Dutch ministry of defence.<br><br>Speaking at a conference hosted by the International Institute for European Affairs in Dublin, he said <strong>bringing private and public sectors together was vital to help countries around Europe to “become more resilient against hybrid threats”.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Russian spy ships have entered British, Irish, Dutch and French waters on several occasions in the past two years</strong> raising fears over the security of maritime infrastructure.<br><br>Ireland’s former deputy prime minister <strong>Simon Coveney</strong> said the “neutrality” of the country was “not a protection”. “In many ways neutral countries have to spend more of defence,” he added. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Russia wants a world where brute force prevails over international law,' Latvia's Rinkēvičs warns</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Latvian president Edgars Rinkēvičs also issues a stark warning about Russia’s intentions as he tells the UN general assembly that Moscow “wants a world where brute force prevails over international law.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“<strong>Russia wants to get what it wants, and … is willing to inflict destruction and misery on others.</strong> Unfortunately, Russia has partners in crime, notably <strong>Iran</strong> and <strong>North Korea</strong>,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He tells delegates that “<strong>Ukraine is fighting for all of us:</strong> for the rules-based international order, for independence and sovereignty, for territorial integrity, so that international borders are not changed by force.”</p> 
  <p>He also <strong>criticises Russian “hybrid attacks” and “new provocations” against a number of eastern European countries</strong>, including <strong>Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, </strong>and<strong> Romania.</strong></p> 
  <p>On Gaza, <strong>Rinkēvičs talks about the need “to strengthen international cooperation to tackle the escalating crisis in Gaza,”</strong> as he warns that “the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza continues to spiral.”</p> 
  <p>“Urgent action is needed to end civilian suffering,” he says, adding that “we recognise Israel’s legitimate right to self-defence, but it must be exercised in line with the international law, and particularly international humanitarian law.”</p> 
  <p>He also backs a two-state solution to “break the cycle of violence and reach a just and lasting peace.”</p> 
  <p>His comments matter as <strong>Latvia was earlier his year elected to serve as a non-permanent member of the UN security council for two years from January 2026.</strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Turning blind eye to Ukraine gives green light to future aggressors anywhere in world, Czech president warns</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Czech president (and a retired army general) <strong>Petr Pavel</strong> is speaking now.</p> 
  <p>He warns that <strong>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has significantly transformed the global security landscape</strong> since the last general debate a year ago,” with the world not any safer than last year.</p> 
  <p>“On the contrary, <strong>in the game of smoke and mirrors, Russia continues targeting civilians, civilian infrastructure, foreign diplomatic missions, and most recently, even our neighbouring country,</strong> Poland – not to forget the acts of hybrid warfare on our own territory,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He warns that “<strong>Russia still aims to seize Ukrainian territory and expand its sphere of influence, backed by China, Iran, North Korea and other countries that help It circumvent sanctions</strong> and provide economic or political support.”</p> 
  <p>He says <strong>the Russian aggression “threatens to dismantle our system of governance</strong> based on mutual respect, equal partnership and rules we all subscribe to.”</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>What is happening in Europe today could happen anywhere else tomorrow</strong> under different circumstances, under but under the exact same pretext. … </em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>Turning a blind eye to Ukraine today is a green light to any future aggressor anywhere in the world.”</strong></em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Unusually direct' speech by Spain's Felipe points to Spain's history to push back against Israel's suggestions of antisemitism - snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Madrid</em></p> 
  <p><strong>King Felipe</strong> <strong>may not have been quite as outspoken on Gaza as Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has been</strong> – the monarch notably steered clear of the word “genocide” – <strong>but his language was unusually direct and very deliberate.</strong> </p> 
  <p>Before calling on the Israeli government to “stop this massacre now”, <strong>he was careful to mention Spain’s Sephardic history,</strong> and to remind his audience that his country has sought to make amends for the expulsion of its Jewish population in 1492 by introducing the 2015 law that offered citizenship to their descendants. </p> 
  <p>“That is why it hurts us so much; that is why it’s so hard for us to understand what the Israeli government is doing,” he said. </p> 
  <p><strong>The invocation of the Sephardic citizenship law</strong> – which resulted in the granting of Spanish citizenship to more than 72,000 descendants of the exiled Sephardic Jews – <strong>echoes the Spanish government’s efforts to hit back at Israel’s suggestions that its stance on Gaza is motivated by antisemitism.</strong> </p> 
  <p>At the beginning of September, Israel’s foreign minister, <strong>Gideon Sa’ar</strong> accused Madrid of waging “a continuous anti-Israel and antisemitic attack”. </p> 
  <p>The <strong>Spanish foreign ministry called the accusation “slanderous and false”</strong> – and also reminded the Israeli government of Spain’s Sephardic history, adding: </p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“In recent years, Spain has granted nationality to 72,000 Sephardic descendants, who are now our fellow citizens. </em></p> 
   <p><em>This government immediately condemned the horrific attack by the terrorist group Hamas and has consistently demanded the release of all hostages. </em></p> 
   <p><em>It also approved the first National Plan against Antisemitism in our history in January 2023 and decided to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>This government is committed to combating antisemitism and racism and to a country where there is no room for discrimination of any kind.”</strong></em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Strong speech from Zelenskyy seeks to broaden appeal of his warnings - snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>That was <strong>a very strong speech from Zelenskyy</strong> and <strong>a clear attempt to make his arguments – naturally focused on the threat posed by Russia – a bit more universal to broaden its appeal to his global audience</strong> as he explicitly mentions crises in other parts of the world, including <strong>Georgia, Moldova, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan, </strong>and<strong> Syria.</strong></p> 
  <p>(<strong>Expect Moldova to be watched particularly closely this week</strong> given the recent events there with Russian attempts to interfere with the country’s democratic processes and the upcoming critical parliamentary election.)</p> 
  <p>There was <strong>a bit of advice or warning for both the most advanced countries</strong> – warning that they are not ready for what could hit them and they don’t want to face the same tragic choices that Ukraine is facing – <strong>and the rest of the world</strong>, stressing that they shouldn’t be subjected to a 21st century “survival of the fittest” where all that matters is what friends and weapons you have.</p> 
  <p>His line on the need for strong guarantees for Ukraine to make sure that <strong>“national security not a privilege for a few nations, but a right for everyone”</strong> is particularly strong here and will probably reasonate with many listeners.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Make national security a right for everyone, not a privilege for few, Zelenskyy says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Zelenskyy</strong> returns to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as he says that <strong>“every year that this war goes on, weapons become even more deadly, and only Russia deserves to be blamed for this.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He says <strong>Ukraine had to build “underground schools and underground hospitals” to save others or teach farmers to protect their equipment from drone strikes.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Russia’s war has put us in this situation. <strong>But do </strong><em><strong>you</strong></em><strong> have protection against similar threats?</strong>,” he asks leaders.</p> 
  <p>He warns that “<strong>stopping this war now and within the global arms race is cheaper than building underground kindergartens or massive bunkers for critical infrastructure later.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“<strong>Stopping Putin now is cheaper than trying to protect every port and every ship</strong> from terrorists with sea drones. Stopping Russia now is cheaper than wondering who will be the force to create a simple drone carrying a nuclear warhead,” he says,</p> 
  <p>He urges leader to <strong>“use everything we have together to force the aggressor to stop and only then we have a real chance that this arms race will not end in catastrophe for all of us.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“<strong>If it takes weapons to do it, if it takes pressure on Russia, then it must be done, and it must be done now.</strong> Otherwise, Putin will keep driving the war forward wider and deeper. And we told you before, Ukraine is only the first,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He says that “if security guarantees work for Ukraine, something more than just friends and weapons, <strong>it will mean that people were able to make national security not a privilege for a few nations, but a right for everyone.</strong>”</p> 
  <p>He then turns to Russia’s trading partners, as he says their response will decide if Russia is allowed to continue its aggression.</p> 
  <p>“<strong>War has already reached too many people to pretend it has nothing to do with you.</strong> So it depends on you whether you help peace or continue trading with Russia and helping Russia to fund this war,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He once again thanks Trump for his support after their talks on Tuesday, and ends on a strong note with a direct appeal:</p> 
  <p>“<strong>So don’t stay silent while Russia keeps dragging this war on.</strong> Please speak out and condemn it. Please join us in defending and international law and order. People are waiting for action,” he says.</p>

  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>We are now living through the most destructive arms race in human history,</strong> because this time it includes artificial intelligence.</em></p> 
   <p><em>And <strong>if there are no real security guarantees except friends and weapons</strong>, and if the world can’t even respond to all threats, and if there is no strong platform for international security, <strong>will there be any place left on Earth that’s still safe for people</strong>?”</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Collapse of international law and order leads to rise of weapons, Zelenskyy says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Returning to a broader international theme, <strong>Zelenskyy</strong> refers the situation in Afghanistan and “cartels in some Latin America countries that are more powerful than the government.”</p> 
  <p><strong>“This is all about collapse of international law and the weakness of the international institutions, and so it’s about the rise of weapons,”</strong> he says.</p> 
  <p>He gives specific examples by paying tribute to US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> saying only “God saved him from a murder attempt during the campaign,” and notes the recent killing of <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong> in the US, and of Ukrainian woman <strong>Iryna Zarutska</strong> killed in the US.</p> 
  <p>He then remarks on the growing importance of drones, saying “war tech doesn’t care about geography any more” as he references the recent closure of <strong>Copenhagen</strong> airport because of drones.</p>

   <p><em>Russia abducted thousands of Ukrainian children, and we have brought some of them back. And I thank, I thank everyone who’s helped. But how long will it take to bring all of them whom childhood slips away faster than adults are able to help?”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He says that he warned about the risk of radiation disasted as a result of Russia’s occupation of Zaporizhzhya power plant last year, and “nothing has changed” since.</p> 
  <p>“Russia hasn’t stopped shelling, even in areas near a nuclear facility. And international institutions are too weak, this madness continues,” he says.</p> 
  <p>Acknowledging recent incidents in Poland, Romania, and Estonia, he says that “even being part of a longstanding military alliance [Nato] doesn’t automatically mean you are safe.”</p> 
  <p>He also pays tribute to Moldova this “is defending itself again from Russia’s interference.”</p> 
  <p>He says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“We have already lost Georgia in Europe. Human rights and the European nature of the state system are only shrinking there, and Georgia is dependent on Russia, and for many, many years Belarus has also been moving toward dependence on Russia.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova too.”</strong></em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Stop this massacre now,' Spain's king Felipe tells Israel on Gaza in passionate defence of rules-based order</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Spain’s King Felipe mounts a passionate defence of the international rules-based order in his speech</strong>, warning that <strong>“a world without rules amounts to uncharted territory; … it’s returning to the middle ages.”</strong></p> 
  <p>Already in one of the opening paragraphs, he <strong>acknowledges “the voices that continue to proclaim the end of multilateralism and the obsolescence and inefficacy of the United Nations”</strong> in what can be seen as an indirect rebuke to yesterday’s speech by US president <strong>Donald Trump.</strong></p> 
  <p>He <strong>condemns Russia’s “unprovoked and unjustifiable aggression,”</strong> backing “all efforts aimed at achieving a just and lasting peace.”</p> 
  <p>But <strong>he focuses even more on the situation in the Middle East,</strong> as he <strong>says “we cannot remain silent or look away from the devastation of bombings,”</strong> and <strong>calls out “the countless civilian deaths, famine, starvation, the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of people.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He says <strong>“these are abhorrent acts that stand in stark contrast to everything that this forum represents,</strong> they offend human conscience and shame the entire international community.”</p> 
  <p>Noting Spain’s links with Sephardic Jews, he says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“It is for this reason, and <strong>it is so difficult for us to understand that with and we are so pained by the actions of the Israeli government in Gaza.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>We therefore cry out, we implore, we demand: <strong>stop this massacre now</strong>. </em></p> 
   <p><em>No more deaths in the name of a people that are so wise and ancient, who have suffered so greatly throughout history.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He <strong>condemns “the heinous terrorism of Hamas,”</strong> and <strong>“recognise Israel’s right to self-defence,”</strong> but also <strong>demands full access to Gaza for humanitarian aid deliveries.</strong></p> 
  <p>“The international community must shoulder its responsibility to achieve as soon as possible, a viable solution that would include the existence of two states,” he says.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump’s change in tone is valuable to Ukraine – but more than words are needed</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Defence and security editor</em></p> 
  <p><strong>The change in Trump’s tone is worth something to Kyiv.</strong> </p> 
  <p>But if the US president were to be serious about a Ukrainian battlefield victory, <strong>it would require not just further economic sanctions, but a far greater provision of American weapons</strong> and probably direct military intervention on the part of the west as well.</p> 
  <p>Russia has been forced to retreat only during two periods since its full-scale invasion began in February 2022: in the spring of that year, when it was over-extended around Kyiv; and again in autumn 2022, when it faced a similar problem in Kherson and when defences were thinly held in the Kharkiv region before the Kremlin launched a mobilisation drive.</p> 
  <p>Critically, Ukraine failed with its counteroffensive in the summer of 2023. Western tanks, rockets and armoured vehicles were supplied but used poorly by Kyiv, spreading them out at multiple points along the front in attacks that failed to take account of Russian mines, trenches and other defences.</p> 
  <p>The gains amounted to six miles at best at one or two points on the front and have long since been eradicated by the slow, but remorseless Russian advance from Avdiivka to the gates of Pokrovsk in central Donetsk. Moscow has held the initiative since early 2024 and shows no sign of relinquishing it.</p> 
  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/ukraine_240925/giv-32554w9iVGy0QG0qc/" data-alt="Map of Ukraine"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/ukraine_240925/giv-32554w9iVGy0QG0qc/">Interactive</a> 
  </figure> 
  <p><strong>Ukraine itself has long since acknowledged that it cannot win back lands conquered by Russia through military means.</strong> </p> 
  <p>In February, Zelenskyy accepted that some or all of the territory occupied since 2014 would have to be returned to Ukraine by “diplomatic means” while other experts have talked about pursuing a highly militarised defensive strategy.</p> 
  <p><strong>In military terms, Ukraine would probably only be able to push out the Russian invader in one of two scenarios.</strong> One is a radical change in western intervention – perhaps the direct involvement of Nato air power – but the idea is so politically unlikely that it ought to be discounted. The second is a Russian collapse, stemming probably from regime change at the Kremlin, of which, again, there is no sign.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in New York</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump may have been speaking to the 192 other world leaders gathered in the United Nations, but the real target of his speech on Tuesday was Europe,</strong> which was hauled up repeatedly as the whipping boy for an antiliberal, blood-and-soil polemic that renewed an assault on the transatlantic relationship that has become a theme of his second administration.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">

  </aside> 
  <p>In an hourlong address to the assembled world leaders and delegations, <strong>Trump told European leaders directly that they were destroying their own countries</strong> – and that they should be more like the US as he condemned their policies on immigration, green energy and political correctness.</p> 
  <p><strong>These were not subtle digs</strong>. On migration, he told Europeans that “your countries are going to hell.” On Europe’s approach to climate change, he said it was “on the brink of destruction because of the green energy agenda”. On the war in Ukraine, he said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> was “funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?”</p> 
  <p>This is <strong>red meat for his supporters, and observers from across the aisle in the United States quickly identified Trump’s likely audience as his own base.</strong> The first 10 minutes were almost a classic stump speech, with Trump telling foreign leaders about how well he had handled inflation and that after just eight months in office “we are the hottest country anywhere in the world, and there is no other country even close”.</p> 
  <p>But then he turned his gaze to the failures of the United Nations and other world leaders – in which an aide forecast that he would denounce “globalists”. <strong>US conservatives would have been delighted to watch Trump tear into European liberals</strong>, who were forced to watch and politely applaud as they were accused of gross mismanagement of their countries.</p> 
  <p><strong>“Let’s not pretend this is a foreign policy speech or dignify it by calling it one,”</strong> wrote Ned Price, a former deputy to the US representative to the United Nations during the Biden administration. </p> 
  <p>“This is basically Maga madlibs. <strong>Trump is speaking to his political base, hitting each of his campaign trail hits,</strong> while addressing a room of leaders who’d rather be just about anywhere else.”</p>
