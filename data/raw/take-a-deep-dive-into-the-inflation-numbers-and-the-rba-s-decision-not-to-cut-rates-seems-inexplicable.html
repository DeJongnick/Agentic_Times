<p>The <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/price-indexes-and-inflation/consumer-price-index-australia/jun-quarter-2025#key-statistics">latest inflation figures</a> confirm that the Reserve Bank wrongly kept interest rates steady at its meeting earlier this month as the official measure of inflation fell to 2.1%, while the monthly indicator dropped outside the RBA target band at 1.9%.</p> <p>The one thing you won’t hear from the Reserve Bank after the release of the June quarter inflation figures is an apology. Because, to give credit to the RBA, in its <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2025/may/outlook.html#4-6-detailed-forecast-information">May statement on monetary policy</a> it predicted inflation of 2.1%. That it did predict this inflation and yet still kept interest rates steady tells you something about how punishingly timid it has been.</p> <p>In June, not only was the official CPI at 2.1%, meaning it has now been below 3% for a year, but the core measure of inflation (the trimmed mean) fell from 2.9% to 2.7%:</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Inflation across all measures is now well under 3%">  <iframe title="Inflation across all measures is now well under 3%" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-5Lqaz" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/5Lqaz/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="403" data-external="1"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/5Lqaz/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>Even more astonishing is that in a majority of capital cities, inflation is now below 2% – yep, <em>below</em> the Reserve Bank’s target range:</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="In five capital cities inflation is now below 2%">  <iframe title="In five capital cities inflation is now below 2%" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-7Dz9X" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7Dz9X/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="398" data-external="1"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/7Dz9X/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>And if you want even more confirmation of just how low inflation is at the moment, the monthly measure of inflation – which in November will take over as the official measure once a few more items are added – rose just 1.9%:</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="The monthly measure of inflation is below the RBA range">  <iframe title="The monthly measure of inflation is below the RBA range" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-6yZ6P" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6yZ6P/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/6yZ6P/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>All of this is very good news for those who were struggling with rising prices in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>It is less good news for the opposition. The shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, took to the <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Hansard/Hansard_Display?bid=chamber/hansardr/28812/&amp;sid=0000">parliament on Monday</a> and told the treasurer that “inflation remains too high”. If that is the case then we need to change the English language as well as economics to redefine “high”.</p> <p>Even when you compare our core inflation with those in other major economies, Australia is doing well.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Australia’s core inflation is low">  <iframe title="Australia's core inflation is low" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-ZRYK7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZRYK7/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/ZRYK7/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>Core inflation is the measure that the RBA mainly focuses on because it gives a less erratic view of what is happening.</p> <p>What it does is top and tail (or “trim”) the 15% biggest price rises and falls.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2025/jul/29/all-the-way-with-donald-j-albaneses-second-term-will-be-defined-by-how-he-handles-the-elephant-in-the-room">All the way with Donald J?

But even still, electricity costs on average 14% less than it would without the subsidies. So you can bet the government will be very happy it extended its scheme:</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Government rebates have made electricity 14% cheaper">  <iframe title="Government rebates have made electricity 14% cheaper" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-6ePks" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/6ePks/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/6ePks/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>That the RBA did not cut rates earlier this month is even more inexplicable when you dig deeper into the figures.</p> <p>The RBA always looks at the price increase of services rather than goods, because services are more closely linked with wages (because you need workers to do the services). In the year to June service prices rose just 3.3% – that is back at the level they rose in 2011 to 2014 – a period when <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/statistics/cash-rate/#cash-rate-chart">the RBA cut interest rates eight times</a>:</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Services inflation is back at sustainable levels">  <iframe title="Services inflation is back at sustainable levels" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Kez6G" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Kez6G/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/Kez6G/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>And the level of inflation is also very broad. The prices of about two-thirds of all items counted in the CPI basket rose less than 3% – that’s a very solid level:</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="The prices of two-thirds of items are rising by less than 3%">  <iframe title="The prices of two-thirds of items are rising by less than 3%" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-XEtl7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/XEtl7/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/XEtl7/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>This of course does not mean all things are hunky dory and life is a sweet basket of chocolates and strawberries.</p> <p>Pleasingly the prices of non-discretionary items – those things we have to buy, such as food, petrol or insurance – are now rising the slowest, but there is still a lot of catching up to do after the past four years.</p> <p>Since June 2022, which was about the same time the RBA began lifting rates, wages have risen 14% – well behind the 22% increase in the price of those necessities. That makes for a lot of people still feeling worse off than they were then:</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Since June 2022 the price of non-discretionary items has risen the fastest">  <iframe title="Since June 2022 the price of non-discretionary items has risen the fastest" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-l5EzK" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/l5EzK/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="399" data-external="1"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/l5EzK/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>But overall, the story is very good. Inflation should no longer be such a concern that the RBA holds off on cutting rates until it gets more information.</p> <p>But unemployment is now rising above 4%; when you combine that with inflation falling close to 2% that equals an interest cut. And even though they won’t, when they do cut in August, the RBA also should apologise for making everyone wait six weeks longer than they needed to.</p> <ul> <li><p>Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and policy director at the Centre for Future Work</p></li> </ul>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
