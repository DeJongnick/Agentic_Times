<p>Rachel Reeves is considering plans for a new pay-per-mile tax for electric vehicles worth an extra £250 a year on average.</p> <p>Under proposals the chancellor may announce in the budget on 26 November, EV drivers would face a new charge of 3p a mile on top of other road taxes to offset falling revenue from petrol and diesel cars as drivers switch to greener options.</p> <p>A government spokesperson said: “Fuel duty covers petrol and diesel, but there’s no equivalent for electric vehicles. We want a fairer system for all drivers.”</p> <p>The chancellor would reportedly argue that the EV levy would be fairer, as drivers of petrol or diesel cars pay £600 a year in fuel duty, on average. The move would also help her plug a financial hole of between £20bn and £30bn by the end of the parliament. </p> <p>The scheme would start in 2028 after a consultation, by which time up to 6 million people are expected to be driving electric cars or vans, according to the Daily Telegraph, which first reported on the proposal.</p> <p>Last year, the Campaign for Better Transport <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/sep/03/uk-electric-car-drivers-per-mile-vehicle-taxes-campaign-for-better-transport">urged Reeves</a> to introduce a pay-per-mile road charging scheme to fill the growing revenue gap. The Tony Blair Institute <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/23/pay-per-mile-road-pricing-system-tony-blair-thinktank">also advised at the time</a> that Reeves should introduce a simple road pricing system of 1p a mile for cars and vans and 2.5p to 4p for lorries and heavy goods vehicles.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/more-than-a-million-evs-on-uk-roads-as-vehicle-ownership-reaches-new-high/">the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders</a>, there are more than 1.3m electric cars on the road at present.</p> <p>Amid growing speculation around a new pay-per-mile charge, a third of Britons are considering getting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/dec/16/motoring-myths-black-boxes-telematics-insurance">“black box” car insurance</a> that tracks your driving behaviour to cut costs. Middle-aged drivers are the most likely to opt for telematics insurance policies, according to a survey from the insurance company Hastings Direct.</p> <p>The government spokesperson said £4bn had been invested in support of the transition to electric vehicles, including grants to cut upfront costs by up to £3,750 for each eligible vehicle.</p> <p>“Just as it is right to seek a tax system that fairly funds roads, infrastructure and public services, we will look at further support measures to make owning electric vehicles more convenient and more affordable,” they added. </p>
