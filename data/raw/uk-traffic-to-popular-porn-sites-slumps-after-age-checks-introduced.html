<p>British visits to popular pornography sites have slumped following the introduction of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/what-are-the-new-uk-online-safety-rules-and-how-will-they-be-enforced">strict age checks last month</a>, data shows.</p> <p>Daily visits to Pornhub, the UK’s most used porn site, fell from 3.6m on 24 July, the day before age-gating was introduced, to 1.9m on 8 August, a drop of 47%.</p> <p>At the next most popular sites, XVideos and xHamster, visits fell 47% and 39% over the same period, according to the data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/11/wikipedia-can-challenge-online-safety-act-strictest-rules-high-court">Wikipedia can challenge Online Safety Act if strictest rules apply to it, says judge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The data, first reported by the Financial Times, appears to show the impact of strict age-checking rules from 25 July under the Online Safety Act. However, social media sites that also introduced age checks for material barred to under-18s, such as X and Reddit, did not experience dips in traffic over the same timeframe.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Pornhub said: “As we’ve seen in many jurisdictions around the world, there is often a drop in traffic for compliant sites and an increase in traffic for non-compliant sites.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/what-are-the-new-uk-online-safety-rules-and-how-will-they-be-enforced">What are the new UK online safety rules and how will age checks on adult content be enforced?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Online Safety Act contains rules on protecting children from harmful content that require sites or apps showing pornography to prevent children from seeing it.</p> <p>Ofcom, the UK watchdog overseeing the act, has backed age assurance measures including: facial age estimation, which assesses a person’s likely age through a live photo or video; checking a person’s age via their credit card provider, bank or mobile phone network operator; photo ID matching, where a passport or similar ID is checked against a selfie; or a “digital identity wallet” that contains proof of age.</p> <p>However, the act also requires online platforms to prevent children from viewing content including material that encourages suicide or self-harm, and to suppress the spread of content such as dangerous challenges, showing serious violence or inciting hatred against people. This has led to the age-gating of content such as an alcoholic recovery forum on Reddit and footage of an <a href="https://x.com/BenBarryJones/status/1948830460668158130">anti-migrant protest</a>, which led to warnings that the new law was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/04/social-media-battles-and-barbs-on-both-sides-of-atlantic-over-uk-online-safety-act">already over-regulating</a>.</p> <p>Ofcom maintains that the act does not suppress freedom of expression and has pointed to provisions that protect free speech. Breaches of the act carry a range of punishments, from formal warnings to a fine of up to £18m or 10% of global turnover or, in extreme cases, the site being blocked in the UK.</p> <p>Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party pledged to repeal the act after the introduction of age checks, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/29/peter-kyle-nigel-farage-extreme-pornographers-online-safety-bill">sparking a war of words</a> in which the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, accused Farage of siding with “people like Jimmy Savile”. Farage described Kyle’s comments as “so below the belt”.</p> <p>The introduction of age-checking has also led to a surge in the downloading of virtual private networks, which allow people to circumvent a country’s restrictions on viewing certain websites. The top five of Apple’s app store have been regularly dominated by VPN apps.</p>
