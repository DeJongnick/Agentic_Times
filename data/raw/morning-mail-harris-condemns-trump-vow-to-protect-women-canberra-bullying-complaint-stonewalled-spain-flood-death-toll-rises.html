<p>Good morning. As the US election looms, Kamala Harris has called out Donald Trump for his latest offensive comments directed at the nation’s women, whom he is promising to protect “whether the women like it or not”. This comes as polls show the political gender gap may be wider than ever.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the deputy prime minister’s chief of staff claims her bullying complaint is being stonewalled, a massive typhoon is hitting Taiwan and new research has revealed how Indigenous scrub burning methods could help south-east Australia stave off wildfires.</p>

<p><strong>Albanese and the Qantas firestorm</strong></p> 
<p>Just two weeks ago, the prime minister was engulfed in a crisis of optics when he bought a $4.3m property in middle of a housing crisis. Now he is under pressure once more for allegedly seeking free Qantas flight upgrades directly from the then CEO, Alan Joyce, while serving as transport minister and opposition leader – allegations he has denied.</p>
