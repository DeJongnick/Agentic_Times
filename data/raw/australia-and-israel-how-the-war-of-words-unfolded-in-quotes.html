<p>This week, diplomatic tensions between Australia and Israel have arisen after Canberra decided to deny a far-right Israeli politician entry to Australia. </p> <p>Simcha Rothman, a member of the Knesset for the far-right party Religious Zionism, has described Palestinian children in Gaza as “enemies” and called for Israel’s total control of the West Bank.</p> <p>Rothman was scheduled to appear at two public events in Sydney and Melbourne in August and two private events. It had been billed as a “solidarity tour”.</p> <p>The Australian home affairs minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tony-burke">Tony Burke</a>, on Monday confirmed Rothman’s visa application had been rejected.</p> <p>The decision ignited a war of words between the two countries.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/19/netanyahu-criticises-albanese-social-media-jewish-groups-respond-to-australia-israel-dispute-over-visa-cancellations-ntwnfb">Netanyahu lashes out at Albanese as ‘weak politician who betrayed Israel’ as diplomatic row escalates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In retaliation, Israel immediately announced it would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/18/israels-foreign-minister-revokes-visas-of-australian-representatives-to-palestinian-authority-ntwnfb">revoke the visas</a> of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority.</p> <p>By Wednesday, Burke was declaring there were now “very serious differences” between the two countries.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>This is how the public war of words has ramped up and played out:</p> <h2>Monday, 18 August</h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If you are coming to Australia to spread a message of hate and division, we don’t want you here.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Tony Burke on the decision to block </strong><strong>Rothman from visiting Australia</strong></p> <p>After Rothman’s visa application is rejected, Israel’s minister for foreign affairs, Gideon Sa’ar, announces on X he has revoked the visas of the Australian diplomats.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>While antisemitism is raging in Australia, including manifestations of violence against Jews and Jewish institutions, the Australian government is choosing to fuel it by false accusations, as if the visit of Israeli figures will disrupt public order and harm Australia’s Muslim population.</p> <p>It is shameful and unacceptable!</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s foreign affairs minister, on X, explaining the decision to revoke visas of Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority</strong></p> <h2>Tuesday, 19 August</h2> <p>On Tuesday morning, Australia’s foreign minister, Penny Wong, responds.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>At a time when dialogue and diplomacy are needed more than ever, the Netanyahu government is isolating Israel and undermining international efforts towards peace and a two-state solution.</p> <p>This is an unjustified reaction, following Australia’s decision to recognise Palestine.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Penny Wong, Australia’s foreign affairs minister, in an official statement on Israel’s decision to revoke the Australian visas</strong></p> <p>Netanyahu later takes to social media, posting a strongly worded statement to X, escalating the standoff. Netanyahu also wrote a letter, dated 17 August, to the Australian prime minister, stating Albanese’s decision to recognise Palestine was adding “fuel on this antisemitic fire”. The same quote was reportedly used in a letter Netanyahu sent to French president, Emmanuel Macron.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>History will remember Albanese for what he is: a weak politician who betrayed Israel and abandoned Australia’s Jews.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on X, after Australia’s </strong><strong>decision to block Rothman’s visit</strong></p> <p>Netanyahu’s public outburst attracts criticism from Israel’s opposition, saying it’s a “gift” to Australia. </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The thing that most strengthens a leader in the democratic world today is a confrontation with Netanyahu, the most politically toxic leader in the western world.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Yair Lapid, leader of the opposition in Israel, in a statement on X</strong></p> <h2>Wednesday, 20 August</h2> <p>Albanese says he didn’t take the verbal attack from Netanyahu personally. He promises to continue engaging diplomatically with all leaders.</p> <p>But Albanese’s home affair minister, Burke, is far stronger in his criticism of Netanyahu.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Strength is not measured by how many people you can blow up or how many children you can leave hungry. Strength is much better measured by exactly what [Albanese] has done, which is when there’s a decision that we know Israel won’t like, he goes straight to Benjamin Netanyahu.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Tony Burke on ABC Radio National</strong></p> <p>Alex Ryvchin, a prominent Jewish leader in Australia, criticises the decision to cancel Rothman’s visa. But he says the responses by Israel and Australia are overblown. He tells Sky News it was “unseemly” for a leader like Netanyahu to speak to a foreign leader in that manner.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There are real-life consequences here and we want to see the countries work through any issues before things get out of hand.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– Alex Ryvchin, the co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australia Jewry </strong></p> <p>Before the visa cancellation, the US ambassador to Israel expressed disappointment about Australia’s decision last week to recognise Palestine. Mike Huckabee told the ABC’s 7.30 program the timing was hurtful, and the decision was a gift to Hamas. The White House didn’t directly criticise Australia’s decision, but said more generally that the US recognising Palestinian statehood would be a reward for Hamas, and the administration would not do that, in comments reported by Nine Newspapers.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There’s an enormous level of disappointment and some disgust … I don’t know that the president used that word, [but] I would say that is a characterisation of a sentiment.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>– </strong><strong>Mike Huckabee on ABC’s 7.30 program, 14 August</strong></p> <p><em>– with Josh Taylor</em></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
