10-point plan to prepare the country for the climate emergency</strong>, warning that <strong>“if we don’t want to bequeath our children a Spain that’s grey from fire and flames</strong>, or a Spain that’s brown from floods, <strong>then we need a Spain that’s greener”.</strong></p> <p>Sánchez said <strong>August’s heatwave-fuelled wildfires</strong> – which killed four people, burned through an area six times the size of Ibiza, and <strong>required “the biggest human and technical deployment” ever seen in Spain</strong> – showed immediate action must be taken to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.</p> <p>He said waiting any longer would be dangerous and expensive, and <strong>criticised those who deny the realities of global heating in Spain.</strong> </p> <p>Over the past five years, he said, the climate emergency had caused <strong>more than 20,000 deaths and cost the public purse €32bn (£28bn) in material losses.</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em><strong>We need to mobilise as a society against climate change,</strong> which is a common enemy that lies beyond ideologies.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>He added:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“<strong>Climate change kills.</strong> It kills. </em></p> <p><em>And that’s why we have to be aware of everything it represents in terms of insecurity and in terms of the risks it poses to our lives. The climate change denial that’s coming from an important part [of society] – and which is growing as a result of the lies spread on social networks by some members of our political class – is as incomprehensible as it is worrying.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>He proposed a series of initiatives in Madrid on Monday, including a state civil protection agency to coordinate crisis responses, a network of climate refuges across the country and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/16/pauls-spain-wildfires-climate-change">a rethink of forest management and land use</a>. Only by acting now, he said, could the country hope to avert similar disasters or reduce their impacts.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a
