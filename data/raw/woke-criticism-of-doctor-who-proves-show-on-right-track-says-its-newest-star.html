<p>Criticisms that Doctor Who has become too “woke” prove the series is doing the right thing by being inclusive, its new star Varada Sethu has said.</p> <p>Sethu plays the Doctor’s latest travelling companion, Belinda Chandra, in new episodes airing this month. With Ncuti Gatwa returning as the Doctor, the pairing marks the first time a Tardis team will comprise solely people of colour.</p> <p>Speaking about the milestone, Sethu told the Radio Times: “Ncuti was like, ‘Look at us. We get to be in the Tardis. We’re going to piss off so many people.’”</p> <p>At a time when representative casting in sci-fi and fantasy is prompting toxicity online, the actor, who recently appeared in the Disney+ Star Wars series Andor, said she had been encouraged by fans’ response to her joining the show.</p> <p>“There’s been a couple of Doctor Woke [references] or whatever, but I just think we’re doing the right thing if we’re getting comments like that,” Sethu said.</p>    <p>“Woke just means inclusive, progressive and that you care about people. And, as far as I know, the core of Doctor Who is kindness, love and doing the right thing.”</p> <p>Doctor Who celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2023, when some viewers <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-14408525/woke-storylines-cancel-doctor-bbc.html">criticised its introduction of transgender and non-binary characters</a>, as well as a scene in which David Tennant’s Doctor realises he has a crush on Sir Isaac Newton.</p> <p>Sethu, who was born in India and moved to the north-east of England at a young age, has also appeared in Jurassic World Dominion, Annika and Strike Back.</p> <p>The 32-year-old made her first appearance in Doctor Who last year, playing an entirely different character in the episode Boom.</p> <p>She told Radio Times that, after filming that episode, the Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies said he “kept seeing me and Ncuti on screen and thinking, ‘God, those two have such great chemistry’.”</p> <p>She added: “We really are equals in the way that we interact with each other. Russell wanted someone who can push back and not be in awe of this all-powerful being.”</p> <p>Sethu said the new Doctor Who episodes were “bright and energetic”, with one – The Interstellar Song Contest – including a cameo from the TV personality Rylan Clark.</p> <p>She also spoke of the “whiplash”-inducing experience of taking on one of the most coveted and high-pressure roles on British television.</p> <p>“I was dropped into [filming] within two weeks of being told I had it. So a lot of the confusion and stress that [Belinda is] going through is the confusion and stress that I was going through,” she said.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 April 2025. An earlier version said that the series would start to air “next month” instead of this month.<br></p>
