<p>The chief executive of a FTSE 350 company is paid 52 times as much as a typical worker, according to the latest measure of inequality between bosses and their employees.</p> <p>Median pay for FTSE 350 chief executives was £2.5m last year, which works out at 52 times a median worker’s pay, according to a new report from the High Pay Centre campaign group. </p> <p>The widest gap was found at the cleaning, security and waste management group Mitie, whose chief executive, Phil Bentley, was paid £14.7m, 575 times more than a middle-earner in the 2023-24 financial year.</p> <p>Tesco ranked the second highest for the same period among FTSE 350 companies legally obliged to report the figure.</p> <p>With a package <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/14/tesco-ceo-near-10m-pay-a-slap-in-the-face-for-struggling-workers-union-says">worth nearly £10m</a>, the supermarket’s chief executive, Ken Murphy, was paid 431 times more than a typical Tesco worker that year. The most recent ratio, for the company’s 2024-25 financial year, was lower, at a multiple of 373 as Murphy’s pay fell to £9.2m.</p> <p>Luke Hildyard, the director of the High Pay Centre, said a maximum pay ratio between chief executives and workers could help ensure that all workers received “a fair reward for their contribution to business success”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/09/executive-pay-bonuses-policy-trump-tariffs-us-lawyers-cooley">Tariff-hit firms should review bonuses or risk backlash, US lawyers warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pay-gap ratio was even starker among FTSE 100 companies, where the median pay of chief executives was 78 times higher than their median employees. When compared with the lowest-earning quartile, the multiple rose to 106.</p> <p>The High Pay Centre suggested all companies should be required to publish their CEO-to-worker pay gaps in their annual reports, and include pay figures for outsourced workers in their calculations.</p> <p>Its research found the pay-gap ratio between chief executives and workers had decreased in the past year, and that there had been growth in pay for the lowest-earning workers. However, the thinktank noted this could also have reflected changes such as a smaller workforce due to job cuts, outsourcing or relocation.</p> <p>Tensions have been growing in the City over big pay packages for chief executives. Last month Centrica, the owner of British Gas, faced a shareholder rebellion after it handed its boss a multimillion-pound pay packet while energy bill payers struggled with record levels of debt.</p> <p>Before the vote, the leading proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommended against supporting Chris O’Shea’s pay rise as it “was materially above those given to the wider workforce”.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the pay package of Marks &amp; Spencer’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/02/m-and-s-boss-stuart-machin-pay-package-cyber-attack"> chief executive, Stuart Machin, jumped to more than £7m</a> just weeks before the cyber-attack that rocked the retailer. It marked a 40% rise compared with the £5.1m he took home a year earlier, partly as a result of a sharp rise in performance-linked bonuses.</p> <p>Bosses in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/02/pay-soars-at-barclays-and-hsbc-after-end-of-uk-banker-bonus-cap">banking sector are also expected to get bumper pay packages </a>this year after the removal of the UK banker bonus cap in late 2023.</p> <p>NatWest Group proposed a 43% increase in the maximum for its chief executive, Paul Thwaite, taking his total compensation to as high as £7.7m for the year. Meanwhile, his counterpart at Barclays, CS Venkatakrishnan, could earn up to £14.3m, a 45% increase. HSBC has suggested a 43% rise for Georges Elhedery, for a maximum payout of about £15m.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Tesco said its most recent pay-gap ratio reflected a remuneration policy for executive directors tied to the performance of the business. They said: “We remain committed to a competitive and fair reward package for all colleagues. Earlier this year we announced a further increase in hourly pay rates, equivalent to an investment of more than £900m over the last three years.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Mitie said its high multiple reflected a one-off award for its chief executive after the acquisition of another business, Interserve. They said: “The acquisition saved 29,000 jobs, Mitie’s revenues have more than doubled from £2.2bn to £5.1bn, and the share price has risen 125%.</p> <p>“Our colleagues have also benefited from Mitie’s strong financial performance during that time through the gifting of over £19m in free shares as well as £30m of value created for colleagues who participated in the ‘save as you earn’ scheme during that time.”</p>
