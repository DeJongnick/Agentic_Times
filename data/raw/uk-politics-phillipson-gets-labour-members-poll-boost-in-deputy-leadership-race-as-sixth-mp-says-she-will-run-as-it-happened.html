This would mean fundamentally water doesn’t come out of the taps, toilets don’t flush.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Prof Dieter Helm</strong>, economist and utilities expert at the University of Oxford, seemed sceptical at the minister’s claims. He told the Guardian: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In practice an application in itself [to the court] would trigger practically the outcome. As to what constitutes a serious breach etc, imagine trying to argue that Thames had not in fact done so … pretty difficult in practice I guess, given all the evidence of its failings.</p> <p>Finally – and this is the really important bit – if the criteria are as demanding as the minister suggests, a SAR would only be used in extremis and by then it might be very hard to guarantee the continuity of services which is the reason a SAR is deliberately ‘special’. It would be a disaster. SARs were designed to deal with failures long before the company and its performance goes over a cliff … If they can’t, then there needs to be a new Utilities Failures Act to put a proper regime in place as a matter of urgency.</p> </blockquote> <p>Ministers appear to be getting ready to place the company into SAR, and have appointed FTI Consulting as potential administrators.</p> <p><strong>Hardy</strong> confirmed the appointment, adding: “It is absolutely right that we should be prepared for everything. I don’t want to be one of those ministers that is caught on the hop so we have made sure we have got everything ready.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c010698f08f8d90f76c635" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-09T11:39:09.450Z">12.39pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Starmer tells cabinet they must see off 'those that feed off politics of grievance', in swipe at Reform UK</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In opening remarks at cabinet this morning, <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> criticised Reform UK, telling his ministers they were “up against those that feed off the politics of grievance”, and that they had a “patriotic duty” to offer an alternative programme of “national renewal”.</p> <p>He told his team:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>You are the right people to heed the patriotic call to lift up our country and take it forward to national renewal for millions of working people.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in a reference to Reform, he said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is important that we are very clear about what we’re up against.

He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Without being disrespectful to some brilliant women in London who are standing, like Emily Thornberry [whom] I’ve got a lot of respect for, I can well understand why lots of my colleagues are saying we should have a deputy leader from outside London to broaden perspectives, broaden the base.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Thornberry were to win the deputy leadership, Labour would have a leader, a deputy PM and a deputy leader who were all London MPs and lawyers.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bfd69f8f08f8842fbb4fd8" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-09T07:35:42.391Z">8.35am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Wes Streeting welcomes 'brilliant' Bridget Phillipson standing for deputy leader - but without confirming he will vote for her</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Wes Streeting</strong>, the health secretary, has welcomed Bridget Phillipson’s decison to stand for Labour deputy leader – but without confirming that he will actually vote for her.</p> <p>In an interview on the Today programme, asked if he would be voting for Phillipson, Streeting replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I haven’t decided yet. I’m delighted Bridget Phillipson has thrown her hat into the ring. She is a brilliant education secretary. We come from very similar working class backgrounds, Bridget in the north-east of England, me in east London, and she has made a big contribution to the Labour party’s success getting elected into government, and she is part of the team that is now delivering change. </p> <p>There are other candidates who I think also have that kind of background, that kind of campaigning record.</p> <p>Like other Labour MPs, I’ll be listening intently as they set out their stores this week, and then deciding who I’ll cast my nomination for.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that Phillipson was clearly the leadership candidate, and that he would be expected to vote for her, Streeting disputed that, and said “we’re not afraid of debate”.</p> <p>Asked to explain what the role of deputy leader meant, now that Keir Starmer has decoupled it from being deputy PM, Streeting replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Campaigner in chief is the job of the deputy leader, to ensure the electoral success of the Labour party at the ballot box, in order that we get permission to change communities, locally or the country in the case of general elections, or the Scottish and Welsh elections that are coming up.</p> <p>That does mean helping Labour’s appeal. It does mean making sure that we are holding our coalition of voters together, and that is the fundamental job.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bfca3e8f08de6921c7cb21" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-09T07:18:51.978Z">8.18am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Bridget Phillipson becomes first minister to enter race to become deputy Labour leader</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Good morning. Yesterday around a dozen Labour MPs were being named as potential candidates for the deputy leadership, but it is mathematically impossible for more than four of them to get the required number of nominations and quite possible that only two or three will manage it. And, with hustings scheduled for tomorrow, any serious candidates are going to have to declare today.</p> <p>This morning <strong>Bridget Phillipson</strong> has announced that she is standing. As a woman, who is not from London (she is MP for Houghton and Sunderland South) and a loyalist (she is education secretary), she has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/08/labour-deputy-leadership-election-contest-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68be8ebc8f085f50533e9bfa#block-68be8ebc8f085f50533e9bfa">all the qualities</a> mentioned by Harriet Harman yesterday as ideal for the next deputy leader.</p> <p>Here is the statement Phillipson has issued:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Today I am putting myself forward as a candidate for the deputy leadership of the Labour party, to unite our great party and deliver for working people.</p> <p>I am a proud working-class woman from the north-east. I have come from a single parent family on a tough council street, all the way to the cabinet, determined to deliver better life chances for young people growing up in our country.</p> <p>I’ve taken on powerful vested interests in the education sector – and even as they threw everything at me, I have never taken a backwards step. I will bring that same determination to every battle ahead of us.</p> <p>Because make no mistake: we are in a fight. We all know the dangers Reform poses our country.</p> <p>But not only am I ready for it: I’ve proven we can do it. I’ve shown we can beat Farage in the north-east, while staying true to the Labour party’s values of equality, fairness and social justice.</p> <p>With me as deputy leader we will beat them right across the country and unite to deliver the opportunity that working people across this great country deserve.</p> </blockquote> <p>The only other candidate to have formally declared so far is Bell Ribeiro-Addy, a leftwinger, who may struggle to get the 80 MPs nominations needed.</p> <p>As a cabinet minister, Phillipson will be seen (fairly or not) as the leadership candidate. In the current climate, that is probably not an advantage in an election open to all Labour party members, but a lot will depend on who is on the final ballot. It is hard to imagine that Phillipson won’t get the 80 names. There is less clarity about who else might be there.</p> <p>Phillipson has got an ideal platform today; she is speaking at the TUC conference in Brighton.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> Keir Starmer chairs cabinet.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Tim Davie, director general of the BBC, gives evidence to the Commons culture committee.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Kemi Badenoch gives a speech on welfare.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>Noon:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>After 12.30pm:</em> MPs debate the Diego Garcia military base and British Indian Ocean Territory bill, that implements the treaty transferring sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.</p> <p><em>Afternoon:</em> Phillipson speaks <a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/Congress2025/programme-business-congress-2025">at the TUC conference in Brighton.</a></p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm BST at the moment), or message me on social media.
