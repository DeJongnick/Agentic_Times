He said developing nations had to accept the deal though, because Cop is the only forum for them to pursue the climate action so desperately needed.</p> <p>“I think 1.5C was at the intensive care unit and it feels like that bed just broke and it fell on the floor. So we’re probably not going to be able to reach 1.5C based on this very low level of finance being provided by the developed world. That means death, that means misery, for our countries.”</p> <p>“The gavel was hit way too fast and our heart goes out to all those nations that feel like they were walked over. Developed nations always throw text at us at the last minute, shove it down our throat, and then, for the sake of multilateralism, we always have to accept it, otherwise the climate mechanisms will go into a horrible downward spiral, and no one needs that. </p> <p>This is the only space that we have to negotiate and to work towards our common goals.

The commitment from developed countries of $300bn per year by 2035 primarily from bilateral and multilateral sources of public finance is an important advance on current levels, but falls short significantly of the at least $390bn a year by 2035 which our work shows would be required to deliver the goals of the Paris agreement.</p> <p>“It is important that work starts immediately on the urgency of delivery, the quality of and access to finance, and reducing the cost of capital. Therefore we welcome the emphasis in the agreement on the new goal on delivery, monitoring and transparency. It is crucial to work together to begin ramping up financial support from all sources immediately to assist developing countries in making stronger pledges for action.”</p> <p><strong>Mary Robinson</strong>, the former UN envoy and senior climate figure said: “Cop29 in Baku has been one of the most difficult Cops I can remember. It came very close to failure and it has ended with a disappointing deal. But it is a deal the world can build on in 2025. </p> <p>“The $300bn per year committed by 2035 by rich countries at Cop29 falls $90bn short of the amount needed to implement the Paris agreement. This is nowhere near enough to support developing countries. But the intention in the deal to generate at least $1.3tn from a wider range of sources is right. This is an investment, not a handout.</p> <p>“Cop29 was weak in transitioning away from fossil fuels. Oil-rich countries must see that their efforts to delay the inevitable will fail.

On the key issues like climate finance and the transition away from fossil fuels, this is — yet again — the bare minimum.</p> <p>We cannot continue to rely on last-minute half measures. Leaders today shirk their responsibility by focusing on long-term, aspirational goals that extend far beyond their own terms in office. To meet the challenge of our time, we need real action at the scale of months and years, not decades and quarter-centuries. </p> <p>This experience in Baku illuminates deeper flaws in the Cop process, including the outsized influence of fossil fuel interests that has hobbled this process since its inception. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been particularly obstructive. Putting the future of humanity at severe risk in order to make more money is truly disgraceful behaviour. Reforming this process so that the polluters are not in effective control must be a priority.</p> <p>On climate finance, our primary task in the coming years must be to not only fulfil and build upon the financial commitments agreed to at Cop29, but to unleash even larger flows of affordable and fair private capital for developing countries.</p> <p>Ultimately, coming out of Cop29, we must transform disappointment into determination. We can solve the climate crisis.

We are living in a time of truly challenging geopolitics so seeing a deal truly is exceptional.”</p> <p>“In my view, Cop29 will be remembered as a start of a new era for climate finance and we have worked hard with all of you to ensure that there is significantly more money on the table.

Kicking the deadline to 2035 adds insult to the injury of a paltry $300bn, a fraction of the trillions needed.

It’s a deal that will drive forward the clean energy transition which is essential for jobs and growth in Britain and for protecting us all against the worsening climate crisis.</p> <p>“The new finance goal rightly reflects the importance of going beyond traditional donors like Britain, and the role of countries like China in helping those on the frontline of this crisis. If this finance is used in the right way, it could cut the equivalent emissions of one billion cars and could protect nearly a billion people from the impacts of climate change.</p> <p>Today’s agreement sends the signal that the clean energy transition is unstoppable. It is the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century and through our championing of it we can help crowd in private investment. </p> <p>There is much more work to do if we are to keep 1.5C within reach and prevent climate catastrophe. We’ve pushed for ambition in Baku and have restored the UK back to a position of global climate leadership.

It’s an indication they should be favoured. We’ll know soon how they react.</p></li> <li><p>The text says developed countries will be “taking the lead”. Others will have their voluntary efforts recognised.</p></li> <li><p>The broader $1.3tn goal remains in. It calls on “all actors” to work together to scale up at least $1.3tn in funding from public and private sources by 2035.</p></li> <li><p>On the thorny question of the role of the major emerging economies who were not considered developed when climate summits began in the 1990s - including China, India, Saudi Arabia and other gulf states - it says “encourages developing countries to make contributions on a voluntary basis”.</p></li> <li><p>The text recognises that parties can count “climate-related outflows” and “climate-related finance” mobilised by multilateral development banks towards achievement of the $300bn goal.

It will also put a huge amount of pressure on Brazil and their Presidency of COP30 next year. Governments will need to submit ambitious NDCs and show how they can really deliver.

The time for any more backsliding has passed.</p> <p>“The suggestion that “decarbonising” the extraction and processing of fossil fuels will solve climate change is essentially a myth. Fossil fuels must be phased out to meet our climate goals. Action on operational oil and gas emissions – especially methane - is also critical. Yet current corporate targets have significant shortcomings, and thus underestimate the impact of corporates’ activities: generally they do not fully reflect methane’s role in driving short term warming and almost universally exclude emissions from non-operated assets in which companies have an equity stake.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6742092d8f08849211a433c0" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/patrick-greenfield"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-23T17:00:14.346Z">5.00pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Our colleagues in Baku are reporting that the current events in the plenary are pretty surreal and reflect the state of negotiations here in Baku.

Whatever finance is provided by the rich world must be regarded in light of that ongoing effort, according to the UN”s development chief.</p> <p>Campaigners have repeatedly reminded delegates here that what developing countries are seeking is not charity. Developed countries caused the climate crisis through their burning of fossil fuels, and developing countries are now spending billions every year on boosting renewable energy, reshaping their economies, and trying to adapt their infrastructure to the impacts of extreme weather. </p> <p>According to the International High Level Expert Group on climate finance, made up of leading economists, by 2030 developing countries excluding China can be expected to spend about $1.4 trillion a year from their own budgets on climate-related activities.</p> <p>I caught up with Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, earlier in these talks, ahead of the current wrangles over texts at Cop29. “Developing countries are actually investing hundreds of billions of dollars a year already from their own taxpayers’ revenue, in climate action. It wouldn’t hurt or harm anyone on the other side of the table to acknowledge that. Because it kind of creates a more level playing field, and we get away from the zero sum game psychology.”</p>    <p>The figures involved might seem large, but are not in terms of the total global economy, he added.</p> <p>“The $1.3 trillion [that is the figure representing the total finance flows to developing countries from the rich world by 2035, likely to be agreed at Cop29] is not an irrational order of magnitude, when looking at climate finance,” he said. “It’s not something that’s out of this world. It would allow a world of 8bn people to accelerate and raise their levels of ambition in decarbonising their economies.”</p> <p>The money would not all be coming from developed country taxpayers, he added. “China, India and the emerging economies are essentially financing their climate transitions out of their own resources, their taxpayers’ money plus significant private sector and capital market investments. We need to help the public understand that this is not talking about $1.3 trillion of taxpayers’ money from the Global North, being syphoned out and invested in the developing countries or the Global South.”</p>    <p>Money from public financial institutions in the developed world that goes towards climate finance would also help to “mobilise” large amounts of private sector investment, he added. “It is guaranteed to have a remarkable multiplier function in terms of additional capital that will mobilise to make these transitions happen. And again, this is not imagined. We already have a decade behind us where we have invested trillions in renewable energy infrastructure and expansion of clean energy production, that in significant parts was financed by the private sector, by enterprise, by investors, by capital markets.”</p> <p>More money was also needed on adaptation, Steiner said. “Adaptation is essentially a tax on development. They have to spend money to stay in the same place because they can’t invest in expanding the infrastructure, education, digitalisation, because they’re essentially having to protect their current development assets from either destruction or even having to invest in earlier recovery and reconstruction. Take Pakistan; one flood event cost $30bn, probably much more even if you take the cumulative damage.”</p> <p>He also warned against too much private finance being provided in the form of loans that could push countries deeper into debt. “These are debts that are in a sense being accumulated on top of an already unsustainable debt in many of these economies. And that’s why we need to push as hard as possible, that for those countries, if you want them to pivot forward, that a significant amount of that funding and financing is actually more than just concessional. It should be grant based or close to being the equivalent of grant based financing.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-11-23T14:52:26.408Z">at 2.52pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6741e1688f087ff7bcc43f6b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-23T14:13:01.711Z">2.13pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">'We are still taking part in the process' say AOSIS</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Fiona Harvey</strong> and <strong>Patrick Greenfield</strong></p> <p>The Alliance of Small Island States has just sent out a statement saying that they are still taking part in the process.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Let me make it clear that the Alliance of Small Island States remains committed to this process and are here in the spirit of good faith in multilateralism to secure the best deal that will protect not just us, but the world from the worst impacts of climate change.</p> <p>“We have presently removed ourselves from the stalled NCQG discussions, which were not offering a progressive way forward.

Anything lower than that will not help the world tackle climate change.”</p> <p>The Guardian understands many donor countries do not have a mandate to go above $300bn for the climate finance target. Lots of developing countries are pushing for far more. The G77 and China are pushing for at least $500bn, according to one source.</p> <p>Susana Muhamad, Colombia’s environment minister, said: “The text is still not very clear.

For instance, helping people in poor countries to use solar cookstoves can reduce their dependence on firewood – which cuts emissions and helps keeps forests standing.</p> <p>I spoke to Eamon Ryan, the Irish environment minister who is co-chair of the adaptation work here at Cop29, ahead of the draft texts which are now being argued over.</p> <p>“As we can already see, devastating climate change is coming, even if we stop emissions tomorrow,” he said. “So we need to prepare. And we need to do that particularly in developing countries, because they are the ones being hit most and they are least able to prepare. Many of them also have very small emissions.”</p> <p>Adaptation had often been an afterthought at Cops, he added. “This whole process has tended to focus on emissions, rightly in some ways, but hasn’t put adaptation centre stage.”</p> <p>The most vulnerable countries are most in need of finance for adaptation, but most climate finance has gone towards middle income countries or those already able to adapt.</p> <p>Adaptation is not one of the most controversial issues at Cop, as most countries agree it should have more focus. The issue of “transformational adaptation” has also caught people’s imagination, Ryan said. “It’s a more radical, a more systemic approach,” he said. “We need to progress that. We need to ensure that is now worked on. I think it’s going to be quite big in future.”</p> <p>He said it was important for Cop29 to recognise the vital role of adaptation in tackling the climate crisis. “Our job is to make sure we keep it centre stage,” he said.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-11-23T11:05:48.401Z">at 11.05am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6741b1938f086501868e8083" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-23T10:46:33.250Z">10.46am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Patience appears to be wearing thin in the final stages of negotiations.

Finance that is provided comes from developed country governments or publicly funded institutions in the form preferably of grants, and highly concessional loans – loans at very low rates of interest.</p> <p>Finance that is mobilised can include private sector co-investing with governments.</p> <p>So the EU provides about $30bn of climate finance every year – but it mobilises a further $7bn through private sector co-investing.</p> <p>Poor countries, quite reasonably, want their climate finance in the form of grants, to avoid getting further into debt. But some countries are deeply reluctant to provide money in this way. France, for instance, through its AFD (Agence Francaise de Developpement) historically provides nearly all its climate finance in the form of loans.</p> <p>The reasoning behind this is that it gives recipient countries more incentive to spend the money in the most efficient way, and gives the providing country some form of accountability over how the money is spent. (It is also treated differently in the developed country’s own budgets and accounting.) The big downside is that it counts towards debt for developing countries, which is why many rich countries are more willing to talk about grants, and deals such as “debt for climate swaps”.</p> <p>It’s also important to note that the habit of preferring loans is not confined to developed countries – China also provides most of its “south-south” cooperation in the form of loans, on which developing countries are currently paying more than $300bn a year in interest alone.</p> <p>At Cops, there are no hard and fast definitions of climate finance. That is partly in order to give both donors and recipients some degree of flexibility. It is also because there is little agreement on what such a definition should be. If climate finance had to be defined, several participants told the Guardian, this Cop would have to go on for months longer rather than (hopefully) mere hours.</p> <p>What definitions there are go back to the 1992 UNFCCC, the Paris agreement of 2015, and decisions of various Cops in between.</p> <p>For instance, article 11 of the UNFCCC states: “A mechanism for the provision of financial resources on a grant or concessional basis, including for the transfer of technology, is hereby defined. It shall function under the guidance of and be accountable to the Conference of the Parties, which shall decide on its policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria related to this Convention. Its operation shall be entrusted to one or more existing international entities.”</p> <p>And in the Cancun accords of 2010, paragraph 98 states: “Recognises that developed country Parties commit, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation, to a goal of mobilizing jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries; 99. Agrees that, in accordance with paragraph 1(e) of the Bali Action Plan, funds provided to developing country Parties may come from a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources; from Decision 1/CP.16.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6741a5388f087ff7bcc43dc4" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/damiancarrington"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-23T09:59:58.623Z">9.59am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Social media boosters for Azerbaijan’s authoritarian regime are working the weekend, praising President Ilham Aliyev for his “strong political will” which “played a decisive role in our success today”.</p>    <p>That will confuse the delegates at Cop29, who remain a long way from any success, and who also remember Aliyev’s extraordinarily undiplomatic statements at the start of the summit.

This makes a massive difference to the scale of finance being discussed.</p> <p>In 2009, developed countries agreed that by 2020, they would collectively mobilize $100bn per year to support developing countries’ decarbonization and adaptation plans. <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/">US dollar inflation was 20.6% </a>in this time period.</p> <p>But when monitoring contributions, inflation was not taken into account, the OECD confirmed to the Guardian. As a result, the target became easier to meet over time, though countries met it late.</p> <p>The Cop29 draft texts released on Friday set a new proposed finance goal: $250bn by 2035. But they will not rise over time to keep pace with inflation.</p> <p>This has a very big impact on numbers, as the analysis shows below.</p> <p>$100bn in 2009 dollars would equal $145.3bn today if we adjust for US inflation in this time period.</p> <p>Returning to the proposed $250bn target, that becomes $345bn if we assume the average annual inflation rate of the US of 2.38% over the last 15 years, according to a back-of-the-napkin calculation from my colleague Patrick Greenfield.</p> <p>“Agreeing a figure of $250 billion mobilised per year by 2035 would not only be inadequate but shameful. Adjusted for inflation, it represents virtually no increase in public finance from developed countries beyond the $100 billion commitment made 15 years ago,” Salomé Lehtman, project and advocacy advisor at Mercy Corps, said.</p> <p>And $390bn annually – the number <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/19/it-is-feasible-climate-finance-wont-burden-rich-countries-say-economists">proposed</a> in a study by top academics as fair and in line with the Paris agreement – would in 2035 be $538bn in today’s money, assuming the same rate of inflation.</p> <p>“Targets will need to adjust for inflation over time,” Amar Bhattacharya, the executive secretary of the UN’s independent high-level expert group on climate finance and co-author of the study, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Put another way, the proposed $250bn target for 2035 is really a $197.6bn target, assuming the same inflation rate. This means the target is not even a doubling.</p> <p>“The proposed climate finance goal in the latest text is an embarrassment,” said Collin Rees, a manager at the climate justice NGO Oil Change International, who shared calculations from the IMF with the Guardian.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-674197138f087ff7bcc43d83" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/dharna-noor"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-23T09:06:51.664Z">9.06am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>As we await new Cop29 draft texts on Saturday morning, I chatted to Thoriq Ibrahim, climate, energy and environment minister for the Maldives, who is leading negotiations for the small island nation.</p> <p>Yesterday’s drafts were “totally unacceptable,” he said.</p> <p>The $250bn goal put forth for climate finance was “absolutely not at all adequate,” he said, and “barely an improvement” on the $100bn goal set in 2009.</p> <p>“If you look at the $250 billion with inflation, it’s almost same goal,” he said. </p> <p>Rich countries have privately agreed to up the goal to $300bn, the Guardian learned this morning.</p> <p>The minister said he could not comment on whether that figure would be acceptable until it is officially on the table.</p> <p>But the number is not the only concern for vulnerable countries, he said.

She says Cop29 is failing and it “up to us as a global collective to take the action we so desperately need”.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>As the COP29 climate meeting is reaching its end, it should not come as a surprise that yet another COP is failing. The current draft is a complete disaster. But even if our expectations are close to non-existent, we must never ever find ourselves reacting to these continuous betrayals with anything but rage.</p> <p>The people in power are yet again about to agree to a death sentence to the countless people whose lives have been or will be ruined by the climate crisis. The current text is full of false solutions and empty promises. The money from the Global North countries needed to pay back their climate debt is still nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>Those in power are worsening the destabilisation and destruction of our life supporting ecosystems. We are on track to experience the hottest year ever recorded, with the global greenhouse gases reaching an all time high just last year.</p> <p>The COP processes aren’t just failing us, they are part of a larger system built on injustice and designed to sacrifice current and future generations for the opportunity of a few to keep making unimaginable profits and continue to exploit planet and people.</p> <p>With every negotiation, with every speech made by a world leader and with every agreement they sign, it becomes clear that it is up to us as a global collective to take the action we so desperately need and show where the leadership truly lies. They are not going to do it for us, as this COP29 yet again proves.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-11-23T07:29:31.031Z">at 7.29am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67417caf8f087ff7bcc43cfd" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/patrick-greenfield"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-23T07:02:57.131Z">7.02am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>As we wait for signs of movement in the negotiations, the conference centre is a ghost town this morning. Gone are the crowds of delegates and rammed food halls. The organisers are busy dismantling pavilions and the network of tents built around the Olympics stadium here in Baku. Competition for food, water and toilet roll is a growing issue. </p> <p>This morning, the New York Times ran a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nytimes.com/post/3lbltgws46s2c">story</a> about Singapore beer made from recycled toilet water on offer at Cop29. In a few hours, maybe that will start to seem appealing. Air conditioning units have been turned up to 30C in some areas, literally turning the heat up for negotiators.</p> <p>Everything about the venue is telling those that remain to get on with it, reach a deal and leave.

Behind the scenes, a diplomatic effort is underway to increase the offering from rich nations to make sure the deal survives.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that the UN secretary general is ringing round capitals to push for a higher figure. The EU is among those open to $300bn but Japan, Switzerland and New Zealand do not want to raise the offer, it is understood. Let’s see who budges, if anyone.</p> <p>Among donor countries, there is anxiety about what Donald Trump’s return to the US presidency will mean for climate finance, and they do not want to overcommit to a figure they cannot deliver. This, combined with the potential of right wing governments in France, Germany, Canada and elsewhere, means that things are in the balance in Baku.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-11-23T06:24:59.832Z">at 6.24am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67405d3f8f08849211a42484" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-23T06:07:29.254Z">6.07am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Cop29 climate conference, I’m Ajit Niranjan.
