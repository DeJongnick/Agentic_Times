<p>Arnoldo Chile, 33, drives his old Toyota pickup truck through the orchards that stretch across the slopes of the mountains surrounding the Guatemalan community of El Rejón in Sumpango, about 45 minutes from <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/65/">Antigua Guatemala</a>, one of the country’s leading tourist destinations. People in this small village in the Sacatepéquez department rely almost entirely on agriculture as their primary source of income.</p>    <p>However, most struggle to make a living, leading to poverty and social exclusion. Facing these challenges, several of Chile’s neighbours have emigrated illegally to the US, hoping to make enough money to support their families.</p> <p>His case, however, is different. Thanks to the circular migration programme by the <a href="https://cuatropinos.com.gt/">Cuarto Pinos</a> agricultural co-operative and the <a href="https://fundacionjuanfrancisco.org/">Juan Francisco García Foundation</a>, he obtained an <a href="https://gt.usembassy.gov/information-for-h-2-applicants-and-u-s-petitioners/">H-2A visa</a> that allows him to work in agriculture in the US for several months each year.</p> <p>“At first, I was a bit sceptical that this project could work; I thought it might be a scam like others that have happened in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guatemala">Guatemala</a> before. But since my first time in 2016, I’ve been to the US several times under this programme,” says Chile.</p> <p>He harvested broccoli, cabbage and lettuce in the early years, eventually being promoted to row boss, assisting the supervisor. “I earned $19 (£14.50) an hour and made about $3,500 (£2,700) a month, while here in Guatemala, I could only earn about $450 (£340) a month,” he says.</p> <p>Using his earnings, Chile bought a small plot of land near his village, El Rejón, and now provides work for several family members, primarily in blackberry production.</p>    <p>As migration across the US-Mexico border hit its <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/border-crossings-us-mexico-border-june-2024/">lowest level in three years</a> in the first few months of 2024, driven by the Joe Biden administration’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/04/biden-us-mexico-border-asylum-seekers">strict enforcement policy</a>, the humanitarian costs of crossing are mounting. People arriving from South and Central America stranded in Mexico <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/03/record-half-million-people-crossed-darien-gap-2023">are facing increasing dangers</a>, and reports of deaths at the border are on the rise.</p> <p>In this context, Guatemala’s circular migration offers legal, safer pathways for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/21/guatemala-remittances-15bn-buoy-up-economy">workers to make a living in the US</a> and support their home communities – surely a better alternative to the migration crisis in the Americas.</p> <p>An estimated <a href="https://crisisresponse.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl1481/files/appeal/documents/Estrategia%20OIM%20Guatemala%20EN%202023%20%281%29.pdf">2.9 million Guatemalans live outside their country</a>, mainly in the US. According to Úrsula Roldán, who has a PhD in geography and is the director of the <a href="https://cparens.url.edu.gt/facultades_unidades/instituto-de-investigacion-en-ciencias-socio-humanistas-icesh/">Institute of Socio-Humanistic Sciences at Rafael Landívar University</a>, they usually migrate to escape low incomes, poverty and the risk of social exclusion in a country where the state often fails to meet their needs for education, health and other basic public services.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>The communities have seen improvements as migrants have bought more land and increased their vegetable production</p> <footer> <cite>Vanessa García, Cuatro Pinos co-operative</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another reason, she says, is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/chain-migration">chain migration</a>, when individuals already established in the US call for their relatives to join them. “With the climate crisis, the country has been facing floods and droughts that further worsen this situation. This results in crop failures, leaving rural families in even more dire conditions in Guatemala,” Roldán adds.</p> <p>The results of circular immigration leave scholars such as Roldán in little doubt about its efficiency. The immediate families of regular migrants who participate in these programmes receive <a href="https://accioncontraelhambre.org.gt/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Impact-of-regular-temporary-migration-to-Canada-and-the-U.S.-FINAL-INFORM-2023.pdf">better education and healthcare access</a>, which is crucial in avoiding social exclusion.</p>    <p>“This project was created in response to a combination of economic, social and environmental factors affecting rural families in our country,” says Vanessa García, the head of social responsibility at Cuatro Pinos. “Many families seek better job opportunities, and remittances sent by migrants have become a crucial source of income, motivating many to migrate irregularly.”</p> <p><a href="https://accioncontraelhambre.org.gt/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Impact-of-regular-temporary-migration-to-Canada-and-the-U.S.-FINAL-INFORM-2023.pdf">Different studies</a> suggest that over the years, gender roles tend to shift within families with regular migrants, showing a greater <a href="https://www.iom.int/sites/g/files/tmzbdl486/files/about-iom/gender/Migration-in-the-2030-Agenda-SDGs-Achieving-Gender-Equality-through-Migration-Governance.pdf">focus on gender equity</a> and a gradual empowerment of women, those who migrated and those who remained in the home country managing the family income.</p> <p>“The communities have seen improvements in development as migrants have bought more land and increased their vegetable production for export, providing jobs for women and men in their communities,” says García.</p>    <p>“There have also been improvements in housing, education, and the nutrition of their children, which is essential. Some families have also started businesses within the community,” she adds.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Elsewhere in El Rejón, Juan Francisco Yucute, 32, reviews the accounts of the small store he managed to open with his wife, thanks to the money he made working in the US under the circular migration programme, where he earned about $12 (£9) an hour. He participated in the scheme on four occasions, and was away for four to five months each time.</p>    <p>He is has left the programme, as the company he worked for in Arizona no longer needed him. However, the money he saved allowed him to start his small business and build two adjacent premises he now rents to neighbours.</p> <p>“My wife and I used to work in the fields before I went to the US, just like most people in our community,” says Yucute, who thought about going to the US illegally until he heard about the circular migration scheme. “My idea of opening the store was so that she and my daughters could have a less strenuous job than agriculture, where you have to spend hours under the sun and rain, and in a village where the roads to the fields are dangerous.”</p> <p><a href="https://accioncontraelhambre.org.gt/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GT-Gobierno-y-reclutadoras_Jul-2023.pdf">According to a report</a>, the expenses for circular migration typically range between $500 (£382) and $1,000 (£765), covering administrative costs, travel and other fees. This is significantly less than <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/hsi/news/2024/08/23/major-enforcement-operation-guatemala-city-secures-arrest-human-smuggler">the $12,000 (£9,200) to $15,000 (£11,500)</a> demanded by smugglers for irregular entry into the US, a method that does not always guarantee success.</p> <p>“For migrants, using coyotes [people smugglers] is an alternative route to reach the US. We know that US anti-immigration policies have tightened border controls, which has increased the risks posed by drug trafficking and organised crime along the migration route, making circular migration a viable option,” says Roldán.</p>    <p>The process to obtain a temporary work visa in the US is complex. It can take up to 120 days, as the <a href="https://www.dol.gov/">Department of Labor</a> requests <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent">certification</a> to justify hiring foreign workers where there is no local workforce. If no local candidates are found for the position, the employer can apply for a visa for foreign workers and often starts international recruitment with the help of specialised agencies.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/feb/28/when-have-we-ever-had-democracy-is-thelma-cabrera-guatemalas-most-surprising-politician">‘When have we ever had democracy?’: is Thelma Cabrera Guatemala’s most surprising politician?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite increasing numbers of Guatemalans seeking H-2A and <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2b-temporary-non-agricultural-workers">H-2B visas</a> to take part in circular migration programmes, <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/news/causes-migration-guatemala">irregular migration continues to prevail</a>.

She choose to stay in their village of San José Yalú, near Sumpango, where she now runs the bakery they started together two years ago. Since then, her business has thrived. Not only has she succeeded, but she has also employed some of her relatives and several local young people.</p> <p>“I know many people from here who went to the US illegally. As for me, I never wanted to leave because I have this business that I need to oversee and manage,” says Canel. “I’ve been able to sustain and expand the business and offer employment to five or six people. I hope we can continue to create jobs in Guatemala.”</p>
