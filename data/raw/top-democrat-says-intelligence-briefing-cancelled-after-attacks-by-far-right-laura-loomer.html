<p>Senator Mark Warner said on Wednesday that a meeting he had scheduled at the headquarters of a US intelligence agency was cancelled following online attacks by the far-right activist and conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer.</p> <p>Warner, the Democratic vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, was set to visit the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in Virginia in what he described part of his “responsibility to provide oversight and support to our intelligence community”.</p> <p>The administration rescinded the invitation after Loomer initiated a “campaign of baseless attacks” against him and the agency’s director, Trey Whitworth, he said.</p> <p>“I can’t overstate how unprecedented and dangerous this is,” Warner said in a fundraising email. “This administration is taking its marching orders from Laura Loomer – a wackjob with a long history of outlandish fringe views, including 9/11 denialism, anti-Muslim harassment campaigns, and associations with white supremacists.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/republicans-capitol-january-6-attack">House Republicans approve new panel to ‘uncover all the facts’ of January 6 attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Loomer posted on social media in recent days complaining that the director of an intelligence agency was hosting a “rabid ANTI-TRUMP DEMOCRAT SENATOR”. She celebrated the cancellation, calling Warner a threat to national security and arguing he should be removed from the Senate committee.</p> <p>“He weaponized our intelligence agencies to push the debunked Russia Collusion Hoax,” she wrote.</p> <p>She told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/03/us/politics/senator-warner-laura-loomer.html?">New York Times</a> Warner should “be removed from office and tried for treason”.</p> <p>Warner told reporters that the decision to cancel the previously unpublicized meeting was made by the office of the defense secretary.</p> <p>The incident illustrates Loomer’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/06/laura-loomer-donald-trump-maga-influencer">enduring influence</a> within Donald Trump’s administration. The 32-year-old, who has previously described herself as “a proud Islamophobe”, has acted as a national security and foreign policy adviser to the president. In April, Trump fired six staffers after Loomer gave him a list of people she believed were not sufficiently loyal to the president.</p> <p>Last month, the administration announced it was planning to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/gaza-children-visas-medical-care-laura-loomer">stop issuing visas</a> to children from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> seeking medical care after complaints from Loomer.</p> <p>Warner argued that Loomer is “basically a cabinet member at this point” and that Trump and his administration were “caving to whatever she wants”.</p> <p>“This nakedly political decision undermines the dedicated, nonpartisan staff at [the] NGA and threatens the principle of civilian oversight that protects our national security,” Warner said in a statement.</p> <p>“Members of Congress routinely conduct meetings and on-site engagements with federal employees in their states and districts; blocking and setting arbitrary conditions on these sessions sets a dangerous precedent, calling into question whether oversight is now allowed only when it pleases the far-right fringe.”</p>
