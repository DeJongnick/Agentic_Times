Badosa, though, larrups a forehand close to the baseline and when the riposte falls long, she unleashes, perhaps too soon, because after a big serve allows her to clean up, she thwacks straight at her opponent … but Osaka doesn’t move her feet, so can’t get around the ball to control a shot that only needs to arrive into court. That’s a big missed opportunity, though as we go from deuce to advantage, she’s still in the game. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-683472188f08fb88c85e525d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-26T13:53:43.150Z">2.53pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Collins leads 5-3 in the second </strong>and though Burrage has given a good account of herself, like Harriet Dart, she lacks a definitive weapon on which to rely when things get tight.</p> <p>Meantime, Altmaier has taken the third set to leasd Frtiz 7-6 3-6 6-3; following them on Mathieu we’ve got Monnet v Boulter.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-05-26T13:55:08.249Z">at 2.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6834719d8f088f648d3c13f1" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-26T13:50:52.054Z">2.50pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Back on Chatrier, Badosa breaks back immediately; </strong>we’re 2-2 in the fifth, and this is brewing into an epic. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6834710d8f088f648d3c13e2" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-26T13:50:18.242Z">2.50pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Like Cam Norrie,</strong> Fearnley is a classic example of a late developer who gets much better than anyone expected.
