So Donald Trump is a hero in this.”</p> <p>Then on Thursday, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, made the same claim in <a href="https://x.com/mkraju/status/1963640592514081026">an interview</a> with Manu Raju of CNN. </p> <p>When the reporter said that Trump had called the effort to release the Epstein files “a hoax”, Johnson replied: “He’s not saying that what Epstein did is a hoax. It’s a terrible, unspeakable evil. He believes that himself. When he first heard the rumor, he kicked him out of Mar-a-Lago. He was an FBI informant to try to take this stuff down.”</p> <p>As the conspiracy theory expert Mike Rothschild noted: “This has been a supposition among QAnon believers for years.

That prompted the Fox national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin to observe that there was no apparent reason that stealth fighter jets were needed for a counternarcotics mission. </p> <p>“The F35s being sent to Puerto Rico are usually used for large bombing missions like the targeting of Iran’s nuclear facilities- a 5th generation supersonic fighter jet known for its lethality”, Griffin <a href="https://x.com/JenGriffinFNC/status/1964001832172179733">wrote on X</a>. “It looks to me like the US military is going to war.”</p> <p>Later on Friday, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/05/politics/trump-weighs-strikes-targeting-cartels-inside-venezuela">CNN reported</a> that Trump “is weighing options for carrying out military strikes targeting drug cartels operating inside Venezuela, including possible strikes within the country”.</p> <p>Such strikes would be an escalation from deadly attack on a boat from Venezuela in the Caribbean, which killed 11 people the administration suspected on smuggling drugs bound for the US.</p> <p>During Trump’s first term in office, according to his defense secretary, Mark Esper, the president asked him on at least two occasions if the US military could “shoot missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs.”</p> <p>Esper recounted the requests in his memoir, and wrote that when he objected, Trump suggested that “no one would know it was us” if the US fired “some Patriot missiles” and he would just deny that the US had carried out the strikes.</p> <p>In 2019, when Trump reportedly considered forcing its president, Nicolás Maduro, from office, a Democratic congresswoman opposed to what she called “regime change wars” objected very strongly. “The United States needs to stay out of Venezuela”, <a href="https://x.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1088531713649713153">Tulsi Gabbard wrote</a> at the time. “Let the Venezuelan people determine their future.

He then claimed, incorrectly, that he had seen video evidence of “the destruction of the city”.</p> <p>In fact, a handful of protesters have demonstrated outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in a remote area of Portland along the south waterfront this year, but the scale of the protests, which attract dozens at most, is nothing like the 2020 protests that regularly drew thousands or tens of thousands of demonstrators to a central part of the city.</p> <p>“Are you going into Portland?” a reporter asked Trump.</p> <p>“Well, I’m going to look at it now because I didn’t know that was still going on; this has been going on for years,” the president replied. He then explained how he had been misled into the entirely false belief that the large-scale protests from 2020 had continued.</p> <p>“We’ll be able to stop that very easily, but that was not on my list, Portland, but when I watched television last night, this has been going on,” Trump said.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dTSbtfXwDg"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_dTSbtfXwDg?start=1&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Donald Trump threatened to invade Portland, Oregon during an Oval Office event on Friday.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The president did not cite the specific news report that he was basing his impression on, but his favorite channel, Fox News, broadcast <a href="https://x.com/KatieDaviscourt/status/1963819280249807236">a report</a> on Thursday that mixed images of a recent protest in Portland, attended by dozens of protesters, with <a href="https://x.com/PDXzane/status/1284726088187310080">a viral video clip</a> from 2020 of one protester, Christopher David, being pepper-sprayed in the face by a federal agent that was wrongly described as having been shot in June of this year.</p> <p>The report focused mainly on one protest outside the facility on Tuesday, attended by dozens of protesters who brought a guillotine as a prop before being doused with chemical agents by federal officers.</p>    <p>“These are paid terrorists,” the president said, once again spreading <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/06/04/white-house-forced-retract-claim-viral-videos-prove-antifa-plotting-violence/">a baseless conspiracy theory</a> his administration amplified about anti-fascist protesters in 2020.</p> <p>“These are paid agitators, these are professional. I watched that last night, I’m very good at this stuff. These are paid agitators, they get paid money by radical left groups,” the president claimed. He then went on to suggest that well-printed signs displayed by some protesters proved his theory.</p> <p>“These are paid agitators and they’re very dangerous for our country and when we go there, if we go to Portland, we’re going to wipe ‘em out. They’re going to be gone. They won’t even stand to fight. They will not stay there. They’ve ruined that city.”</p> <p>“It’s like living in hell,” the president said, describing an imaginary version of Portland that bears no resemblance to the actual city, in which fences around the federal courthouse that was the scene of mass protests in 2020 have now been removed and the central police headquarters no longer has boarded up windows.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-05T23:39:33.879Z">at 12.39am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68bb58d68f08638a14b785fb" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-05T21:56:59.094Z">10.56pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump says US must be 'very careful' in removing mandates for 'vaccines that are so amazing'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Asked about Florida’s move to lift mandates on vaccinations for schoolchildren, Donald Trump said that officials have to “be careful” in removing access to vaccines he described as “amazing” and “incredible”.</p> <p>“I think we have to be very careful” Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. “Look, you have some vaccines that are so amazing. The polio vaccine, I happen to think, is amazing. A lot of people think that Covid is amazing. You know, there are many people that believe strongly in that.

The president then quickly moved to downplay concerns that he was using his office for personal profit, claiming that “we will not make any money on it” and that the location was chosen because “everybody wants it there”.</p> <p>The president was asked if he intends to invite Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to attend as an observer. He initially said that he had not yet considered that possibility, but has previously claimed that excluding Russia, over its initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014, was a mistake.</p> <p>Minutes later, Trump was asked again and said that both Putin and China’s leader, Xi Jinping, were welcome to attend as observers. “I’d love them to, if they want to”, the president said. “If they want to, we can certainly talk”.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-05T21:39:40.716Z">at 10.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68bb533d8f085f50533e8a59" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-05T21:18:38.053Z">10.18pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Eric Adams</strong>, the mayor of New York, just announced that he will not end his re-election campaign, despite reports that he was recently offered a position in the Trump administration if he would do so.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-05T21:25:59.120Z">at 10.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68bb49ef8f087e152e27f78b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-05T21:04:42.270Z">10.04pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump claims 'a lot of illegal aliens' worked at raided Georgia plant, but warrant targeted just four</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Donald Trump just claimed that “a lot of illegal aliens, some not the best of people” were working at a factory in Georgia raided by immigration officers on Friday, resulting in nearly 500 arrests.</p> <p>However, a warrant for the raid on the HL-GA battery factory, which is being built to make car batteries for South Korean electric vehicles, identified just four “target persons”.
