The number of UASs fluctuated and they ranged in size [and] configuration.</p> <p>“The UASs were actively monitored and installation leaders determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents or critical infrastructure.</p> <p>“To protect operational security, we do not discuss our specific force protection measures but retain the right to protect the installation. We continue to monitor our airspace and are working with host-nation authorities and mission partners to ensure the safety of base personnel, facilities and assets.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the British Ministry of Defence said: “We take threats seriously and maintain robust measures at defence sites. This includes counter-drone security capabilities.</p> <p>“We won’t comment further on security procedures.”</p>
