<h2>Saturday</h2> <p>10am (all times BST)</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Women’s Euro 2025</p>  <p>Join us on Saturday morning for all the follow-up from Spain 2 Switzerland 0 and the buildup to the final quarter-final, between France and Germany in Basel. And of course, the news from the England camp. After their A-B-B-A 2-2 draw with Sweden (<strong>A</strong>sllani, <strong>B</strong>lackstenius, <strong>B</strong>ronze, <strong>A</strong>gyemang) and penalty shootout, will it be another late finish and a case of Nessun Dorma against Italy in Tuesday’s semi-final? Back in England, it’s a busy transfer window for the women and the men, and Thomas Frank has his first match in charge of Tottenham, a 3pm friendly at Reading.

Was the run of tour victories that followed the defeat by Argentina in Dublin genuine, or were the opposition too far beneath Test quality? Four years on from the Covid-imposed silence in South Africa, the atmosphere in Brisbane will be electric, and <strong>Robert Kitson</strong>, <strong>Gerard Meagher</strong> and <strong>Jack Snape</strong> will be reporting from Suncorp Stadium, after <strong>Lee Calvert</strong> guides you through the match with his minute-by-minute report.</p>   <p>11am</p> <p>England v India second women’s ODI</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p>After losing the T20 series 3-2 – and only scraping home in the dead rubber – England were beaten by four wickets with 10 balls to spare in Thursday’s first ODI, with Deepti Sharma guiding India home at the Rose Bowl with an unbeaten 62. However, a failure to review an lbw shout when she had 40 cost the home side dear. On to Lord’s, where the new regime of Charlotte Edwards as coach and Nat Sciver-Brunt as captain need a win as they prepare for the autumn’s World Cup, against that tournament’s hosts. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> and <strong>Tanya Aldred</strong> are on over-by-over duty, while <strong>Raf Nicholson</strong> will be reporting from St John’s Wood.</p> <p>Noon</p> <p>Tour de France stage 14: Pau to Luchon-Superbagnère</p> <p>Cycling</p>  <p>It’s Pyrenean purgatory for the peloton, with the Cols de Tourmalet, Aspin and Peyresourde on the menu, making it a big day in the battle to be king of the mountains, as well as the general classification. <strong>John Brewin</strong> is watching all the wheels turn as it happens, while <strong>Jeremy Whittle</strong> will be in the ski resort of Luchon-Superbagnère to report on who winds up in yellow and in polka dots with eight stages to go.</p> <p>2pm</p> <p>Open Championship, day three</p> <p>Golf</p>  <p>Moving day on the Causeway Coast, for those who made the cut, after some impressive low scoring on Friday, most notably from Scottie Scheffler and Matt Fitzpatrick. <strong>Scott Murray</strong> will take you through the action as it happens, while <strong>Ewan Murray</strong> and <strong>Sean Ingle</strong> will be reporting from Royal Portrush. Can Rory McIlroy, tied for 12th on a respectable three under par, make an impression on Scheffler, with the world No 1 seven shots better off than the local hero?</p> <p>8pm</p> <p>Quarter-final: France v Germany</p> <p>Women’s Euro 2025</p>  <p>If the group stages had gone with the pre-tournament odds, then this game would still have taken place but on Thursday with Germany, third favourites overall, as Group C winners and France, fourth favourites, as Group D runners-up. Instead France caught England very cold and Sweden surprised a sluggish Germany, meaning the victors are facing Spain, the world champions, in the last four. <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong> will cover the minute-by-minute action, while <strong>Tom Garry</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Liew</strong> are at St Jakob-Park.</p>   <h2></h2> <p>8.30pm</p> <p>Usyk v Dubois II (and undercard)</p> <p>Boxing</p>  <p>Just under two years ago Oleksandr Usyk recovered from a disputed low blow in Wroclaw to retain his IBF, WBA (Super) and WBO world heavyweight titles by stopping Daniel Dubois in the ninth round. Since then Usyk vacated the IBF title and Dubois picked it up and defended it successfully against his fellow Briton Anthony Joshua. With the fight at Wembley, Dubois will have home advantage this time, though that did Joshua no good when he fought Usyk the first time, at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong> is covering the action blow by blow, including the undercard, while <strong>Donald McRae</strong> and <strong>Barney Ronay</strong> are at Wembley.</p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>Noon</p> <p>Tour de France stage 15: Muret to Carcassonne</p> <p>Cycling</p>  <p>No one can take it easy on the Tour but the day after the Pyrenees offers a little respite. The peloton will travel west-by-south-west from Muret just outside Toulouse to the mediaeval city of Carcassonne, with its intact fortress walls. The stage’s one category-three climb may preclude a sprint finish but, with the final rest day to come on Monday, it can be worth putting in some extra effort. <strong>Tom Bassam</strong> will be keeping you up to date with the breakaways, while <strong>Jeremy Whittle</strong> is in the Languedoc.</p> <h2></h2> <p>2pm</p> <p>Open Championship, day four</p> <p>Golf</p>  <p>In 2019, it was Shane Lowry who strode on to the 18th green at Royal Portrush as champion-elect, duly picking up the Claret Jug. The pictures of the finish are always memorable, but there is a twist this time: the lack of a clubhouse alongside the 18th has enabled the R&amp;A to approve the use of a Spidercam, to provide panoramic views from overhead as the crowd follow the final pairing on to the green. <strong>Scott Murray</strong> will be your live guide, while <strong>Ewan Murray</strong>, <strong>Andy Bull</strong> and <strong>Sean Ingle</strong> will be capturing the scene from the course.</p>
