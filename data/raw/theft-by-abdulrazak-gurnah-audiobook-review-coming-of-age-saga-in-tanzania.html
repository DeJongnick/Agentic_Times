<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/08/nobel-winner-abdulrazak-gurnah-says-writing-cannot-be-just-about-polemics">Nobel prize-winning</a> author Abdulrazak Gurnah is known for his portrayals of east Africans and the after-effects of colonial rule. Opening in Zanzibar in the aftermath of independence, his 11th novel, Theft, spans half a century as it documents the lives of Karim, Fauzia and Badar. We learn how young Karim is treated as “an afterthought” by his mother, Raya, who divorces her much older husband and leaves her son behind to start a new life.</p> <p>Mother and son are reunited several&nbsp;years later in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where Raya has married a pharmacist named Haji. Karim, who grows up to be handsome, intelligent and more than a&nbsp;little conceited, gets a&nbsp;scholarship to study in the city and meets Fauzia, who&nbsp;is training to be a teacher and is keen to avoid the fate of&nbsp;other “mute daughter[s] laid out for deflowering”. She and Karim marry, and the pair open their home to Badar, a&nbsp;former servant of Raya and Haji’s who&nbsp;was abandoned by his parents&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/mar/19/theft-by-abdulrazak-gurnah-review-love-and-betrayal-from-the-nobel-laureate">Theft by Abdulrazak Gurnah review – love and betrayal from the Nobel laureate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Actor Ashley Zhangazha is the narrator of this intimate drama about interconnected lives, his reading deftly navigating the contrasting voices and interior lives of the main characters.
