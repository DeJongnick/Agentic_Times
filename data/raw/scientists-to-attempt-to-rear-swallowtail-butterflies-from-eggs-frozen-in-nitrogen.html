<p>Researchers are to attempt to rear swallowtail butterflies from eggs frozen in liquid nitrogen in a test to see whether cryopreservation could support the long-term conservation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/04/a-very-british-butterfly-spectacular-swallowtail-is-built-for-capricious-summers">Britain’s largest native species</a>.</p> <p>In a groundbreaking project, researchers will freeze eggs of captive-bred European swallowtails in liquid nitrogen at -196C and attempt to rear butterflies from the unfrozen eggs, comparing their success with butterflies reared from eggs that have never been frozen.</p> <p>If the method is successful, it could lead to eggs of the British swallowtail being stored to support long-term conservation strategies, such as breeding programmes and translocation efforts.</p> <p>The British swallowtail (<em>Papilio machaon britannicus</em>) is a unique subspecies but its range is shrinking and it is vulnerable to extinction, confined to low-lying parts of the Norfolk Broads likely to be overwhelmed by rising seas over the next century. In 2024, it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/29/butterflywatch-swallowtail-winter-floods-norfolk-broads">suffered its worst year</a> since scientific records began.</p> <p>Cryopreservation for butterflies is being tested by researchers from Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) in partnership with <a href="https://jimmysfarm.com/">Jimmy’s Farm &amp; Wildlife Park</a> and <a href="https://www.natures-safe.com/">Nature’s Safe</a> charity, a biobank specialising in conservation cryopreservation.</p> <p><a href="https://www.aru.ac.uk/people/alvin-helden">Dr Alvin Helden</a>, a member of the <a href="https://www.aru.ac.uk/science-and-engineering/research/institutes-and-groups/applied-ecology">Applied Ecology Research Group</a> at ARU, said: “Our project will combine fieldwork and lab research to see if we can establish a reliable method for preserving the British swallowtail’s genetic material by using its closely related, but less endangered, European cousin. Cryopreservation is a promising tool for supporting conservation efforts, but we believe this is the first time it has been attempted with butterflies.”</p> <p>Jimmy Doherty, founder of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/29/polar-bears-are-back-in-britain-but-should-they-really-be-living-here">Jimmy’s Farm &amp; Wildlife Park</a>, which houses a thriving captive population of the European swallowtail (<em>Papilio machaon gorganus</em><em>)</em>, said: “Our commitment to the science of entomology, and especially butterfly conservation, means this project is a natural fit for us. Partnering with ARU and Nature’s Safe allows us to apply our expertise to work that could make a real difference in protecting the British swallowtail for generations to come.”</p> <p>Debbie Rolmanis, chief operating officer of Nature’s Safe, said: “This project holds significant importance for the development of cryopreservation techniques – not only for the British swallowtail, but across pollinators and invertebrates as a whole.”</p>
