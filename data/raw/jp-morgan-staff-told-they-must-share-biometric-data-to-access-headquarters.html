<p>JP Morgan Chase has told staff moving into its new headquarters in New York that they must share their biometric data to access the multibillion-dollar building.</p> 
<p>The investment bank had previously planned for the registering of biometric data by employees at its new Manhattan skyscraper to be voluntary.</p> 
<p>However, employees of the US’s biggest bank who have started work at the headquarters since August have received emails saying that biometric access was “required”, according to communications seen by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5351d3d-d64f-4a90-a3da-d1ef8e8bea66">the Financial Times</a>.</p>

<p>Biometric access requires staff to scan their fingerprints or eye to gain access through security gates in the lobby instead of swiping their ID badges.</p> 
<p>The bank’s headquarters, which cost a reported $3bn (£2.25bn) to build, will eventually be a base for 10,000 employees once it is fully occupied later this year.</p> 
<p>JP Morgan declined to comment but it is understood that the use of biometric data for access is designed to make the building more secure.</p> 
<p>There are exemptions for some employees who will still be able to use a badge for access, the Guardian understands, although the criteria for who will use more traditional ID access is unclear.</p> 
<p>Biometric enrolment is understood to remain voluntary at other JP Morgan offices, including London, where voluntary hand biometrics have been introduced at its Bank Street office.</p> 
<p>This process involves an employee’s hand print being encrypted so the company does not have access to the data.</p> 
<p>This system operates in a similar fashion to Apple’s Face ID option on iPhones, where the Silicon Valley company cannot access customers’ facial data.</p> 
<p>Alongside the introduction of palm and eye scanners, the company has also launched the “Work at JPMC” mobile app, which works as a digital badge and hub for employee services.</p> 
<p>The app allows staff to manage guest registration, navigate indoor maps of the building and pre-order meals from the building’s 19 on-site dining vendors.</p> 
<p>The implementation of stricter access protocols comes as US corporations, particularly those with significant operations in New York, look to increase security after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/04/unitedhealthcare-ceo-shooting-what-we-know-so-far">shooting last year </a>of the chief executive of one of the US’s largest health insurers. Brian Thompson, the boss of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot not far from JP Morgan’s offices.</p> 
<p>The move comes amid debate over the use of technology to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/14/uk-firms-bossware-monitor-workers-activity">track workers by their employers</a>, including monitoring office attendance levels. Earlier this year all JP Morgan workers on hybrid work schedules were told they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/10/jp-morgan-chase-return-to-office">must return to the office five days a week</a>.</p> 
<p>The bank’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has described JP Morgan’s new 60-storey headquarters as a “beautiful physical manifestation” of the company.</p> 
<p>Dimon, one of the world’s most powerful bankers, this week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/09/head-of-jpmorgan-chase-warns-of-risk-of-american-stock-market-crash">warned</a> that the chance of the US stock market crashing was far greater than many financiers believed.</p> 
<p>JP Morgan has been contacted for comment.</p>
