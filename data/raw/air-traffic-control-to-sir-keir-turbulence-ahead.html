<p>To Elon Musk, I say this! To perform one<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/21/elon-musk-nazi-roman-salute-difference-trump-inauguration"> </a>Nazi salute at Donald Trump’s inauguration, while simultaneously offering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/25/elon-musk-makes-surprise-appearance-at-afd-event-in-eastern-germany">full support to European neo-Nazis</a>, might be considered a misfortune. To perform <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/20/trump-elon-musk-salute">two Nazi salutes at Donald Trump’s inauguration</a>, while simultaneously offering full support to European neo-Nazis, begins to look like carelessness.</p> <p>I didn’t write that joke. I have cannibalised it from one by the gay Irish Victorian Oscar Wilde, a typical diversity hire who would have achieved nothing had his work not been promoted by the famously woke 19th-century British establishment. Luckily, Wilde was dead long before he had the opportunity to emigrate to the US and take an air traffic controller job from a more deserving straight white male, where his gayness would have caused planes to crash.</p> <p>And dead also is Wilde’s contemporary Little Tich, the resilient dancing midget, whose spectacular gravity-defying boots can still be seen on display in Bloomsbury’s bijoux Museum of Comedy, alongside Tommy Cooper’s fez and a jar of thoughts John Cleese was forbidden from articulating owing to political correctness. But I dread to think of the havoc a capering music hall midget might have wrought on today’s international flight paths. It is a relief that Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/30/trump-washington-dc-plane-crash-dei">targeted the diversity policies</a> that could lead, directly up the gently sloping access ramp of woke inclusivity, to millions of appalling aviation disasters.</p> <p>Call me a textbook member of the tofu-munching north London wokerati, but I am proud to live in a world where people of shorter stature, while still entitled to dance in funny shoes if they so desire, can also be air traffic controllers. And call me a textbook member of the cinnamon latte-guzzling liberal elite, but it does seem wrong for the new president of the US to blame dwarf diversity hires and lazy amputees and those pesky epileptics for an air crash, without any evidence, especially when he’s reportedly just laid off loads of air traffic controllers.</p> <p>On a recent Friday in York, I had a lovely north African tapas lunch with a longstanding comedy promoter who, though still young, was old enough to remember working for a special bowling alley in Blackpool, where small people in crash helmets mounted on little trolleys were ricochetted down the aisles at speed towards clusters of vulnerable skittles by violently drunk stag parties. In the end, this massively popular seaside attraction – dwarf bowling – closed early, not because someone in Blackpool had a belated anxiety about whether it was ethical, but because of the injuries sustained by those being bowled down the lanes by the intoxicated revellers.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Starmer can’t really criticise Trump, when he too has decided to throw all life on Earth under the bus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the 1920s, Blackpool’s midgets lived in their own Midget Town on top of the Blackpool Tower, where tourists paid to see them go about their daily business in suitably scaled-down settings. It was a living. But when Midget Town finally closed, the pre-PC future offered only pantomime, seasonal work and bowling. It’s a world Trump would like to return to.</p> <p>Ah, well! Meet our potential major trading partner, whose return, according to Boris Johnson, was to be celebrated as another welcome victory over the woke. Witnessing the adjudicated sex abuser and convicted felon’s inauguration, Johnson, perhaps scenting his own second chance in the offing, related in the <em>Daily Mail</em> how, as the “invisible pulse of power surged” from the battered bible into the hand of Trump: “I saw the moment the world’s wokerati had worked so hard to prevent.” I can’t even be bothered to write anything funny about a man who could pen something so cynical, stupid and self-serving. I wish Johnson, the wounded wild pig of world politics, wandering around the central reservation wailing, having been winged by a passing Winnebago, would just fuck off. For ever.</p> <p>Too many of our politicians and pundits seem willing to take a wait-and-see approach to the wild swings of Trump’s pendulous wrecking balls. We should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/carney-vows-canada-will-stand-up-to-bully-as-trump-imposes-trade-tariffs">stand strong against Trump alongside Canada</a>, the harmless honey bear of international politics suddenly rearing up like an animatronic grizzly in an 80s B-movie. Keir Starmer is in danger of being on the wrong side of history, his only consolation being that, at the current rate of collapse, there may not be much history left. Like the natural world Starmer wishes to destroy, it seems history may be a finite resource.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/10/trump-rallies-extreme-heat">“Drill, baby, drill!”</a> cries Trump, as Los Angeles burns and Greenland’s permafrost unfreezes to the point where the previously unexploitable country may actually be worth him invading. Meanwhile, Starmer’s cry is the same but more complex and no less stupid. “Build a third runway and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/03/pm-faces-growing-internal-backlash-over-potential-approval-of-rosebank-oilfield">drill in the Rosebank oilfield</a>, baby, build a third runway and drill in the Rosebank oilfield! And while you’re at it, lock up peaceful environmental protesters too. Especially the elderly.”</p> <p>Starmer can’t really criticise Trump’s planet-pulverising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-order-paris-climate-agreement">withdrawal from the Paris agreement</a>, let alone his baseless hostility to a phalanx of imaginary disabled air traffic incompetents, when he too has decided to throw all life on Earth under the bus, despite having once been an idealistic teenager who left his “village and went to the city of Leeds” and “discovered a whole new world of indie bands – like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present”. Bless!</p> <p>I began this supposedly funny column on Monday morning, when the US president was still saying Starmer was “very nice” and there’d be no UK tariffs. Then I travelled to Oxford to do a show, and one takeaway coffee and a homemade sausage sandwich later, the UK seemed to have drifted back into Trump’s target zone, depending on which interpretation of his last mouth-fart of vengeful gobbledy-vomit you chose to believe. There’s no point trying to make plans around the whims of Trump. Starmer may as well throw cake at a hippo or try to cajole a box jellyfish. Go to Brussels on bended knee and beg for brotherhood.</p> <ul> <li><p>Stewart Lee tours <em><a href="https://www.stewartlee.co.uk/live-dates">Stewart Lee vs the Man-Wulf</a></em> this year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in July</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
