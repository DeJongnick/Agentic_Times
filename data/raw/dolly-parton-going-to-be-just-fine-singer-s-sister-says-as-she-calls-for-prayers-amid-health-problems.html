<p>Dolly Parton’s sister says she has been “up all night praying” for the singer as she continues to deal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/29/dolly-parton-postpones-las-vegas-residency-citing-health-challenges">with unspecified health problems</a>.</p> <p>Freida Parton wrote that her 79-year-old sister “hasn’t been feeling her best lately”, two weeks after the singer postponed a Las Vegas residency scheduled for December, citing “health challenges”.</p> <p>“Last night, I was up all night praying for my sister, Dolly,” Freida Parton wrote on Facebook.</p> <p>“Many of you know she hasn’t been feeling her best lately. I truly believe in the power of prayer, and I have been lead to ask all of the world that loves her to be prayer warriors and pray with me.</p> <p>“She’s strong, she’s loved, and with all the prayers being lifted for her, I know in my heart she’s going to be just fine. Godspeed, my sissy Dolly. We all love you!”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/sep/29/dolly-parton-postpones-las-vegas-residency-citing-health-challenges">Dolly Parton postpones Las Vegas residency, citing ‘health challenges’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Freida’s comments caused widespread concern for Parton. She later wrote a second message, saying: “I didn’t mean to scare anyone or make it sound so serious when asking for prayers for Dolly. She’s been a little under the weather, and I simply asked for prayers because I believe so strongly in the power of prayer … Thank you all for lifting her up.”</p> <p>Parton’s manager, Olly Rowland, said Parton had been treated for kidney stones, and added: “It looks like her sister posted, and it got quite a bit blown out of proportion.”</p> <p>Parton was due to begin Dolly: Live in Las Vegas, the singer’s first extended run of concerts in the city in 32 years, at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace on 4 December but it has been rescheduled for September 2026.</p> <p>The singer announced that she has “been dealing with some health challenges, and my doctors tell me that I must have a few procedures”.</p> <p>She did not give details but added light-heartedly: “As I joked with them, it must be time for my 100,000-mile checkup, although it’s not the usual trip to see my plastic surgeon!”</p> <p>She continued: “In all seriousness, given this, I am not going to be able to rehearse and put together the show that I want you to see, and the show that you deserve to see. You pay good money to see me perform, and I want to be at my best for you … I just need a little time to get show ready, as they say.</p> <p>“And don’t worry about me quittin’ the business because God hasn’t said anything about stopping yet. But, I believe He is telling me to slow down right now so I can be ready for more big adventures with all of you. I love you and thank you for understanding.”</p> <p>Asked about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/oct/31/dolly-parton-reader-interview">possibility of retirement in an interview last year</a>, Parton told the Guardian: “Oh, my Lord, I can’t retire. I always say I’ve dreamed myself into a corner. I’ve got to keep all those dreams alive. Every dream spins off into some something else … I couldn’t retire if I wanted to. And I don’t want to.”</p> <p>Parton’s husband of nearly 60 years, Carl Dean, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/03/carl-dean-husband-dolly-parton-dies">died aged 82 in March</a>.</p>
