A week off to get the body right again. Yeah, job is not finished. Exciting stuff to come.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Cats midfielder explains what he expected when he moved across from the Bulldogs and how he has found his first year at a second club.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I try to take it day by day as cliché as that is. Job is not done yet. That is what I focus on. There are no egos [here] and everyone plays to their strengths. It is just infectious and really positive group and super-grateful to be part of it.

The AFL heavyweights are well-acquainted at this time of year, with this the fourth final they have played against each other in the past five seasons. It isn’t too hard to see a path where they make it five finals clashes in as many years and meet again in this season’s decider.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe">During finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The previous three finals were even more important with a spot in the grand final up for grabs. This time the focus will be on taking a huge step toward that same stage again, with the winner tonight to have another weekend off and then host a preliminary final. The loser will face a do-or-die semi-final against Fremantle or Gold Coast, and hope to meet Collingwood a week after that.</p> <p>The Cats are on a six-match winning streak after easing through the run home against sides that finished in the lower half of the ladder. If health truly is wealth at this time of year then the Cats could hardly be any richer, with only Rhys Stanley and long-term project ruck Toby Conway unavailable this week. But two of their six defeats this year have come against Brisbane, who also beat Geelong in a preliminary final classic last year.</p> <p>The Lions have had an up and down season with their best being as good as any side has produced while they have also suffered a couple of unusually heavy defeats. Their 16 wins and a draw is a better record than they managed when they finished fifth but went on to win the premiership last year, even as they were handed a horror fixture this season. And ending the home-and-away season with seven wins from nine matches, with the first victory in that streak coming against the Cats, suggests the reigning premiers are primed for another big September.</p> <p><strong>First bounce will be at 7.40pm in Melbourne / AEST</strong>.
