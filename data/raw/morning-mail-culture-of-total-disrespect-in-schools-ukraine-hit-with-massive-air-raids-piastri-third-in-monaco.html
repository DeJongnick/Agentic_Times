<p>Good morning. Our main story today looks at a growing “culture of total disrespect” in schools, with teachers reporting a shocking rise in bullying behaviour and even violence towards them. Some are deciding to quit the profession.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Ukraine has hit out at US “silence” after Russia carried out its largest air raid of the war – and we learn more about the tragedy faced by two doctors in Gaza after nine of their 10 children were killed in an Israeli airstrike.</p> 
<p>And, we look at the devastating impacts of the NSW floods on rural communities where farmers have been left counting the costs as they bury their dead animals.</p>

<p>Thrifting was made for times like these; a prolonged period of high living costs and consumer pushback against the excesses of fast fashion has led to soaring interest in buying secondhand clothes and pre-owned homewares. But big business is tapping into the trend, drawing mixed reactions from thrifters accustomed to spending their money at charitable op shops. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/26/savers-is-a-thrift-store-and-were-in-a-cost-of-living-crisis-so-why-is-the-us-chain-dividing-australian-shoppers">Why is the US chain Savers dividing Australian shoppers</a>?</p>
