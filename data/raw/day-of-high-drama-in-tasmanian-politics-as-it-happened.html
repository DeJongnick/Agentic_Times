 <h2 class="block-title">NSW parliament bans public-private partnerships for hospitals</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The New South Wales parliament has voted to ban all future public private partnerships being imposed on the state’s acute hospitals.</p> 
  <p>The Minns government had foreshadowed “Joe’s law” prior to Thursday’s vote, named for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/20/massa-family-toddler-death-northern-beaches-hospital-ntwnfb">two-year-old boy </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/20/massa-family-toddler-death-northern-beaches-hospital-ntwnfb">Joe Massa</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/20/massa-family-toddler-death-northern-beaches-hospital-ntwnfb"> who died at the Northern Beaches hospital</a>.</p> 
  <p>He suffered a cardiac arrest and died in September after waiting three hours in the emergency department operated by private hospital provider Healthscope in a public-private partnership (PPP).</p> 
  <p>On Thursday evening, NSW health minister <strong>Ryan Park</strong> said the PPP Prohibition Bill had made amendments to the Health Services Act to prohibit governments from entering into a Northern Beaches-style arrangement to build or operate an acute public hospital.</p> 
  <p>“As a Labor government, we have always adamantly opposed these sorts of arrangements – and we will continue to oppose them, now and into the future,” Park said.</p> 
  <p>He added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The private sector can and does play an important part in the delivery of public hospital services. <br><br>However, the use of a Northern Beaches Hospital style public private partnership raises complex issues and risks. <br><br>This Government does not believe, and never has believed, that this is a model that is best for public health care. Local community hospitals that are designed to provide services to public patients should be part of the public health system.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Rockliff to go to governor on Tuesday to ask for election</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Tasmanian premier Jeremy Rockliff has said the state’s parliament will resume next Tuesday to pass supply bills to ensure essential services the government is responsible for are funded, before an election is called.</p> 
  <p>Rockliff will then meet with the government of Tasmania to request that an election be called.</p> 
  <p>The premier was speaking outside government house in Tasmania hours after parliament passed a vote of no confidence in him.</p> 
  <p>Rockliff accused opposition leader, <strong>Dean Winter</strong>, of taking a “wrecking ball” to parliament “and effectively the Tasmanian people”.</p> 
  <p>“[It’s been] quite a day for all of us and for all Tasmanians, and a day that I did not want to come to this point, but it has,” Rockliff said.</p>

  <p><strong>Albanese stands firm in trade talks to get ‘damn fine’ products into Europe</strong></p> 
  <p>Australia has stood firm in free trade negotiations with the European Union in the new environment of Donald Trump’s tariffs.</p> 
  <p>Trade minister <strong>Don Farrell</strong> walked away from the bloc’s previous offer following rounds of negotiations because it failed to give Australian agricultural products greater market access, which remains the sticking point.</p> 
  <p>Farrell met face-to-face with the EU’s trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, for the first time on Wednesday, on the sidelines of an OECD meeting in Paris.</p> 
  <p>Anthony Albanese said there was bipartisan support for free and fair trade.</p> 
  <p>The PM said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We will seek a deal that is good enough for Australia.</p> 
   <p>If it benefits us, we’ll be in it. If it doesn’t, we’ll continue to not sign up to something that is not in our national interest.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Albanese said Australia’s free trade agreement with the UK had led to an increase in meat exports, in addition to wine.</p> 
  <p>“Why is that the case? Because our products are damn fine and they are in demand right around the world,” he said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Rockliff arrives at Government House to ask for early Tasmanian election</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Tasmanian premier, <strong>Jeremy Rockliff</strong>, has arrived at Government House to ask for an early state election after the parliament passed a motion of no confidence in him earlier today.</p> 
  <p>He will be meeting the state’s chief justice and lieutenant governor, <strong>Christpher Shanahan</strong>. The governor, <strong>Barbara Baker</strong>, is not in the state.</p> 
  <p>Rockliff’s car has just passed through the gates of Government House, on the Queens Domain.</p> 
  <p>It is unclear whether the acting governor will accept Rockliff’s advice or consider other options for this parliament to continue. The Labor leader, <strong>Dean Winter</strong>, has said he would not form a minority government that relied on the support of the Greens.</p> 
  <p>It is just 15 months since the last election. The Liberals have 14 seats, Labor 10, the Greens five and there are six other crossbenchers.</p> 
  <p>Psephologist <strong>Kevin Bonham</strong> said the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kevinbonham.bsky.social/post/3lqtppcik5t2a">earliest possible election date was 12 July</a>.</p> 
  <p>There is another potential issue that needs to be resolved.</p> 
  <p>Parliament is likely to need to pass a temporary supply bill to ensure government services can continue to function during an election campaign as the budget introduced last Thursday has not been passed. The lieutenant-governor could appoint Rockliff as acting premier for a sitting to pass the supply bill.</p>

  <p><strong>Rental crisis eases for inner city tenants</strong></p> 
  <p>Some renters have received a reprieve from years of relentless increases, with rents falling in about one-third of suburbs around Australia over the last quarter, according to market data company PropTrack.</p> 
  <p>The falls were steepest in inner-city areas, where investors have been buying properties, adding rental stock to the market.</p> 
  <p>Median rents in Australia’s biggest city, Sydney, have fallen in about one-third of suburbs, in line with the national average.</p> 
  <p>The PropTrack economist <strong>Anne Flaherty</strong> said: “While an increase in investor activity is bad news for owner occupier buyers who are competing with investors, it does help add to the stock of rental properties.”</p> 
  <p>Overall, rents have still trended higher across the country over the past quarter, although the pace of increases has slowed.</p> 
  <p>Tenants have suffered the brunt of the cost-of-living crisis amid a tight supply of housing that has led to sharp increases in rent.</p> 
  <p>PropTrack data shows that Sydney renters are paying an average of $13,000 a year more now than they were five years ago. After a brief lull, home prices have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/19/rba-interest-rate-cuts-expected-to-drive-home-buyer-activity-but-economists-doubtful-of-boom-market">started to rise again</a>, fuelled by lower interest rates.</p>

  <p><strong>Man charged over mini pistol in luggage at Perth airport</strong></p> 
  <p>A Western Australian man travelling through Perth airport has been detected allegedly carrying a foldable pistol in his backpack.</p> 
  <p>The man was charged with allegedly carrying a foldable pistol in his luggage, after federal police – who have jurisdiction in airports – were notified on Wednesday that airport security had allegedly found a firearm during an X-ray screening of a passenger’s backpack.</p> 
  <p>“Police searched the backpack and found an unlicensed foldable single-shot pistol weighing less than 1kg. No ammunition was found in the luggage or in the man’s possession,” police said.</p> 
  <p>The 37-year-old was charged with one count of possessing an unlicensed handgun; and one count of carrying a weapon through a screening point.</p> 
  <p>The maximum penalty for each offence is seven years’ imprisonment. The man was scheduled to appear before Perth magistrates court on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>The AFP Det Acting Supt <strong>Peter Brindal</strong> said “carrying a firearm in an airport is a serious offence”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Security screening staff at the airport were vigilant and, along with AFP officers, acted quickly to ensure the safety of the travelling public and stop weapons entering the aviation environment.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Attorneys general are considering if reform needed on</strong> <strong>child abuse liability</strong></p> 
  <p>The nation’s attorneys general are considering whether reforms are needed following a high court decision limiting the <strong>liability of churches and other institutions for child abuse</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The high court ruled last year that the Catholic church couldn’t be held vicariously liable for abuse committed by a parish priest because the priest wasn’t a formal employee of the church.</p> 
  <p>The ruling had broad consequences in limiting institutions from being held vicariously liable for abuse committed by individuals who are associated with them but are not considered formal employees, such as parish priests and volunteers.</p> 
  <p>The ruling has prompted multiple crossbench attempts for reform, including in Victoria and New South Wales, attempting to extend the concept of vicarious liability to “persons akin to employees”.</p> 
  <p>A bill by <strong>Jeremy Buckingham</strong>, a NSW upper house crossbencher, was voted down on Wednesday night. In voting down the bill, the state finance minister, <strong>Courtney Houssos</strong>, revealed the issue was being considered by the standing council of attorneys general, a body comprising federal and state attorneys general. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The Standing Council of Attorneys-General is the most appropriate forum for consideration of the impacts of this decision, and the New South Wales Government believes we should not progress reforms ahead of this process.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It is important that all jurisdictions are given the opportunity to consider potential reform options as any changes in this space would benefit from a uniform national approach, if possible, to ensure that victim-survivors across Australia have equal opportunities to seek justice.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Any reforms progressed in this sensitive area of law must also be developed in close consultation with key legal stakeholders and victim-survivors to ensure that there are no unintended consequences.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Thorpe says PM ‘should have done his homework’ before saying bullying in parliament not an ongoing issue</strong></p> 
  <p>Conversation turns to <strong>Dorinda Cox</strong>’s defection to the Labor party, which followed <strong>Lidia Thorpe</strong> leaving the Greens to become an independent prior to the last election.</p> 
  <p>Asked if the Greens have a “problem with Indigenous women”, Thorpe says the two senators left the party for “very different reasons”, particularly on the referendum and her stance on the voice to parliament.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The Greens still have … a staunch and active group of blackfellas from around the country, so as long as they have the Blak Greens I think they just need to listen to them and they will be able to get it right eventually.</p> 
   <p>It is disappointing to see Senator Cox go to the Labor party to become a backbencher that obviously will not have a voice and no say in policy development.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Thorpe confirms she made a complaint with the parliamentary workplace support scheme in relation to Cox because the PM “told the people of this country that there was no ongoing issues with bullying and he was wrong”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>He should have done his homework before he opened his mouth because there is still an ongoing issue with bullying in the workplace and there is a lot of work to do and Labor need to take that seriously.</p> 
   <p>You cannot force people to mediate, so I am always open to a conversation and conciliation, so until that happens, it is still open.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked if Cox should resign, Thorpe says that’s for her to decide, “not for me”.</p> 
  <p>Cox’s office was approached for comment on Thorpe’s allegations but referred Guardian Australia to the prime minister’s media team, which did not respond to questions.</p> 
  <p>Cox has been the subject of a number of workplace behaviour complaints, as <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/dorinda-cox-staff-quit-greens-senator-s-office-over-toxic-workplace-claims-20240918-p5kbov.html">first reported by the Nine newspapers</a> last October. At the time, the WA senator apologised for “the distress this may have caused” but said there had been “significant missing context” in the reports of bullying allegations within her office.</p>

  <p><strong>‘It just has to stop’: Thorpe calls for action on Aboriginal deaths in custody after death of Warlpiri man</strong></p> 
  <p>The independent senator <strong>Lidia Thorpe</strong> is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing after revelations she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/04/lidia-thorpe-reveals-she-made-bullying-complaint-about-dorinda-cox-which-remains-unresolved-ntwnfb">made a bullying complaint</a> about the former Greens senator<strong> Dorinda Cox </strong>which remains unresolved.</p> 
  <p>First, she is asked about the death of Warlpiri man Kumanjayi White in police custody in Alice Springs last week.</p> 
  <p>Thorpe says the federal government needs to “take very seriously” what community members have been calling for, which is an independent investigation into his death, rather than “cops investigating cops”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is very clear that we have had so many deaths in custody, almost 600 deaths in custody, and nobody ever is held accountable for any of those deaths. We need to enact those royal commission recommendations from 1991 which clearly states that we need independence and accountability of these killings … it is another member of the Yuendumu community who has lost their life at the hands of the police.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Thorpe adds that state, territory and federal governments have worked together on issues such as vaping, kids on social media and the pandemic.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Why can’t we call the state and territories together on stopping Aboriginal deaths in custody? It just cannot continue. Our families and communities are reeling in the trauma every time we lose somebody in our communities. It just has to stop.</p>

  <p>The Tasmanian parliament’s lower house has passed a vote of no confidence in the Liberal premier, <strong>Jeremy Rockliff</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Climate group chief predicts more Coalition seats will fall after Boele victory</strong></p> 
  <p>Climate 200’s executive director has praised the independent candidate <strong>Nicolette Boele</strong> for prevailing in Bradfield, and said the fundraising vehicle had already “started thinking about 2028” and the next federal election.</p> 
  <p><strong>Byron Fay</strong>, in an email to supporters this afternoon, said the Coalition couldn’t form government without the seats won by teal independents, and predicted more seats would keep falling.</p> 
  <p>Fay called Boele’s close win – a margin of 26 votes – a “hard-won victory”, which he said proved “every single volunteer, every cent, and every conversation matters for independent campaigns”. Fay wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>[Boele is] a bona fide expert on decarbonisation and energy transition and she’s going to be a brilliant addition to the crossbench. I’m so excited to see what she brings to the conversation.</p> 
   <p>It’s easy to think of a seat like Bradfield as just a number in parliament, but it’s so much bigger than that. It’s clear now that the seats won by independents are an ideological firewall. The Liberal Party cannot form government without them, and if they continue to tear themselves apart over net zero and climate policy in general, they will continue to lose seats like Bradfield to extraordinary community independents like Nic.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Fay told supporters to “savour the win”, adding that Boele had put in a lot of work over the whole period since she came up short in Bradfield in 2022.</p> 
  <p>“We’ve started thinking about 2028 and our first strategy briefings are kicking off next week,” Fay wrote, inviting supporters to get involved.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Liberals will vote against Labor’s super tax plan, O’Brien says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The deputy Liberal leader and shadow treasurer, <strong>Ted O’Brien</strong>, has committed to voting against the government’s plan to trim superannuation tax breaks for very large balances.</p> 
  <p>It leaves the Greens in the box seat to negotiate with Labor to get the bill through, in an early test of how the minor party will seek to make deals in this term of government.</p> 
  <p>O’Brien told Sky News the opposition would “definitely, as a Coalition, oppose this unfair super tax of Labor’s every step of the way”. He called the tax changes “super big and super bad”.</p> 
  <p>The changes, which Labor proposed way back in 2023, would today affect about 80,000 Australians with more than $3m in superannuation – adding an extra 15% to the earnings in their account over $3m.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> 
   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/20/what-is-labor-proposing-to-do-with-superannuation-and-why-is-it-controversial">What is Labor proposing to do with superannuation, and why is it controversial?</a> </p> 
  </aside> 
  <p>Labor says the changes are fair and only affect a small number of Australians. The Coalition has strongly opposed the change, saying a failure to index the threshold means more people will be caught every year, as well as vehemently criticising the plan to tax “unrealised” gains which exist on paper in someone’s super account.</p> 
  <p>O’Brien has now committed the Coalition to opposing the bill. He says it will catch people who are “asset rich but cash poor”, such as farmers who may have included their farms inside their superannuation account.</p> 
  <p>The Greens now loom as Labor’s pathway to pass the bill, but the minor party says it would seek to reduce the threshold from $3m to $2m – therefore capturing more people initially – but also indexing the rate, to capture fewer lower-income earners over time.</p> 
  <p>However, the Greens have also signalled their willingness for a more constructive approach in this parliament, after holding up several key Labor bills last term. Parliament returns in late July.</p>

  <p><strong>A brief note on trade deficits and surpluses</strong></p> 
  <p>It should be noted there is nothing inherently wrong with a trade deficit. Trade is of benefit to both the sending and receiving nations.</p> 
  <p>At an individual level: someone has money and wants to buy something, someone else has that thing and wants to sell it. It is a win-win: the buyer gets the product they want, and the seller gets money for the goods they produced. No one is forcing anyone to buy (or sell) anything.</p> 
  <p>America’s trade deficit with most countries occurs for the simple reason that America is a rich country: Americans have a lot of money to spend and they buy more stuff from overseas than they sell to foreigners.</p> 
  <p>Trump has consistently said he doesn’t like trade deficits, but most government leaders don’t believe it is a valid metric to judge economic policy.</p>

  <p><strong>ABS confirms trade surplus with US in January 2025</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian Bureau of Statistics</strong> issued this statement (along with <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/articles/australias-trade-united-states-america">this data</a>) today:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Historically, Australia has had an annual trade deficit with the USA, importing more from the USA each year than it exports. In 2024, imports from the USA reached $50.6b and exports to the USA reached $23.8b resulting in a trade deficit with the USA of $26.9b.</p> 
   <p>Trade balances between countries are typically assessed on an annual basis due to the volatility of monthly trade data. However, it is worth noting the monthly trade balance with the USA moved into surplus for the first time in January 2025 following a sharp rise in exports of non-monetary gold. The monthly surplus was maintained for three consecutive months but returned to deficit in April 2025, when gold exports returned to regular trading levels.</p> 
   <p>Australia’s exports of non-monetary gold to the USA have historically risen during periods of economic uncertainty such as the global financial crisis in 2008, and the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Despite these previous peaks, the current rise in non-monetary gold far exceeds previous export levels, and has driven the Australia-USA trade balance into a monthly surplus for the first time on record.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Australia’s trade deficit with the US has been one of its key arguments to the US for relief from Trump’s universal tariff regime (along with a decades-old Free Trade Agreement, and being an unswerving security ally). Australia has been hit <a href="https://www.dfat.gov.au/trade/trade-and-investment/latest-us-tariffs">with a 10% tariff on most goods</a> going into the US. Steel and aluminium imports attract a 50% tariff.</p> 
  <p>Albanese will argue that tariff-free trade with the US benefits America (and Americans): these figures from the ABS support that argument.</p>

  <p><strong>Australia’s trade deficit could help Albanese’s tariff talks with Trump</strong></p> 
  <p>As <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> prepares for talks on tariffs with <strong>Donald Trump</strong> later this month, he has an extra arrow in his quiver of arguments: Australia has returned to trade deficit with the US.</p> 
  <p>Australia has, for decades, run a consistent – and large – trade deficit with the US. Put simply, Australia imports more from America than it exports to America. (This is a trade surplus from the US perspective: as Donald Trump would like it).</p> 
  <p>But, for the first time on record, in January this year, Australia started running a trade surplus with the US (a trade deficit, from Washington’s perspective) driven by a massive spike in gold being sold to the US.</p> 
  <p>Investors typically turn to gold in times of economic uncertainty, which the Trump Administration 2.0 has inarguably been. Australia shipped a record amount of gold to the US in January – worth US$2.9bn – the highest figure on record.</p> 
  <p>However, normal levels of gold trading have resumed and the more typical trade imbalance (in America’s favour) has returned.</p>

  <p><strong>Marine heatwave engulfed area of ocean five times the size of Australia in 2024</strong></p> 
  <p>Almost 40 million sq kilometres of ocean around south-east Asia and the Pacific – an area five times the size of Australia – was engulfed in a marine heatwave in 2024, a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report has revealed.</p> 
  <p>WMO scientists said the record heat – on land and in the ocean – was mostly driven by the climate crisis and coincided with a string of extreme weather events, from deadly landslides in the Philippines to floods in Australia and rapid glacier loss in Indonesia.</p> 
  <p>The WMO secretary general, Prof Celeste Saulo, said ocean heat and acidification had combined to “inflict long-lasting damage” to marine ecosystems and economies. Saulo said:</p>

   <p>Sea-level rise is an existential threat to entire island nations. It is increasingly evident that we are fast running out of time to turn the tide.</p>

  <p><strong>Pocock says companies ‘taking the piss’ after reform to petroleum resource rent tax</strong></p> 
  <p>Independent senator <strong>David Pocock</strong> and teal MP <strong>Zali Steggall</strong> say Labor’s 2023 reforms to the petroleum resource rent tax (PRRT) did not go far enough and that major gas exporters are still not paying their fair share.</p> 
  <p>The PRRT is anticipated to generate $4bn less than when it was tweaked two years ago to ensure the east-coast LNG giants paid some measure of the tax.</p> 
  <p>Pocock told the ABC that the PRRT needed to be revisited as companies were “taking the piss”, and that the government had chosen the weakest of a range of reform options, backed by the Greens.</p> 
  <p>Steggall also called for a beefed-up resource rent tax, and accused Labor of being swayed by oil and gas vested interests.</p> 
  <p>The comments come after experts told Guardian Australia that the PRRT was allowing foreign companies to profit from Australia’s mineral wealth while delivering “almost nothing” to the national purse.</p> 
  <p>Chris Richardson said “it is fair to say that how we tax gas in Australia is a massive fail”.</p> 
  <p>The PRRT is levied at the rate of 40% on taxable profits, but has failed to operate as intended thanks to overly generous rules allowing gas companies to claim previous years of capital expenditure against those taxable profits.</p> 
  <p>Experts also say the taxable profits are based on an undervaluation of the underlying resource.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sarah Hanson-Young says it would be ‘honourable’ for Dorinda Cox to resign</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Greens senator <strong>Sarah Hanson-Young</strong> has criticised former colleague <strong>Dorinda Cox</strong> for switching to the Labor party, saying “the honourable thing” would be to resign if a senator didn’t feel they could continue with the party for which they were elected.</p> 
  <p>Cox was elected to the Senate for a six-year term in 2022, but this week said her values were more aligned with Labor and will now sit with the government.</p> 
  <p>Senators are allowed to switch parties once elected and continue for the rest of their term: such situations have occurred regularly in recent years, and each time it is accompanied by a discussion about whether that person should be forced to resign instead.</p> 
  <p>The most recent notable example was former Labor senator <strong>Fatima Payman</strong>, who received a chorus of strong criticism from Labor politicians and luminaries when she quit to sit on the crossbench as well as calls for her to return her seat to Labor.</p> 
  <p>Hanson-Young, speaking at Parliament House today, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s not fair to the voters and indeed any of the parties involved that if somebody is elected as one party and then jumps ship later on.</p> 
   <p>I do think the honourable thing is to resign from the parliament. But, you know, that’s not the rules and we’re left where we are.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Hanson-Young referred to Payman’s situation, claiming there was “a bit of hypocrisy, of course, about how Labor has responded to this”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It wasn’t OK to jump ship for Fatima Payman, but apparently when it’s people coming to them, it’s all OK.</p>

  <p><strong>More on the no-confidence motion</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Winter</strong> said <strong>Rockliff</strong> had lost the confidence of parliament after last week’s budget, including over a plan to sell publicly owned assets. He reaffirmed Labor’s commitment that it “will not do a deal with or form government with the Greens”.</p> 
  <p>The no-confidence motion, moved yesterday, is still being debated.</p> 
  <p>Several speakers have suggested Winter expected Rockliff to resign or be pushed out, and for the weakened Liberals to elect another leader if the motion was successful. But the Liberals have backed the premier.</p> 
  <p>The Liberals have been governing with just 14 seats in the 35-seat parliament. Labor has 10, the Greens five, the Jacqui Lambie Network one and there are five independents.</p>

  <p><strong>Tasmanian opposition leader says Labor won’t form government with Greens, ‘ready to go’ to early election</strong></p> 
  <p>The Tasmanian Labor leader, <strong>Dean Winter</strong>, who kicked off chaos in the state parliament on Tuesday by proposing a vote of no-confidence on the Liberal premier, <strong>Jeremy Rockliff</strong>, has declared his party will not form a government with the Greens and is ready for an early election.</p> 
  <p>As we reported earlier, Rockliff fronted the media before the start of parliament and said he would advise the acting governor to call an early election if the vote – as is widely expected – is passed today, and if Labor did not form government with the Greens.</p> 
  <p>Rockliff said an early election, just 15 months after Tasmanians last voted, would be “on Mr Winter’s head”.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, Winter responded that if this happened Rockliff would be “the only person forcing Tasmania to an early election”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If he is granted an election, Labor is ready to go because we strongly believe Tasmania needs change.</p>

  <p><strong>PM again says bullying allegations against Dorinda Cox have been ‘dealt with’</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Albanese</strong> was asked about allegations of bullying made by senator <strong>Lidia Thorpe</strong> against former Greens senator <strong>Dorinda Cox</strong>, who shockingly defected to Labor earlier this week. The prime minister reiterated that he believes those allegations had been handled. Thorpe, however, recently said the process had been “far from satisfactory”.</p> 
  <p>Albanese said this morning:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I have answered those questions, but they were dealt with. There is an independent process for those things to be dealt with. It is not surprising that the Greens political party will put forward some opposition to what has occurred, but Senator Cox has made a decision, and she has decided that the way that she will advance her values is through a party of government.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Nine newspapers first reported last October about the complaints, and at the time Cox apologised for “the distress this may have caused” while saying there was “significant missing context”.</p>

  <p><strong>Head of one of the largest Australian gambling companies resigns</strong></p> 
  <p>The chief executive of one of Australia’s largest gambling companies, <strong>Entain</strong>, has resigned and will leave the company at the start of July.</p> 
  <p>Dean Shannon, who runs the <strong>Ladbrokes</strong> and <strong>Neds</strong> brands in Australia, briefed staff on his departure on Thursday morning.</p> 
  <p>Shannon has not publicly commented on the reason for his departure but sources at the briefing, not authorised to speak publicly, said he told staff his departure would give the company clear air after a damaging few months.</p> 
  <p>The nation’s financial intelligence agency, Austrac, recently commenced federal court proceedings against the company alleging serious and systemic violations of anti-money laundering rules between 2018 and 2024.</p> 
  <p>Austrac alleged Entain Australia accepted $152m in bets from 17 high-risk customers who had “suspected criminal profiles and associations” despite being aware they may have been laundering money.</p> 
  <p>Entain Australia is yet to file its response to Austrac’s statement of claim but has acknowledged the allegations and said the company is taking them “extremely seriously”. In late March, Shannon said the company was strengthening its anti-money laundering compliance arrangements.</p>

He had this to say on RN Breakfast:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve made it really clear we don’t want to see an escalation of tariffs. They are an act of economic self-harm. They are very damaging to the global economy. And we won’t be immune from that, even though we’re better-placed and better-prepared than most countries to deal with it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Chalmers said the tariffs would have an impact on Australian steel manufacturers, but called those businesses “among the best in the world”.</p>

  <p><strong>More from Climate Change Authority chief Matt Kean yesterday</strong></p> 
  <p>In his speech at the Australian Museum, <strong>Matt Kean</strong> also briefly referred to the Climate Change Authority’s work advising the Albanese government on a 2035 emissions reduction target.</p> 
  <p>The advice was delayed before last month’s federal election. The advice and a government announcement is now expected by September, before the Cop30 summit in Brazil in November.</p> 
  <p>Kean said he wanted a target that was “ambitious, informed by the science, but also achievable”. He has previously said the authority was consulting with stakeholders on a target range – a 65% to 75% cut below 2005 levels.</p> 
  <p>He said part of the authority’s work was to understand what <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s attempts to dismantle the Biden administration’s decarbonisation funding would mean for Australia – whether it would hamper or help a rapid shift to cleaner practice.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Some political or business leaders have suggested if a target appears beyond reach, we should throw in the towel.</p> 
   <p>In fact, there are many ways we can do more, mostly by going with the electron flow. The pace of electrification will determine whether we succeed.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said giving households more help to take up solar and batteries was “not only good politics. It could pick up some of the slack if the larger grid overhaul takes longer than expected”.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The secretary of the Queensland Nurses and Midwives’ Union, <strong>Sarah Beaman,</strong> said tens of thousands of nurses would take part in the action on Thursday morning. It is the first action since 2002.</p> 
  <p>Union members will wear pins, pink shirts and distribute union material but the action is expected to escalate over time if their terms are not met.</p> 
  <p>The union is locked in negotiations with the state government over a new enterprise bargaining agreement. The main sticking points are wages and conditions; the union says the state government has failed to meet an election promise for nation-leading pay for nurses. Beaman said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Make no mistake we have a nursing and midwifery workforce crisis in Queensland. If the government allows Queenland to fall behind Victoria for the first time in 15 years, we will see less nurses and midwives state-wide.</p>

  <p><strong>Matt Kean</strong> made an assertive case for why climate action makes economic sense while giving the Talbot oration at the Australian Museum in Sydney on Wednesday night.</p> 
  <p>In comments that were a less-than-subtle swipe at Coalition MPs, and possibly some others, the Climate Change Authority chair and former NSW Liberal energy minister said “opponents of climate action don’t give up even when their political parties cop an electoral hammering”, but urged Australians to ignore “doubters whose main mission seems to be to prolong the life of fossil fuel industries”:</p>
