<p>An Australian republic, renewable-powered supermarkets, recyclable packaging and the phasing out of Australia Post motorbikes.</p> <p>These are just some of the promises, targets and predictions that years ago were set for 2025 – which is now finally here.</p> <p>Here’s a look at what actually got achieved, what is in progress and what is not going to happen in the next 365 days.</p> <h2>Phasing out Australia Post motorcycles</h2> <p>Australia Post told a parliamentary inquiry it would phase out its fleet of postie motorcycles by 2025 to improve safety.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/01/eyes-on-the-poll-five-themes-that-will-mark-australias-politics-in-election-year">Eyes on the poll: five themes that will mark Australia’s politics in an election year</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/14/australia-post-to-phase-out-iconic-red-motorcycles-by-2025">At the time</a>, it said three-wheeled electric delivery vehicles would replace motorcycles – used for postal deliveries since the 1970s – because they are safer, can carry more parcels and have improved technology.</p> <p>Australia Post is working towards the target, set for the end of the upcoming financial year.</p> <p>“We’re proud to have 5,131 electric vehicles in our network, the largest electric delivery fleet in Australia,” a spokesperson said, with more than 3,800 eDVs being rolled out. It is understood that where terrain requires it, <a href="https://newsroom.auspost.com.au/electric-motorbike-fleet">petrol motorbikes will instead be replaced with electric ones</a>.</p> <h2>An Australian republic</h2> <p>Ten years ago, Bill Shorten declared a future Labor government would work towards a republic in the next decade. It didn’t happen.</p> <p>“We can be an Australian republic, with an Australian head of state,” he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/24/bill-shorten-aims-for-australian-republic-and-half-labor-mps-women-by-2025">told the Labor conference</a> in 2015.</p> <p>After the Queen’s death in 2022, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/19/guardian-essential-poll-australians-divided-on-whether-king-charles-should-be-head-of-state">a survey found</a> 43% of respondents supported Australia becoming a republic.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>At the time, Anthony Albanese swore his allegiance to King Charles III and said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/03/pm-anthony-albanese-piers-morgan-interview-republic-referendum-australia-not-imminent-king-charles-coronation">a republic was not “imminent”</a>. </p> <p>The defeat of the Indigenous voice to parliament in 2023 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/oct/23/can-republicans-rally-after-australias-resounding-no-to-constitutional-reform-on-the-voice">also shot down hopes of a republic referendum</a> – which achieved a 45% yes vote in 1999. </p> <h2>100% packaging to be recyclable</h2> <p>Australia is not on track to meet this goal.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/all-australian-packaging-to-be-sustainable-by-2025-coag-agrees">In 2018</a>, the Turnbull government and states agreed to the 2025 national packaging targets, which included:</p> <ul> <li><p>100% of packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable.</p></li> <li><p>70% of plastic packaging recycled or composted.</p></li> <li><p>50% average recycled content across all packaging.</p></li> <li><p>Phasing out problematic and unnecessary single-use plastic packaging.</p></li> </ul> <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/20/australia-recycles-just-18-of-plastic-packaging-and-will-not-reach-2025-target-review-finds">review in April 2023</a> found those targets were not on track to be met.</p> <p>Suzanne Toumbourou, the CEO of the Australian Council of Recycling, said stricter oversight <a href="https://acor.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/241028-ACOR-Reform-of-packaging-regulation-consultation-paper.pdf">on packaging regulation</a> was needed.</p> <p>Until thriving markets for recycled product derived from packaging can be ensured, “we’re not going to be able to meet any forms of targets,” she said.</p> <h2>100% renewable energy for Coles and Woolworths</h2> <p>Coles is on track to source all its electricity from renewable sources across its brands by 2025, it said.</p> <p>The supermarket giant first announced the target in 2021. According to its <a href="https://www.colesgroup.com.au/FormBuilder/_Resource/_module/ir5sKeTxxEOndzdh00hWJw/file/Sustainability_Report.pdf">latest sustainability report</a>, it is on track to meet the target through “onsite solar and large-scale generation certificate arrangements which match our consumption”.</p> <p>Woolworths also has stated its intention to have all its operations in Australia and New Zealand running on 100% renewable electricity by 2025.</p> <p>Its total renewable electricity was at 23.5% in 2024, <a href="https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/content/dam/wwg/investors/reports/f24/f24/Woolworths%20Group%202024%20Sustainability%20Report.pdf">an increase</a> of 0.9% on the previous year. <a href="https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/au/en/our-impact/sustainability/Planet/green-electricity.html">Woolworths said</a> a new energy partnership with CleanCo in Queensland, together with contracts in other states, secure a pathway for 100% by 2025.</p> <p>In 2021, Aldi said it had reached its target to power all operations with 100% renewables six months ahead of schedule.</p> <h2>Gender parity for Labor MPs</h2> <p>Shorten also used the 2015 Labor conference to declare that by 2025 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/24/bill-shorten-aims-for-australian-republic-and-half-labor-mps-women-by-2025">half of the party’s MPs would be women</a> – which has been achieved.</p> <p>After the 2022 election and the Aston byelection in April 2023, the Labor party is 52% women – or 54 of the 103 caucus members.</p> <p>In the House of Representatives, 48% of members are women (37 of 77) and in the Senate, 65.4% of senators are women (17 of 26).</p> <h2>NBN rollout</h2> <p>In 2022, Labor announced funding to improve the national broadband network and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/19/labor-promises-full-fibre-nbn-access-to-15m-homes-and-businesses-by-2025">expand full-fibre access to 1.5m homes and businesses</a> by 2025, mainly in outer city and regional areas.</p> <p>An NBN spokesperson said it was on track to meet this by the end of the year, enabling more than 10m premises – or up to 90% of the fixed line network – to access close to gigabit speeds.</p> <p>As of August, more than 8.84m premises were eligible to access its highest residential speed tier. The latest numbers are expected to be released in February.</p> <h2>75% renewables for South Australia</h2> <p>Wind and solar power in South Australia <a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/18f3ed24-4b26-4c83-a3d2-8a1be51c8cc8/Electricity2024-Analysisandforecastto2026.pdf">grew to 75% in 2023</a> – a target initially set for 2025 by the former Labor premier Jay Weatherill in 2018. The then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, described the goal as <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-12/pm-attacks-sas-renewable-energy-policy/8800782">“ideology and idiocy in equal measure”</a>.</p> <p>South Australia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/08/south-australia-renewable-energy-targets-international-template-solar-power">now leads the world</a> in the integration of variable, or weather-dependent, renewables. The state government is attempting to legislate a target of 100% renewable energy by 2027.</p> <h2>Energy bills cut by $275</h2> <p>It’s the election promise that has come back to bite Labor.</p> <p>Before the 2022 election, Albanese said Labor’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jun/06/labor-has-set-an-exceptionally-ambitious-target-for-renewable-energy-can-it-be-met">powering Australia policy</a> would slash $275 off power bills by 2025. Instead, bills have gone up.</p> <p>The Coalition has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/21/power-bills-could-rise-by-1000-a-year-under-coalition-plan-to-boost-gas-until-nuclear-is-ready-analysts-say">blamed the rise on new renewable energy</a>, but analysts say it was largely due to fossil fuels, including the Ukraine war pushing up gas and coal prices. Regulators say prices for households <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/19/australias-power-regulator-orders-price-cuts-of-up-to-71-for-households-as-generation-costs-ease">should fall up to 7%</a> in 2025.</p>
