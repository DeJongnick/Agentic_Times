Its core responsibilities have included distributing federal financial aid for education, collecting data on the US’s schools, identifying major educational issues and enforcing federal education laws prohibiting discrimination and implementing congressional education legislation.</p> <p>Among its most significant functions is administering federal student aid programs, providing billions in grants, work-study funds and loans to more than 13 million students. The agency also oversees programs addressing special education, English-language acquisition and education for disadvantaged students.</p> <p>Critics have long questioned the need for the department, arguing education should remain entirely under state and local control, while its supporters maintain it plays a crucial role in protecting educational equity and providing much-needed federal backing to schools serving vulnerable populations.</p> <h2>Can Trump legally eliminate a government agency?</h2>  <p>Scrapping an entire department <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/04/trump-education-department">would require</a> congressional approval – something that conservatives seeking to get rid of the education department have failed to do for decades.</p> <p>No president has ever successfully closed a cabinet-level agency enshrined in law before. And the constitutional separation of powers means the president’s executive authority alone isn’t sufficient to close the agency by the stroke of his pen.</p> <p>The White House has acknowledged this limitation, with administration officials confirming they don’t have the necessary votes in Congress to eliminate the department completely.</p> <p>So instead, Trump’s executive order would essentially direct the education secretary, Linda McMahon, to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure”, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/20/politics/education-department-trump-executive-order/index.html">according to administration officials</a>, while working within existing executive branch powers. This could include reorganizing certain functions, appointing leadership aligned with the aggressive drawing-down goal and potentially returning specific authorities to states where federal law permits.</p> <h2>What does the executive order mean for American students?</h2>  <p>The mass weakening of the agency will undoubtedly create significant uncertainty for America’s 50 million public school students and their families, with impacts varying widely depending on how the directive is implemented.</p> <p>In the immediate term, most students will probably see little change to their daily educational experience, as schools primarily operate under state and local control and budgets for the year are already set. However, the long-term implications could be substantial if federal education programs are modified or reduced.</p> <p>Shuttering the department <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/21/trump-education-department">puts marginalized students</a> most at risk, experts say. Since federal programs support special education, English-language learners and disadvantaged students, they face the brunt of the impact. The <a href="https://www.ed.gov/laws-and-policy/individuals-disabilities/idea">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act</a> (Idea), which provides protections for students with disabilities, is federally enforced through the department.</p> <h2>What happens to student loans?</h2>  <p>There is significant uncertainty for the federal student loan system, which currently manages approximately $1.69tn in outstanding debt for more than 43 million Americans.</p> <p>While the White House has indicated functions such as student loans will continue, any disruption to the department’s distribution of grants, work-study funds and loans could affect the more than 19 million college students in the United States.</p> <p>There are questions about which department might oversee these operations, but earlier this month, Trump suggested transferring loan management to either the treasury department, commerce department or the small business administration next. The treasury department may be the most likely choice.</p> <p>Borrowers currently in repayment are unlikely to see immediate changes to their payment requirements or loan terms, but may face uncertainty about where to direct questions and how to navigate repayment options if administrative responsibilities shift. But the executive order’s impact on new student loans and financial aid processing for incoming college students remains unclear.</p>
