<p>US Capitol police are reportedly investigating after a US flag bearing a swastika was discovered inside the office of Republican House member Dave Taylor of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ohio">Ohio</a>.</p> <p>The image, obtained by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/15/capitol-police-investigating-swastika-in-gop-congressional-office-00609704">Politico</a>, shows a modified flag featuring red and white stripes arranged in the form of a swastika – which is virtually synonymous with the Nazis’ genocidal regime. The flag was displayed on what appears to be a cubicle wall behind Angelo Elia, one of Taylor’s staff members, during a virtual meeting.</p> <p>Other items pinned nearby include a pocket constitution and a congressional calendar. It remains unclear whether Elia had any connection to the display.</p> <p>“I am aware of an image that appears to depict a vile and deeply inappropriate symbol near an employee in my office,” Taylor said in a statement to the <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2025/10/15/dave-taylor-reacts-vile-symbol-office/86709735007/">Cincinnati Enquirer</a>.</p> <p>“The content of that image does not reflect the values or standards of this office, my staff, or myself, and I condemn it in the strongest terms. Upon learning of this matter, I immediately directed a thorough investigation alongside Capitol Police, which remains ongoing. No further comment will be provided until it has been completed.”</p> <p>According to his office, the flag was discovered on Tuesday afternoon inside Taylor’s suite in the Cannon building on Capitol Hill, Politico reported. The congressman suspects the act was “foul play or vandalism”, his spokesperson said.</p> <p>When contacted by the Guardian for comment, an automatic response from the US Capitol police public information office was sent that said the office is “closed for routine business” during the funding-related federal government shutdown that began on 1 October. “The office will reopen when the federal government is funded,” the response said.</p> <p>The discovery follows <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/private-chat-among-young-gop-club-members-00592146">a report</a> from Politico published on Tuesday detailing a Telegram chat in which Young Republican leaders exchanged racist comments and slurs, mocked the Holocaust, and expressed admiration for Nazi ruler <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/adolf-hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.</p> <p>The exposed chat has since been met with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/young-republicans-racist-group-chat-messages-leaked">major backlash</a> throughout the US, with some who participated being called to resign and at least one member having a job offer revoked.</p>
