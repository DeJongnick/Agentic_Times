 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>That’s it for today. My colleagues are continuing coverage of the developments in the Middle East <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/17/israel-iran-conflict-live-updates-tehran-trump-evacuation-middle-east">here</a>.</p> 
  <p>Here’s what happened today:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump is leaving the G7 Summit early</strong> and return to Washington DC on Monday. “You probably see what I see and I have to be back as soon as I can,” Trump said in an apparent nod to the intensifying conflict in the Middle East.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>President Trump</strong> <strong>has directed</strong> <strong>national security staff</strong> to convene in the situation room, both <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-iran-attack-strikes-news-06-16-25-intl-hnk#cmbzrnmii00003b6zmau5hep8">CNN</a> and Fox News are reporting.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump says ‘everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran’</strong> and that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> “should have signed the ‘deal’”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Republican-run Senate Finance Committee published a modified text of</strong> <strong>Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act</strong> that proposes Medicaid reforms and a new federal deduction for state and local taxes.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba</strong> met with <strong>President Trump</strong> on the sidelines of the <strong>G7 meeting</strong> on Monday to discuss import auto tariffs Washington imposed on Japan, Reuters is reporting.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European leaders at G7 trying to bring Iran back to negotiating table. </strong>But <strong>Iran</strong> is demanding a joint ceasefire with <strong>Israel</strong>, while <strong>Benjamin</strong> <strong>Netanyahu</strong>, the Israeli prime minister, is resisting the move, and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> praised the Israeli campaign, suggesting he did not yet believe it was time to relieve the pressure on Iran.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Britain</strong> <strong>and the United States should finalize “very soon” the implementation of a trade deal agreed last month,</strong> <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has said ahead of a meeting with <strong>Donald</strong> <strong>Trump</strong> in Canada.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US justice department has asked a federal appeals court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging race-conscious admissions at the US</strong> <strong>Naval Academy</strong> after the elite military school said it changed its policy under <strong>Donald Trump</strong>. The Naval Academy disclosed in March that it was no longer considering race or ethnicity in its admissions decisions following directives from Trump and defense secretary <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>US House speaker Mike Johnson said he has postponed his planned 22 June trip to Israel</strong> to address its parliament, as an escalating battle between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> and <strong>Iran</strong> has raised fears of a broader conflict.</p></li> 
   <li><p> <strong>The American Bar Association has sued the Trump administration,</strong> seeking an order that would bar the White House from pursuing what the ABA called a campaign of intimidation against major law firms. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington DC, said the administration violated the US Constitution in a series of executive orders targeting law firms over their past clients and lawyers they hired.</p></li> 
   <li><p> <strong>Minnesota shooting suspect had more than 45 names of elected officials, prosecutors say. </strong>Reuters reports that notebooks recovered from Boelter’s car, as well as the home where he had been staying, showed that he had meticulously planned the attacks for some time. He had the names and, in some cases, home addresses for more than 45 elected officials – “mostly or all Democrats” – according to an affidavit from an FBI agent. </p></li> 
   <li><p> <strong>The suspect in the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband this weekend</strong> <strong>drove to the homes of two other state politicians</strong> before he succeeded in killing one of the targets of his carefully planned attack, federal authorities said today.</p></li> 
   <li><p> <strong>A federal judge has said she would issue a brief extension of an order temporarily blocking Donald Trump’s plan</strong> to bar foreign nationals from entering the US to study at <strong>Harvard University</strong> while she decides whether to issue a longer-term injunction.</p></li> 
   <li><p> <strong>Trump</strong> <strong>once again complained about removing Russia from what was once the G8</strong>. Russia used to be a part of the exclusive club of major economies but was kicked out following its 2014 annexation of <strong>Crimea</strong> from <strong>Ukraine</strong>.</p></li> 
   <li><p> <strong>Trump says Iran wants to talk about de-escalating hostilities with Israel</strong>, and he advises that they should do so immediately “before it’s too late”.</p></li> 
   <li><p> <strong>Iran</strong> <strong>has been urgently signaling that it seeks an end to hostilities and resumption of talks over its nuclear programs</strong>, sending messages to <strong>Israel</strong> and the <strong>US</strong> via Arab intermediaries, the Wall Street Journal reports.</p></li> 
   <li><p> <strong>The Trump Organization has launched a self-branded mobile service and a $499 smartphone,</strong> dubbed <strong>Trump Mobile</strong>, signaling a new effort to court conservative consumers with a wireless service positioned as an alternative to major telecom providers. The new mobile venture will include <strong>call centers based in the United States</strong> and <strong>phones made in America</strong>, the organization said.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> will leave the <strong>G7 summit</strong> early and return to Washington DC on Monday, the <strong>White House</strong> said about an hour after the president said people in Iran’s capital Tehran should evacuate immediately.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s evacuation warning on Truth Social followed a warning from the Israeli defense forces issued a formal evacuation order to residents of Tehran warning them of the imminent bombing of “military infrastructure”.</p> 
  <p>Trump was originally supposed to arrive back in the US in the early hours of Wednesday morning, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>

  <p>The scientist responsible for overseeing the CDC team that collects data on COVID-19 and RSV hospitalizations resigned on Monday.</p> 
  <p><strong>Dr. Fiona Havers </strong>told colleagues in an email that she no longer had confidence the data would be used “objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,” according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-cdc-official-charge-covid-rsv-data-resigns-ahead-vaccine-meeting-2025-06-16/">Reuters</a>.</p> 
  <p>She resigned before a planned meeting of a new vaccine panel put in place by <strong>Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.</strong> after he fired all 17 members of the CDC’s independent vaccine advisory panel. Kennedy also dropped a recommendation to get the Covid shot for healthy children and pregnant women.</p> 
  <p>A Health and Human Services spokesperson told Reuters that the agency is committed to “gold standard science.”</p>

  <p><strong>Trump</strong> has fired a Democratic commissioner of the <strong>U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)</strong>, the agency that is in charge of Nuclear safety, according to the AP. </p> 
  <p><strong>Christopher Hanson </strong>wrote in a statement that he was fired without cause “contrary to existing law and longstanding precedent regarding removal of independent agency appointees.”</p> 
  <p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told the AP that “all organizations are more effective when leaders are rowing in the same direction” and that the Republican president reserves the right to “remove employees within his own executive branch.”</p> 
  <p>Hanson’s term was due to end in 2029. He was originally nominated to be the head of the NRC by Trump in 2020 and was appointed chair by President Biden in 2021. After Trump was inaugurated the second time, Hanson was replaced as chair by the president’s newest pick, David Wright, a Republican member of the NRC. Hanson had remained on the NRC as a commissioner. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">European leaders at G7 trying to bring Iran back to negotiating table</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour">Patrick Wintour</a><em> </em>and<em> </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker">Peter Walker</a><em> in Banff</em></p> 
  <p>European leaders at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7">G7 summit</a> in Canada are trying to engineer an Iranian return to the negotiating table using Gulf leaders as intermediaries.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Iran</strong> is demanding a joint ceasefire with <strong>Israel</strong>, while <strong>Benjamin</strong> <strong>Netanyahu</strong>, the Israeli prime minister, is resisting the move, and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> praised the Israeli campaign, suggesting he did not yet believe it was time to relieve the pressure on Iran.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>US</strong> is considered by Iran to be critical to putting pressure on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, but the US president wants indications that Iran will back down on wanting to maintain the right to enrich uranium. He is willing to continue to use the Israeli assault as a bargaining chip if necessary.</p> 
  <p><strong>French</strong>, <strong>German</strong> and <strong>British</strong> foreign ministers were due collectively to speak to the Iranian foreign minister, <strong>Abbas Araghchi</strong>, in an attempt to see if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> would meet the US demand to end all uranium enrichment in the country, previously a red line for Tehran.</p> 
  <p>Asked if he had received any messages from Iran suggesting that it wanted to de-escalate the conflict, Trump hinted that he had: “They want to talk.”</p> 
  <p>The US president said that Iran was not winning its conflict with Israel and should re-enter negotiations “before it’s too late”.</p> 
  <p>“They have to make a deal, and it’s painful for both parties, but I’d say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately, before it’s too late,” Trump told reporters at the summit.</p> 
  <p>He added: “If Iran wants to negotiate, now is the time.”</p> 
  <p>Araghchi appealed to Trump to break with Netanyahu, <strong>telling the US president he was being played by an Israeli leader</strong> who was determined to scuttle a deal that Iran and the US were on the verge of sealing. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>By all indications, the purpose of Netanyahu’s criminal attack on Iran – killing hundreds of innocent civilians, including women and children – is to scuttle a deal between Iran and the US, which we were on the right path to achieve. He is playing yet another American president, and ever more American taxpayers, for absolute fools.</p> 
   <p>If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential. Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu. That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.</p>

  <p>On the sidelines of the G7 summit, Starmer told reporters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m certainly seeing President Trump today, and I’m going to discuss with him our trade deal.</p> 
   <p>I’m very pleased that we made that trade deal, and we’re in the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The UK was the first country to agree a framework deal for lower tariffs from Trump, with the US reducing tariffs on imports of UK cars, aluminium and steel, and Britain agreeing to lower tariffs on US beef and ethanol.</p> 
  <p>But implementation of the deal has been delayed while details were being hammered out. The proclamation readied by the White House will set an effective date in coming weeks, a source told Reuters.</p> 
  <p>On steel and aluminum, the US agreed to lower the 25% tariffs on imports from Britain to zero, subject to setting a quota for British steel imports that must meet supply chain requirements.</p> 
  <p>Britain had avoided tariffs of up to 50% on steel and aluminum that the US imposed on other countries earlier this month, but could face elevated tariffs from 9 July unless a deal to implement the tariff reduction is reached.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">US seeks dismissal of Naval Academy case after ending race-conscious admissions</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The US justice department has asked a federal appeals court to dismiss a lawsuit challenging race-conscious admissions at the US <strong>Naval Academy</strong> after the elite military school said it changed its policy under <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The Naval Academy, located in Annapolis, Maryland, disclosed in March that it was no longer considering race or ethnicity in its admissions decisions following directives from Trump and defense secretary <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The justice department and an anti-affirmative action group that had sued the academy, jointly told the court today that the policy change rendered the legal dispute moot.</p> 
  <p>“This Department is committed to ending illegal discrimination and restoring merit-based opportunity throughout the federal government,” attorney general <strong>Pam Bondi</strong> said in a statement.</p> 
  <p>The filing, in the US court of appeals for the fourth circuit, also asks the court to vacate a federal judge’s ruling last year finding that the prior race-conscious policy was legal.</p> 
  <p>The Biden administration defended affirmative action at the Naval Academy after the US supreme court exempted US military academies from its 2023 ruling barring consideration of race in college admissions.</p> 
  <p>The Naval Academy had long relied on its prior policy to raise its enrollment of Black, Hispanic and other minorities.</p> 
  <p>US conservatives and the Trump administration have argued that such policies disadvantage white and certain other applicants and do not improve military readiness.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>American Bar Association</strong> has sued the Trump administration, seeking an order that would bar the White House from pursuing what the ABA called a campaign of intimidation against major law firms.</p> 
  <p>The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Washington DC, said the administration violated the US Constitution in a series of executive orders targeting law firms over their past clients and lawyers they hired.</p> 
  <p>“There has never been a more urgent time for the ABA to defend its members, our profession and the rule of law itself,” the group’s president, <strong>William Bay</strong>, said in a statement.</p> 
  <p>The ABA, with about 150,000 paying members, is the country’s largest voluntary association for lawyers.</p> 
  <p>A White House spokesperson had no immediate comment.</p> 
  <p>Four law firms have separately sued the administration over <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s orders, which stripped their lawyers of security clearances and restricted their access to government officials and federal contracting work.</p> 
  <p>Four different judges in Washington have sided with the firms and temporarily or permanently barred Trump’s orders against them.</p> 
  <p>One of the firms that sued and won a preliminary victory, <strong>Susman Godfrey</strong>, is representing the ABA in Monday’s lawsuit.</p> 
  <p>Despite Trump’s court losses, nine law firms have struck deals with the president, pledging nearly $1bn in free legal services on mutually agreed legal issues with the White House in order to stave off similar executive orders.</p> 
  <p>The ABA said in its lawsuit that Trump’s actions had made it difficult to find law firms willing to represent it in litigation adverse to the federal government, including a case it sought to join challenging the administration’s immigration policies.</p> 
  <p>The ABA said Trump had formed a “deliberate policy designed to intimidate and coerce law firms and lawyers to refrain from challenging the President or his Administration in court”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Minnesota shooting suspect had more than 45 names of elected officials, prosecutors say</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Reuters reports that prosecutors said notebooks recovered from Boelter’s car, as well as the home where he had been staying, showed that he had meticulously planned the attacks for some time.</p> 
  <p><strong>He had the names and, in some cases, home addresses for more than 45 elected officials</strong> – “mostly or all Democrats” – according to an affidavit from an FBI agent. Boelter’s notes indicated he had used a variety of people-finding websites to track down addresses.</p> 
  <p>In one notebook, Boelter noted that the Hortmans had two children and included details about their house, writing: “Big house off golf course 2 ways in to watch from one spot,” the affidavit said.</p> 
  <p>Hours after the shootings, with police searching for him, Boelter met an individual at a bus stop in Minneapolis and offered to buy his electric bicycle, according to prosecutors. After the two went to the person’s house, Boelter instead offered to buy his Buick.</p> 
  <p>Investigators on Sunday found the Buick in rural Sibley county, near his listed home address about an hour’s drive southwest of Minneapolis. Inside the car, officers found a handwritten letter to the FBI, in which Boelter gave his name and admitted to committing the shootings, according to the affidavit.</p> 
  <p>More than 20 Swat teams combed the area, aided by surveillance aircraft, officials said. Boelter, who was armed, crawled from a wooded area and surrendered to police in a field with no shots fired.</p> 
  <p>The killing was the latest in a series of high-profile episodes of political violence across the country, including a 2022 attack on former Democratic US House speaker <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong>’s husband at their home, the attempted assassination of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> last year and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/23/josh-shapiro-arson-home-passover-seder"> an arson attack</a> at Pennsylvania governor <strong>Josh Shapiro</strong>’s house in April.</p>

  <p>The Minnesota attacks began around 2am on Saturday, when a gunman wearing a police-style tactical vest <strong>knocked on the Hoffmans’ door in Champlin</strong>, announced himself as a police officer and then shot the couple multiple times inside, according to prosecutors. He was driving an SUV outfitted with police-style lights and a fake license plate that read “POLICE.”</p> 
  <p>Boelter then traveled to <strong>the home of another state lawmaker in Maple Grove</strong>, where he rang the doorbell at 2.24am, Thompson said. The official was not home at the time.</p> 
  <p>Boelter also visited <strong>the home of a legislator in New Hope</strong>, prosecutors said. A New Hope officer – dispatched to the house to conduct a wellness check after police learned of the Hoffman shooting – took Boelter, who was parked outside, to be another police officer and pulled up next to him.</p> 
  <p>“He just sat there and stared straight ahead,” Thompson said of Boelter. The responding officer went to the door to wait for additional officers, and Boelter had left by the time they arrived, prosecutors said.</p> 
  <p>Shortly after, police went to <strong>the Hortmans’ house in Brooklyn Park</strong> as a precaution. The arriving officers saw the suspect shoot Mark Hortman through an open door around 3.35am and exchanged fire with him before he fled on foot out the back door, according to prosecutors. <strong>Melissa Hortman</strong> was already dead inside.</p> 
  <p>When police searched Boelter’s SUV after the shootings, they discovered three AK-47 assault rifles, a 9mm handgun, a gold police-style badge and the target list, according to authorities.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Suspect in Minnesota lawmaker killing visited other legislators' homes, prosecutors say</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The suspect in the assassination of a <strong>Minnesota</strong> lawmaker and her husband this weekend <strong>drove to the homes of two other state politicians</strong> before he succeeded in killing one of the targets of his carefully planned attack, federal authorities said today.</p> 
  <p>Vance Boelter, 57, faces state and federal charges of murder after he was arrested on Sunday night following a massive two-day manhunt that was the largest in state history.</p> 
  <p>He is charged with fatally shooting <strong>Melissa Hortman</strong>, the top Democrat in the Minnesota House, and her husband, <strong>Mark</strong>, in their home on Saturday. Boelter is also accused of shooting and wounding another Democratic lawmaker, state senator <strong>John</strong> <strong>Hoffman</strong>, and his wife <strong>Yvette</strong>, in their home a few miles away.</p> 
  <p>Prosecutors said Boelter also visited the homes of two other lawmakers on Saturday while disguised as a police officer, apparently targeting more victims. Investigators have said they discovered a list in his car that included the names of dozens of legislators.</p> 
  <p>Boelter was charged with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree attempted murder in Hennepin County. The county’s chief prosecutor, <strong>Mary Moriarty</strong>, said at a news conference today that her office would seek first-degree murder charges, which carry a mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole.</p> 
  <p>Federal prosecutors separately charged Boelter with an array of crimes, including murder, which could lead to a death sentence.</p> 
  <p>“Political assassinations are rare,” <strong>Joseph Thompson</strong>, Minnesota’s acting US attorney, said at a news conference today. “They strike at the very core of our democracy.”</p> 
  <p>Boelter is expected to make an initial appearance in federal court on Monday afternoon.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Harvard wins extension of court order blocking Trump's international student ban</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A federal judge has said she would issue a brief extension of an order temporarily blocking <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the US to study at <strong>Harvard University</strong> while she decides whether to issue a longer-term injunction.</p> 
  <p>US district judge <strong>Allison Burroughs</strong>, at the end of a hearing in Boston in Harvard’s legal challenge to the restrictions, extended to 23 June a temporary restraining order that had been set to expire on Thursday. She said she wanted to give herself more time to prepare a ruling, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ll kick out an opinion as soon as we can.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Ian Gershengorn</strong>, a lawyer for Harvard, told her that an injunction was necessary to ensure the Trump administration could not implement his latest bid to curtail the school’s ability to host international students.</p> 
  <p>The judge scheduled the hearing after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jun/05/harvard-trump-foreign-student-ban">issuing a temporary restraining order</a> on 6 June preventing the administration from implementing a proclamation that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/trump-restricts-harvard-student-visas">Trump had signed a day earlier</a>. A preliminary injunction would provide longer-term relief to Harvard.</p> 
  <p>Gershengorn argued Trump signed the proclamation to retaliate against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/harvard-university">Harvard</a> in “plan violation” of its free speech rights under the Constitution’s first amendment for refusing to accede to his administration’s demands to control the school’s governance, curriculum and the ideology of its faculty and students.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Russia</strong> has said that the <strong>United States</strong> has cancelled the next round of talks between the two countries, an apparent setback in a process launched by presidents <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> to improve bilateral ties.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson <strong>Maria Zakharova</strong> did not say if Washington had given any reason for the break in the talks, which began after Trump returned to the White House in January.</p> 
  <p>“As of today, the next meeting within the framework of bilateral consultations on eliminating ‘irritants’ in order to normalize the activities of diplomatic missions of both countries has been cancelled at the initiative of the American negotiators,” Zakharova said. “We hope that the pause they have taken will not last too long.”</p> 
  <p>Reuters reports that Russia had said only last week that the US-Russia talks – which have been proceeding on a separate track from discussions about ending the war in <strong>Ukraine</strong> – would soon move to Moscow from Istanbul.</p> 
  <p>However, the Kremlin – while denying that dialogue had stalled – also said last week that there were “a lot of blockages in bilateral relations” and talks on improving them were not expected to yield quick results.</p> 
  <p>Both sides say there is huge potential <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/18/us-russia-ukraine-talks-riyadh-saudi-arabia">for business and investment deals</a> if relations improve. But Trump, despite holding five phone calls with Putin – most recently on Saturday – has voiced frustration about Russia’s war actions in Ukraine and the lack of any visible progress towards a peace deal.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> will begin the first full day of his trip to <strong>Canada</strong> with a meeting with Canadian prime minister <strong>Mark Carney</strong>, according to NBC News.</p> 
  <p>The meeting comes amid continuing heightened trade tensions and Trump’s referring to Canada in the past as the 51st US state.

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump Organization enters phone market with $499 'made in the USA' Trump Mobile smartphone</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Trump Organization</strong> has launched a self-branded mobile service and a $499 smartphone, dubbed <strong>Trump Mobile</strong>, signaling a new effort to court conservative consumers with a wireless service positioned as an alternative to major telecom providers.</p> 
  <p>The new mobile venture will include <strong>call centers based in the United States</strong> and <strong>phones made in America</strong>, the organization said.</p> 
  <p>“We are going to be introducing an entire package of products where people can come and they can get telemedicine on their phones for one flat monthly fee, roadside assistance on their cars, unlimited texting to 100 countries around the world,” said the president’s eldest son, <strong>Donald Trump Jr</strong>, announcing the product at Trump Tower in New York.</p> 
  <p>Per NBC News, “the venture is the latest example of Trump’s business empire capitalizing on its association with the sitting president”. Indeed, during his second term, we’ve already seen the likes of branded <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/06/trump-bible-review">Bibles</a>, gold “Never Surrender” hi-top <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/donald-trump-promotes-golden-never-surrender-hi-top-trainers-for-399-a-pair-13074631">sneakers</a> and $100,000 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/donald-trump-watches-merchandise">watches</a>.</p> 
  <p>Reuters reports that a website that went live after the announcement included details of the new Trump-branded smartphone that will be available from September, and a <strong>$47.45 a month subscription plan</strong> to the new network.</p> 
  <p>DTTM Operations - the entity managing <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s trademarks - has filed applications to use his name and the term “T1” for telecom-related services. The filings, submitted on Thursday to the <strong>US Patent and Trademark Office</strong>, cover mobile phones, accessories like cases and chargers, wireless telephone services, and possibly even retail stores.</p> 
  <p>On the website, the “T1” smartphone appears to feature a <strong>gold-colored metal case etched with an American flag</strong>. What’s more, both the name of the wireless service - “<strong>The 47 Plan</strong>” and its monthly price are references to Trump, who was the 45th US president during his first term and is now serving as the 47th.</p> 
  <p>More than 60 million smartphones are purchased annually by American consumers, but nearly all of these devices are manufactured abroad — primarily in <strong>China</strong>, <strong>South Korea</strong>, and increasingly in <strong>India</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Despite the strength of US-based tech brands, there is no significant domestic smartphone production infrastructure, largely due to high labor costs, supply chain complexity, and reliance on overseas component sourcing.</p> 
  <p>The launch of <strong>Trump Mobile</strong> comes after Trump in May threatened <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/23/donald-trump-threatens-25-percent-tariff-iphones-not-made-in-us">to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones</a> if they are not made in the United States, as he stepped up the pressure on <strong>Apple</strong> to build its signature product in the country.</p> 
  <p>Trump said in a post on Truth Social:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/india">India</a>, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Trump then said that he would also impose a 25% tariff on <strong>Samsung</strong> and any other phone manufacturer that makes phones outside of the US, or, he said, “it would not be fair”.</p> 
  <p>He told reporters at the White House:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When they build their plant here, there’s no tariffs. So they’re going to be building plants here.<br></p> 
  </blockquote>

The dangers of further escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict loomed over the meeting, with US President Donald Trump expressing hope on Sunday that a deal could be done, but no signs of the fighting abating on the fourth day of war.</p>

  <p>As Republican senators consider President Donald Trump’s big bill that could slash federal spending and extend tax cuts, a new survey shows most U.S. adults don’t think the government is overspending on the programs the GOP has focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps.</p> 
  <p>Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They’re more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.</p> 
  <p>The poll points to a disconnect between Republicans’ policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate in the coming weeks.</p>

  <p>Brussels negotiators hope that offering to accept US tariffs of 10% across all of the European Union’s exports into the United States will avert any higher duties on cars, drugs and electronics, newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Monday.</p> 
  <p>Citing high-ranking EU negotiators, the paper said the offer to US counterparts would come only under certain conditions and would not be billed as permanent.</p> 
  <p>Handelsblatt also said the EU was, in return, ready to cut its tariffs on US -made vehicles, and to possibly change technical or legal hurdles to make it easier for U.S. manufacturers to sell their cars in Europe.</p> 
  <p>The EU’s position comes partly from the realisation that US President Donald Trump will rely on some tariff revenues to fund planned tax cuts.</p>

  <p>A bright spark in the Canadian team preparing the G7 Kananaskis summit, in the ridiculously beautiful Canadian Rockies, decided to insert the issue of wildfires onto a crowded agenda. It seemed an eminently sensible and Canadian thing for the eminently sensible Canadian prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mark-carney">Mark Carney</a>, to do.</p> 
  <p>After all there are currently an estimated 225 blazes in Canada, including 120 classified as out of control, and they are raging to the west in British Columbia across to northern parts of Alberta. Indeed it is likely to be Canada’s second worst year on record for wildfires. Moreover, Carney had an ingenious solution ready to hand – a Kananaskis wildfire charter including “greater equipment interoperability” between the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/g7">G7</a> members.</p> 
  <p>But unfortunately wildfires were already on the G7 agenda, albeit in an altogether broader, even more existential sense.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A Democratic senator introduced legislation on Monday to prevent US President Donald Trump from using military force against Iran without Congress’s authorization, as an escalating battle between Israel and Iran raised fears of broader conflict.</p> 
  <p>Tim Kaine of Virginia has tried for years to wrest back Congress’s authority to declare war from the White House.</p> 
  <p>During Trump’s first term, in 2020, Kaine introduced a similar resolution to rein in Trump’s ability to wage war against Iran. That measure passed both the Senate and House of Representatives, winning some Republican support, but did not garner enough votes to survive the Republican president’s veto.</p> 
  <p>Kaine said his latest war powers resolution underscores that the US Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the sole power to declare war and requires that any hostility with Iran be explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for the use of military force.</p>

  <p>When Donald Trump last came to Canada for a G7 summit, the enduring image was of him seated with his arms folded defiantly as then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel stared daggers at him.</p> 
  <p><br>If there is a shared mission at this year’s G7 summit, which begins Monday in Canada’s Rocky Mountains, it is a desire to minimize any fireworks at a moment of combustible tensions.<br>Trump already has hit several dozen nations with severe tariffs that risk a global economic slowdown. There is little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and now a new and escalating conflict between Israel and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program.<br><br>Add to all of that the problems of climate change, immigration, drug trafficking, new technologies such as artificial intelligence and China’s continued manufacturing superiority and chokehold on key supply chains.</p> 
  <p>So it looks like the Trump, and the leaders of Japan, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany and Canada are in for a busy time.</p>

  <p>The White House has stayed decidedly mum about its goals for the G7, which originated as a 1973 finance ministers’ meeting to address the oil crisis and steadily evolved into a yearly summit that is meant to foster personal relationships among world leaders and address global problems.</p> 
  <p>There is no plan for a joint statement this year from the G7, a sign that the Trump administration sees no need to build a shared consensus with fellow democracies if it views such a statement as contrary to its goals of new tariffs, more fossil fuel production and a Europe that is less dependent on the U.S. military.</p>
