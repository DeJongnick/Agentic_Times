<p>On Horsegirl’s 2022 debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jun/03/horsegirl-versions-of-modern-performance-review-matador">Versions of Modern Performance</a>, three Chicagoan gen Z musicians robed themselves in the noise of gen X indie-rock, their chaotic carapace of distortion and dynamics housing soft-centred pop and bruised melodies. But its fuzzy charms are eclipsed by this quantum leap of a second album, a masterpiece of intention and purposefulness. Produced by Cate Le Bon, Phonetics On and On prunes away the clatter and finds new power in restraint.</p>    <p>Their references now are the third Velvets album, the first Raincoats record, and the Feelies. Nora Cheng and Penelope Lowenstein’s guitars are taut and brittle, and there’s not a wasted moment. With sonic austerity comes a newfound lyrical clarity; sweet songs of loneliness, displacement and confusion that find lucidity in simplicity – like Frontrunner’s refrain of “In the morning when you’re sleeping / I can’t wait” – sung in knowingly deadpan, subtle voices.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Horsegirl: Phonetics On and On">  <iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7C51cbjlLSILLTMVnxbrOc?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The results are a joy. 2468 is perfect minimalist pop, its giddy sharp edges piercing the subconscious like a barb; the glint of joy behind the dry, austere dispassion of Lowenstein’s vocal is exquisite, best heard on Well I Know You’re Shy; I Can’t Stand to See You is almost Strokes-esque in its concision, its embarrassment of hooks and pop flourishes. The album feels almost clockwork: every element machine-tooled, a place for everything, and everything in its place. But there’s no coldness here, the poignancy only accentuated by the poise with which these songs are delivered, the 7/8ths of the iceberg further revealing itself with each play.</p>
