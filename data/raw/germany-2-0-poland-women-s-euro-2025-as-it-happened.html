Jule Brand scored a pearler-curler, Lea Schüller made up for missing one close-range header by netting another, and Klara Bühl was outstanding on the left flank all evening. Even so, the normally efficient goalscorer Ewa Pajor missed a couple of big chances for the Poles that might have altered the course of the story. So Germany still have work to do if they’re to deliver on their dark-horse status, while major-tournament newbies Poland will take heart from a decent performance against a team that was expected to dispatch them with ease. Everyone sort of happy, in their own way.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-04T21:08:04.430Z">at 10.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68683fa58f0833eb8520e9b1" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-04T20:56:23.315Z">9.56pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">FULL TIME: Germany 2-0 Poland</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Germany get their opening win as expected.

Poland by comparison are making their tournament debut this evening. Then take the head-to-head record between these two countries: Germany 6, Poland 0, to an aggregate score of 28-3. As neighbourly rivalries go, it’s a particularly lop-sided one.</p> <p><strong>But in football there’s always hope, and here’s Poland’s:</strong> <strong>they’re currently on an 11-match unbeaten run, a sequence that incorporates ten wins.</strong> Yay! The only problem is, just before they began that run last year, they were beaten home and away by … you can tell where this is heading, can’t you … Germany. A 4-1 defeat away, a 3-1 loss at home. Oh, and Germany are on a five-game winning run of their own, having scored 24 goals in those matches. Which may explain why you can get odds of 33-1 on their winning this evening. So this should be a shoo-in for Germany, a chance to make a statement like Spain did last night. We’ll find out whether the <em>Frauenteam</em> make good on that promise soon enough. <strong>Kick-off is at 8pm UK time.</strong> It’s on!</p> </div>   </div>
