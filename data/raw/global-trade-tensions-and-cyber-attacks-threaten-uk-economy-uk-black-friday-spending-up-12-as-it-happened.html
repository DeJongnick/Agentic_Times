Fraudsters design offers that appear to be fleeting, pressuring shoppers to act quickly without thoroughly evaluating the legitimacy of the deal.<br><br>Phrases such as ‘limited time offer’ or ‘only a few items left’ can be red flags. Making hasty decisions could prove costly, so you should always stop and take a moment to assess the offer critically before proceeding.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Fear and anxiety</strong> – Scammers often incite fear by suggesting that failing to act immediately could result in negative consequences, such as missing out on a deal or facing account issues. <br><br>Emails from retailers are rife at this time of year, but messages claiming that your account has been compromised and urging you to click a link to verify your information are common scams. You should always verify such claims by directly contacting the retailer or service provider through official channels.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Greed and excitement</strong> – Scammers know that the allure of significant discounts can cloud judgement, so you should always question the authenticity of deals that offer products at prices well below market value. It is wise to compare prices across multiple trusted sources to validate the offer, and shop only from secure, official websites. <br><br>You should always look for a padlock symbol in the address bar and verify that the URL starts with “https://”. Secure connections protect your personal and financial information from being intercepted by malicious actors.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id="block-674966628f088c7046fdf5ee" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-29T07:07:32.687Z">7.07am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">The best Black Friday deals on the products we love....</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/oct/10/welcome-to-the-filter-the-guardians-home-for-product-reviews-and-recommendations">The Filter</a>, the Guardian’s home for product reviews and recommendations, has rounded up some of the best Black Friday deals on offer in the UK.</strong></p> <p>They’ve picked out genuine Black Friday deals – namely, discounts that undercuts the item’s long-term average price by a notable amount, rather than reversing an October price hike (a tactic popular with less scruplous retailers).</p> <p>The list includes air fryers, food mixers, a handheld steamer, a coffee machine, hand-held weighs, tech kit, and clothes….</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/28/best-black-friday-deals-cyber-monday-2024">The best Black Friday deals on the products we love: air fryers, heated throws and Shakira’s hair waver</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67495b068f0816561c49e7b7" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-29T07:04:10.629Z">7.04am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Introduction: Retailers hoping for Black Friday sales lift</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.</strong></p> <p>UK retailers will be hoping for a surge of Black Friday sales today, after bad weather hit takings in November.</p> <p>This month has been tough for Britain’s retailers, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/26/storm-bert-offers-stark-reminder-of-uks-underfunded-flood-defences">Storm Bert brought high winds, heavy rain, flooding and transport disruption</a> to parts of the country.</p> <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, footfall on UK high streets fell 5% last week, and was 10% lower than a year ago.
