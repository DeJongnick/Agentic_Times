<p>I love the internet. People from the time before the internet always talk about how great that time was. They’re lying. Some things were exactly the same: there was love and war, and people pushed doors clearly marked “pull”, especially if someone was watching. But we had to bear these experiences without a tool to ferret out as much information as possible about anything or anyone at any time. So it was definitely a worse time.</p> <p>When a dial-up connection came into my life at 12, I threw myself at the internet with the intensity usually reserved for Backstreet Boys dances. I’ve aggressively communicated on every virtual platform since its inception, and the best bit is the link to all the funnies.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>I don’t have to warn anyone that I’m strange any more – I’m a comedian now so it’s assumed – but it was a surprise to myself that this list came out as mostly music and animals. Here it is in no particular order.</p> <h2><strong>1. Giant Pandas falling over</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLQiAqc1MI8"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLQiAqc1MI8?start=27&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=27" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It’s hard knowing that I’ll never write a joke as funny as someone falling over. When I’m having a bad day, I watch giant pandas falling over to cackle (they’re totally fine, it’s part of their development according to this zoo).</p> <h2><strong>2. Graham Norton – David Attenborough</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Z5k1_LgkE"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f7Z5k1_LgkE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Sir Attenborough can narrate absolutely anything, including this tortoise trying to mate with a shoe.</p> <h2><strong>3. Anisa Nandaula</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Video of Anisa Nandaula pretending to be a snake, lizard and spider intercut with footage of Robert Irwin handling those animals/insects.">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@anisa_nandaula/video/7491543093527858440&quot; data-video-id=&quot;7491543093527858440&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@anisa_nandaula&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@anisa_nandaula?refer=embed&quot;&gt;@anisa_nandaula&lt;/a&gt; Maybe he won&amp;#39;t notice &lt;a title=&quot;australiatikt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/australiatikt?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#australiatikt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;aussieticktok&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/aussieticktok?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#aussieticktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;aussietok?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/aussietok%3F?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#aussietok?&lt;/a&gt; australiatok &lt;a title=&quot;robertirwintiktok&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/robertirwintiktok?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#robertirwintiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;robertirwin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/robertirwin?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#robertirwin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;♬ som original - 𝑷𝒆𝒅𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒂𝒔🎵&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/som-original-7290729809591716613?refer=embed&quot;&gt;♬ som original - 𝑷𝒆𝒅𝒓𝒂𝒅𝒂𝒔🎵&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There are many wildly talented people in Australian comedy making everyone laugh. No one does it in under 10 seconds like Anisa – here she is pretending to be a snake to get closer to Robert Irwin.</p> <h2><strong>4. Lonely Island – Captain Jack Sparrow (feat Michael Bolton)</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI6CfKcMhjY"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GI6CfKcMhjY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This is the sum total of my deep love of Michael Bolton, Erin Brockovich, my nightclub era and the height of Lonely Island’s dominance of the internet. There is something about Michael – we are on first name terms, but he doesn’t know that – saying “well hey there, I’m a legal lady” that still gets me.</p> <h2><strong>5. Taylor Swift – Trouble (Goat Remix)</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aLYvZ5sX28"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-aLYvZ5sX28?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Taylor Swift’s Trouble was on every radio wave when my brother happened upon this video mixing the chorus with a screaming goat and it never fails to dissolve me into laughter.</p> <h2><strong>6. Lawyer or cat</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGOofzZOyl8"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lGOofzZOyl8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The year that was 2020 was hard on all of us but this lawyer who turned up to a virtual courtroom as a cat had an especially difficult day.</p> <h2><strong>7. Jonathan Bynoe – Lovely Day</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqwCxt6QAO0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dqwCxt6QAO0?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>If you’ve ever wondered what happened in a studio on the day a song was recorded, this man answers it for you. My favourite is Lovely Day.</p> <h2><strong>8. Avicii vs Nicky Romero – I Could Be The One</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bek1y2uiQGA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bek1y2uiQGA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>There’s a scene in this music video where she smashes a printer in the office in slow motion and I used to watch it on repeat to feel joy. In hindsight, there were many signs that I wasn’t happy being a lawyer.</p> <h2><strong>9. Lou Wall – Where is Bed</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HXFurHCkP8"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8HXFurHCkP8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>If you’ve tried to put something on Facebook Marketplace, you’ll start by relating to this and end by not being able to breathe because you’re laughing so hard. That was my experience when I saw it live, it just keeps escalating.</p> <h2><strong>10. Birds Who Were Named By People Who Clearly Hated Birds</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/stu_bot3000/status/1356921656946679810">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My favourite species of birds are the ones named by people who clearly hate birds.
