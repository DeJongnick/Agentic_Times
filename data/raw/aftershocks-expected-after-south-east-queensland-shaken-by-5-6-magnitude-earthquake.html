More than 16,000 “felt reports” had been registered as of Saturday afternoon, from as far away as Brisbane and the Gold Coast to the south, and Bundaberg to the north.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/embed-zip/giv-32554UITxq16E3tpS" data-alt="Map of Queensland 5.6-magnitude earthquake location, highlighting where Kilkivan is in relation to Gympie, Brisbane and the Gold Coast"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/embed-zip/giv-32554UITxq16E3tpS">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“I don’t think anybody expected to wake up to that today in Queensland,” the state premier, David Crisafulli, said on Saturday. “There’s been some amazing stories that have come through and we obviously are waiting to see … damage and we hope everyone is OK.”</p> <p>Michelle Salmon, a seismologist with Geoscience Australia, said the only stronger recent earthquake was an offshore temblor in 2016 near Bowen in the state’s north.</p> <p>“This is the largest earthquake we’ve had onshore in Queensland for 50 years,” she said on Saturday. “We can certainly expect more aftershocks from this event.”</p> <p>Across the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane and the Gold Coast, people reported their houses shaking and a low rumble.</p> <p>Sue Krucker was home in Mount Mellum on the Sunshine Coast – 100km from the epicentre – when the quake struck.</p> <p>Krucker said she had lived through 13 cyclones, and was intimately familiar with the safety precautions for those, but earthquakes were highly unusual for Queensland.</p> <p>“I was sitting in our home office, and the first thing I noticed was our printer activated, and then one of the pot plants started to shake.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/why-did-wednesday-earthquake-tsunami-produce-so-little-damage">Why did such a powerful earthquake and tsunami cause so little damage?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It was moving like a Mexican wave, from one thing to the next: the printer, the plant, my chair, my desk, my monitor. It kept progressing. Then my phone came up with an earthquake alert. It was almost a surreal moment.</p> <p>“It lasted quite a while. Doors were moving. This house is a split-level Queenslander – the house was definitely moving. And when I went to stand up, my legs were shaky, I felt like I was on a rocky boat. And for sometime afterwards, I felt like my equilibrium had not been restored.”</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/GeoscienceAus/status/1956514937137659940">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve detected an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/earthquake?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#earthquake</a> with a preliminary magnitude of 5.6 at 9:49 AM in Kilkivan, Queensland.
