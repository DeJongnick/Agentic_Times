<h2><strong>Berlin</strong></h2> <p>A city as celebrated for its quirkiness as Berlin is almost duty-bound to deliver on the flea market front – plus, many of its shops close on Sundays, making market browsing the natural retail fix.</p> <p>Although Mauerpark<strong> </strong>in the Prenzlauer Berg<strong> </strong>district is well known for its flea market and sells good stuff, if you have the patience to rummage through the inevitable piles of tat, smaller markets tend to have more interesting one-off finds. A favourite is Arkonaplatz in the Mitte district, which is especially alluring in autumn when the light and surrounding trees take on golden shades. There’s old film and camera equipment to be had here, as well as industrial furniture. My favourite buy is a huge, hand-crocheted blanket in shades of lapis and rust.</p> <p>The Rathaus Schöneberg flea market in Tempelhof-Schöneberg is one of Berlin’s oldest, and is located where John F Kennedy made his famous “<em>Ich bin ein Berliner</em>” speech. It’s mostly the wares of people having a clear-out, as opposed to professional dealers, and is affordable.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>For the most beautiful setting, the Bode antique and book market on Museum Island is pure romance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lesser known to non-Berliners, Neukölln’s Kranoldplatz Flohmarkt – in one of the city’s most vibrant alternative neighbourhoods – is a good choice for cool castoffs. Strict regulations limit what vendors can sell, too, so you’re spared much of the new, mass-produced junk you might find elsewhere.</p> <p>For the most beautiful setting, though, the Bode antique and book market on Museum Island is pure romance. I can’t read any of the books I’ve bought there, nor have I ever served cake with the silver-plated slice I found there, but who cares?</p> <p>Secondhand stores can be found all over the city – but it’s worth homing in on Friedrichshain. It’s home to Europe’s biggest Humana store (five floors of vintage treasure, including a selection of lederhosen) and there are several smaller outfits here, too. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/v_vintagefashionberlin/">V Vintage</a> (Kopernikusstraße 18 and Grünberger Straße 50) has a great range of pieces, from vintage denim to retro après-ski, while <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/SoulAndStyleVintage">Soul and Style</a> (Krossener Straße 24 and Frankfurter Allee 35-37) serves up fashion with a distinctly 80s flair, complete with band T-shirts, glitter and lurid shell suits. <br><em>For more insider tips, check out </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ezcape/">@ezcape</a></em><em>, </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessica.miusha/">@jessica.miusha</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Athens</strong></h2>    <p>Who wouldn’t have old things on their mind when visiting the cradle of western civilisation? Once you’ve taken in the Acropolis and Parthenon, swerve the stalls selling fridge magnets of ancient ruins and head to the port city of Piraeus. About 5&nbsp;miles south-west of Athens, it’s where the ferries depart for hundreds of Greek islands and a Sunday flea market takes place, alongside the railway tracks, until 2pm-ish. There’s often good retro clothing and vintage homewares – be prepared to rummage, sometimes at ground level, as not all vendors set up on tables. Then head for lunch at one of the many waterfront restaurants.</p> <p>Another Sunday option is Pazari Rakosyllekton, or Scavengers’ Fleamarket (the name alone gets my treasure-hunt heart racing), a few minutes’ walk from Eleonas station, selling everything from furniture and homewares to books and records. Having found Olivia Newton-John’s Xanadu here, I feel I’ve peaked.</p> <p>Elsewhere, curated vintage stores include <a href="https://www.kilo-shop.com/en/shop/athenes/">Kilo Shop</a> (Ermou 120), where finds are charged by weight and rails restocked every second day. Higher-end options include <a href="https://anthophilevintage.com/">Anthophile Vintage</a><strong> </strong>(Zoodochou Pigis 55), where florals and whimsy reign, and <a href="https://handpickedcherriesvintage.com/">Handpicked Cherries</a><strong> </strong>(Frinis 51) for vintage leather and Y2K treats. <br><em>For more insider tips, check out</em><em> </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/athens_thrifts/?hl=en">@athens_thrifts</a></em><em>, </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/posh.vintage/?hl=en">@posh.vintage</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Stockholm</strong></h2>    <p>Sweden and its Scandi neighbours are known for being savagely pricey, so balance the books with a touch of secondhand shopping. Stockholm has two stores from the popular European chain <a href="https://www.humanasecondhand.se/">Humana</a> – one in the Norrmalm district and another in Södermalm – good for clothing and accessories. With several locations around the city, <a href="https://www.myrorna.se/">Myrorna</a> – owned by the Swedish arm of the Salvation Army – is more for your home than wardrobe. Gustavsberg porcelain and stylish glassware by Kosta Boda pop up frequently, as do pieces by other Nordic brands, such as Marimekko.<br><br>Södermalm is also home to a branch of the UK chain <a href="https://www.beyondretro.com/pages/store-locator-uk">Beyond Retro</a> and <a href="https://www.judits.se/second-hand">Judits Second Hand</a> (Hornsgatan 75), which operates partly on a consignment basis, selling unwanted garments of local people for a split. </p> <p>For a particularly Swedish experience, seek out a <em>loppis</em>. Not quite a garage sale, not quite a flea market, it’s an immensely popular way to socialise on a weekend, while unearthing the treasure that is someone else’s trash. Some are spontaneous, others semi-permanent with on-site refreshment and music. Spring and summer are prime times for <em>loppisrunda</em><em> (</em>loppis-hopping), especially in the countryside, but they&nbsp;can be found year-round (check <a href="http://loppiskartan.se/">loppiskartan.se</a>). A vintage Swedish Christmas tablecloth with matching fabric napkins and a pair of sleek brass reindeer, all from Uppsala, a 40-minute train journey north of Stockholm, remain beloved finds. <br><em>For more insider tips, check out</em><em> </em><em> </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/modernretrostockholm/?hl=en">@modernretrostockholm</a></em><em>, </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vintageretrosimon/?hl=en">@vintage</a></em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/vintageretrosimon/?hl=en">retrosimon</a> </em><em>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/myrornaropsten/?locale=kk-KZ&amp;hl=af">@myrornaopsten</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Madrid</strong></h2>    <p>Fast-fashion behemoth Zara was born&nbsp;in Spain, and although its largest retail store worldwide is in Madrid, the capital isn’t enslaved to high-street dressing. As well as its 29 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/humana_secondhand_es/?hl=es">Humana</a> shops, where you might stumble upon anything from 90s streetwear to 50s corsetry, those with a yen for designer labels should check out the city’s many upmarket secondhand boutiques, which are more akin to&nbsp;concept stores&nbsp;than thrift shops.</p> <p>Try <a href="https://www.second-chance.es/en">Second Chance</a><strong> </strong>in the city centre (Calle de la Virgen de los Peligros 11) for lightly used clothes by&nbsp;names such as Loewe, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Yves Saint Laurent. While not exactly bargains, they are far more affordable than they would be new.</p> <p>Denim is the staple at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/friperie.madrid/#">Friperie</a><strong> </strong>(Calle Rodriguez San Pedro 2), which has been name-checked by Vogue; and for those who consider Y2K to be vintage (rude) then <a href="https://neareclothes.com/">Neare</a><strong> </strong>in the centre<strong> </strong>(Corre Alta de San Pablo 21)<strong> </strong>has a&nbsp;varied selection of clothing and accessories.</p> <p>At <a href="https://tiendassolidarias.org/">Piel de Mariposa</a> (Calle Embajadores 35)<strong> </strong>there are books, vinyl and homewares, as well as a good range of fashion and accessories, many for under €10 apiece.</p> <p>The traditional flea market experience is also readily available in&nbsp;Madrid: El Rastro, home to many restaurants and bars, bursts into life on Sundays, when the flea market takes over the neighbourhood. Be prepared to wade through lots of rubbish, but when you do strike gold (for me, the vintage ceramics are particularly beguiling) it glitters for real.<br><em>For more insider tips, check out </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/rastro_madrid/?hl=en">@rastro_madrid</a></em><em>, </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/matiz.life/">@matiz.life</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Amiens</strong></h2>    <p>There are plenty of reasons to visit Amiens, the capital of the Picardy region: France’s largest Gothic cathedral, the country’s first purpose-built museum (with displays covering everything from Egyptian artefacts to&nbsp;Francis Bacon), and for Channel-hoppers it’s only a 90-minute drive from Calais. Plus, twice a year it hosts <a href="https://www.grande-rederie-amiens.com/en">the Réderie, one of the largest flea markets in France</a>.<br>On the second last Sunday in April and the first Sunday in October, 2,000-plus vendors spread over 50-odd streets in the town centre.</p> <p>Aim&nbsp;to arrive on the Saturday, as many&nbsp;of the vendors start setting up the night before. So wrap up warmly, wear comfortable shoes and a head torch, and maybe you’ll bag an early bargain. Take a camping trolley for your finds: some of my favourites have included framed floral needlepoints, heavy brass swans and acrylic candleholders.<br><br>While the biannual market is the big draw, the town has plenty to keep vintage lovers happy year-round. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fripes_et_merveilles/?hl=en">Fripes et Merveilles</a> (151 Rue Gaulthier de Rumilly) is a time capsule of well-priced finds, from bric-a-brac to jewellery. Prices are far higher at <a href="https://www.silkandroses.fr/">Silk &amp;&nbsp;Roses</a> (18 Rue Saint-Martin aux Waides), but expect to find the likes of&nbsp;Kenzo, Moschino and Yves Saint Laurent. Meanwhile, <a href="https://iconefriperie.fr/">Icône Friperie</a> (21&nbsp;Rue du Général Leclerc) charges by&nbsp;the kilo – €30 a haul.<br><em>For more insider tips, check out </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/search/keyword/?q=%23grandrederieamiens">#grandrederieamiens</a></em><em>, </em><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/se_souvenir_des_belles_choses/?hl=en">@se_souvenir_des_belles_choses</a></em></p>
