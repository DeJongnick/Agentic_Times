<p>Zarah Sultana has consulted defamation lawyers after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/18/jeremy-corbyn-clashes-zarah-sultana-your-party-split">her public spat with Jeremy Corbyn</a> over the launch of a paid membership system for the party they were to co-lead.</p> 
<p>Sultana said she has been on the receiving end of “politically motivated” attacks amid the row that has engulfed the launch of Your party. Corbyn had previously urged people not to use the “supposed membership portal”, and said legal advice was being taken over its launch.</p> 
<p>Late on Friday evening, Sultana said there had been “baseless attacks on my character [that] are politically motivated”, adding that she intended to “hold to account those responsible for making them. To that end, I have this evening instructed specialist defamation lawyers.”</p> 
<p>The Coventry South MP claimed several “false and defamatory statements” had been published about her. “The portal was properly launched in accordance with the party’s roadmap. At no point was members’ data misused or put at risk. All funds received from members were ringfenced and protected in the appropriate manner.”</p> 
<p>Sultana’s statement comes after she previously said she had been subjected to a “sexist boys’ club” amid the row over the membership system.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Corbyn spoke out in defence of a key aide Sultana had named in criticism of the way the party was being run. Speaking at the annual conference of his Peace and Justice Project, Corbyn said: “She has had an awful lot of stick and criticism this week. I just want to say this. I’ve known Karie Murphy for many, many years and I’m appalled when people attack an individual like her.”<br><br>Noting that it is rare for Corbyn to become personally involved in confrontation – and to publicly name aides – the Times quoted him as saying: “She’d walk on burning coals for a cause that she believes in and I want to say: ‘Thank you, Karie.’”</p> 
<p>Sultana had previously said: “I do not believe members will accept Karie Murphy and her associates having sole financial control of members’ money and sole constitutional control of our conference. This undermines the democratic principles we agreed to uphold.”</p> 
<p>On Thursday morning, an invitation went out to supporters of the outfit, so far described as “Your party” in its campaign material, inviting them to officially sign up and give it financial backing.</p>

<p>But Corbyn described this as an “unauthorised email” and warned people not to sign up using the link, in a statement also signed by the four other independent MPs who have set up an ad-hoc parliamentary group with Corbyn and Sultana.</p> 
<p>In turn, Sultana said: “After being sidelined by the MPs named in today’s statement and effectively frozen out of the official accounts, I took the step of launching a membership portal so that supporters could continue to engage and organise.”</p> 
<p>Despite Corbyn’s warning, she said supporters of Your party should “sign up now” as the portal was a “safe, secure, legitimate” means of becoming a member of the party.</p> 
<p>She added: “My sole motivation has been to safeguard the grassroots involvement that is essential in building this party. Unfortunately, I have been subjected to what can only be described as a sexist boys’ club: I have been treated appallingly and excluded completely.”</p> 
<p>Later on Thursday, the party said it had reported itself to the UK’s data protection watchdog over the morning email, claiming that a “false membership system has been unilaterally launched”.</p>

<p>It said data had been collected and payments taken and that the data controller had flagged the matter with the Information Commissioner’s Office, citing its “responsibilities to our supporters and duties under the law”.</p> 
<p>The row is the latest in a series of disagreements between the two MPs over the direction of the party, which is yet to hold an annual conference or decide on an official name.</p> 
<p>Sultana announced its launch before Corbyn appeared ready to confirm it. And she has also reportedly clashed with Adnan Hussain, the independent MP for Blackburn, over their different views on transgender rights.</p> 
<p>The party appeared to be building momentum, with Sultana claiming more than 750,000 supporters had signed up.</p>
