Now prime minister Netanyahu is contemplating re-occupying Gaza entirely. Is he defying you, sir, or are you giving him a green light?” Bilbassy Charters, who grew up in Gaza, <a href="https://x.com/AlArabiya/status/1953239302420197793">asked</a>.</p> <p>Trump avoided the thorny question of whether or not he supports the Israeli prime minister’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/israel-issues-forced-displacement-orders-amid-fears-of-full-occupation-in-gaza">reported plan</a> to forgo a peace deal with Hamas and opt for full-scale military occupation of the Palestinian territory. Instead, he pivoted to the boast that, “we have stopped wars in the Middle East, by stopping Iran from having a nuclear weapon.”</p> <p>The president was far more comfortable with questions laced with praise from two correspondents from far-right news outlets the White House invited to be present.</p> <p>One of them, <strong>Daniel Baldwin</strong>, the chief White House correspondent for the fringe, pro-Trump cable channel One America News, asked the president to talk about how the “manufacturing renaissance” he is bringing about “will positively impact the millions of Americans that trusted you with their vote”.</p> <p>The other, <strong>Brian Glenn</strong>, a correspondent for Real America’s Voice, a network set up to host Steve Bannon’s podcast, told Trump he had “an entertainment-based question”.</p> <p>“A few weeks ago, Stephen Colbert announced that he was leaving his show. Howard Stern announced that him and SiriusXM radio are parting ways. Do you think the ‘Hate Trump’ business model that’s been in the entertainment business is going out of business?” Glenn asked.</p> <p>Stern has made no such announcement, although he is near the end of his contract with the satellite radio provider and there are rumors that the 71-year-old shock jock might end his show.</p> <p>Trump, a ratings-obsessed, former game-show host, eagerly took the invitation to trash late-night comedians who have mocked him. “Colbert has no talent,” he said. “Fallon has no talent. Kimmel has no talent. They’re next, I hear they’re going to be going.”</p> <p>As for Stern, who frequently hosted Trump on his show before the developer turned reality TV host entered politics, “I haven’t heard that name in a long time,” Trump said.</p> <p>“You know when he went down?” Trump asked. “When he endorsed Hillary Clinton, he lost his audience.” That seems unlikely, given that SiriusXM increased Stern’s salary from $90m a year in 2020, four years after he endorsed Clinton. In December 2020, as Trump was frantically lying about his election loss to Joe Biden, SiriusXM offered Stern an improved five-year, $500m deal which he accepted.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-07T00:49:01.114Z">at 1.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6893c50b8f0879cbbcaaeced" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-06T23:10:32.675Z">12.10am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">ICC arrest warrant for Putin limits where any summit with Trump could take place</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The White House confirmed on Wednesday that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> could meet <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> to try to broker an end to the Russian war on Ukraine as soon as next week, but finding a neutral venue to host the summit might not be easy, given that the Russian president was <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and">indicted for war crimes</a> in 2023 by the international criminal court, and so is subject to arrest in 125 countries.</p> <p>That rules out Helsinki, where Trump and Putin <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/07/16/live-trump-and-putin-meet-in-helsinkis-hall-of-mirrors/">met in 2018</a>, since Finland is one of the <a href="https://asp.icc-cpi.int/states-parties#S">125 state parties</a> to the Rome statute authorizing the ICC, and so would be obliged to act on the court’s arrest warrant should Putin visit. Switzerland, Austria, Iceland, Malta, France, Spain and the United Kingdom, which all hosted cold war era summits between American and Soviet leaders, are also out, for the same reason.</p> <p>Potsdam, where Truman met Stalin in 1945, is also impossible, since Germany is also a signatory to the ICC treaty.</p> <p>Yalta, where FDR met Stalin and Churchill earlier the same year, would no doubt appeal to Trump’s sense of his own historic importance, but it is, inconveniently for the subject matter of these talks, in Crimea, which was the first part of Ukraine seized by Russia in 2014.</p> <p>Trump is also unlikely to be welcome in Tehran, where FDR, Stalin and Churchill met in 1943, given the US air strikes on Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities six weeks ago.</p> <p>That could mean organizing a summit in Saudi Arabia or Turkey, where talks between Russia and Ukraine have already been held.</p> <p>Another possibility is Hungary, given that its prime minister, <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong>, is close to both Trump and Putin, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/03/hungary-to-pull-out-of-icc-as-netanyahu-visits-hungary">announced</a> his government’s intention to leave the ICC in April, while welcoming Israel’s prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>, to Budapest, despite an ICC warrant against him for war crimes in Gaza.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office earlier today, <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1953209514305487086">Trump said</a>: “We had some very good talks with president Putin today and there’s a very good chance that we could be ending the, ending the round — ending the end of that road. That road was long, and continues to be long, but there’s a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon”.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-07T00:52:13.221Z">at 1.52am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6893cc718f0879cbbcaaed11" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-06T22:00:03.714Z">11.00pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump says he could try to overturn DC home rule and deploy national guard troops</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Donald Trump said that White House lawyers “are already studying” the possibility of legislation to overturn the law granting the District of Columbia self-rule and imposing direct federal control of the capital.

And we’re still trying to run our business or explain to our boss why we’re not there. We try to live, you know, we try to live a normal life, and we will rely on each other”.</p> <p>Texas’ part-time lawmakers earn <a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3/CN.3.24.htm#:~:text=(a)%20Members%20of%20the%20Legislature,the%20salary%20is%20that%20amount.">just $600 a month</a>, so many have other jobs and have been forced to work remotely from outside the state, if they can.</p> <p>Martinez Fischer wanted to make sure people knew that he and his colleagues are still doing legislative work, even though they’re not in Austin. He mentioned that he filed two bills yesterday.</p> <p>He said this was his fourth quorum break. He said he was a “one bag guy” and had packed some leisure wear to wear with polos and his best suit he could stretch out a few days. “I’m wearing some clothes today that I haven’t worn yet. So, you know, that’s a small success for me”.</p> <p>“When we talk about the grand scheme of what we, what we’re doing here and why we’re here, I mean, there are people who have had it a whole lot worse than me”, he said.</p> <p>He also said this quorum break feels different than the one in 2021, when Democrats fled the state for several weeks to try and stop a bill with sweeping new voting restrictions from going into effect. </p> <p>“2021, we spent more time trying to convince the country that there was an issue, right? This time, you know, there is no tutorial necessary and everybody is laser focused on the issue before us”, he said. “We don’t have to debate somebody on the merits of this walkout.

He declined to say. </p> <p>“These quorum checks and the strategies and end games are kind of best left undiscussed”, he said. “It’s a very fluid, it’s a very fluid dynamic. The idea that we had on Sunday may be different next Sunday”.</p> <p>Martinez Fischer said he’s not really concerned about the $500 per day fines lawmakers are accruing under state legislature rules enacted in 2023. “Not concerned about it at all”, he said. “We’ve had rules set aside before, and courts don’t have to interpret the rules the way Republicans want them to be interpreted”.</p> <p>He said he also wasn’t fazed by threats from top Texas Republicans to ask courts to remove Democratic lawmakers from office. Abbott filed a long-shot legal bid to do so against Gene Wu, the chair of the Democratic caucus, on Tuesday evening.</p> <p>“I think he recognizes that he’s on the losing side of this narrative”, Martinez Fischer said. “I think that the theories by which the governor is trying to remove people from office has a much more structured procedure than just filing some papers with the supreme court.

It’s one that has grown by the day, so here’s where things stand at the moment.</p> <p>State Democratic lawmakers <strong>broke quorum for two consecutive days</strong> – forestalling the Texas legislature’s special session. Democrats fled the state over the weekend to protest a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/texas-redistricting-voter-maps-democrats-explained">new GOP-drawn congressional map </a>that could see Republicans pick up five extra House seats in the 2026 midterms if it passes.</p> <p>While the legislators camp out in blue states like Illinois, New York and Massachusetts for “as long as it takes”, they’ve also set the stage for a showdown between the Texas governor and nationwide Democrats. The Texas Tribune reports that former <strong>Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke</strong> has been a top funder covering the costs of the lawmakers’ exodus. A reminder, fleeing Democrats are also facing a $500-a-day fine for leaving the special session without permission. It’s a fee that representatives the Guardian has spoken to are paying out of their own pocket.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>senator John Cornyn of Texas</strong> has asked the FBI to aid Texas law enforcement in locating and arresting Democrats who left the state. For his part, the state’s Republican <strong>attorney general Ken Paxton</strong> said he would pursue a court ruling to declare the seats of “any rogue lawmakers” vacant if they do not return to work at the statehouse by Friday.</p> <p>Beyond Texas’s borders, a redistricting “arms race” –&nbsp;as <strong>state representative</strong> <strong>Gina Hinojosa</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/texas-republicans-redistricting-maps-trump">described to the Guardian</a> –&nbsp;has ensued. <strong>California governor Gavin Newsom </strong>is pushing for a special election to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/gavin-newsom-special-election-california-redistricting">ask voters to override the state’s redistricting commission</a>, and approve new maps that would favor California Democrats if Texas moved forward with its gerrymandering plan.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-06T17:14:50.057Z">at 6.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68935bab8f08ef556a64828a" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-06T13:45:08.367Z">2.45pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>A White House official confirms to the Guardian that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will make an announcement today that Apple plans to spend another $100bn on domestic manufacturing.</p> <p>Apple CEO, Tim Cook, is expected to attend.
