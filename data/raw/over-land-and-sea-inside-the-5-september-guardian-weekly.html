<p>In 2015 – which has now come to be seen as the peak of Europe’s migration crisis – nearly 1 million asylum seekers tried to reach the continent by perilous journeys over land and sea. Most were refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war, but many also came from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and other countries across the Middle East and Africa.</p> <p>In doing so they would test the core values of the European Union, itself an organisation that grew out of the ashes of a war that displaced millions. Ten years on, Guardian reporter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lorenzo-tondo">Lorenzo Tondo</a> catches up with one Syrian refugee who reflects on the 4,400km journey he undertook to Germany, and how his life has progressed since.</p> <p>Also as part of our big story package, the Guardian’s European community affairs correspondent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ashifa-kassam">Ashifa Kassam</a> reports on the growing wave of anti-migrant vigilantes in Europe and what their emergence signifies.</p> <p>And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nesrinemalik">Nesrine Malik</a>’s excellent commentary explores the cyclical and escalating nature of anti-immigration rhetoric and policy, especially in the UK and US. Nesrine argues that the issue is deliberately manipulated by politicians, with the goalposts constantly shifting so no measure, no matter how extreme, can ever satisfy the demand for “fewer” immigrants.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM53X">Special offer: get 12 editions of the Guardian Weekly for just £/$/€12</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Five essential reads in this week’s edition</h2>    <p><em><strong>Spotlight</strong></em><strong> | Is Trump trying to rig the midterms?<br></strong>With elections next year, the US president is pushing extraordinary measures to ensure the Republicans maintain control of the legislature, reports <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith">David Smith</a></p> <p><em><strong>Spotlight</strong></em><strong> | Friction on the Nato border <br></strong>In North Karelia, the border force says the fence dividing Finland and Russia is no Berlin Wall – but it is now a key geopolitical faultline. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/miranda-bryant">Miranda Bryant</a> reports</p> <p><em><strong>Feature</strong></em><strong> | What the Netflix algorithm did to the movies<br></strong>When the streaming giant began making films guided by data, the results were often generic, forgettable, artless affairs.
