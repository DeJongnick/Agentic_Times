<p>Good morning.</p> <p>The Trump administration said it would provide only partial relief to recipients of food stamps on Monday, amid mounting uncertainty among the nearly 42 million people on the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap).</p> <p>The Department of Agriculture said it would use contingency funds to keep benefits going, but for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap">just 50% of the usual funds</a>. Money for the program officially ran out on Saturday as a result of the government shutdown, which is now in its 35th day and showing no sign of ending as congressional Republicans continue their standoff with the Democrats.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How did we get here?</strong> As a result of the shutdown, Donald Trump has threatened to cut off the food benefits for the first time in the program’s more than 60-year history. A federal judge last week prevented the Department of Agriculture from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension">suspending</a> Snap altogether.</p></li> <li><p><strong>What impact will it have?</strong> There have already been long lines at food banks across the nation. Chris Stein <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions">spoke to people</a> affected, with many saying they would have to scrimp on food to get by. “I’m dumbfounded by the cruelty,” one said.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Polls open across the nation as Trump threatens to cut funds if Mamdani wins New York City mayoral election</strong></h2>    <p>The candidates for New York City mayor spent a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/new-york-city-mayoral-race-mamdani-cuomo">frantic final day campaigning</a> across the city yesterday, as voters head to the polls today in New York, as well as for governor races in New Jersey and Virginia and a redistricting ballot initiative in California.</p> <p>Last night Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-mamdani-new-york-election-mayor-cuomo">issued a threat</a> to New Yorkers: stop Zohran Mamdani or pay. “If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home,” he said, falsely labelling Mamdani, who argues for democratic socialism and has campaigned on affordability.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Can Trump even do that?</strong> The president does not directly determine how much money any city receives from the federal government; appropriation is the constitutional function of Congress. But control over how money is spent – or withheld in acts of impoundment, which are forbidden under federal law – has become a point of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-mamdani-new-york-election-mayor-cuomo">legal contention</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>What do New York polls say?</strong> A recent survey from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/polls/nyc-mayoral-election-polls-2025.html">AtlasIntel</a> showed Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, on 44%, the independent Andrew Cuomo on 39% and the Republican Curtis Sliwa on 16%.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>At least 36,000 Sudanese have fled since fall of El Fasher to RSF, says UN agency</strong></h2>    <p>More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/03/sudanese-refugees-el-fasher-rsf-tawila-un">36,000 people fled</a> Sudan’s Kordofan region between 26 and 31 October amid a surge in fighting, the UN’s migration agency has said, after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/27/fears-civilians-sudan-paramilitary-rsf-capture-el-fasher">capture</a> of the city of El Fasher in neighbouring Darfur by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) after more than a year under siege.</p> <p>The people, most on foot, headed to Tawila, a town west of El Fasher that is <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/10/1166237#:~:text=More%20than%2036%2C000%20people%20have,Organization%20for%20Migration%20(IOM).">sheltering</a> more than 652,000 displaced people, the UN said.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What do we know about war crimes allegations?</strong> Prosecutors at the international criminal court said on Monday they were <a href="https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/statement-icc-office-prosecutor-situation-el-fasher-north-darfur">collecting evidence</a> of alleged mass killings, rapes and other crimes in El Fasher.
