<h2><strong>The face that launched a thousand memes could put you on the first boat home</strong></h2> <p>I have a very important public service announcement to make. Do not, under any circumstances whatsoever, make fun of Vice-President <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a> by sharing one of the millions of <a href="https://gizmodo.com/notes-on-a-meme-the-grotesque-pleasure-of-bloated-jd-vance-pictures-2000572683">unflattering memes</a> dedicated to him. Don’t you dare chuckle at the images of him looking like the “lollipop kid” in Shrek (the resemblance is uncanny) or a chicken nugget. And, whatever you do, do not share the meme that you can find <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/jd-vance-babyface-edits">here</a>, where he looks like a big bald baby. You risk hurting the poor man’s feelings and, also, you might get kicked out of the country.</p> <p>So says a 21-year-old Norwegian called Mads Mikkelsen, anyway. Mikkelsen recently accused American border officials of denying him entry into the US because he had a meme of a bloated baby Vance saved on his phone. Mikkelsen, who had travelled to the US to visit friends, told the Norwegian paper <a href="https://www.nordlys.no/mads-sin-drommereise-til-usa-spolert-pa-grunn-av-satirebilde-pa-mobilen/s/5-34-2171723">Nordlys</a> that immigration officers at Newark airport interrogated him, forced him to give fingerprints and blood samples, and went through his phone. After they found the Vance meme, as well as a picture of Mikkelsen holding a homemade wooden pipe, they sent him home.</p> <p>“Both pictures had been automatically saved to my camera roll from a chat app, but I really didn’t think that these innocent pictures would put a stop to my entry into the country,” Mikkelsen told Nordlys.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/21/week-in-patriarchy-arwa-mahdawi">Why does this billionaire have 100 kids in 12 countries? | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/06/25/norwegian-tourist-jd-vance-meme/">rejected Mikkelsen’s claim</a> that he was kicked out of the country for disrespecting the vice-president. “FACT CHECK. Claims that Mads Mikkelsen was denied entry because of a meme are unequivocally FALSE,” they <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1195784362592740&amp;id=100064835614791&amp;rdid=xWvVJOUaNCZgmLdU">posted on Facebook</a> earlier in the week. “TRUTH: Mikkelsen was refused entry into the US for his admitted drug use.”</p> <p>A homeland security assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, also <a href="https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/1937644506872193279">called the story “BS”</a> in a post on X.</p> <p>Mikkelsen, meanwhile, insisted to the <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/06/25/norwegian-tourist-jd-vance-meme/">fact-checking website Snopes</a> that the meme played a role in getting him denied entry. The 21-year-old claimed border officials told him he was getting sent home because of “extremist propaganda [the meme] and narcotic paraphernalia”. However, that claim hasn’t been verified.</p> <p>We may never know if the Vance meme really did play a role in getting Mikkelsen kicked out of the country. While I don’t normally side with border officials, one imagines the pipe picture was probably the actual culprit. Still, the story, which made headlines around the world, won’t help <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91341658/us-tourism-decline-report-travelers-staying-away-in-2025">America’s tourism industry</a>. International visitors are staying out of the US after a spate of stories about tourists getting sent to Ice detention centers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney">without any explanation</a>. The World Travel &amp; Tourism Council has said the country could lose $12.5bn in <a href="https://wttc.org/news/us-economy-set-to-lose-12-5bn-in-international-traveler-spend-this-year">international visitor spending</a> this year.</p> <p>The story has also reignited interest in JD Vance memes, which have been circulating for months now, peaking at end of February after the vice-president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-shouting-match-oval-office">scolded</a> Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an exchange that launched <a href="https://x.com/barflugnarven/status/1895590112828010945">a million memes</a>. Indeed, the Irish lawmaker Ivana Bacik recently held up the Vance baby meme while speaking in the Irish parliament about <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-bald-baby-face-meme-shown-irish-parliament-2091049">the Mikkelsen story</a>.</p> <p>While claims that making fun of Mr Hillbilly Elegy may get you deported might be exaggerated, the fact that so many people immediately believed Mikkelsen’s claims is a sign of just how badly the US’s international image has been damaged and how dystopian the country has become. The US is heading very <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5340753/trump-democracy-authoritarianism-competive-survey-political-scientist">quickly towards authoritarianism</a>. It is cracking down on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/anti-protest-bills-trump">dissent and protest</a>. Book banning has surged and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/book-bans-pen-america-censorship">Trump administration</a> has instructed the Department of Education to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/27/education-department-book-ban-investigations">end their investigations</a> into these bans, calling them a “hoax”. Free speech rights <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/us-free-speech-rights-trump">are being shredded</a>.</p> <p>And the people responsible for all this? They’re not evil geniuses, they’re embarrassing dweebs with massively meme-able faces. “I knew that one day we might have to watch as capitalism and greed and bigotry led to a world where powerful men, deserving or not, would burn it all down,” Rebecca Shaw said in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/16/i-knew-one-day-id-have-to-watch-powerful-men-burn-the-world-down-i-just-didnt-expect-them-to-be-such-losers">Guardian piece earlier this year</a>. “What I didn’t expect, and don’t think I could have foreseen, is how incredibly <em>cringe </em>it would all be.”</p> <h2><strong>Immigrants in the US are worried about getting deported if they report domestic violence</strong></h2> <p>“The Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, a national network of advocates for those hurt by domestic violence, found that 75% of the 170 advocates they surveyed across the country said the immigrants they serve fear they’ll face arrest or deportation if they contact authorities,” <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/06/22/immigrant-domestic-violence-survivors-ice-deportation/84246931007/">reports USA Today</a>. Meanwhile the Fox News host Jesse Waters seems to think all this is hilarious. “I bet a bunch of guys that are dating illegal alien Spanish girls are like Ice, here’s the address! She hasn’t been very good,” <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/jesse-watters-i-bet-bunch-guys-are-dating-illegal-alien-spanish-girls-are-ice-heres">Watters recently said</a>.
