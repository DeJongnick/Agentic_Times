<p>The Queensland government has rejected a controversial carbon capture and storage (CCS) proposal to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/09/gina-rinehart-one-nation-and-the-greens-all-oppose-glencores-plan-to-store-co2-in-the-great-artesian-basin-why">inject CO2 from a coal-fired power station into the Great Artesian Basin</a>.</p> <p>Swiss mining company Glencore was awaiting the Queensland government’s approval of a pilot scheme to inject 330,000 tonnes of liquified CO2 into an aquifer about 2.3km underground in southern Queensland.</p> <p>But in its assessment of the proposal’s environmental impact statement, the state department of environment found the project could not proceed due to potential “irreversible or long-term change to groundwater quality”.</p> <p>The Great Artesian Basin is one of the biggest underground water sources in the world.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/09/gina-rinehart-one-nation-and-the-greens-all-oppose-glencores-plan-to-store-co2-in-the-great-artesian-basin-why">Gina Rinehart, One Nation and the Greens all oppose Glencore’s plan to store CO2 in the Great Artesian Basin – why?
