<p>Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration “wants nothing less than $500m from Harvard” as a condition for restoring billions of dollars in federal funding to the Ivy League university.</p> 
<p>“Don’t negotiate with them, they’ve been very bad,” Trump told his education secretary, Linda McMahon, in a cabinet meeting.</p> 
<p>Trump’s<a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1960389934264582350"> comments</a> came <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/11/us/trump-harvard-settlement-negotiations.html">amid reports </a>that his administration and Harvard are moving toward a potential settlement that could bring an end to their months-long battle over the government’s allegations that Harvard has not done enough to crack down on antisemitism tied to pro-Palestinian protests.</p> 
<p>In April, Harvard<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/21/harvard-sues-trump-administration"> became the first</a> – and so far only – university <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/21/harvard-sues-trump-administration">to sue</a> the Trump administration over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/21/harvard-trump-administrations-26bn-cuts-illegal">funding cuts</a>. It sued again the following month over the government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/23/judge-trump-proclamation-harvard">efforts</a> to block the school from enrolling international students.</p>

<p>The university has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/21/harvard-trump-administrations-26bn-cuts-illegal">argued</a> that the administration unlawfully slashed $2.6bn in research funding from the university in retaliation for the school’s refusal to comply with a series of demands laid out in an 11 April letter from a federal antisemitism task force. Those demands related to campus protests, academic policies and admissions practices.</p> 
<p>A US district judge heard arguments from both Harvard and the Department of Justice last month.</p> 
<p>The Department of Justice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/21/harvard-trump-administrations-26bn-cuts-illegal">has argued </a>that the federal government has the authority to cancel grants when institutions violate presidential directives, and have cited Trump’s executive order purporting to combat antisemitism.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/11/us/trump-harvard-settlement-negotiations.html">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harvard-trump-agreement-antisemitism-ivy-a84b88a8136a852aa305e508d012afb6">the Associated Press</a> have both<strong> </strong>reported that Harvard and the White House had made substantial progress toward a deal. Under the proposed agreement, according to the Times, Harvard would pay $500m in exchange for the restoration of billions in frozen federal research funds. However, key terms reportedly remain unresolved, with negotiations still continuing.</p> 
<p>The Harvard president, Alan Garber, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/04/harvard-trump-settlement">disputed the Times report, reportedly telling faculty that</a> the article was inaccurate and alleged that the information had been leaked to the press by White House officials.</p> 
<p>According to Harvard <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/8/3/garber-500-million-trump/">Crimson</a>, the university’s student newspaper, Garber said the university remains committed to resolving the matter through the courts and that academic freedom was nonnegotiable in any deal.</p> 
<p>In July, it was also reported that Harvard <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/29/harvard-trump-administration-employment-forms">agreed to comply</a> with federal demands to turn over employment records for thousands of staff members.</p> 
<p>Since taking office in January, Trump and his administration have made unprecedented efforts to reshape higher education, targeting elite universities over their handling of the pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s war in Gaza, DEI programs and more.</p> 
<p>Several other universities that have faced federal funding cuts – including Columbia, Brown and the University of Pennsylvania – have reached <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/07/universities-settle-trump">settlement agreements</a> with the administration to restore research funding.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/columbia-university-funding-trump-demands">Columbia University</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/23/columbia-university-220m-trump-administration">agreed</a> to pay more than $220m and implement a series of reforms to settle <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/a-look-at-project-esther-and-trumps-approach-to-combat-antisemitism-on-campus">allegations</a> that it was not doing enough to combat antisemitism. However, some education advocates <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/columbia-university-deal-white-house-reactions">decried</a> that deal as a blow to academic freedom.</p>
