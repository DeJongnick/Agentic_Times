  <p><strong>The World Food Programme (WFP) has begun scaling up its operations in Gaza</strong>, as the ceasefire paves the way for humanitarian agencies to resume operations in areas that have been cut off from vital aid in the war-torn territory.</p> 
  <p>“After two years of devastating conflict, hundreds of thousands of families remain displaced with food systems shattered, and access to basic necessities severely limited,” WFP said in a <a href="https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-scales-life-saving-food-assistance-ceasefire-unfolds">statement</a>. “With full access, WFP intends to restore its regular food distribution system, scaling assistance through 145 distribution points across the Strip.”</p> 
  <p>It added that “over 170,000 metric tons of food” was ready for dispatch or on route, “via Ashdod, Egypt, Jordan, and the West Bank corridors.”</p>

  <p><strong>British prime minister Keir Starmer will travel to Egypt to attend the Sharm El Sheikh Peace Summit</strong>, where leaders are expected to sign a US-brokered peace agreement aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza, his office said on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>The first phase of the plan is set to begin with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners by Monday, marking what Britain called a “historic turning point” after two years of war.</p> 
  <p>The British leader would pay tribute to the role of US president Donald Trump and the diplomatic efforts of Egypt, Qatar and Turkey in brokering the deal, his office told Reuters.</p> 
  <p>He is expected to call for continued international coordination to implement the next phase, which includes deploying a ceasefire monitoring mission and establishing transitional governance in Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Starmer will reiterate Britain’s “steadfast support” to help secure the ceasefire and deliver humanitarian aid.</p>

  <p>Staying with Iran and diplomatic relations for a moment, there is another development.</p> 
  <p>Iran does not see “any reason” to resume nuclear talks with European countries over the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme, the AFP reported just now.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We truly do not see any reason to negotiate with them. What can they possibly do, and what positive outcome could such negotiations have?” said foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, referring to Britain, France and Germany, which said on Friday they would seek to restart stalled nuclear talks.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Late last month, widespread United Nations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/28/sweeping-un-sanctions-on-iran-come-into-effect-after-nuclear-talks-fail">sanctions</a> against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> came back into force for the first time in a decade, prompting anger from Tehran, after last-ditch nuclear talks with western powers failed to produce a breakthrough.</p> 
  <p>The sanctions, which came into effect three months after Israel and the US bombed Iran, bar dealings related to Tehran’s nuclear and ballistic missiles programme and are also expected to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/30/far-more-dangerous-than-war-iranians-brace-for-prospect-of-un-sanctions">wider effects on the country’s troubled economy</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Iran on Saturday said it has “no trust” that Israel will respect the terms of a Gaza ceasefire</strong> that began a day earlier, following two years of war.</p> 
  <p>“We warn about the tricks and betrayals of the Zionist regime regarding previous agreements ... There is absolutely no trust in the Zionist regime,” said Iran foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, according to Agence France-Presse.</p> 
  <p>Araghchi pointed to previous ceasefires that have been violated, including in Lebanon.</p>

  <p><strong>The World Cup qualifier between Norway and Israel in Oslo on Saturday was marked by protests and a heavy security response</strong> including the use of tear gas, with Norwegian fans divided over Israel’s participation in the tournament due to the war in Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Ahead of the game, hundreds of pro-Palestinian supporters gathered to protest outside the Norwegian parliament, with many wearing the jerseys of the Palestine national team.</p> 
  <p>Marching towards Ullevaal Stadium with Palestinian flags and flares, the protesters gathered outside, vowing to continue until kickoff as nearby buildings displayed pro-Palestinian banners hanging from balconies. Security was tight around the stadium, with police closing several entrances hours before the match started, conducting bag searches, and reducing the number of spectators allowed in.</p> 
  <p>Later, Norwegian police confirmed they had used tear gas on a group of protesters who attempted to breach the barricades surrounding the stadium as the match was being played, according to Reuters.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary of the day so far</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It is 6pm in <strong>Gaza</strong> and <strong>Israel</strong>. Here is a summary of the main developments covered on the blog so far today:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel has begun transferring prisoners to two jails ahead of their release as part of the Gaza ceasefire deal, designed to lead to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/hostages-gaza-israel-profiles">release of hostages</a> held by Hamas, the prison service said on Saturday. </strong>Thousands of staff, including prison officers, “operated throughout the night in order to implement the government’s decision: ‘The framework for the release of all Israeli hostages’,” a statement said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel is expected to release about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, including 250 serving long sentences for serious security offences, in exchange for the remaining hostages in Gaza. </strong>A list Israel published on Friday did not include high-profile prisoner Marwan Barghouti. Netanyahu’s office has <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/10/09/israel-refuses-release-palestinian-mandela-barghouti-gaza/">confirmed</a> it refuses to release Barghouti.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The hostage and prisoner releases are expected to begin on Monday, two Egyptian officials briefed on the talks and a Hamas official said, although another official said they could occur as early as Sunday night.</strong> The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to be publicly named speaking about the negotiations, reported the Associated Press (AP).</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Hamas’s disarmament as part of US president Donald Trump’s plan for Gaza is “out of the question”, a Hamas official told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Saturday. </strong>“The proposed weapons handover is out of the question and not negotiable,” the official said. The US president has indicated the issue of Hamas surrendering its weapons would be addressed in the second phase of the peace plan.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump has said that “for the most part, there is consensus” on how the next stages of how the Gaza ceasefire plan will work, but admitted that “some of the details … will be worked out”. </strong>In comments made on Friday, and reported by various news outlets, Trump spoke about the remaining hostages in Gaza, adding that Hamas were gathering them “now”. He said: “they’re in some pretty rough places”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The head of the US Central Command (Centcom) said on Saturday he visited Gaza to discuss post-conflict stabilisation and insisted no US troops will be deployed there. </strong>Adm Brad Cooper wrote on X that he had just returned from a trip to Gaza to discuss the creation of a Centcom-led “civil-military coordination centre” which will “support conflict stabilisation”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>However, about 200 US troops have arrived in Israel to help retrieve hostages and monitor the ceasefire. </strong>The US military will coordinate a multinational taskforce which will deploy in Gaza and is likely to include troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians returned to their Gaza neighbourhoods on Saturday</strong>, weaving through dust-shrouded streets as bulldozers clawed through the wreckage of two years of war and a ceasefire held in its second day.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Aid groups are preparing to scale up relief work, with Doctors Without Borders, the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) stating that they are ready to step up aid shipments. </strong>Trucks carrrying boxes of WFP aid were seen on Saturday arriving in Khan Younis and being distributed among Palestinians. A UN official speaking to the AP on the condition of anonymity said the UN had been given the green light by Israel to begin delivering scaled-up aid into Gaza starting on Sunday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Unicef and its partners are urging Israel to reopen more crossings and allow aid to flow into Gaza more freely. </strong>Speaking from central <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, Unicef spokesperson Tess Ingram said: “A ceasefire alone is not enough … it also needs to ensure a surge of humanitarian aid that begins to address the tremendous damage that has been done over the past two years.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Cogat, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid, said that more than 500 trucks entered Gaza on Friday, although many crossings remain closed.</strong> With a declared famine still under way in parts of the strip, Unicef has 1,300 trucks ready to enter, with more on the way, Ingram said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her Spanish counterpart, Pedro Sánchez, will travel to Egypt to attend an international summit on Gaza on Monday, their respective governments have confirmed. </strong>Trump has previously said he plans to meet “a lot of leaders” in Cairo on Monday to discuss the future of Gaza. Representatives from a range of countries, including the UK, Germany, France and Qatar, are expected to be in attendance.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Gaza’s civil defence agency has said it recovered the bodies of 150 Palestinians since the ceasefire came into effect, while 9,500 are still missing.</strong> It added that 300,000 people have arrived in Gaza City since the truce began.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Officials in Gaza have said that 5,000 public operations have been carried out since the ceasefire came into effect on Friday, including efforts to restore water and sewage infrastructure, as well as secure damaged buildings. </strong>About 1,200 medical and healthcare operations were conducted, such as treating the wounded and monitoring those injured, Al Jazeera reported, citing the Gaza government media office.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Protesters flooded the streets of central London to march in support of Palestine on Saturday.</strong> Tens of thousands of demonstrators attended the march, organised by the Palestine Coalition, which includes the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Stop the War and other groups.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>International journalists in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/11/israel-gaza-ceasefire-hamas-hostages-netanyahu-trump-middle-east-latest-news-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68ea1f6f8f08e1d65d2a758d#block-68ea1f6f8f08e1d65d2a758d">called for reporters to be granted immediate access to Gaza</a> after the rapidly negotiated ceasefire came into effect, joining a long list of international media organisations demanding press freedom in the devastated territory. </strong>In a statement <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/4k7pkd4c4">released</a> on Friday, the Foreign Press Association (FPA) urged Israel to “immediately open the borders and allow international media free and independent access to the Gaza Strip” now that hostilities have ceased.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Lebanese president Joseph Aoun condemned Israel on Saturday for carrying out overnight strikes on civilian facilities that the health ministry said killed at least one person. </strong>The Lebanese health ministry said an Israeli strike on the al-Msayleh area left one person dead and seven others injured.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan will meet Syrian officials, in Ankara on Sunday, the Turkish foreign ministry said. </strong>Defence minister Yasar Guler, intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin, and their Syrian counterparts will attend the security cooperation meeting, the ministry said in a statement on Saturday.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Hamas</strong>’s disarmament as part of <strong>US</strong> president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s plan for <strong>Gaza</strong> is “out of the question”, a Hamas official told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>“The proposed weapons handover is out of the question and not negotiable,” the official said.</p> 
  <p>The US president has indicated the issue of Hamas surrendering its weapons would be addressed in the second phase of the peace plan.</p>

  <p>In response to a query by the Guardian on <strong>Unicef</strong>’s plans to scale up its aid operation as a result of the <strong>Gaza</strong> ceasefire, a spokesperson for UN agency said on Saturday:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We expect the ceasefire will allow us to scale up significantly from tomorrow [Sunday]. Unicef has more than 1,300 trucks stationed at points around the Gaza Strip, ready to bring in tents, nutrition supplies, medical supplies and more.</p> 
   <p>The ceasefire must, finally, afford humanitarian actors the opportunity to safely roll out the massive response inside the Gaza Strip that is so desperately needed. This includes unimpeded access to reach all children and families with essential food and nutrition, health care and psychosocial support, clean water, and sanitation, education, and learning, as well as cash assistance and the resumption of commercial trucking operations.</p> 
   <p>Unicef has been bringing trucks in consistently for months and continue to do so, including this past week. In recent days, Unicef brought in hygiene kits, baby diapers and tents. </p> 
   <p>From tomorrow [Sunday], we expect to collect supplies for children with disabilities, tents, hygiene kits, water tanks, RUTF [ready-to-use therapeutic food], menstrual hygiene supplies, winter clothes, plastic tarps and diapers. </p> 
   <p>As the scale-up comes into effect, we will be prioritising nutrition supplies to fight the famine, items for the production of safe drinking water and other urgent water and sanitation needs, as well as supplies to help families cope with the impending winter.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Israel</strong> has begun transferring prisoners to two jails ahead of their release as part of the <strong>Gaza</strong> ceasefire deal, designed to lead to the release of hostages held by <strong>Hamas,</strong> the prison service said on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>Thousands of staff, including prison officers, “operated throughout the night in order to implement the government’s decision: ‘The framework for the release of all Israeli hostages’,” a statement said, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p> 
  <p>About 2,000 <strong>Palestinian</strong> prisoners are to be freed from Israeli jails, including 250 serving long sentences for serious security offences. In exchange, Hamas has until Monday to hand over its 48 remaining Israeli hostages – living and dead.</p>

  <p>“The most basic necessities are still urgently needed in Gaza: medical equipment, medicines, food, water, fuel, and adequate shelter for two million people who will face the approaching winter without a roof over their heads.” <strong>Jacob Granger</strong>, <strong>Gaza</strong> coordinator for <strong>Doctors Without Borders </strong>told Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p> 
  <p>Representatives of Granger’s organisation, the <strong>World Food Programme (WFP)</strong> and the <strong>Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC)</strong> said they were ready to step up shipments, but much remains unclear.</p> 
  <p>“The difficulty we have now is questions of access,” said <strong>Antoine Renard</strong>, WFP director for <strong>Palestine</strong>, speaking to AFP from <strong>Deir el-Balah</strong> in central Gaza.</p> 
  <p>The WFP, which leads the group of organisations handling food security, has begun discussions with <strong>Cogat</strong>, the <strong>Israeli </strong>defence ministry agency for civilian affairs in the territories.</p> 
  <p>On Friday, empty WFP trucks were seen by AFP leaving <strong>Khan Younis</strong> in southern Gaza and heading to the <strong>Kerem Shalom crossing</strong> to be loaded with food aid for distribution inside Gaza.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Trump</strong> plan foresees a return to the <strong>UN</strong>-led aid system in place before January 2025, when Israel sealed Gaza’s borders and a private US-led operation took over aid distribution. “But the conditions on the ground are different,” Renard said.</p> 
  <p>Since Israel’s latest offensive into the cities in the north of Gaza last month, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have been driven from the homes – many of which were destroyed – into central and southern Gaza.</p> 
  <p>This has shifted pressure for food aid into a now overcrowded area whose original residents were already struggling.</p> 
  <p>The Trump plan states “full aid will be immediately sent to the Gaza Strip” as soon as the agreement comes into effect, “without interference from either party”.</p> 
  <p>AFP reports that several humanitarian sources expressed optimism, despite concerns about security and registration procedures, on which Israel has yet to provide guidance.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Aid groups were preparing to scale up relief work, one of the many challenges ahead as a ceasefire between <strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Hamas</strong> entered its second day, reports the Associated Press (AP).<br><br>“When people get there, they’re going to find rubble. They’ll find that their homes and their neighbourhoods have been reduced to dust,” <strong>Unicef</strong> spokesperson <strong>Tess Ingram</strong> told the AP on Friday.</p> 
  <p>Unicef and its partners are urging Israel to reopen more crossings and allow aid to flow into <strong>Gaza</strong> more freely. Meanwhile, about 200 <strong>US</strong> troops arrived in Israel to help retrieve hostages and monitor the ceasefire.<br><br>Speaking from central Gaza, Ingram said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A ceasefire alone is not enough.</p> 
   <p>Yes, it stops the killing and injuring of children, hopefully, but it also needs to ensure a surge of humanitarian aid that begins to address the tremendous damage that has been done over the past two years.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Cogat</strong>, the Israeli military body in charge of humanitarian aid, said that more than 500 trucks entered Gaza on Friday, although many crossings remain closed. With a declared famine still under way in parts of the strip, Unicef has 1,300 trucks ready to enter, with more on the way, Ingram said.</p> 
  <p>The aid is among the 170,000 metric tonnes that have been positioned in neighbouring countries awaiting permission from Israel to restart deliveries that have been suspended.<br><br>The days since the announcement of the ceasefire have moved swiftly. Israel’s military confirmed it had taken effect on Friday and said the 48 hostages still in Gaza would be freed on Monday. A UN official, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet public, said Israel also approved expanded aid deliveries starting Sunday.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">International journalists urge Israel to allow reporters into Gaza after ceasefire deal</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>International journalists in <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a></strong> have called for reporters to be granted immediate access to <strong>Gaza</strong> after the rapidly negotiated ceasefire came into effect, joining a long list of international media organisations demanding press freedom in the devastated territory.</p> 
  <p>In a statement <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/4k7pkd4c4">released</a> on Friday, the <strong>Foreign Press Association (FPA)</strong> urged Israel to “immediately open the borders and allow international media free and independent access to the Gaza Strip” now that hostilities have ceased. The organisation also noted that the supreme court is expected to hear arguments on 23 October, “after more than a year in which the state has been allowed to delay its response”.</p> 
  <p>Since 7 October 2023, Israel has prevented international journalists from entering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> and reporting on the war, with the few allowed in under strict military supervision on guided tours arranged by the <strong>Israel Defense Forces</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The international media has relied on <strong>Palestinian</strong> journalists and media workers in Gaza, and contact with individual Palestinian civilians, aid agency staff and medical workers. But Palestinian journalists and media workers are the most at risk in the world, with 197 killed by Israeli attacks in the past two years, according to the <strong>Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Among those most recently killed were <strong>Mariam Dagga</strong>, who worked for the Associated Press and Independent Arabia and was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/mariam-abu-dagga-gaza-journalist-killed-in-israeli-strike-carried-her-camera-into-the-heart-of-the-field">killed in an Israeli strike on </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/mariam-abu-dagga-gaza-journalist-killed-in-israeli-strike-carried-her-camera-into-the-heart-of-the-field">Nasser hospital</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/mariam-abu-dagga-gaza-journalist-killed-in-israeli-strike-carried-her-camera-into-the-heart-of-the-field"> in </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/mariam-abu-dagga-gaza-journalist-killed-in-israeli-strike-carried-her-camera-into-the-heart-of-the-field">Khan Younis</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/mariam-abu-dagga-gaza-journalist-killed-in-israeli-strike-carried-her-camera-into-the-heart-of-the-field"> on 25 August</a>, and Reuters journalist <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/he-loved-his-work-deeply-profiles-of-five-palestinian-journalists-killed-in-gaza-airstrike">Hussam al-Masri</a></strong>, who was killed in the same attack.</p> 
  <p>Israel carried out 25 targeted killings of journalists in that period, the CPJ said, describing them as murders.</p>

  <p>After more than 700 days <a href="https://stories.bringthemhomenow.net/">in captivity</a>, the 20 hostages believed to be still alive in <strong>Gaza</strong> are set to be freed in the coming days, after the <strong>Israeli</strong> government’s ratification of a ceasefire deal with <strong>Hamas</strong>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>United Nations (UN)</strong> was given the green light by <strong>Israel</strong> to begin delivering scaled-up aid into <strong>Gaza</strong> starting on Sunday, a UN official said. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public, reports the Associated Press.<br><br>The aid shipments are meant to address severe malnutrition and famine conditions triggered by Israeli offensives and restrictions on humanitarian help. The <strong>international criminal court</strong> is seeking the arrest of Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> and his former defence minister for allegedly using starvation as a method of war. Israeli officials deny the accusations.<br><br>Accoding to the AP, the aid will include 170,000 metric tons that have already been positioned in neighboring countries such as <strong>Jordan</strong> and <strong>Egypt</strong> as humanitarian officials awaited permission from Israeli forces to restart their work.</p> 
  <p>UN officials and Israeli authorities have engaged in a series of discussions in <strong>Jerusalem</strong> over the last 24 hours about the volume of aid humanitarian organisations can bring in and through which entry points.<br><br>UN spokesperson <strong>Stéphane Dujarric</strong> told reporters on Friday that fuel, medical supplies and other critical materials have started flowing through the <strong>Kerem Shalom crossing</strong>. UN officials want Israel to open more border crossings and provide safe movement for aid workers and civilians who are returning to parts of Gaza that were under heavy fire until only recently.</p> 
  <p><br>In the last several months, the UN and its partners have been able to deliver only 20% of the aid needed in the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong>, according to the UN’s under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, <strong>Tom Fletcher</strong>.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Israeli</strong> military confirmed the start of the <strong>Gaza</strong> ceasefire on Friday, and the remaining 48 hostages, about 20 of them believed to be alive, are to be released by Monday.</p> 
  <p><strong>Palestinians</strong> said heavy shelling in parts of <strong>Gaza</strong> earlier on Friday had mostly stopped after the military’s announcement, reports the Associated Press (AP).<br><br>Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> said in a televised statement on Friday that the next stages would see <strong>Hamas</strong> disarm and Gaza demilitarised.

  <p>The Israeli military has said it will continue to operate defensively from the roughly 50% of Gaza it still controls after pulling back to agreed-upon lines.</p>

  <p>As <strong>Abdel Fattah al-Kurdi</strong> made the long journey back to <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> City</strong>, he found himself getting lost. Though he left the city just a few weeks ago, he could no longer recognise its streets. The buildings he had grown up in between had collapsed, their contents carpeting the roads in a mixture of torn furniture and broken concrete.</p> 
  <p>Al-Kurdi could only recognise the <strong>Netzarim checkpoint</strong> marking his entry into north Gaza by the bodies lying at its feet – those who had tried to return home too early, their faces obscured by dust after being cut down by Israeli fire.</p> 
  <p>“The city looks completely different, as if it is no longer the Gaza we once knew. In just a short time, massive destruction has spread everywhere. Almost all of the houses are destroyed, the streets blocked,” said al-Kurdi, a 40-year-old resident of Gaza City, as he returned to his home in the <strong>Sheikh Radwan</strong> neighbourhood.</p> 
  <p>Al-Kurdi was one of the thousands of people of <strong>Gaza</strong> who took advantage of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/10/palestinians-displaced-gaza-home-ceasefire-israel-hamas">ceasefire announced on Friday</a> to travel back to their homes in northern Gaza. Videos showed a coastal highway clogged with crowds, many on foot, making their way northwards.</p> 
  <p>For the first time since a previous ceasefire had collapsed in mid-March, fighting had stopped in Gaza. <strong>Hamas</strong> and <strong>Israel</strong> had agreed to stop fighting to prepare for the release of 48 Israeli hostages held in Gaza and nearly 2,000 <strong>Palestinian</strong> prisoners in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/trump-peace-plan-gaza-israel-hamas">agreement</a> that is meant to lead to a complete end to the two-year war.</p> 
  <p>Like most people of north Gaza, al-Kurdi was filled with anxiety as he walked north. In the days leading up to the ceasefire, Israel had been intensely bombing Gaza City as part of its campaign to occupy the city.</p> 
  <p>Al-Kurdi had no idea if his home was among the lucky few that was still standing.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Lebanon condemns overnight Israeli strikes that killed one</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Lebanese</strong> president <strong>Joseph Aoun</strong> condemned <strong>Israel</strong> on Saturday for carrying out overnight strikes on civilian facilities that the health ministry said killed at least one person, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.</p> 
  <p>Aoun said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Once again, southern Lebanon has been the target of a heinous Israeli aggression against civilian installations – without justification or pretext.</p> 
   <p>The seriousness of this latest attack lies in the fact that it comes after the ceasefire agreement in Gaza.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The <strong>Lebanese health ministry</strong> said an Israeli strike on the <strong>al-Msayleh</strong> area left one person dead and seven others injured.</p> 
  <p>Lebanon’s official National News Agency said Israeli warplanes conducted 10 raids targeting bulldozer and excavator yards. </p> 
  <p>The Israeli army confirmed it conducted strikes in Lebanon. In a statement, it said it had “struck and dismantled Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure in the area of southern Lebanon, where engineering machinery used to re-establish terrorist infrastructure in the area” was located.</p> 
  <p>Israel has repeatedly bombed Lebanon despite a November ceasefire, which followed more than a year of hostilities with the <strong>Iran</strong>-backed militant group that culminated in two months of open war.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump says 'for the most part, there is consensus' on next stages of Gaza ceasefire plan</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>US</strong> president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said that “for the most part, there is consensus” on how the next stages of how the <strong>Gaza ceasefire plan</strong> will work, but admitted that “some of the details … will be worked out”.</p> 
  <p>In comments made on Friday, and reported by various news outlets, Trump spoke about the remaining hostages in <strong>Gaza</strong>, adding that <strong>Hamas</strong> were gathering them “now”. He said: “they’re in some pretty rough places”.</p> 
  <p>The US president, who has been praised by Hamas and many in <strong>Israel</strong> for his role in securing a ceasefire deal, said he believes the agreement will “hold” because “they’re [Hamas and Israel] all tired of the fighting”.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, Trump plans to convene world leaders for a summit on Gaza during his visit to <strong>Egypt</strong> next week, Axios reported. Among those expected to participate are representatives from <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, <strong>Italy</strong>, <strong>Qatar</strong>, the <strong>United Arab Emirates</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong>, <strong>Turkey</strong>, <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>, <strong>Pakistan</strong> and <strong>Indonesia</strong>. According to a US official<strong>, Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> will not be present.</p> 
  <p>Trump confirmed that he would meet a “lot of leaders” in <strong>Cairo</strong> on Monday to discuss the future of Gaza and it has been reported that he will also travel to <strong>Israel</strong>, where he will adress the <strong>Knesset</strong>.</p> 
  <p>More on this story in a moment, but first here are some other key developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Tens of thousands of Palestinians headed back to the heavily destroyed northern Gaza Strip on Friday as a US-brokered ceasefire came into effect in a deal that raised hopes for ending the Israel-Hamas war.</strong> The remaining 48 hostages, about 20 of them believed to be alive, are to be released by Monday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Questions remain over who will govern Gaza as Israeli troops gradually pull back and whether Hamas will disarm, as called for in Trump’s ceasefire plan.</strong> Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who unilaterally ended a ceasefire in March, hinted that Israel might renew its offensive if Hamas does not give up its weapons.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The United Nations was given the green light by Israel to begin delivering scaled-up aid into Gaza starting on Sunday, a UN official said.</strong> The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet made public, reports the Associated Press. The aid will include 170,000 metric tons that have already been positioned in neighboring countries such as Jordan and Egypt as humanitarian officials awaited permission from Israeli forces to restart their work.</p></li>

   <li><p><strong>Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned Israel on Saturday for carrying out overnight strikes on civilian facilities that the health ministry said killed at least one person. </strong>“Once again, southern Lebanon has been the target of a heinous Israeli aggression against civilian installations – without justification or pretext,” Aoun said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel shared a list of the Palestinian detainees that it plans to release as part of the ceasefire agreement made with Hamas.</strong> Of the 250 Palestinian prisoners serving long sentences for serious security offences, 15 will be released in East Jerusalem, 100 to the West Bank, and 135 will be deported. Initially, when Hamas officials submitted a list of proposed prisoners to be released to mediators in Egypt, they called for the release of high-profile Palestinian political figures such as Marwan Barghouti. But Netanyahu’s office<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/10/09/israel-refuses-release-palestinian-mandela-barghouti-gaza/"> confirmed</a> it refuses to release Barghouti.</p></li>
