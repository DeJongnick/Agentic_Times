<h1>‘What is the point?’ Scottie Scheffler questions golf and life before Open</h1>

<p>Since the age of three, when he was given a plastic set of clubs, Scottie Scheffler has wanted to be the best golfer in the world. He has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/18/scottie-scheffler-runs-away-with-us-pga-title-after-challengers-fade-away">won three majors</a>, been ranked world No 1 since 2023, and is the favourite for the Open this week. But during an extraordinary press conference at Portrush on Tuesday, the American peered into an existential void as he asked himself: what is the point of it all?</p> 
<p>Scheffler was clearly happy, and his determination to win this week was clear. He also spoke eloquently on the challenges of links golf. But a hitherto unremarkable press conference suddenly veered into a deeper philosophical search for meaning when the 29-year-old was asked how long he had ever celebrated a victory.</p>

</aside> 
<p>It turned out the answer was a few minutes. And Scheffler was only getting started, as he then promised to quit golf if it ever affected his family life.</p> 
<p>“There’s a lot of people that make it to what they thought was going to fulfil them in life, and you get there, you get to No 1 in the world, and they’re like what’s the point?” he said. “I really do believe that, because what is the point? Why do I want to win this tournament so bad?</p> 
<p>“That’s something that I wrestle with on a daily basis. Showing up at the Masters every year, it’s like, why do I want to win this golf tournament so badly? Why do I want to win the Open Championship so badly? I don’t know. Because, if I win, it’s going to be awesome for two minutes. Then we’re going to get to the next week and it’s: ‘Hey, you won two majors this year; how important is it for you to win the FedExCup playoffs?’ And we’re back here again.”</p> 
<p>Scheffler was clearly in a good mood. But he conceded that any joy he felt from his achievements was only fleeting and didn’t give him much fulfilment. “To get to live out your dreams is very special, but at the end of the day I’m not out here to inspire the next generation of golfers,” he said.</p> 
<p>“I’m not out here to inspire someone to be the best player in the world, because what’s the point? This is not a fulfilling life. It’s fulfilling from the sense of accomplishment, but it’s not fulfilling from a sense of the deepest places of your heart.”</p> 
<p>Perhaps such an approach, along with his deepest held religious beliefs, helps to explain why Scheffler has looked so ice‑cool even when the pressure is ratcheted up to the max.</p> 
<p>“We really work so hard for such little moments. I’m kind of sicko; I love putting in the work. I love getting to practise. I love getting to live out my dreams. But at the end of the day, sometimes I just don’t understand the point.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know if I’m making any sense or not. It’s just one of those deals. I love the challenge. I love being able to play this game for a living. It’s one of the greatest joys of my life, but does it fill the deepest wants and desires of my heart? Absolutely not.”</p> 
<p>Instead Scheffler said that his family mattered far more – and he would stop playing professional golf if it ever affected his relationship with his wife, Meredith, and his son, Bennett.</p> 
<p>“Every day when I wake up early to go put in the work, my wife thanks me for going out and working so hard,” he said. “When I get home, I try to thank her every day for taking care of our son. That’s why I talk about family being my priority because it really is.</p> 
<p>“I’m blessed to be able to come out here and play golf, but if my golf ever started affecting my home life or it ever affected the relationship I have with my wife or my son, that’s going to be the last day that I play out here for a living.</p>

    <p><b>6:35am (rd 1) /11.26am (rd 2):</b></p>
    <p><b> Padraig Harrington, Nicolai Hojgaard, Tom McKibbin</b></p>
    <p>Two-time Open champion Padraig Harrington leads an eye-catching first group with two rising European stars. Denmark's Nicolai Hojgaard, 24, already has a Ryder Cup appearance under his belt, while Tom McKibbin, 22, who finished tied-fourth in LIV Golf Andalucía, will be hoping to make an impression in his native Northern Ireland.<br></p>
    <p><b>9:58am (rd 1)/2.59pm (rd 2):</b></p>
    <p><b> Xander Schauffele, JJ Spaun, Jon Rahm</b></p>
    <p>Xander Schauffele will be bidding to become the first golfer since Harrington in 2008 to defend his Open title. JJ Spaun, making his Open debut, said his closest links experience was playing Bandon Dunes in Oregon, but as the only golfer to finish under-par at the US Open, he will fancy his chances. Former world No 1 Jon Rahm rounds out a group of major&nbsp;champions.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>10:09am (rd 1)/3:10pm (rd 2):</b></p>
    <p><b> Shane Lowry, Collin Morikawa, Scottie Scheffler</b></p>
    <p>Much has been said about Scottie Scheffler's effortless dominance, which&nbsp;will finally be put to the test on Portrush's&nbsp;treacherous&nbsp;links course. "I think it fits my&nbsp;strengths because I like to do things very creatively," he said pre-tournament. Former champions Collin Morikawa and Shane Lowry, who won at Portrush in 2019, complete the trio.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>10:42am (rd 1)/3:43pm (rd 2):</b></p>
    <p><b>Matti Schmid, Ryggs Johnston, Richard Teder (a) </b></p>
    <p>Richard Teder will be one of nine amateurs among the 156-strong field to&nbsp;watch. The 20-year-old Estonian, who picked up golf by accident, dramatically qualified for the Open by holing out from 90 yards in a sudden-death play-off. He is no stranger to links golf, having played in kids' tournaments in Scotland and shot competitive rounds at courses like Royal St George's and Ballyliffin.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>2:48pm (rd 1)/9:47am (rd 2): </b></p>
    <p><b>Robert MacIntyre, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin Rose </b></p>
    <p>Major success has come fleetingly close for Justin Rose in recent attempts, and the Englishman will again be a crowd favourite as he aims to add to his 2013 US Open win. Meanwhile, the contrast in styles between Bryson DeChambeau, who has traditionally struggled with links golf, and Scotland's Robert MacIntyre is one to keep an eye on.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>3:10pm (rd 1)/10.09am (rd 2):</b></p>
    <p><b> Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Tommy Fleetwood</b></p>
    <p>All eyes are on home favourite Rory McIlroy as he returns to Portrush after missing the cut in 2019. McIlroy left that tournament with regrets, but comes here after his Masters victory. Tommy Fleetwood finished second at Portrush in 2019 and may be best placed to end his Major drought, while Justin Thomas is also looking to rediscover his mojo. <b>Ervin Ang</b></p>

<p>“This is not the be all, end all. This is not the most important thing in my life. That’s why I wrestle with, why is this so important to me? Because I’d much rather be a great father than I would be a great golfer. At the end of the day, that’s what’s more important to me.”</p> 
<p>That doesn’t mean, of course, that Scheffler isn’t deeply determined to win his first Open title at Portrush, having achieved his best finish of seventh at Troon last year.</p> 
<p>“It’s great to win tournaments. But sometimes the feeling of winning only lasts a few seconds. It’s pretty exciting and fun, but it just doesn’t last that long.”</p>
