<p>Every so often, I’m listening to someone and I think: this person – this is a crossword person. Most recently, the person was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2023/apr/24/angela-barnes-comedy">comedian Angela Barnes</a>. And this time, I did what an American would describe as “reaching out” to see whether she’d ever entertained the idea of writing a puzzle.</p> <p>Angela, it transpired, had been to <a href="https://www.johnhalpern.co.uk/newsletter-zoom">an online solving session hosted by Paul</a> during the pandemic and had “try to set a cryptic” on her bucket list:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>When I was given an opportunity to have a go at setting a puzzle for the Guardian – well, I bit the editor’s hand off.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/cryptic/29736">The puzzle appears today</a>. I asked Ariel, as we can now say, what it was like switching to “setting mode”:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The switch from a solver’s brain to a setter’s brain feels quite subtle, but I really like the reversal, working backwards, where there are myriad correct possibilities instead of just one.</p> </blockquote> <p>And if you haven’t solved it yet, look away before these words about the theme:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I know that F1 is a sport that divides people. It divides me. After all, I’m a woolly lefty who likes a sport with a ginormous carbon footprint – but what are human beings if not hypocritical contradictions? <br>F1 is not just a display of exceptional focus and reflexes; it’s also a masterclass in engineering, fluid and aerodynamics, material science and sheer maths and physics. Something for everyone!</p> </blockquote> <p>In other news, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/genius">an intriguing Genius from KGB awaits your attention</a>, and entries are closed for Pangakupu’s.</p> <p>In <a href="https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/06/09/Genius_crossword_No_264.pdf">the latter,</a> the preamble told us, apparently unhelpfully, that:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Six answers are modified, with one part of each replaced by itself.</p> </blockquote> <p>A bit of head-scratching revealed that we need to think musically and so an answer such as MUDFLAT needed its D♭ to become a C♯, and the entry is really MUCSHARP.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2025/jun/16/crossword-editor-update-mystery-setter-pendorne">our cluing conference for COINCIDENCE</a>, the runners-up are Montano’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2021/jul/19/crossword-council-4-the-letter-bank">letter bank</a>: “Correspondence encrypted in code, with some letters repeated”, and Chri5Miller’s evocative: “Surprising harmony from Chopin, Nicki, Edge and Cher … what are the odds?”; the winner is the not-unaudacious: “Fortune from a copper, some other coppers and more coppers lacking coppers’ character.”</p> <p>Kludos to Rakali. Please leave entries for COINCIDENCE below, along with any favourite clues or puzzles you’ve spotted. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2025/jun/16/crossword-editor-update-mystery-setter-pendorne">the Pendorne mystery</a> is solved!
