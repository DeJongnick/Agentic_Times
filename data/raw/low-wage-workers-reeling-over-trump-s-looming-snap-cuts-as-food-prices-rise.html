<p>Poverty and hunger will rise as a result of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s unprecedented cuts to the US federal “food stamps” program, according to experts. Low-income workers who rely on the aid are braced for dire consequences.</p> <p>Katie Giede, a single mother and waitress in Conyers, Georgia, is one of the 42 million Americans who use the supplemental nutrition assistance program (Snap). Even with the maximum benefit permitted, she struggles to afford food for her and her child.</p> <p>She makes $3 an hour plus tips at the fast-food chain Waffle House, where she has worked for 11 years. The company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/16/waffle-house-workers-strike-minimum-wage-union">deducts</a> meals from workers’ pay check per shift, regardless of whether they eat one or not.</p> <p>“Our pay is already so little that we’re struggling with everything,” Giede told the Guardian. “Single mothers like myself are reliant upon the benefits like Snap and Medicaid. So when you go and you cut that as well, now you have mothers out here that are not only worried at night because they already can’t afford housing or a vehicle, but we’re also worried what is our kid is going to eat? Because we no longer have help.”</p> <p>Giede said she received $450 a month for her and her child. She said working too many hours or receiving too much income<strong> </strong>was a constant concern,<strong> </strong>due to <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/recipient/eligibility">eligibility</a> cut-offs.</p> <p>According to an <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/cuts-snap-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-would-widen-persistent-gap-between-benefits-and">analysis </a>by the Urban Institute, at the end of 2024, even the maximum Snap benefit would not cover the cost of a modestly priced meal in 99% of all counties in the US.</p> <p>“I dread that trip to the grocery store every week, because you have to sit down and you really have to budget,” said Giede. “Every time you go, you’re having to make the choice between something that’s healthy or something that’s cheaper, just so you can get enough to last all week.</p>    <p>“There are so many people in this country that rely on these benefits, and with these cuts, half of the people that are surviving right now off of this are going to lose their benefits. That’s not even just people not eating a little bit. They’re already not eating enough, so we’re going to lose lives over this. It’s those of us at the bottom that are really feeling it.”</p> <p>Waffle House did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” set the stage for significant cuts to Snap by shifting higher administrative costs to each state, expanding work reporting requirements and imposing restrictions on non-citizen eligibility.</p> <p>Many lower-wage workers have grown more reliant on Snap in recent years. US food prices rose by 23.6% between 2020 and 2024, according to official data. While inflation has since moderated, grocery costs remain high.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/snap-foodstamps-republicans-propose-cuts">‘It’s been a lifesaver’: millions risk going hungry as Republicans propose slashing food stamps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a result of the latest Snap changes,<strong> </strong>states will be responsible for 75% of administrative costs of handling the program from 2027, up from 50% cost-sharing with the federal government, which is likely to strain state budgets.</p> <p>From 2028, for the first time states will be forced to pick up some of the multibillion-dollar bill for Snap benefits. The state of New York, for example, faces a budget impact of about $1.2bn, according to the Food Research and Action Center (Frac), a non-profit advocacy group.</p> <p>While such shifting costs have raised fears that states will cut back Snap support,<strong> </strong>expanded work requirements have sparked concern that few people will be eligible. <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/cuts-snap-one-big-beautiful-bill-act-would-widen-persistent-gap-between-benefits-and">Analysis</a> by the Urban Institute found about 22.3 million US families are set to lose some or all of their Snap benefits.</p> <p>“This is a very targeted, well-thought<strong>-</strong>out plan of dismantling the Snap program that federal policy makers won’t take responsibility for, because it is the states, it is the governors who will have to cut resources for Snap, who will have to cut the program in order to say we can’t operate this because of what’s happening at the federal level,”<strong> </strong>said Gina Plata-Nino, Snap deputy director at the Frac.</p> <p>“Snap is a very important ecosystem at the local level, at the state level and the federal level, because billions of dollars go into states, and this federal money supports local economies,” she added. “All of these proposals threaten this very delicate balance.”</p> <p>The White House deferred comment to the office of management and budget, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>States across the US are braced for stark consequences.<strong> </strong>“We’re going to have worse hunger and ultimately, worse poverty,” said Seth DiStefano, policy outreach director at the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy. “There are entire regions of West Virginia where there aren’t 20 hours a week [expanded Snap work requirement] of anything to apply for. What do you tell those families?</p> <p><strong>“</strong>We’re talking families with kids now that are going to be subjected to these harsh work reporting requirements. We’re talking folks in their 60s, literally in communities where there are no jobs, none, and ripping away the one outlet to their basic needs that’s available to them.”</p> <p>Among the employers with the most workers reliant on Snap is Walmart, the largest private employer in the US, as much of its workforce <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/05/part-time-jobs-underwork/682768/">receives</a> only part-time hours.</p> <p>Christina Gahagan, 66, has worked at Walmart for a decade<strong> </strong> in western New York at several stores. She is currently based at a store in Geneseo, New York.</p> <p>“I would say at least 50% of the people in my store rely on food stamps to make ends meet for their families,” said Gahagan. “They’re always trying to figure out where the best deals are, coupon clipping at lunch and reading circulars to see who’s got the best deal on whatever, just to make their money stretch.”</p> <p>She has cut down on costly grocery items, eating cheaper junk food to get by.</p> <p>“I was paying $9 a pound for roast beef. Today it’s almost $13 a pound. So I’m not buying full pounds any more. I’m just buying a half a pound and making it work and just eating crap in between, like buying myself some chips out of the vending machine or something,” Gahagan said.</p> <p>“Walmart is the largest employer in the US. We rival Amazon almost dollar for dollar in what we do. You would think a company like that could shell out a little bit more money per hour for associates in the store across the board, so that there aren’t people who are having to depend so heavily on public assistance.”</p> <p>Walmart did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p>
