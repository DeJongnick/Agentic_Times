Not too old, however, to serve another eight years as an MP.</p> <p>Even at that age, Campbell could probably have outpaced most of his younger critics, having been a world-class sprinter in his youth and captain of the Great Britain athletics team. Closer to the truth was that he was not particularly happy or comfortable as a party leader: in an earlier era his sagacity and expertise would probably have been revered and respected but Gordon Brown, then the Labour prime minister, was a decade younger than he was, and the Tories had just elected David Cameron, who was a quarter century younger. Campbell gave way gracefully to be succeeded by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg">Nick Clegg</a>, nearly 26 years his junior, who at that time had been in parliament for little more than two years.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68d6b58b8f084553ecf44f29" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-26T15:49:53.675Z">4.49pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Reform UK 'hate Britain', says Darren Jones</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Darren Jones</strong>, the Cabinet Office minister and chief secretary to the PM, told the Global Progress Action Summit that Reform UK hates Britain.

We said we would balance day-to-day spending with tax receipts and that would get that debt down as a share of the economy, but that, subject to those things, we would invest in those things to grow the economy.</p> <p>As a result, we’ve been able to invest something like £120bn extra over the spending review period on big capital projects.</p> <p>But there are limits to what government can do.<em> </em>At the moment our debt to GDP ratio is basically 100%, just under, and £1 in every £10 that the government spends is on servicing the debt interest, on the debts racked up not by us but by the previous government.</p> <p>I don’t think there’s anything progressive about spending one in every £10 of government money on interest, often to foreign hedge funds and investors.</p> </blockquote> <p>Reeves said there were only two ways to reduce this: by getting the debt down, and by bringing down interest rates. </p> <p>She also said the government had to show how it would make “the sums at up”. </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Some people think that is in tension with our Labour, our social democratic, values. I would argue the exact opposite. There’s nothing progressive about seeing interest rates go up again.</p> </blockquote> <p>In what may have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/25/labour-internal-warfare-breaks-open-as-keir-starmer-and-ministers-criticise-andy-burnham">a reference to Burnham</a>, Reeves also said that if the government just borrowed more, it would end up like Liz Truss’s administration.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>No one can accuse me of not accepting that there are tradeoffs. But that’s why there are people who are unhappy. </p> <p>But if you pretend there aren’t trade offs, then we’re going to go the same way that Liz Truss went, and that is crashing the economy, putting pensions in peril, sending mortgage rates spiralling and not just losing elections, but being consigned to total irrelevance, which is where the Conservatives are today.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked again about tax rises, Reeves said the government had to deal with the situation it was in. The last Labour government inherited a debt to GDP ratio of less than 50%, she said. </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’m chancellor in the world that we are in, not in the world that we may wish it to be, and I have to make those trade offs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Reeves said she had a plan, and would “not be dragged off course by every siren call”.</p> <p>In what may have been a second reference to Burnham, she said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’ll stick to that plan, to grow the economy and to stabilise the public finances because I know it’s the right thing to do.</p> <p>Of course, other things are available – I’m not sure if I would call them plans – other options are available, but we’ve tried that way before and that is what has got us into the mess we’re in today.</p> </blockquote> <p>Reeves got a round of applause for this answer.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68d69eed8f08c0f8b6cd6639" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-26T14:13:19.775Z">3.13pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Digital ID will make it easier for firms to take on new workers, Recruitment and Employment Confederation says</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>A digital ID scheme will make hiring workers easier, according to the <strong>Recruitment and Employment Confederation.</strong> Its chief executive, Neil Carberry, put out this statement about the government’s plans.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We use digital ID every day, from paying on our phones to travel and event tickets.

Some of it just echoes the language he will use in his speech this morning, briefed overnight. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/26/keir-starmer-digital-id-cards-immigration-borders-reform-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68d652238f081ea00e4fa9f4#block-68d652238f081ea00e4fa9f4">9.52am</a>.) But in the Telegraph he also argues that in the past Labour has been wrong about immigration – ignoring concerns about illegal migration, while been overly positive about the impact of legal migration.</p> <p>Starmer says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The first essential part [in taking on the populist right involves] recognising where some on the left went wrong on the issue of immigration.</p> <p>There is no doubt that for years, leftwing parties, including my own, did shy away from people’s concerns around illegal immigration. It has been too easy for people to enter the country, work in the shadow economy and remain illegally.</p> <p>We must be absolutely clear that tackling every aspect of the problem of illegal immigration is essential …</p> <p>Equally, the belief that uncontrolled legal migration was nothing but good news for an economy should never have been accepted on the left. It is not compassionate leftwing politics to rely on labour that exploits foreign workers and undercuts fair wages.</p> <p>The huge increase in immigration that happened under the Conservatives was based on a hyper-liberal free-market viewpoint. Labour is clear that there must be no return to that.</p> </blockquote> <p>To be fair, there is no Labour government in history that has favoured “uncontrolled legal migration” in a literal sense. Starmer is referring in particular to the Blair government, its relaxed attitude to seeing net migration rise, and in particular its decision not to impose transitional controls when 10 mostly eastern European countries joined the EU in 2004, giving their citizens the right to work in the UK.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68d659ef8f08af03abbe8734" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-26T09:17:10.315Z">10.17am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>We would like to hear from you about what you think of the plans for digital ID cards.

Labour has released some extracts in advance, and two lines stand out.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Starmer will suggest that today’s far-right populism could lead to fascism and war if left unchecked.</strong> He will say:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>An industrialised infrastructure of grievance - an entire world – not just a worldview, created through our devices. That is miserable, joyless, demonstrably untrue. And yet in another way – totally cohesive. That preys on real problems in the real world. Identifies clear enemies – that’s us.</p> <p>And, at its heart – its most poisonous belief - on full display at the protests here in London, just a week or two ago, that there is a coming struggle, a defining struggle, a violent struggle, for the nation. For all our nations.</p> <p>Now – you don’t need to be a historian to know where that kind of poison can lead.
