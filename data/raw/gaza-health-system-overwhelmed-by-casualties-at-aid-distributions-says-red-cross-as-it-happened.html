The facility also treated more than 2,200 “weapon-wounded patients, most of them across more than 21 separate mass casualty events”, it added.</p> <p>Among the wounded are toddlers, teenagers, elderly, mothers–and overwhelmingly, young men and boys who said they were trying to get food and aid for their families.</p> <p>“The scale and frequency of these incidents are without precedent,” the ICRC said, adding that its field hospital had treated more patients since late May than “in all mass casualty events during the entire previous year”.</p> <p>To cope with demand, it said that all its staff were now contributing to the emergency response effort:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Physiotherapists support nurses, cleaning and dressing wounds and taking vitals.

This comes as indirect negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas resumed in Qatar, and US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> put pressure on Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> for a deal that would end the war. </p> <p>The ceasefire proposal envisages a phased release of hostages, Israeli troop withdrawals from parts of Gaza and discussions on ending the war entirely. As Reuters reports, senior Israeli officials briefing journalists in Washington, said it may take more than a few days to finalize agreements in Doha but they did not elaborate on the sticking points. This comes as Palestinian sources said on Monday that there were gaps between the sides on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p> <p>Israeli minister <strong>Zeev Elkin</strong>, who sits in Netanyahu’s security cabinet, said that there was “a substantial chance,” a ceasefire will be agreed. “Hamas wants to change a few central matters, it’s not simple, but there is progress,” he told Israel’s public broadcaster Kan.</p> <p>As the outlet states, Hamas has long demanded an end to the war before it would free remaining hostages; Israel has insisted it would not agree to end the fighting until all hostages are released and Hamas dismantled.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686cd8c88f089731c616e1f6" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-08T09:08:32.867Z">10.08am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here are some images coming to us over the wires:</p>     </div>   </div> <div id="block-686cd5088f0833eb852109f9" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-08T08:54:19.428Z">9.54am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>A third day of indirect negotiations on a Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, with a focus on withdrawal and aid, began in Doha today (8 July).</p> <p>“Indirect negotiations are continuing this morning in Doha, with a fourth meeting being held… the discussions are still focused on the mechanisms for implementation, particularly the clauses related to withdrawal and humanitarian aid,” a Palestinian source tells AFP.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686cd3d28f08aadc85ad0790" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/gustavo-petro"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-08T08:52:29.341Z">9.52am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>In a new opinion piece for the Guardian, president of Colombia <strong>Gustavo Petro</strong> argues that governments have a duty to “stand up to Israel”, and criticises “passive” attitudes. </p> <p>“If we fail to act now, we not only betray the Palestinian people, we become complicit in the atrocities committed by Netanyahu’s government,” he wrote. “Some governments have already stepped up. My government suspended coal exports to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, for example, recognising that economic ties cannot be divorced from moral responsibilities. South Africa, meanwhile, has taken Israel to the world’s highest court. </p> <p>“And Malaysia has banned all Israeli-flagged cargo ships from docking at its ports.

The Palestinian people deserve justice. The moment demands courage.
