<p>People seeking cheap Botox-like injections have been warned by experts against doing it themselves due to the risk of “eyelid droops”, infection and even botulism.</p> <p>There are growing concerns over the availability of medication called Innotox that is being sold illegally online in the UK. Unlike Botox, which comes as a powder that must be reconstituted for use in an injection, Innotox is a ready-to-use liquid – making it easier to self-administer.</p> <p>Wes Streeting, the health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/06/clapdown-wild-west-cosmetic-treatments-liquid-brazilian-butt-lifts">announced plans</a> this week to introduce legislation cracking down on England’s cosmetic “wild west”, where there is scant regulation of who can deliver treatments such as dermatological filler and Botox.</p> <p>Experts say Innotox is not licensed for use in the UK, unlike some other liquid Botox-like injections, meaning its quality and safety has not been assessed.</p> <p>Aenone Harper-Machin, a consultant plastic surgeon and spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (BAPRAS), said the online availability of Innotox was frightening and appalling, and she cautioned against DIY jabs. </p> <p>“People could be giving themselves eyelid droops and all sorts of weird asymmetries by injecting it in the wrong place, too deeply, too superficially. You can inject it into your blood vessel and give yourself botulism,” she said.</p> <p>Products such as Botox and Innotox contain type A botulinum toxin, which blocks nerve signals and prevents muscles from contracting. While botulinum toxin is a prescription-only medicine in the UK, Innotox can be readily bought online without one, amid longstanding concerns about <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgnl430n5wo">untrained and unregulated providers</a>, as well as unlicensed or counterfeit products.</p> <p>Health officials have said <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/ukhsa-issues-warning-over-botulism#full-publication-update-history">41 recent cases of botulism</a> poisoning in England have been linked to unlicensed jabs.</p> <p>Harper-Machin has had Botox-like injections but said she would not self-administer them. “I wouldn’t have it done by anybody other than a consultant plastic surgeon who has intimate knowledge of facial anatomy,” she said.</p> <p>Botox jabs have become a routine procedure for many people. The government estimates that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/consultation-launched-into-unregulated-cosmetic-procedures">about 900,000 such injections</a> are carried out in the UK each year.</p> <p>Despite now being available in high street clinics, their high cost and the regular need for top-up treatment has fuelled a desire for cheaper alternatives.</p> <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is unlawful to sell unauthorised medicines, although in certain circumstances unauthorised medicines may be supplied under the supervision of a healthcare professional.</p> <p>Nora Nugent, the president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), said: “While rare, BAAPS has become aware of isolated but concerning cases of individuals experiencing serious complications following self-injection of botulinum toxin and dermal filler products.</p> <p>“These include infections, tissue damage and, in extreme cases, the need for multiple surgical interventions. We are aware of cases that have resulted in significant tissue damage and tissue loss needing multiple surgical interventions and resulting in permanent scarring.”</p> <p>Sophie Cooper, the managing director of the Harley Street Skin Clinic, said: “Content creators on TikTok have been sharing their results from self-injecting Innotox, which has been encouraging viewers to jump on the bandwagon.</p> <p>“Innotox has been reported to have a simpler injection process, be faster working, longer lasting and be lower in price. In reality, self-injecting Innotox as a Botox alternative comes with many dangers.”</p> <p>Tom Albright, the chief executive of Luvantas, a subsidiary of Medytox, which produces Innotox, said the company became aware in June of the unauthorised importation of Innotox to the US, UK and other countries and alerted Medytox management to the situation.</p> <p>“Medytox has opened an investigation into this matter and have engaged experts to assist in shutting down the sources of importation,” he said. “Patient safety is our highest priority. We strongly caution healthcare providers and consumers against purchasing unapproved or misrepresented botulinum toxins through unauthorised channels. Products distributed outside authorised supply chains may not meet safety, efficacy or storage standards.”</p> <p>He added: “Botulinum toxins should be administered only by qualified healthcare professionals in a medically appropriate setting. Administration requires a deep understanding of facial anatomy and aesthetic principles, which cannot be replicated in consumer-administered or unregulated environments.”</p>
