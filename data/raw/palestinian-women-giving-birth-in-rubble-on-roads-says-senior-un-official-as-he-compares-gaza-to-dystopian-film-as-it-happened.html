 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It is approaching 5pm in <strong>Gaza</strong> and <strong>Israel</strong>. This blog will be closing shortly but you can access all the Guardian’s <strong>Middle East</strong> coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/middleeast">here</a>.</p> 
  <p>Here is a summary of today’s main developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Palestinian women are giving birth in rubble on roads, a senior UN official has said, as he compared Gaza to a “dystopian film”.</strong> Andrew Saberton, an executive director with the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) described the “sheer devastation” that he witnessed on his most recent travel to Gaza, saying that there is no such thing as a “normal birth in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> now”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US vice-president, JD Vance, said that Israel would not annex the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>, the day after Israeli lawmakers voted to advance two bills paving the way for the territory’s annexation. </strong>“If it was a political stunt it was a very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult to it,” Vance said in comments as he wrapped up his visit in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, during which he visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem’s Old City, and met Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s defence minister, Israeli military leaders and other officials.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US secretary of state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/marco-rubio-warning-israel-west-bank-donald-trump">Marco Rubio, warned Israel on Wednesday against annexing the West Bank</a>, saying steps taken by parliament and settler violence threatened a Gaza deal. </strong>But Rubio – the latest high-ranking US visitor to Israel after Vance – voiced optimism overall for preserving Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> deal. Rubio said: “Every day there’ll be threats to it, but I actually think we’re ahead of schedule in terms of bringing it together, and the fact that we made it through this weekend is a good sign.” Rubio will meet Netanyahu on Friday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European Union (EU) leaders are seeking a more active role in Gaza and the occupied West Bank after being sidelined from the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. </strong>At a summit on Thursday in Brussels largely focused on Ukraine and Russia, EU heads of state are also expected to discuss the shaky ceasefire in Gaza and potential EU support for stability in the war-torn coastal territory.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/icj-orders-israel-to-allow-aid-into-gaza-and-says-blockade-had-been-a-breach">Israel must allow aid into Gaza, and its restrictions on doing so over the past two years have put it in breach of its obligations</a>, the UN’s top court has found. </strong>The stinging advisory opinion by the international court of justice (ICJ) in The Hague also found that Israel had a duty not to impede the supply of aid by UN organisations including the beleaguered UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, which has been in effect banned from the territory since January.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israeli foreign minister Gideon Saar said on Thursday that Israel is committed to working towards the success of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/trump-netanyahu-gaza-peace-plan">Trump plan for Gaza</a>, adding that Hamas and Islamic Jihad must lay down their arms. </strong>The 20-point plan demands that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a> lay down its arms and renounce governance in the strip.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Health authorities said Israeli drone fire killed one Palestinian in southern Gaza.</strong> It comes as residents reported almost constant heavy gunfire and tank shelling in eastern areas of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and also east of Gaza City in the north of the Palestinian territory overnight, according to Reuters.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The body of a Thai farm worker killed during the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel and held by Hamas in Gaza was repatriated to Thailand on Thursday, officials said</strong>. The remains of Sonthaya Oakkharasri arrived at Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport from Tel Aviv as part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The ceasefire in Gaza should mark a turning point for all Palestinians, not be a pretext to tighten control over the West Bank, the secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) Jan Egeland has warned. </strong>During his visit to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, this week, Egeland said that “the same violence and impunity we saw in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> is dispossessing whole communities in the West Bank”. He stressed that “recovery in one part of the territory cannot come at the cost of destruction in another”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Humanitarian organisations are also facing growing restrictions, said Egeland, warning that “if enforced, they will paralyse our life-saving work”</strong>. In March 2025, Israel introduced new registration rules for international agencies that could prevent them from operating anywhere in the occupied territory.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>In the first medical evacuation since the ceasefire began on 10 October, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday they had evacuated 41 critical patients and 145 companions out of the Gaza Strip. </strong>In a statement posted to X, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on nations to show solidarity and help 15,000 patients who are still waiting for approval to receive medical care outside Gaza.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>On Thursday, Israel’s supreme court held a hearing into whether to open the Gaza Strip to the international media and gave the state 30 days to present a new position in light of the new situation under the ceasefire</strong>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> has blocked reporters from entering Gaza since the war erupted on 7 October 2023.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Turkish peacekeeping forces will continue to help boost the Lebanese army’s capability under a renewed deployment mandate in Lebanon, Turkey’s defence ministry said on Thursday</strong>. Turkey’s parliament passed a bill on Tuesday to renew the military’s deployment mandates in Syria and Iraq by three more years, and its deployment mandate under the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) by two years.</p></li>

  <p><strong>US</strong> vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong> has criticised <strong>Israel</strong>’s parliament vote on <strong>West Bank</strong> annexation, calling the move a “stupid political stunt” after a bill applying Israeli law to the occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>, a move tantamount to the annexation of land <strong>Palestinians</strong> want for a state, won preliminary approval from Israel’s parliament on Wednesday. </p> 
  <p>Speaking on the tarmac of <strong>Tel Aviv’s international airport</strong> before departing at the end of his visit to Israel, Vance insisted that “the policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that but we certainly weren’t happy about it”, adding “I personally take some insult to it”.</p>

  <p>The EU’s top diplomat, <strong>Kaja Kallas</strong>, has said the EU should play a role in Gaza and not just pay to support stability and eventually reconstruction.<br><br>The EU has provided key support for the <strong>Palestinian Authority</strong>, which administers parts of the occupied West Bank, pledged to help flood Gaza with humanitarian aid, and said it could bring a West Bank police support programme to Gaza to buttress a stabilisation force called for in the current 20-point ceasefire plan. <br><br>It has also sought membership in the plan’s <strong>“Board of Peace”</strong> transitional oversight body, <strong>Dubravka Šuica</strong>, European Commissioner for the <strong>Mediterranean</strong>, said this week, reports the AP. <br><br>At least two EU countries, <strong>Denmark</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong>, are participating in the new <strong>US</strong>-led stabilisation effort overseeing and implementing the Gaza ceasefire.

  <p>The remains of <strong>Sonthaya Oakkharasri</strong> arrived at <strong>Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi airport</strong> from <strong>Tel Aviv</strong> on Thursday, as part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.</p> 
  <p>Israeli authorities confirmed this week they had received Sonthaya’s body and formally identified him.</p> 
  <p>Under the truce, Hamas has returned the final 20 surviving hostages it was holding and so far released 15 of another 28 who died.</p> 
  <p>Nearly 30,000 Thais work in Israel, according to Thailand’s labour ministry, mostly in the agricultural sector.</p> 
  <p>Sonthaya was 30 years old and worked at the <strong>Beeri kibbutz</strong> when he was killed in the 2023 attack on Israel that trigged the war.</p> 
  <p>Thailand’s labour minister <strong>Treenuch Thienthong</strong> and Israel’s ambassador to Thailand <strong>Alona Fisher-Kamm</strong> laid wreaths during a repatriation ceremony of Sonthaya’s body at the airport on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Sonthaya’s mother told local media she was devastated but grateful that her son’s body would return to his home town in northern <strong>Nong Bua Lamphu</strong> province. His body will be sent for funeral rites according to Buddhist tradition, and the Thai government will provide compensation of up to $54,000 to his family, local outlet Thairath said.</p> 
  <p>The Thai foreign ministry told AFP on Thursday that 47 Thai nationals have been killed in the two-year conflict.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israel is committed to working towards the success of the Trump Gaza plan, foreign minister says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Israeli</strong> foreign minister <strong>Gideon Saar</strong> said on Thursday that Israel is committed to working towards the success of the <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/trump-netanyahu-gaza-peace-plan">Trump</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/trump-netanyahu-gaza-peace-plan"> plan for </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/trump-netanyahu-gaza-peace-plan">Gaza</a></strong>, adding that <strong>Hamas</strong> and <strong>Islamic Jihad</strong> must lay down their arms.</p> 
  <p>The 20-point plan, aimed at ending the war in the <strong>Palestinian</strong> territory that erupted after the deadly attack on 7 October 2023, calls for a ceasefire, a swap of hostages held by <strong>Hamas</strong> for Palestinian prisoners and detainees held by Israel, a staged Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian territory, Hamas disarmament and a transitional government led by an international body.</p> 
  <p>The plan also demands that Hamas lay down its arms and renounce governance in the strip. Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence would be given amnesty to remain in Gaza or they would be granted safe passage to receiving countries.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s plan would also establish a temporary governing board.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">ICJ orders Israel to allow aid into Gaza and says restrictions breached international obligations</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Israel</strong> must allow aid into <strong>Gaza</strong>, and its restrictions on doing so over the past two years have put it in breach of its obligations, the <strong>UN</strong>’s top court has found.</p> 
  <p>The stinging advisory opinion by the <strong>international court of justice (ICJ)</strong> in <strong>The Hague</strong> also found that Israel had a duty not to impede the supply of aid by UN organisations including the beleaguered <strong>UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa</strong>, which has been in effect banned from the territory since January.</p> 
  <p>The court found Israel had not produced adequate evidence to justify ending cooperation with Unrwa on the basis it was not a neutral organisation under the <strong>Geneva conventions</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The court instead found the organisation was the backbone of all humanitarian assistance in the area, requiring Israel to cooperate with the organisation in good faith.</p> 
  <p>The ruling that Israel has violated the UN’s immunities as set out in the UN charter, as well as ignored its humanitarian obligations as an occupying power under the Geneva conventions is bound to lead to further calls for Israel’s suspension from the UN.</p> 
  <p>It is also possible that some countries will now claim that the UN secretary general <strong>António Guterres</strong> should seek damages from Israel for breaching the immunities of UN staff premises and entities inside occupied <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories">Palestine</a></strong>, by bombing them and ending cooperation with Unrwa. Israel has paid compensation in one previous case nearly 40 years ago.</p> 
  <p>Israel dismissed the ICJ findings. In a message on social media platform X, <strong>Israel’s foreign ministry</strong> said it categorically rejected the court’s findings and added: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Israel fully upholds its obligations under international law.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The ICJ ruling came in the form of an advisory opinion after a request from the <strong>UN general assembly</strong> in December prompted by Israel’s parliament in October <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/28/what-is-unrwa-and-why-has-israels-parliament-voted-to-ban-it">ending all cooperation with Unrwa</a> claiming the organisation had been irrevocably infiltrated by <strong>Hamas</strong> in Gaza. Unrwa rejects that claim, and the ICJ found that Israel hadn’t “substantiated the allegations”, ICJ president, <strong>Yuji Iwasawa</strong> said.</p> 
  <p>The ICJ findings – including an assertion that the humanitarian position inside Gaza remained catastrophic and massive casualties had occurred – took well over an hour to read and were mostly agreed by 10 votes to one by the judges.</p>

  <p><strong>Turkish</strong> peacekeeping forces will continue to help boost the <strong>Lebanese</strong> army’s capability under a renewed deployment mandate in Lebanon, <strong>Turkey’s defence ministry</strong> said on Thursday, reports Reuters. </p> 
  <p>Turkey’s parliament passed a bill on Tuesday to renew the military’s deployment mandates in <strong>Syria</strong> and <strong>Iraq</strong> by three more years, and its deployment mandate under the <strong>UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil)</strong> by two years. The ministry said in a statement:<br></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Efforts will continue to improve security conditions in the region, ensure stability and assist in the capacity building of the Lebanese armed forces, with the aim of establishing and maintaining peace in Lebanon.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Nato</strong> member Turkey, which took part in mediation that led to the ceasefire deal in <strong>Gaza</strong>, condemned <strong>Israeli</strong> offensives in the <strong>Palestinian</strong> territory and regional countries including Lebanon, saying that “genocidal” and “expansionist” Israeli policies remained the biggest threat to regional peace, reports Reuters. </p> 
  <p>Separately, the defence ministry said in its weekly briefing that the renewed Iraq and Syria mandates aimed to preserve Turkey’s national security against attempts to harm the territorial integrity of its two neighbours. </p> 
  <p>Turkey has been frustrated by what it calls the stalling of the <strong>US</strong>-backed, <strong>Kurdish</strong>-led <strong>Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)</strong> in terms of implementing a landmark integration agreement that it signed with Syria’s government in March. </p> 
  <p><strong>Ankara</strong> views the SDF as a terrorist organisation linked to the outlawed <strong>Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK)</strong> militant group, which has been in a disarmament process that Turkey says must apply to the SDF as well. It has warned of military action against the SDF and said <strong>Damascus</strong> should address its concerns.</p> 
  <p>In the mandate passed on Tuesday, parliament said the move was necessary because “terrorist organisations continued their presence in the region” and the SDF was “rejecting taking steps toward integrating into Syria’s central administration over its separatist and discriminatory agenda”.</p>

   <p>Israel’s new registration rules for international organisations strike at the heart of international humanitarian relief.</p>

   <p>Recognition of Palestine by 157 countries shows overwhelming global consensus that the occupation must end.

 <h2 class="block-title">'Same violence and impunity' seen in Gaza 'dispossessing whole communities in the West Bank', says aid official</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The ceasefire in <strong>Gaza</strong> should mark a turning point for all <strong>Palestinians</strong>, not be a pretext to tighten control over the <strong>West Bank</strong>, the secretary general of the <strong>Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) Jan Egeland </strong>has<strong> </strong>warned.</p> 
  <p>During his visit to the West Bank, including <strong>East Jerusalem</strong>, this week, Egeland said that “the same violence and impunity we saw in Gaza is dispossessing whole communities in the West Bank”. He stressed that “recovery in one part of the territory cannot come at the cost of destruction in another”.</p> 
  <p>Egeland said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As there is hope at long last in Gaza, the West Bank is being intentionally and brutally carved up.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Military operations in <strong>Jenin</strong>, <strong>Nur Shams</strong>, and <strong>Tulkarm refugee camps</strong> have displaced more than 30,000 people, yet humanitarian groups remain barred from assessing the full scale of destruction, said the NRC. Commenting on this, Egeland said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Humanitarians cannot even reach parts of Jenin and Tulkarm camps to verify the devastation, and communities are not allowed to return.</p> 
   <p>Restrictions and intimidation are silencing the truth about what is happening.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Nearly 1,400 Palestinian structures, including homes, schools, agricultural buildings and water infrastructure, have been destroyed this year, said the NRC, adding that this has displaced at least 1,400 people and negatively affected tens of thousands more.</p> 
  <p>Egeland said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I witnessed how Israeli settler violence, backed by the authorities – including Israeli cabinet ministers – is driving vulnerable Palestinian communities from their homes.</p> 
   <p>It was heartbreaking to meet with families driven from their homes by unrelenting settler violence – their lives disrupted and livelihoods lost. Entire communities are being erased.</p> 
   <p>Many families I listened to are having their land – land they have lived on for generations – stolen from them. Some communities have lost their water connection as settlers have diverted the supply: how can such actions go on with total impunity?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In the first nine months of this year, the <strong>UN</strong> documented an average of more than four violent settler attacks per day, which have led to the forced displacement of 1,276 <strong>Palestinians</strong>.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Explainer: What were the bills on annexing the occupied West Bank voted on by Israeli lawmakers?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Reuters has some more detail on the bills voted on yesterday by <strong>Israeli</strong> lawmakers mentioned in the previous post:</p> 
  <p>A bill applying Israeli law to the <strong>occupied West Bank</strong>, a move tantamount to annexation of land that <strong>Palestinians</strong> want for a state, won preliminary approval from Israel’s parliament on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>There are about 700,000 Israeli settlers living in settlements across the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The <strong>United Nations</strong> and much of the international community consider the settlements illegal under international law.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s government, however, cites biblical and historical connections to the West Bank, territory that it regards as disputed, and opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state. The settlements are an explosive issue that has for decades been seen as a major obstacle to <strong>Middle East</strong> peace.</p> 
  <p>The vote was the first of four needed to pass the law and coincided with <strong>US</strong> vice-president <strong>JD Vance’s</strong> visit to Israel, a month after President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> said that he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank.</p> 
  <p>Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>’s <strong>Likud party</strong> did not support the legislation, which was put forward by lawmakers outside his ruling coalition and passed by a vote of 25 in favour and 24 against out of 120 lawmakers.</p> 
  <p>A second bill by an opposition party proposing the annexation of the <strong>Maale Adumim settlement</strong> near <strong>Jerusalem</strong> passed by 31 votes to 9.</p> 
  <p>Netanyahu’s government had been mulling annexation as a response to a string of its western allies recognising a Palestinian state in September, but appeared to scrap the move after Trump objected.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Rubio says Israel annexation moves in West Bank ’threatening’ Gaza deal</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>US</strong> secretary of state, <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, warned <strong>Israel</strong> on Wednesday against annexing the <strong>West Bank</strong>, saying steps taken by parliament and settler violence threatened a <strong>Gaza</strong> deal.</p> 
  <p>Israeli lawmakers voted on Wednesday to advance two bills on annexing the occupied West Bank, barely a week after President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> pushed through a deal aimed at ending a two-year Israeli offensive in the <strong>Gaza Strip</strong> that was retaliation for a <strong>Hamas</strong> attack.</p> 
  <p>“I think the president’s made clear that’s not something we can be supportive of right now,” Rubio said of annexation as he boarded his plane for a visit to Israel. Annexation moves are “threatening for the peace deal,” he told reporters.</p> 
  <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Rubio added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They’re a democracy, they’re going to have their votes, and people are going to take these positions. But at this time, it’s something that we … think might be counterproductive.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked about increased violence by extremist Israeli settlers against <strong>Palestinians</strong> in the West Bank, Rubio said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’re concerned about anything that threatens to destabilise what we’ve worked on.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But Rubio – the latest high-ranking <strong>US</strong> visitor to Israel after vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong> – voiced optimism overall for preserving Trump’s Gaza deal. Rubio said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Every day there’ll be threats to it, but I actually think we’re ahead of schedule in terms of bringing it together, and the fact that we made it through this weekend is a good sign.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The US is the primary military and diplomatic supporter of Israel and Rubio until recently had steered clear of criticising annexation moves championed by far-right allies of the prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>.</p> 
  <p>But a number of <strong>Arab and Islamic states</strong>, which the US is courting to provide troops and money for a stabilisation force in Gaza, have warned that annexation of the West Bank, led by Hamas’s moderate rivals in the <strong>Palestinian Authority</strong>, was a red line.</p> 
  <p>In other developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel must allow aid into Gaza, and its restrictions on doing so over the past two years have put it in breach of its obligations, the UN’s top court has found. </strong>The stinging advisory opinion by the international court of justice in The Hague also found that Israel had a duty not to impede the supply of aid by UN organisations including the beleaguered UN Palestinian relief agency Unrwa, which has been in effect banned from the territory since January.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>On the second day of a US diplomatic push aimed at shoring up the fragile Gaza ceasefire, Israel’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, dismissed as “hogwash” suggestions that his country was a client state of Washington. </strong>Despite the US providing an estimated 68% of Israel’s foreign-sourced weapons, Netanyahu, when asked on Wednesday if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> was beholden to Washington, said: “I want to put it very clearly. One week they say that Israel controls the United States. A week later they say the United States controls Israel. This is hogwash.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s supreme court is scheduled to hear on Thursday a petition filed by an organisation representing international media outlets in Israel and the Palestinian territories, demanding independent access for journalists to Gaza. </strong>Since the Gaza war began in October 2023, Israeli authorities have prevented foreign journalists from entering the territory, taking only a handful of reporters inside on tightly controlled visits alongside its troops.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>More than two dozen Democratic lawmakers have written to the US secretary of state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, and the US ambassador to Israel urging them to help secure the release of Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American citizen who has been held in Israeli military detention for nearly eight months. </strong>Ibrahim, a dual Palestinian-American teenager from Florida, was arrested in a raid on his family’s West Bank home in February when he was 15 years old.</p></li>
