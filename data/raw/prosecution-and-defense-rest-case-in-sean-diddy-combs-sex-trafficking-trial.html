<p>After more than a month of testimony from over 30 witnesses, the government rested its case in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/diddy">Sean “Diddy” Combs</a>’s federal sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trial on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>Shortly after, the 55-year-old music mogul stood up at the defense table and confirmed to the court that he would not be testifying in this case.</p> <p>“Is it your decision not to testify in this case?” the judge asked Combs.</p> <p>“That is my decision, your honor,” Combs replied. “It is solely my decision,” he added, noting that he had “thoroughly” discussed the issue with his legal team.</p> <p>Later on Tuesday afternoon, Combs’s defense team also rested its case without calling any more witnesses of their own and instead submitting a series of exhibits into evidence .</p> <p>The jury will have Wednesday off and closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday.</p> <p>Combs, who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2024/sep/17/sean-diddy-combs-arrest-new-york-grand-jury-indictment-ntwnfb">arrested in September</a>, has pleaded not guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex-trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, and has denied the charges against him.</p> <p>If convicted on all counts, he could face up to life in prison.</p> <p>Since the trial began more than six weeks ago, jurors have heard testimony from 34 witnesses, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/16/sean-diddy-combs-sex-trafficking-trial-sixth-week">two of Combs’s former girlfriends</a>, several of Combs’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/27/sean-diddy-combs-trial">former employees</a>, male escorts, well-known figures such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/22/kid-cudi-sean-diddy-combs-trial">rapper Kid Cudi</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/19/diddy-trial-dawn-richard-testimony">singer Dawn Richard</a>, as well as various law enforcement agents and many others.</p> <p>Prosecutors have alleged that, dating back to at least 2004, Combs led an enterprise that was involved in various crimes including sex trafficking, kidnapping, forced labor, arson, bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice.</p> <p>The government alleges that Combs used violence, threats, money, drugs and power to abuse and coerce women into participating in drug-fueled sex marathons with male escorts – referred to as “freak-offs” – and that his employees aided in concealing his actions and protecting Combs’s reputation.</p> <p>Much of the prosecution’s case has centered on testimony from two of Combs’s former girlfriends and alleged victims: singer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/13/sean-diddy-sex-trafficking-trial">Casandra “Cassie” Ventura</a> and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/06/sean-diddy-combs-sex-trafficking-trial-freak-offs">woman identified as “Jane”</a>.</p> <p>Both women alleged that they were coerced into participating in the so-called “freak-offs”, which they claimed Combs directed, watched, masturbated to and sometimes filmed.</p> <p>They both testified about instances where Combs was violent and controlling, and claimed that he would sometimes threaten to release explicit videos of them or cut off their financial support.</p> <p>Another woman, who was formerly a personal assistant to Combs, testified under the pseudonym “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/29/sean-diddy-combs-sex-trafficking-trial">Mia</a>” and alleged Combs physically and sexually assaulted her during her employment.</p> <p>Combs’s lawyers have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/12/p-diddy-sex-trafficking-trial-jury-selection">acknowledged past incidents of domestic violence</a>, but they have argued throughout the trial that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/may/05/sean-diddy-combs-sex-trafficking-trial-jury-selection">all sexual encounters were consensual and part of a “swingers lifestyle”</a>. They also maintain that no criminal conspiracy exists.</p> <p>Throughout the trial, Combs’s lawyers conducted extensive cross-examinations of many of the prosecution’s witnesses, often highlighting inconsistencies in their accounts.</p> <p>This week, the last witness called to the stand by the government was Joseph Cerciello, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations.</p> <p>He testified about travel, hotel, payment and phone records related to the investigation into Combs.</p> <p>The jury were also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/23/sean-diddy-combs-trial">shown several minutes of sexually explicit video</a> related to the case.</p> <p>If the schedule proceeds as planned, the jury could start deliberating before the end of the week.</p> <p><em>• Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.
