<p>José Mourinho has been confirmed as Benfica’s head coach on a contract until the summer of 2027, with a break clause at the end of this season. His fourth game, on 30 September, will take him back to his former club Chelsea in the Champions League.</p> 
<p>The 62-year-old takes over from Bruno Lage, who was sacked after Benfica’s 3-2 Champions League defeat by Qarabag on Tuesday. Benfica said in a statement that a break clause would allow the club or Mourinho to end his deal in the 10 days after their final game of this campaign.</p> 
<p>Benfica are to hold a presidential election in October and Mourinho indicated that the unusual clause was inserted with that in mind.</p>

<p>“It’s a contract with great ethics behind it,” he said. “I only signed it; I wasn’t the one who drew it up – it was outlined by the club’s management and my collaborators. Of course, I only sign what pleases me, but [the contract] has a tremendous ethical concept. From the club’s side, there is a huge respect for the elections and the members. That’s something to praise; it touched me that the contract was directed towards these ethics.</p> 
<p>“The day after the elections, I will be the coach of Benfica. The presence of this ethical side gives me a freedom that, under other conditions, wouldn’t exist. I want to work at Benfica, but I also wish for people to trust me.”</p> 
<p>Mourinho had been out of work since he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/29/jose-mourinho-leaves-fenerbahce-champions-league-exit">left Fenerbahce</a> in late August after being beaten by Benfica in a Champions League qualifier. He was briefly in charge at Benfica in 2000 but came to prominence with Porto before taking jobs including Inter, Real Madrid and Manchester United.</p> 
<p>“I had the opportunity to work at the biggest clubs in the world, and I&nbsp;can say that none of the other giant clubs I’ve had the opportunity to coach made me feel more honoured, responsible or motivated than being the coach of Benfica,” he said. “Words, sometimes, are carried away by the wind, but actions are not, and the promise is very clear. I will live for Benfica, for my mission.”</p> 
<p>His first game is in the league on Saturday at struggling AVS. Benfica are sixth, five points behind the leaders, Porto, with a game in hand. They have given Mourinho his 12th head coach’s role and his first in his homeland since 2004. </p> 
<p>On 5 October Mourinho will return to Porto, where he received a standing ovation last Saturday as a spectator. “I’m expecting a different reception,” he said. “The one they gave me before is normal: I’m a historic coach for the club. My goal is not to try to enjoy a visit but to win a game. The respect they have for me doesn’t change but I’m returning as the coach of the main rival.”</p>
