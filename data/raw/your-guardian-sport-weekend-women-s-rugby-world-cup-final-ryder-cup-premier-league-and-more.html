They’ll be looking ahead to Saturday’s seven Premier League fixtures, from the lunchtime kickoff of Brentford v Manchester United to the evening’s collision of Spurs and Wolves, with team news and breaking stories. Plus updates from the Championship, where there are three lunchtime kick-offs and eight 3pm fixtures. Pick of the day in the second tier? Third face fifth as Bristol City take on Preston, or the midlands meeting of Coventry and Birmingham. We also have the WSL lunchtime fixture covered as Arsenal take on Aston Villa at noon. <strong>Suzanne Wrack</strong> reports from the Emirates.</p>   <p>10.30am</p> <p>County Championship live</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p><strong>James Wallace</strong> keeps a keen eye on happenings in the final round of county fixtures. With the pennant claimed by a Haseeb Hameed-inspired Nottinghamshire, the dying embers of the season still provide some threads to be unpicked. In Division One, the question of who will be relegated along with Worcestershire is still to be resolved, with Durham, Yorkshire and Hampshire all battling the drop. Leicestershire and Glamorgan are already confirmed to go up into what will again be a 10-team Division One played over 14 rounds, after a vote on restructuring the county setup was deadlocked this week.</p>   <p>12pm</p> <p>Ryder Cup live</p> <p>Golf</p>  <p>Europe are up and running against the USA at the Bethpage bearpit and who better to guide you through the second day’s foursomes and fourballs than <strong>Scott Murray</strong> and <strong>Matt Cooper</strong>? Defending champions Europe have not won away from home since 2012 but they will take huge encouragement from the fact that the team leading at the end of the second session have gone on to win each of the past five Ryder Cups. <strong>Ewan Murray</strong>, <strong>Andy Bull</strong> and <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong> will file reports, news and analysis.</p> <p>12.30pm</p> <p>Brentford v Manchester United live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p><strong>Barry Glendenning</strong> returns from his morning stint on matchday live to provide minute-by-minute updates from the lunchtime kickoff. Brentford have won two of their last three home league games against Manchester United, drawing the other, and after their 4-3 defeat in May, United could lose back-to-back league meetings with the Bees for only the third time. Yet Ruben Amorim’s side beat Chelsea last weekend, rising to a giddy 11th, and are aiming for their first back-to-back league wins since November. Keith Andrews’ Brentford sit 17th with just four points after their London derby defeat by Fulham. <strong>David Hytner</strong> and <strong>Barney Ronay</strong> provide reports and analysis from the Gtech.</p> <p>3pm</p> <p>Crystal Palace v Liverpool and more: clockwatch live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Liverpool travel to Selhurst Park for a match featuring the Premier League’s only two unbeaten sides so far this season. Giovanni Leoni’s anterior cruciate ligament injury means Arne Slot must carefully manage his options at centre-back – with Marc Guéhi playing for their opponents. That aside, you might bet your shirt (unless your name is Hugo Ekitiké) on three points for the visitors since Liverpool have won nine of their last 10 league games at Palace, their longest current unbeaten run away from home in the league against any side. Your clockwatch hosts <strong>Billy Munday</strong> and <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> will also be monitoring Chelsea v Brighton and the Madrid derby as Atlético take on Real at 3.15pm. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong> reports from Palace and <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> from Stamford Bridge, with <strong>Sid Lowe</strong> primed to check in from the Metropolitano.</p>   <p>4pm</p> <p>Canada v England live</p> <p>Women’s Rugby World Cup final</p>  <p>History is against England owing to a dismal World Cup finals record. They have reached the denouement of the last six tournaments while winning just once, also against Canada, in 2014. But on the evidence of this World Cup campaign, the current crop of Red Roses, who have amassed a record 32 successive victories, are ready to thrive on the greatest stage of all. There are seven survivors from the starting XV edged 34-31 by New Zealand in the 2022 final and that agonising late defeat – their only loss in the last 63 games – has stalked England ever since. <strong>Lee Calvert</strong> helms our liveblog with <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong> and <strong>Robert Kitson</strong> at a sold-out Twickenham for the showpiece.</p> <p>8pm</p> <p>Tottenham v Wolves live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Spurs are on a mini-roll having beaten Doncaster in the Carabao Cup in midweek and battled back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 against Brighton last weekend. By contrast, Wolves have yet to claim a single point, though a Carabao Cup third-round win over Everton was timely. Still, Vítor Pereira desperately needs a win with Wolves rock bottom after five defeats on the trot. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> hosts our liveblog, with <strong>John Brewin</strong> reporting from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>   <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p><strong>Daniel Harris</strong> and <strong>Dominic Booth</strong> sift through the fallout from Saturday’s matches before our live football countdown blog looks forward to a Sunday featuring two big Premier League games. Aston Villa meet Fulham at 2pm followed by the match of the weekend as Newcastle host Arsenal at 4.30pm. North of the border, events at Livingston will be keenly monitored as Russell Martin’s shambolic tenure at Rangers edges ever closer to a parting of the ways. Rangers have won just four of their 14 matches across all competitions this season, with their most defeats at this stage (five) since 1994-95 under Walter Smith. Surely another defeat will trigger the ejector seat at Ibrox.</p> <p>2pm</p> <p> Aston Villa v Fulham live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>It has been a troubling start to the season for Unai Emery’s Aston Villa, but John McGinn’s early strike earned them a first win of the season against Bologna. Emery believes his side now have something to build on. He told TNT Sports after their Europa League win: “At home I felt always here, strong and confident … and today I felt it again.” His Fulham counterpart, Marco Silva, is in a far better place after back-to-back home wins against Leeds and Brentford. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong> helms our clockwatch with <strong>Ben Fisher</strong> reporting from Villa Park.</p>   <p>4.30pm</p> <p>Newcastle v Arsenal live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Nick Woltemade, Newcastle’s record signing, will continue his crash course in English football against Arsenal at St James’ Park. Like Alexander Isak before him, the Germany international will need time to be assimilated into the team, but his manager, Eddie Howe, is confident he has what it takes to be a success on Tyneside. “Like any striker, you have to be in goalscoring areas, otherwise you won’t score,” Howe noted, not incorrectly. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> keeps the live updates coming while <strong>Louise Taylor</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong> provide reports and analysis.</p> <p>5pm</p> <p>Ryder Cup live</p> <p>Golf</p>  <p><strong>Scott Murray</strong> returns for the big finale. Each of the 12 singles matches, featuring every player on both teams, is worth one point while tied matches result in half a point each. There promises to be plenty of drama as the contest speeds to its Sunday climax. Past nail-biters include Bernhard Langer’s duel with Hale Irwin at Kiawah Island in 1991: the German missed a six-foot putt that would have earned a tie, allowing Team USA to take the trophy. Then there was Brookline in 1999 when José María Olazábal missed a crucial putt at the 17th after Justin Leonard sank a 45-foot birdie putt to lead a thrilling fightback for the hosts. Not forgetting the Miracle at Medinah in 2012, final-day excitement on an epic scale. With the Americans 10-6 up and needing only four wins and one half from the 12 singles, they blew it as the Europeans rallied and carved out a 14-13 lead thanks to Martin Kaymer’s win over Steve Stricker. It was left to Tiger Woods to salvage US hopes by beating Francesco Molinari: that pairing ended in a draw, and the visitors had completed golf’s greatest team comeback. <strong>Ewan Murray</strong>, <strong>Andy Bull</strong> and <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong> report from the Bethpage Black course.</p>
