<p>China has accused UK politicians of “arrogance, ignorance and a twisted mindset” as it defended British Steel’s owner, Jingye, after a barrage of criticism over the narrowly averted shutdown of its blast furnaces.</p> <p>Beijing’s embassy to the UK accused unspecified British public figures of slandering China’s government and businesses, in <a href="http://gb.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/PressandMedia/Spokepersons/202504/t20250416_11595415.htm">comments</a> published on Wednesday on its website.</p> <p>It followed criticism of the actions of Jingye, British Steel’s Chinese owner since 2020, by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds. Reynolds accused Jingye of not acting in good faith after it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/13/no-guarantee-british-steel-plant-will-be-able-to-continue-says-business-secretary">threatened to shut down British Steel’s furnaces at Scunthorpe</a> within days, with the loss of 2,700 jobs.</p> <p>The government stepped in on Saturday to avoid the shutdowns with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/12/why-does-british-steel-need-to-be-rescued-by-the-government-and-what-happens-next">emergency legislation</a> to take control of British Steel.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/15/uk-government-refuses-to-rule-out-redundancies-at-scunthorpe-steelworks">UK government refuses to rule out redundancies at Scunthorpe steelworks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In its first public comments since the government stepped in, Jingye said on Wednesday that it “request[s] that the UK government respect and protect the legitimate rights and interests of Jingye as a foreign investor throughout this process”.</p> <p>In a statement provided to the Financial Times, Jingye said it would “seek a proper solution that ensures a bright future for British Steel”, and added that it had previously safeguarded jobs and made investments in the plant. </p> <p>The dispute over the future of the Scunthorpe furnaces has threatened to worsen the UK’s already troubled relationship with China, even as the Labour government seeks to boost inward investment.</p> <p>China’s embassy said politicians objecting to the country’s involvement in the UK steel sector “took the opportunity to attack all Chinese companies and the Chinese government”, after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/14/dont-politicise-row-over-scunthorpe-steel-plant-says-chinese-foreign-ministry">warning by the country’s foreign ministry</a> earlier on Monday against “politicising” the situation.</p> <p>In an unusual question-and-answer format, the embassy wrote: “The anti-China rhetoric of some individual British politicians is extremely absurd, reflecting their arrogance, ignorance and twisted mindset.”</p> <p>Jingye was approached by the Conservative government in 2019 to take over British Steel after its previous owner, the private equity firm Greybull Capital, walked away. British Steel has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/11/government-scrambles-to-save-british-steel-as-company-faces-crises-within-crises">lost more than £350m</a> since then. Jingye said last month it would close the blast furnaces, and it turned down an offer of £500m in UK government support to switch from the polluting blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces.</p> <p>Reynolds said the UK had “got it wrong in the past” about allowing Chinese investment in strategically important industries such as steel, and highlighted the influence of the Chinese government on private companies. “I wouldn’t personally bring a Chinese company into our steel sector,” he said on Sunday.</p> <p>However, the British government has been sending mixed messages on Chinese investment. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/09/rachel-reeves-heads-to-china-to-build-bridges-but-a-new-golden-era-of-relations-is-impossible">visited China in January</a> to try to drum up investment, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/15/jonathan-reynolds-to-visit-china-to-revive-key-joint-trade-commission">Reynolds is due to visit the country</a> later this year, despite his criticisms.</p> <p>The embassy credited Jingye with saving workers’ jobs in 2020 and said it was “a normal decision” by the company to close the blast furnaces, adding that the dispute could hit Chinese investment in the UK. It contrasted the treatment of China with the alleged lack of criticism of Donald Trump’s tariffs. The embassy wrote: “What on earth are they up to?”</p> <p>“Any words or deeds that politicise or maliciously hype up business issues will undermine the confidence of Chinese business investors in the UK and damage China-UK economic and trade cooperation,” it added.</p> <p>A UK government spokesperson said: “We will take a consistent, long-term and strategic approach to managing the UK’s relations with China, rooted in UK and global interests.</p> <p>“We will continue to support UK business to engage with the second largest economy in the world, while being clear-eyed to any risks and ensuring security and resilience.”</p>
