<p>Liverpool made a loss of £57m last season after not playing in the Champions League while wages and overhead costs increased, the club’s latest accounts have revealed.</p> <p>Liverpool’s accounts for the year to 31 May 2024 show revenue rose by £20m to £614m, with commercial revenue breaking £300m for the first time. But with media revenue falling by £38m to £204m, mainly as a result of competing in the Europa League rather than the Champions League, and administration costs rising by £38m to £600m the club recorded a pre-tax loss of £57m. It made a pre-tax loss of £9m in 2023 and a £7.5m profit in 2022. Liverpool’s bank debt decreased by £10m to £116m.</p> <p>Administration costs mainly cover salaries and overheads, which have increased by 88% since 2018. Then the figure stood at £320m. Match-day costs have risen by almost 80% in the past eight years. The accounting period includes Liverpool rebuilding their midfield with the signings of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo and Ryan Gravenberch and extending 11 contracts in the men’s squad. Seven signings were also made for the women’s team, among them Natasha Flint, Marie Höbinger and Sophie Román Haug, with five contracts extended.</p> <p>Match-day revenue increased by £22m to £102m thanks to the opening of the new Anfield Road Stand and a rise in the number of competitive games played. The biggest uplift was in commercial operations, up by £36m to £308m, with strong growth in partnerships and retail. Liverpool signed four new global partners in 2023-24 – UPS, Google Pixel, Peloton and Orion Innovation – and made record revenues across seven global retail locations including a new store in Dublin.</p> <p>Liverpool’s chief finance officer, Jenny Beacham, said: “Operating a financially sustainable club continues to be our priority and, with the continued increase in costs, it’s essential to grow income streams year on year to maintain financial stability.</p> <p>“The success of our commercial operations, together with the opening of the new Anfield Road Stand, has increased our revenues during this reporting period which demonstrates our desire to continue to compete at the highest levels of football in the men’s and women’s game. The global appeal of this football club continues to be phenomenal and is the underlying strength and opportunity we have for continued growth.”</p>
