<p>Morning everyone. Coalition MPs groping for a way forward on net zero policy have been helped on their way by a slide presentation seen by Guardian Australia that argued “heat deaths are not a thing” and that renewables were unlikely to produce low-cost energy. Meanwhile, our monthly poll shows many more voters support a net zero target than not.</p> 
<p>Elsewhere, Israel has ordered Gaza strikes after Hamas allegedly violated the ceasefire agreement, Hurricane Melissa has been called the “storm of the century”, the Matildas are in action against England – and the supermarket taste test is chocolate ice-cream.</p>

 <li><p><em><strong>Exclusive | </strong></em>Coalition MPs weighing up whether to abandon net zero have been briefed on research that argued <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/29/coalition-mps-net-zero-doubts-climate-science">“heat deaths aren’t a thing”</a>, played down the prospect of substantial sea level rises and claimed “no one has ever made low-cost energy” from wind and solar. It comes as Australian researchers have found that oceans will enter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/29/climate-change-global-heating-warming-oceans-uncharted-future-australia">“uncharted territory”</a> by 2040 due to global heating, even if significant emissions cuts occur.</p></li>

But there was also a warning for Anthony Albanese, with most voters yet to be convinced about Aukus and trade deals with the US.</p></li>

Meanwhile the co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry’s has accused its owner of being part of a movement of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/28/ben-jerrys-donald-trump-ice-cream-gaza-ben-cohen">“corporate butt kissing”</a> of Donald Trump and says management blocked the ice-cream brand from producing a flavour in support of peace in Gaza.</p></li>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>After the Whyalla steelworks was handed a $2.4bn taxpayer bailout in February, a steady stream of heavy industry operators have asked for handouts, including Rio Tinto and Glencore.

<p>Once the real ones were separated from the “almost ice-creams”, Nicholas Jordan and friends took on the task of tasting supermarket chocolate ice-creams.
