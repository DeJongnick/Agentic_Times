<p><strong>What’s your number one guilty pleasure?</strong></p> <p>I love Papa John’s pizza so much. Whenever I’m on my period, I need Papa John’s. After a photoshoot, everyone knows we’re getting Papa John’s. In LA you have access to so much bougie pizza. No, I want Papa John’s pizza.</p> <p><strong>On your new album you’re exploring an alter ego called Gadget Girl</strong><strong>; what’s the number one gadget you can’t live without?</strong></p> <p>Yeah I’ve always been a gadget girl, but I’m putting it to the forefront this time; it’s always enhanced what I’ve done, and I think it’ll be a cool narrative on stage – a sci-fi thing. I can’t live without my electric violin and loop station: that’s how I start all my songs. If I were to make a gadget, it would be basically that, all in one – like a Midi violin. Midi pianos are so accessible and affordable – [I’d invent] a Midi violin that can do the same thing.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYJJWc3HUQc"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xYJJWc3HUQc?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>What book do you return to, and why?</strong></p> <p>African Music: A People’s Art by Francis Bebey. It’s about the different string instruments in Africa and how they’re played, and what tribes play them. And also, right now I keep going back to Stillness Speaks by Eckhart Tolle; it’s light poetry about life, and it’s really inspirational. And you don’t need to read the whole book – when you don’t have a lot of time, you can just open up to any page.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/oct/08/rosie-odonnell-comedian-interview-common-knowledge-meat-loaf-mother-wrote-me">Rosie O’Donnell: ‘Meat Loaf’s mother wrote me and said, “You can’t be mean to my son”’</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>When you’re on the road, what’s the first thing you do when you get to your hotel room?</strong></p> <p>Set a vibe: make sure the lights are good; if I have a candle, I’ll light it. And I lay out everything, get my makeup and everything on the counter. And I turn the air-con off, because I don’t like being cold.</p> <p><strong>What’s your most controversial pop culture opinion?</strong></p> <p>That pop culture is stupid in general. Who gives a fuck about what other people are doing?</p> <p><strong>What’s the best lesson you learned from someone you’ve worked with?</strong></p> <p>That you have the final say when it comes to your art. And to stay true to that, no matter what.</p> <p>I learned that from working with every person I’ve ever worked with. Because usually people get invested in the art too, and they start to have their own ideas. If you’re working with a producer, they might take the lead in certain ways. And you have to be a little more direct when it comes to that, like saying, “Actually, I don’t like that.”</p> <p><strong>What habit are you trying to kick?</strong></p> <p>I’m trying to eliminate as much processed food out of my diet as possible and just eat real food every day. That’s hard sometimes, especially when you’re on tour and you want to get quick food, but I really want to make sure I bring a little cutting board and stuff so I can get groceries and cut up some vegetables, buy some meat.</p> <p><strong>What’s the strangest thing in your fridge right now?</strong></p> <p>Probably the sea moss that has a bunch of random shit in it that makes me go to the bathroom really bad. It’s got a bunch of probiotics in it – it’s supposed to be good for you.</p> <p><strong>What do you do when you procrastinate?</strong></p> <p>I doomscroll. I do tutorials on how to do something weird in a program or with gear. Or I will clean up: I think, “Oh, I’ll be able to get this done if I clean up, because then it’ll be clean” – but then I just go to bed.</p> <p><strong>Tell us a favourite fact that you recently learned.</strong></p> <p>I’m 100% that bitch.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Sudan Archives’ third album, The BPM, is out on Stones Throw.
