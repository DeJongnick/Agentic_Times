<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, the associate of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking crimes, has been transferred from a federal prison in Florida, to a lower-security facility in Texas, the US Bureau of Prisons said on Friday.</p> <p>“We can confirm, Ghislaine Maxwell is in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) at the Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Bryan in Bryan, Texas,” a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said in a statement.</p> <p>Maxwell’s attorney, David Oscar Markus, also confirmed the transfer but declined further comment. FPC Bryan is <a href="https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/bry/">described</a> as a “minimum security federal prison camp” that houses 635 female inmates.</p> <p>According to the Bureau of Prisons’ inmate locator, the Texas facility is also home to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-holmes">Elizabeth Holmes</a>, the disgraced former CEO of the California-based blood-testing company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/theranos">Theranos</a>, who is serving a lengthy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/07/elizabeth-holmes-prison-sentence">sentence</a> for fraud. Real Housewives of Salt Lake City TV star Jen Shah is also serving time there <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/11/jen-shah-real-housewives-salt-lake-city-guilty-fraud-charges">for fraud</a>.</p> <p>Maxwell’s move from FCI Tallahassee, a <a href="https://www.bop.gov/locations/institutions/tal/">low-security prison</a>, to the federal prison camp in Bryan comes roughly a week after she was interviewed in Florida <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/25/ghislaine-maxwell-justice-department-meeting">over two days</a> about the Epstein case by the deputy US attorney general, Todd Blanche, who is also one of Donald Trump’s former lawyers. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/31/virginia-giuffre-epstein-documents-family">Virginia Giuffre wanted Epstein documents made public, siblings say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Blanche had said that he wanted to speak with Maxwell – who was sentenced in 2022 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/28/ghislaine-maxwell-sentencing-sex-trafficking-epstein">for sex trafficking and other related crimes</a> – to see if she might have “information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims”.</p> <p>Details of that meeting have not been made public but Maxwell’s lawyer described it as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-official-meet-epstein-associate-maxwell-again-friday-2025-07-24/">“very productive</a>”, adding that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/25/ghislaine-maxwell-justice-department-meeting">Maxwell answered</a> the questions “honestly, truthfully, to the best of her ability”.</p> <p>The interview took place amid growing political and public pressure on the Trump administration to release additional federal documents related to the Epstein case –&nbsp;a case which has, for years, been the subject of countless conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Earlier in July, the justice department drew bipartisan criticism and backlash after announcing that it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/jeffrey-epstein-trump-maga-turmoil">would not be releasing</a> any more documents from the investigation into the late Epstein, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/jeffrey-epstein-suicide-justice-department-fbi-review-confirms">died in prison</a> in New York in 2019 while awaiting federal trial. This was despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/14/jeffrey-epstein-trump-maga-turmoil">earlier pledges </a>to release more files, by the US president and the US attorney general, Pam Bondi.</p> <p>Last week, the House of Representatives committee on oversight and government reform <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/jeffrey-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell-subpoena">subpoenaed Maxwell</a> to testify via deposition later this month. In response, Maxwell’s lawyer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/29/ghislaine-maxwell-congress-testify-immunity">sent a letter</a> to lawmakers this week stating that Maxwell was willing to testify but only if certain conditions are met, including being granted immunity. In that same letter, Maxwell also made a plea for clemency.</p> <p>But on Friday, the House indefinitely postponed that deposition.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Maxwell has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/28/ghislaine-maxwell-supreme-court">petitioned</a> the US supreme court to overturn her conviction.</p> <p>• The headline of this article was amended on 4 August 2025 to refer to Ghislaine Maxwell as Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplice.</p>
