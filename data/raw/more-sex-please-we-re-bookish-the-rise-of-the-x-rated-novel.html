<p>When<strong> </strong>the judges awarded Yael van der Wouden’s brilliant debut, The Safekeep, the Women’s prize for fiction last month, they weren’t just garlanding a book that happens to have a few sexy scenes in it. They were responding to a work that engages with the current levels of literary excitement around sex and marries this with sweeping historical vistas and a distinctive sensibility. It was joined on the shortlist by Miranda July’s exuberant odyssey of midlife desire, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/16/all-fours-by-miranda-july-review-larger-than-life">All Fours,</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/21/fundamentally-by-nussaibah-younis-review-witty-debut-about-islamic-state-brides#:~:text=The%20novel%20is%20bitingly%20witty,%2C%20and%20never%20straightforward%2C%20processes.">Fundamentally</a> by Nussaibah Younis, a smart, quickfire account of a young academic’s work for a UN deradicalisation programme, which juxtaposes the world of Middle Eastern religious politics with a closeup relish for female sexuality.</p> <p>While younger generations, at least, have said in recent years that they want to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/oct/25/gen-z-less-sex-tv-movie-trend">see more platonic friendship and less sex on screen</a>, reading appetites appear to be going in the other direction, with a huge boom in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/feb/03/romantasy-and-booktok-driving-a-huge-rise-in-science-fiction-and-fantasy-sales">romance and “romantasy”</a> – the romance-fantasy hybrid driven by TikTok and the success of authors such as Rebecca Yarros and Sarah J Maas. We all have strong, mixed feelings about sex, and the cultural landscape reflects the whole spectrum of kinks and hangups. But that means that we have all the more need for writers like Van der Wouden, July and Sally Rooney, who push the boundaries of how explicit the literary novel can be while also giving us new ways of imagining how desire works within lives today.</p> <p>Ours is a dual age of identity politics and porn. We get our identities from sex – queer or straight, pansexual or “incel” – but it’s also the white-hot arena in which identity melts down. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, when pornography is everywhere and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/30/want-by-gillian-anderson-review-let-me-be-your-fantasy">Gillian Anderson</a> is collecting thousands of sexual fantasies with anthropological zeal, it seems we still need literature to tell us new things about sex. What I found, reading recent work by authors including Rooney, Van der Wouden, Jen Beagin, K Patrick and Eimear McBride, were unpredictable fusions of the two impulses. Lovers, dutifully preoccupied with questions of identity by day, find that in bed they can transcend selfhood, outstripping their identities.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/13/womens-prize-winner-yael-van-der-wouden-its-heartbreaking-to-see-so-much-hatred-towards-queer-people">Women’s prize winner Yael van der Wouden: ‘It’s heartbreaking to see so much hatred towards queer people’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To surrender individuality and accept the dissolution of the self, to lose sight of who is in control – these possibilities have preoccupied erotic writers since the early 20th century, when sex first became representable in literary fiction. Back then there was DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, staking the redemption of humanity on sexual transformation. In Lawrence’s wake came Henry Miller, Anaïs Nin and Georges Bataille – all about abjection and breaking taboos. Then the outrageously argumentative Norman Mailer and John Updike, whose frank delight in the female form called out for a feminist backlash. It came in the shape of Kate Millett’s wittily polemical 1970 Sexual Politics and a new wave of sexually explicit novels by women concerned less with celebrating than with demythologising sex. Erica Jong’s epochal 1973 Fear of Flying ushered in the “zipless fuck” – sex without strings – and allowed a generation of feminists to experiment with promiscuity, but for all its brilliance on psychoanalysis and marriage, the book is pretty terrible on sex.</p> <p>It took another backlash – within feminism itself – to make sex great again. In 1967 Susan Sontag had written The Pornographic Imagination, an essay defending writers such as Bataille from prudery and fighting to classify pornographic writing as literature, even or especially when it exceeded realism. “Tamed as it may be, sexuality remains one of the demonic forces in human consciousness,” she wrote – so why not make it a resource for “breaking through the limits of consciousness”? Angela Carter took on Sontag’s ideas in her 1978 study, The Sadeian Woman, arguing against feminists concerned to outlaw porn, and making the case for the “moral pornographer” – an artist who “uses pornographic material as part of the acceptance of the logic of a world of absolute sexual licence for all the genders”. </p> <p>Sontag and Carter saw that the power of sex lay in opening selfhood to otherness with extravagant force. Otherness and innovation go together, so great writing about great sex always has radical potential. The parameters they set out still define the best possibilities&nbsp;of what sex writing can be, though plenty of men – from Philip Roth to Michel Houellebecq – came along in the meantime to try to prove that male desire was still fascinating.</p> <p>Reading in our contemporary era, I find myself most&nbsp;riveted by writers who continue Carter’s tradition.&nbsp;Published earlier this year, Sophie Kemp’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/24/paradise-logic-by-sophie-kemp-review-wild-absurd-and-wickedly-funny">Paradise Logic</a> tells the satirical story of a young woman’s attempt to make herself into the ideal girlfriend and, in doing so, exposes the patriarchal nature of porn culture.&nbsp;But precisely because it’s so clever and sassy it reveals the limits of satire, whereas other contemporary novelists are bringing together the pornographic and the transcendent in a more transporting way.</p> <p>It’s telling that these writers are more often writing gay than heterosexual sex. Garth Greenwell, who has described himself as wanting to write scenes that are “100% pornographic and 100% high art”, is more trammelled by questions of identity than Alan Hollinghurst was when he wrote The Swimming-Pool Library – a book Greenwell credits as an inspiration. Greenwell is writing sex in the age of consent and dutiful identity politics, but arguably it’s these constraints that power his existential quest.</p> <p>There’s a scene in Greenwell’s 2020 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/15/cleanness-by-garth-greenwell-review-intimacy-and-distance">Cleanness</a> where the pornographic and the transcendent explicitly entwine. The narrator has a BDSM encounter with a Bulgarian man he calls Svetcheto, “the little saint”. The usually submissive narrator has agreed to dominate. It’s a brutal scene, all the more frightening because it mirrors an earlier encounter when the narrator was dangerously violated. We’re worried both that he’ll reenact that violence and that he won’t carry off this new role. But then it becomes clear he’s enjoying himself. Suffused by mutual, unexpected transcendence, the couple’s porn-inspired identities simultaneously break down and burst into flower. Laughing, Svetcheto licks away the narrator’s tears. “Do you see? You don’t have to be like that,” he says. “You can be like this.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Sally Rooney writes sex scenes that are at once radiant and minutely observed by her overthinking characters</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Jen Beagin, K Patrick and Yael van der Wouden write moving, powerful portraits of lesbian desire, full of anatomical detail. Beagin’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/may/20/big-swiss-by-jen-beagin-review-fluffy-sex-comedy-with-a-dark-underbelly">Big Swiss</a> is a large-hearted tale of a love affair between Flavia, an absurdly beautiful gynaecologist, and Greta, the more klutzy, down-at-heel writer who’s paid by Flavia’s sex therapist to transcribe her sessions. “Her pussy looked like advanced origami. A crisp pink lotus flower folded by a master. Greta briefly rearranged it with her mouth.” The sex scenes in Patrick’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/07/mrs-s-by-k-patrick-review-a-crescendo-of-sapphic-longing">Mrs S</a> are less metaphorical and more breathlessly desiring, though the prose is taut in its lyricism. It can feel like the plot – a love affair between the 22-year-old new teaching recruit and the headmaster’s wife in a girls’ boarding school – is an excuse for the sex scenes, but in a way that’s the point.</p> <p>In both books, it is striking how quickly sex reveals the existential need for transformation. Even in that first sex scene, Greta feels as if she’s reached a place “she’s been visiting in her dreams for years and forgetting”. Mrs S is casually historical – set in the 1980s or 90s – which means its identity politics can be implicit: the narrator wears a chest binder but the book doesn’t raise questions of trans identity. Instead it is preoccupied with the loss of identity, as the narrator feels herself remade as the “You” she becomes in her lover’s mouth. “It is as if she has always been waiting for this arrival, of me into my body. You. I don’t have a name. Isn’t it so much better, to not have a name, to be dropped straight from the clouds?” </p> <p>The sex scenes are more shocking in Van der Wouden’s The Safekeep because the subject matter is so serious. This is the story of a violently sudden passion that becomes a love affair between Eva, a displaced Jew, and Isabel, a gentile woman who has unwitting power over her. The book is set in the aftermath of the second world war and, given the gravity of the material, some reviewers have wondered if the sex scenes are necessary. But this is to miss the point, which is that the book only works if the relationship throws both women entirely off-kilter – using the edges of porn to show sex derailing not only their lives but their selves, and indeed the conventional novel form itself. Isabel finds herself vulnerably, joyously powerless in an unfamiliar body: “At Eva’s mercy, trapped between the cage of her teeth, she had grown a new shape.” Van der Wouden insists that her complex sense of character development justifies sexual explicitness. But she has also been clear in interviews that no justification is needed: “The girls deserve to have some fun. This was my mantra while writing: Let them have some fun!”</p> <p>So what about those writers daring to write explicit, ecstatic heterosexual sex? The most compelling are Eimear McBride, whose The Lesser Bohemians makes the reader feel as though they are almost inside the bodies of the protagonists, and Sally Rooney, who is casually magisterial at writing sex scenes that are at once radiant and minutely observed by her overthinking characters. Like Greenwell, Rooney balances a commitment to a contemporary vision of identity and consent with a willingness to explore the pull of dissolution and abjection.</p> <p>In Intermezzo, the young chess genius Ivan checks repeatedly that his lover likes what he’s doing, while his brother Peter half-exploits Naomi, a young woman who has sold pornographic images of herself and remains too willing to abase herself for men. But beneath these exterior sexual identities are their private bodily lives, and sex is the best means of growth they have. Rooney follows McBride in dizzyingly contorting her sentences: “Deep pressing almost hurting and she felt him throbbing, wanting to, and she wanted that also, wet inside, image of silver behind her closed eyelids, jetting, emptying into her …” Rooney is surprised that people don’t ask her more often about the place of sex in her novels; “the erotic is a huge engine in the stories of all my books,” she has said.</p> <p>But it is in All Fours that the full possibilities of Carter’s “moral pornography” are realised. July’s novel manages to be at once an ethnographic account of women’s perimenopausal sexuality and a more darkly anti-realist tale of a woman living out her sexual fantasies. The narrator spends vast sums transforming a small-town hotel room into a sumptuous dreamscape, where she tests her capacities for love and lust with Davey, a beautiful, potent but determinedly chaste young dancer she meets at the gas station. The encounters with Davey are brilliantly, exuberantly realised – all the more so because July never loses sight of their comedy. In the absence of sex, they seek consummation elsewhere, and at one point Davey changes her tampon. The scene is both bathetically comic, intensely erotic, and unexpectedly moving. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/24/this-book-is-my-bible-the-women-who-read-miranda-julys-all-fours-then-blew-up-their-lives">‘This book is my bible!’ The women who read Miranda July’s All Fours, then blew up their lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But it is once she and Davey part and the narrator has sex with sexagenarian Audra that the novel becomes incandescent. The narrator is home now, adjusting to her former life, but has negotiated a weekly night in the hotel. She seeks out Audra, who had a relationship with Davey years earlier, desperate to compare notes. “Fantasies are all good and well up to a certain age,” Audra says, “Then you have to have lived experiences or you’ll go batty.” And so Audra describes her sexual past with Davey, while both women masturbate, an experience that, for the narrator, “lit up new neural pathways, as if sex, the whole concept of it, was being freshly mapped”.</p> <p>As a sexual encounter, this is moving and original. As a vision of womanhood undergoing feats of change and confronting mortality, it’s extraordinary. This scene takes us beyond realism. In her life at home, July’s narrator is casually, matter-of-factly bound up in the sexual questions of her contemporary world: she has a nonbinary child and is anxiously aware how limited her sex life is by motherhood. But July uses the narrator’s experiences in the hotel room to bend and test our sense of novelistic, psychological plausibility. It is a place where identity can be discarded and remade. </p> <p>Sex remains at the centre of much of the best fiction, and we need powerful fictions to show us what sex is or can become. This is where realism comes up against something stranger, and body and consciousness undo and affirm each other, because it can be at once so ordinary, and so transcendent.</p> <p>• Look!
