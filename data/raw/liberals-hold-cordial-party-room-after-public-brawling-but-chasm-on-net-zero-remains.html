<p>After months of public and private brawling, the Liberals had what many described as a respectful, cordial and constructive meeting about net zero.</p> <p>Some participants joked that was almost news in itself.</p> <p>The party’s final position on net zero and climate remains unclear – especially with more hardline conservative Liberals and Nationals still calling for net zero to be revoked entirely.</p> <p>But a common theme is emerging among Coalition members on all sides: that they will likely water down their commitment – perhaps even give it a new name – and hope to draw a line under a damaging debate so they can finally get on with landing punches on the Labor government.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The three-hour discussion between 35 MPs and senators drew the party a step closer to a final position, which sources say could mean a dumping of the unconditional legislated 2050 emissions target and a renewed focus on reducing electricity prices – alongside an emissions reduction plan.</p> <p>Numerous Liberals privately believe that position will have to be announced by Christmas. Many conceded the issue has been a distraction.</p> <p>Guardian Australia spoke to Liberals after the meeting, who remarked that there was unity in the room on the two “principles” of reducing prices and emissions.</p> <p>One Liberal remarked that a Coalition agreement would be easier if Barnaby Joyce – one of the most outspoken critics of net zero –<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/17/barnaby-joyce-actively-considering-defection-to-one-nation-say-coalition-sources"> defected to One Nation</a>.</p> <p>Dan Tehan, who is leading the Liberals’ energy policy review, signalled some kind of compromise deal.</p> <p>“There is a pathway, I think, to bring us all together in a way that unifies us all now. Exactly what that looks like we are still working through,” he told journalists at Parliament House after the meeting.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/30/abortion-stillbirth-leave-barnaby-joyce-andrew-hastie-playing-politics">Barnaby Joyce and Andrew Hastie rebuked for ‘playing politics’ on abortion in debate on stillbirth leave</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Everyone is committed to us reducing emissions so that we’re playing our part when it comes to climate change.</p> <p>“Our number one focus and number one priority has to be addressing energy costs.”</p> <p>Internally, there is a fracture between party members over what net zero means in practicality, amid concerns it has been weaponised by opponents and fears dumping the target would be seen as climate denial.</p> <p>Regional MPs have raised concerns about a renewable energy transition crowding prime farmland with wind turbines and solar panels, while metropolitan MPs say net zero is critical to winning back city seats and holding current ones.</p> <p>Today’s meeting, MPs said, didn’t close that chasm.</p> <p>Some Liberals believe they have begun landing blows on Labor over transparency, industrial relations and housing, but that the focus on themselves has let the government off the hook too easily.</p> <p>In the meeting, members were urged to be more disciplined and to not “verbal” other Liberals on the issue. One MP warned there was “so much toxicity” around the “culture” of the party on the issue.</p> <p>In recent weeks, some moderates have begun publicly loosening their language around the net zero target. Shadow minister Andrew Bragg, a staunch advocate for climate action, told Guardian Australia the action counts more than the policy name.</p> <p>“You can cut net zero a million different ways. It is a totally fungible concept. Any nation wanting to cut pollution can craft their policies to suit their own situation,” he said.</p> <p>“The problem Australia faces is Labor’s disastrous rollout with its 82% renewable target, for example. This has increased power prices and trampled over regional communities. It’s the domestic policies that have been disastrous, not the existence of an anti pollution treaty.”</p> <p>On Friday morning, before the meeting, Maria Kovacic also left the door open on a net zero compromise.</p> <p>“[Net zero is an] outcome of the policy, and we have to have a pathway to reduce our emissions and ensure that Australians have a clean and reliable energy grid. And that includes looking at gas and renewables, obviously, and we can also look at a pathway to unlocking nuclear technologies,” she said.</p> <p>No Nationals members attended the Friday discussion, which coincided with the party’s federal council meeting. Tehan is expected to speak to the Nationals party room next week.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointed">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
