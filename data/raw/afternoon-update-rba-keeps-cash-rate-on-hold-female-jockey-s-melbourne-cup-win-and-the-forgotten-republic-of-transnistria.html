<p>Good afternoon.</p> 
<p>The Reserve Bank has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/nov/04/rba-holds-interest-rate-after-surprise-inflation">held the official interest rate at 3.6%</a> in a move widely expected by economists and banks.

<p>Photographer Didier Bizet has documented life in the self-proclaimed autonomous republic of Transnistria, which is not recognised by the international community. As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/nov/03/orphans-of-history-the-forgotten-republic-of-transnistria-photo-essay">Pjotr Sauer explains</a>, its status raises complex questions about the identity of its inhabitants – Ukrainians, Russians, Moldovans and Bulgarians.</p>

His opponents may have been vocal, but as others have noted, there’s a clarity about his message that stands in sharp contrast to many Democratic politicians.</p>
