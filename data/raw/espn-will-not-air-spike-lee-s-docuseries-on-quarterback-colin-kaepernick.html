<p>Director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/spikelee">Spike Lee</a>’s multi-part documentary series for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/espn">ESPN</a> Films about the former NFL quarterback <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/colin-kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a>, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/19/three-years-in-the-nfl-wilderness-what-colin-kaepernick-lost-and-won">sparked</a> a national debate when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/02/muhammad-ali-colin-kaepernick-proud-history-black-protest-in-sport">protested</a> against racial injustice nearly a decade ago, will not be released, the film-maker and ESPN said.</p> 
<p>“ESPN, Colin Kaepernick and Spike Lee have collectively decided to no longer proceed with this project as a result of certain creative differences,” ESPN said in a statement to Reuters on Saturday. “Despite not reaching finality, we appreciate all the hard work and collaboration that went into this film.”</p> 
<p>Lee told Reuters on Friday that the series was not going to be released.</p> 
<p>“It’s not coming out. That’s all I can say,” Lee said on the red carpet ahead of the Harold and Carole Pump Foundation dinner, a fundraiser for cancer research and treatment, in Beverly Hills, California.</p>

<p>Asked why, the Oscar-winning director declined to elaborate, citing a nondisclosure agreement. “I can’t. I signed a nondisclosure. I can’t talk about it.”</p> 
<p>Kaepernick ignited a national debate in 2016 when he knelt during the US national anthem to protest against systemic racism and police brutality. The 37-year-old has not played in the NFL since that season. Many experts believed his political activism, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/sep/14/the-kaepernick-effect-a-story-of-the-other-athletes-who-kneeled-in-protest">triggered a movement</a> that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/22/donald-trump-nfl-national-anthem-protests">drew the ire</a> of Donald Trump, was the key reason teams were wary of signing him. He later filed a collusion grievance against team owners, which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/15/colin-kaepernick-reaches-settlement-with-nfl-over-kneeling-protest-fallout">settled</a> with the league in 2019.</p> 
<p>Representatives for Kaepernick did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<p>Production on the series began in 2022, with Walt Disney-owned ESPN touting it as a “full, first-person account” of Kaepernick’s journey that would feature extensive interviews with the player.</p> 
<p>Last year, Puck News <a href="https://puck.news/will-spike-lee-colin-kaepernick-docuseries-ever-air-on-espn/">reported</a> the project faced delays amid disagreements between Kaepernick and Lee over the direction of the film.</p>

<p>The series is <a href="https://x.com/Kaepernick7/status/1489323173921366018">co-produced by</a> Jemele Hill, a former ESPN reporter who was suspended by the network in 2017, after she suggested that fans who disagreed with criticism of NFL players taking a knee from the owner of the Dallas Cowboys should boycott the team’s advertisers. A month earlier, she had enraged the White House when <a href="https://x.com/jemelehill/status/907391978194849793">she tweeted</a>: “Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists.”</p> 
<p>The network’s decision to drop the series comes as the Trump administration has sued broadcasters that reported critically on the president and pushed private businesses and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/trump-universities-dei-funding">schools</a> to end <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/05/trump-dei-initiatives-colleges">diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives</a> that the government now defines as unlawful discrimination against white Americans.</p> 
<p>In December, Disney’s ABC News <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/14/abc-george-stephanopoulos-trump-15-million">agreed</a> to pay $15m to a foundation and museum to be established by Trump as part of a settlement in a defamation lawsuit Trump filed against the network.</p>
