<p>Good afternoon. At least four people have died and dozens are missing after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/03/bali-ferry-sinking-indonesia">a ferry carrying 65 people sank on its way to Bali</a>, according to Indonesian police.</p> <p>The vessel sank before midnight on Wednesday in the Bali Strait as it sailed to a port in the north of the famous holiday island, departing from Banyuwangi, a town on Indonesia’s main island of Java. Local police said four people had died, 31 had been rescued and 30 were missing. The boat was carrying 53 passengers and 12 crew members as well as 22 vehicles, the search and rescue agency said, though it is common in Indonesia for the actual number of passengers on a boat to differ from the manifest.</p> <p>Indonesian politicians have attributed the cause of the accident to “bad weather”. It is understood at this stage that there were no Australians on board the boat.</p> <h2>Top news</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/03/qantas-cyber-attack-data-breach-what-was-taken-what-should-i-do">Qantas cyber-attack: what data was taken and what should I do if I’m affected?</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/03/wa-police-who-shot-dead-aboriginal-woman-jc-geraldton-coroner-inquest-ntwnfb">WA police who shot dead Aboriginal woman did not make meaningful attempts to de-escalate, coroner finds</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/02/trump-us-mexico-border-immigrants-asylum">‘A win for humanity’: Trump’s asylum ban at US-Mexico border ruled unlawful</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/02/lucy-letby-alleged-to-have-murdered-or-harmed-more-babies">Lucy Letby alleged to have murdered and harmed more babies</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/03/thailand-cambodia-leaked-phone-call-shinawatra-dynasty-paetongtarn">The leaked phone call that could ring the changes for one of Thailand’s most powerful dynasties</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/03/architect-melbourne-cricket-ground-mcg-shane-warne-stand-upgrades-rebuild">Architect behind MCG’s Shane Warne Stand says mooted upgrades ‘don’t pass the pub test’</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>In video</h2>    <p>After its May debut, Sydney’s Mutual Aid Market returned to Marrickville’s Addison Road Community Centre for a second time on 29 June.
