<p>It is the second serious training crash in Froome’s career, during which he has won the Tour de France in 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017 as well as the Vuelta a España in 2011 and 2017 and the Giro d’Italia in 2018.</p> 
<p>In 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/12/chris-froome-doubt-tour-de-france-crash-criterium-hospital-injured">Froome was left in intensive care</a> after a freak accident while travelling at 37mph during a reconnaissance ride at the Critérium du Dauphiné.</p> 
<p>The incident occurred when Froome took his hand off his handlebars to blow his nose before a gust of wind destabilised his bike. He then crashed into a wall and lost consciousness.</p> 
<p>After being airlifted to hospital, Froome was discovered to have fractured his right femur and suffered a broken hip, as well as a fractured elbow and fractured ribs, and later admitted he was “lucky to be alive”.</p> 
<p>The Israel-Premier Tech rider, who is out of contract at the end of the year, is expected to miss the remainder of the season with his injuries.</p>
