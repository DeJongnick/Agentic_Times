<p>One of Britain’s biggest discount retailers has blamed a slide in sales and profits on lower-income consumers missing out on wage rises.</p> <p>B&amp;M, which issued a profit warning in February, said consumers had been more cautious about their spending over the past year.</p> <p>It added that its sales had fallen because of “limited real wage growth”, particularly among its “core lower-income consumer groups” who had previously received <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/20/cost-of-living-payments-failing-to-help-low-income-households-in-uk">emergency cost of living support payments</a>, which ended in February 2024.</p> <p>The retailer, which sells everything from cleaning products and pet food to garden furniture and inflatable hot tubs, said comparable sales at its 740-plus UK stores decreased by 3.1% in the 12 months to the end of March.</p> <p>Pre-tax profit fell by 13.2% to £431m as a result of higher depreciation and increased interest costs as well as the “challenging UK retail trading environment”, B&amp;M said.</p> <p>Shares in the company dropped by nearly 15% on Wednesday after the results, as it admitted its “operational execution could have been better”.</p> <p>The UK’s largest bakery chain, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/greggs">Greggs</a>, said in May its sales of iced drinks and snacks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/20/greggs-sales-mac-and-cheese-iced-tea-prices">were on the rise</a>, even as consumers remained cautious. It added that it was benefiting from the rise in consumers’ disposable income, helped by the April increase in the legal minimum wage.</p> <p>Average wages <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/25/who-is-calling-the-shots-when-it-comes-to-uk-wage-levels-workers-or-bosses">across the economy</a> increased by 6.4% in the year to April, according to the most recent official payroll data from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics">Office for National Statistics</a>, at a time when inflation was 3.5%.</p> <p>Hotel and restaurant staff managed to secure an 8.5% increase in median pay over the year to April, according to the ONS, while retail workers were paid 6.9% more over the same period.</p> <p>Recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/22/teachers-doctors-england-pay-rise-nhs">public sector pay awards</a> were also higher than ministers had previously said the government could afford.</p> <p>B&amp;M should have been winning over new customers amid a squeeze on consumers’ finances, according to Russ Mould, the investment director at the broker AJ Bell.</p> <p>“The discount retailer blamed challenging market conditions, yet its value-led business model should have thrived in a period where consumers were watching their pennies,” Mould said.</p> <p>“It should have mopped up extra business from people trading down from more expensive options, while also being a shop of choice for cash-strapped individuals wanting bargains.”</p> <p>Among the bargain-lovers known to shop at B&amp;M are the former prime minister Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie, who recently revealed on social media they had taken their new baby <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/35160581/boris-johnson-baby-poppy-carrie/">to their “favourite shop”</a>.</p> <p>B&amp;M has been led by its finance director since the departure of its chief executive, Alex Russo, in April. Russo’s successor, Tjeerd Jegen, will take the helm in mid-June.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the retailer WH Smith, which is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/28/wh-smith-brand-to-disappear-as-76m-sale-of-stores-to-modella-agreed">due to disappear from British high streets</a> in the coming weeks, reported a 7% increase in sales at its travel shops in railway stations, airports and hospitals in the 13 weeks to the end of May.</p> <p>The company, which agreed to sell its 480 high street stores in March to the Hobbycraft owner, Modella Capital, in a deal worth £76m, said it expected to complete the sale at the end of June.</p> <p>WH Smith said its remaining travel business was on track to meet its full-year financial targets, and said it was “well positioned as we enter our peak summer trading period”.</p>
