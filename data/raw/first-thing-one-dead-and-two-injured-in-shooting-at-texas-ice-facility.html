<p>Good morning.</p> <p>One detainee has been killed and two others <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/dallas-ice-shooting-texas-immigration-center-latest">injured in a shooting</a> at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) field office in Dallas, according to officials.</p> <p>Authorities have also confirmed that the suspected assailant died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. NBC News, citing senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation, reported that the suspect had been identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What are the details of the shooting?</strong> The Dallas police department said officers responded to a call at approximately 6.40am on Wednesday. Police said the suspect “opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building. Two people were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds. One victim died at the scene. The suspect is deceased.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Do we know anything about a potential motive at this stage?</strong> Authorities said the FBI was investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence. The head of the FBI field office in Dallas said “rounds that were found near the suspected shooter contain messages that are anti-Ice in nature”. One of the unspent shell casings recovered had the phrase “ANTI-ICE” written on it, according to a post from the FBI director, Kash Patel.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>World Health </strong><strong>Organization</strong><strong> rejects Trump’s claims of link between </strong><strong>Tylenol</strong><strong> and autism</strong></h2>    <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/24/world-health-organization-trump-autism-tylenol">pushed back against contested claims by the Trump administration</a> that acetaminophen use during pregnancy heightens the risk of autism, further underscoring that no scientific consensus supports such a connection. “Extensive research, including large-scale studies over the past decade, has found no consistent association,” the WHO said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump faces a simmering Republican backlash, with some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/trump-rfk-autism-tylenol-backlash">threatening to “break ranks”</a> over the direction of the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What have Republican opponents said?</strong> Bill Cassidy, a Republican senator for Louisiana and the chair of the Senate health committee, has led a rebellion on the administration’s health policies. “You’re going to change a medical guideline without science?” Cassidy <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5517446-gop-senator-on-trump-linking-autism-tylenol-not-the-case/">told the Hill</a>. “I mean, you’re going to build a bridge without physics?
