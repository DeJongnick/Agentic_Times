<p>Australian Jewish groups have applauded the government’s “entirely appropriate” move to expel the Iranian ambassador in light of Iran’s alleged connections to antisemitic attacks in Australia – but say the “horrendous” news has renewed fears among the already traumatised community.</p> 
<p>Responding to news the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/26/iran-ambassador-expelled-australia-antisemitic-attacks-ntwnfb">listed as a terrorist organisation</a> in Australia, Jewish community members said the action was welcome but overdue.</p> 
<p>Benjamin Klein, a board member of Melbourne’s Adass Israel synagogue, said Tuesday’s “horrendous” news had caused “general fear” among members of his congregation.</p> 
<p>“It’s very concerning. Your mind boggles to think ‘Why would they? What else do they have up their sleeve?’ It should be taken notice of,” Klein said.</p>

<p>“It’s traumatic and quite stressful for the community. It makes people more fearful.”</p> 
<p>The synagogue was was set alight in December, causing significant damage to the building. The arson attack was later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/09/melbourne-adass-israel-synagogue-fire-ripponlea-suspected-terrorist-attack-ntwnfb">declared a terrorist incident</a> and singled out on Tuesday – along with an October arson attack on Lewis’s Continental Kitchen in Bondi – by Anthony Albanese, who said “credible evidence” determined the incidents were directed by Iran.</p> 
<p>Iranian diplomats posted to Australia were not involved, the chief of the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (Asio), Mike Burgess, said.</p> 
<p>Israel’s embassy in Canberra welcomed the decision, saying it was warranted. “This is a step we have long advocated for … A strong and important move,” a spokesperson said.</p> 
<p>The embassy later posted on social media: “Australia has taken a principled stand, others should consider following suit.”</p> 
<p>The president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry – Australia’s peak Jewish Group – Daniel Aghion, said it was “entirely appropriate” for the IRGC to be proscribed a terrorist organisation.</p> 
<p>“These attacks instigated by the Iranian regime are an attack on our nation and our sovereignty. As Australians, we are outraged that a foreign actor perpetrated acts of terror on our soil. Foremost, these were attacks that deliberately targeted Jewish Australians, destroyed a sacred house of worship, caused millions of dollars of damage, and terrified our community,” he said in a statement in which he also thanked the Australian federal police, Asio and state police forces.</p> 
<p>“For many years, we have warned of the threat posed by the Iranian regime … It has consistently shown a willingness and capability to finance and orchestrate terror all over the world,” Aghion said. “Israel’s enemies are Australia’s enemies.”</p>

<p>The Jewish Council of Australia’s Sarah Schwartz said the group was “shocked” to learn of Iran’s involvement in the attacks, and urged caution around politicising the crimes.</p> 
<p>“These attacks have instilled fear in the Jewish community. The Jewish Council reaffirms our solidarity with Adass congregants and all impacted by the attacks.</p> 
<p>“The fact that a foreign government appears to be responsible shows how irresponsible it was for the attacks to be used <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/17/victoria-protests-legislation-antisemitism-laws-places-of-worship-laws-ban-masks-flags-melbourne-synagogue-fire-ntwnfb">to demonise the anti-genocide protest movement</a>. We call on politicians and the media to exercise caution and to avoid politicisation of these attacks in a way that could further harm the Jewish community.”</p> 
<p>The president of the Zionist Federation of Australia, Jeremy Leibler, said the organisation was “deeply disturbed” by the “chilling revelations”.</p> 
<p>He welcomed the government’s “decisive” action and said it sent “a powerful and principled message that terrorism, foreign interference, and hate have no place in Australia”.</p> 
<p>The president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies (ECAJ’s state body), David Ossip, labelled the alleged Iranian involvement in the attacks “chilling and deeply concerning”.</p> 
<p>“It is difficult to overstate the significance of this unprecedented news,” Ossip said.</p> 
<p>“These incidents were nothing less than an attack on Australia by a foreign state, primarily targeting the Jewish community and designed to unravel our social cohesion by legitimising and normalising attacks on the Jewish community.”</p> 
<p>Ossip said despite Australia’s Jewish community enduring “a summer of terror”, it had been gaslit by some quarters.</p> 
<p>“Those who sought to downplay the threat against the Jewish community or dismiss the campaign of terror targeting our community as a criminal con-job or hoax owe the Jewish community an apology.”</p> 
<p>He added that the Iranian-Australian community in Australia – “most of whom despise the despotic Iranian regime” – should not be held responsible for Iran’s actions.</p> 
<p>The Australian Iranian Community Alliance said the moment marked a “historic turning point” in Australia’s approach to the Islamic Republic.</p> 
<p>“Let us be clear: this is not a diplomatic disagreement with a sovereign nation. This is a countermeasure against a transnational criminal enterprise that has hijacked a country, plundered its resources, destabilised a region, and targeted innocent lives globally – including here in Australia,” the AICA vice-president, Suren Edgar, said.</p> 
<p>Klein said the Adass community had been well-supported by the Victorian police, including through weekly meetings at which the synagogue’s leaders had repeatedly raised the possibility of Iran’s involvement in the attack.</p> 
<p>“They have managed to piece it together. [The government’s] strong stance is quite significant and we applaud it, we’re very grateful.”</p>
