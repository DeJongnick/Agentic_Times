    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - Five were scored, six were saved and three missed the target. England have had a little bit of luck with penalties at the tournament – and not just in the quarter-finals … , 2:C - Michelle Agyemang and Chloe Kelly both began their careers at Arsenal. They have not played together that often at club level given their various loan spells and Kelly’s move to Everton, but they will be lining up in the same side this coming season. , 3:C - England have a winning record against the world champions., 4:B - Dubois knocked out Anthony Joshua in the fifth round last year; and he was knocked out by Oleksandr Usyk in the fifth round on Saturday night. , 5:D - His trainer, Don Charles, denies that Dubois was affected by the get-together. “It was a gathering, a cultural gathering,” said Charles. “We were still able to do everything with 10 minutes to spare.”, 6:C - He came closest in 2022, when he finished joint-second behind Matt Fitzpatrick. , 7:B - He scored 78 on the first day before putting together rounds of 65, 68 and 64 – a better performance in the final three days than runaway winner Scottie Scheffler. , 8:B - Navratilova was 47 when she beat Catalina Castaño at Wimbledon in 2004., 9:A - Sporting CP signed him two years ago for €20m; they have sold him for €73.5m. , 10:B - Pant has fractured his metatarsal, an injury that will sound very familiar to football fans of a certain age., 11:D - The other three played in Spain, but for Real Madrid. , 12:A - Better late than never. Great Britain were elevated from silver to gold after the USA runner Antonio Pettigrew admitted to doping. The belated award ceremony took place at a Diamond League meeting in London, where the athletes were given a rousing welcome by the 60,000 sellout crowd., 13:C - Dion Kitson, who painted the mural, said it is “Dudley’s answer to the Sistine Chapel”. Allardyce is very pleased with it. “I thought it was a very good likeness," he said. "It's 10ft tall – that’s some piece of work, isn’t it.”, 14:B - There would have been 10 Ireland players in the starting XV had Garry Ringrose not withdrawn with injury., 15:B - The tour is longer than in previous years. In fact, the organisers had to receive special permission to run it over nine days as cycling’s governing body limits women’s stage races to just eight days.</p>
