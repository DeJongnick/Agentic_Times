<p>A creek in Melbourne’s north-east has turned a lurid blue after chemicals used in construction of a major road project washed into the waterway.</p> <p>The Environment Protection Authority began investigating after a community member reported blue discoloration in the waters of Banyule Creek, south of Lower Plenty Road in Rosanna, on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the EPA said.</p> <p>The likely source had been traced to a dust suppressant used in the construction of the Victorian government’s North East Link project (NELP).</p> <p>Banyule Creek runs through an important wildlife corridor, particularly at Creek Bend Reserve, a 5.6ha linear park peppered with river red-gums and native grassy woodlands.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Photos shared on social media by a community group on Wednesday afternoon showed the creek a fluorescent blue.</p>    <p>Banyule city council said in a statement that it shared the community’s concern about the pollution and was working with the EPA and Melbourne Water to understand what caused the incident and manage any consequences of it.</p> <p>“While we discussed the possibility of local council drains being involved, we’ve been advised that our drainage system is not considered a source of the pollution,” the council said.</p> <p>“Our teams will continue to work alongside EPA and Melbourne Water, inspecting downstream areas and monitoring for any ongoing effects. We’re committed to protecting our local environment and supporting the agencies managing this incident.”</p> <p>Clean-up duties for pollution incidents fall to the duty-holder, or the party responsible – in this case, likely a contractor to the road project – in consultation with the EPA.</p> <p>The NELP is part of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/22/cost-overruns-threaten-to-define-jacinta-allans-premiership-as-victorias-big-build-faces-huge-budget-blowouts">Victorian government’s Big Build</a>, involving the construction of more than 6km of freeway tunnels, and estimated to cost more than $26bn.</p> <p>NELP was cleaning up the waterway, the EPA spokesperson said. “EPA will monitor the project which will now assess how to ensure such incidents are not repeated. EPA investigations and assessments of any harm to the environment are continuing.”</p> <p>A spokesperson from Major Road Projects Victoria said the department was aware of the pollution in the creek.</p> <p>“There is no threat to the local community,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>“The site clean-up is under way – however we recommend locals keep away from the creek until reviews have concluded. We will continue to work closely with the Environment Protection Authority to ensure impacts to the local environment are minimised.”</p>
