<p>George Clooney has said he is unconcerned about the persistent verbal abuse levelled at him by Donald Trump, after the president labelled him a “fake movie actor” on Truth Social.</p> <p>Speaking to Gayle King on CBS Mornings, Clooney said: “I don’t care. I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time. My job is not to please the president of the United States. My job is to try and tell the truth when I can and when I have the opportunity. I am well aware of the idea that people will not like that.”</p> <p>He continued: “People will criticise that. Elon Musk has weighed in [about me]. That is their right. It’s my right to say the other side.”</p> <p>Trump’s attacks on Clooney renewed last summer, after the latter’s op-ed piece in the New York Times urging Joe Biden to step down for re-election. The actor wrote that Biden could continue with his work furthering democracy by allowing an alternative, younger Democratic candidate to run, who might stand a greater chance of beating Donald Trump.</p> <p>“So now fake movie actor George Clooney, who never came close to making a great movie, is getting into the act,” posted Trump. “He’s turned on Crooked Joe like the rats they both are.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/apr/22/larry-david-spoofs-bill-maher-white-house-visit-trump">‘I must say, mein Führer, I’m so thankful I came’: Larry David spoofs Bill Maher’s fawning White House visit with Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to CNN’s Jake Tapper last week, Clooney said he felt it was his “civic duty” to champion an alternative nominee.</p> <p>“I don’t know if it was brave,” Clooney said. “It was a civic duty. When I saw people on my side of the street not telling the truth, I thought that was time to.”</p> <p>Reflecting on the backlash to his article, Clooney said: “The idea of freedom of speech is you can’t demand freedom of speech and then say, ‘But don’t say bad things about me.’”</p> <p>He continued: “That’s the deal, you have to take your stand if you believe in it. Take a stand for it and then deal with the consequences.”</p> <p>“I have to take that, that’s fair,” he concluded. “I’m OK with that, I’m OK with criticism for where I stand. I defend their right to criticise me as much as I defend my right to criticise them.”</p> <p>Clooney is currently starring on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/apr/03/good-night-good-luck-review-george-clooney">Broadway in a stage version</a> of his 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck, about the conflict between veteran journalist Edward R Murrow and Senator Joseph McCarthy, who alleged that spies and Soviet sympathisers had infiltrated numerous US institutions, in particular the government, universities and the film and TV industry.</p>
