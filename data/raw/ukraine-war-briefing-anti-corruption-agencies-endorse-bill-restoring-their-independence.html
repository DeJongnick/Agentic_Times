<ul> <li><p>The Ukrainian anti-corruption body, Nabu, said a new bill submitted to parliament on Thursday <strong>“restores all procedural powers and guarantees of independence of the Nabu and Sapo”</strong>. Nabu investigates corruption cases and Sapo prosecutes them. A Nabu statement said both agencies took part in the preparation of the new law and they <strong>urged the parliament “to adopt the president’s initiative … in its entirety as soon as possible. </strong>This will prevent threats to criminal proceedings brought by the Nabu and the Sapo.”</p></li> <li><p>The EU welcomed <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s move to reinstate the independence of the anti-corruption agencies</strong> after the shock adoption this week of a bill that stripped their autonomy. After <strong>protests on the streets and from international allies of Ukraine</strong>, the Ukrainian president said the further bill would ensure the rule of law and the independence of the anti-corruption agencies. An EU spokesperson said: “We provide significant financial support to Ukraine and this is conditional to progress and transparency, judicial reform and democratic governance.” Those points were reinforced by European leaders with whom Zelenskyy consulted over the crisis, including <strong>Ursula von der Leyen, Friedrich Merz of Germany and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/24/the-guardian-view-on-ukraines-protests-zelenskyy-must-heed-critics-at-home-and-abroad">The Guardian view on Ukraine’s protests: Zelenskyy must heed critics at home and abroad | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><p>There were <strong>tensions over the Ukraine war as EU officials met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping</strong>, in Beijing on Thursday. Antonio Costa, the European Council president, said the EU officials discussed “at length” their <strong>expectations for China to discourage Russia</strong> in its war against Ukraine. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, prior to the meeting said China was “enabling Russia’s war economy”. Xi told EU to “properly handle differences and frictions … The current challenges facing Europe do not come from China.”</p></li> <li><p>A <strong>Russian attack killed three family members already displaced by the war</strong>, authorities announced on Thursday. The father, mother and son had fled to the village of Pidlyman in the Kharkiv region of Ukraine after Russian forces invaded their home town. A strike later on Kharkiv city wounded 33 people, including a 10-year-old girl, a 17-year-old boy and girl, the governor said. A separate Russian drone and missile barrage wounded seven people including a child in the central Ukrainian region of Cherkasy, emergency services said.</p></li> <li><p>The US state department on Thursday said it had approved <strong>military sales worth US$330m</strong> to Ukraine comprising $150m worth of maintenance, repair and overhaul capability for M109 self-propelled howitzers, and $180m to sustain air defences. The Pentagon said contractors involved would include BAE Systems, Allison Transmission, Daimler Truck North America, Sierra Nevada Corporation, Radionix and Systems Electronic Export. The US on Wednesday announced sales of $322m related to Hawk surface-to-air missiles and Bradley infantry fighting vehicles.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Reuters are reporting that an Indian company</strong> <strong>shipped $1.4m worth of an explosive used in missile warheads, rocket motors and bombs to Russia</strong> in December 2024 despite the threat of US sanctions, according to Indian customs data seen by the news agency. One Russian company listed as receiving the <strong>compound, known as HMX or </strong><strong>octogen</strong><strong>,</strong> was an explosives manufacturer, which Ukraine’s SBU security service has linked to Moscow’s military. An SBU official said Ukraine launched a drone attack in April against one of the company’s factories. </p></li> <li><p>The US government has <strong>identified HMX/octogen as “critical for Russia’s war effort”</strong>. The US state department did not comment to Reuters on the specific shipments but said it had repeatedly communicated to India that companies doing military-related business with Russia were at risk of sanctions. However, <strong>under Donald Trump, Russia-related sanctions work has slowed to a trickle</strong>. India’s foreign ministry said in a statement: “India has been carrying out exports of dual-use items taking into account its international obligations on non-proliferation,” adding that such exports were subject to “holistic assessment”.</p></li> </ul>
