  <p>The killing of Charlie Kirk is being used to mobilise support before what is expected to be Britain’s largest far-right rally in decades, which will include speakers from Britain, the US and Europe.</p> 
  <p>Steve Bannon, Donald Trump’s former chief strategist, is among those listed to appear on stage at the rally in central London, which is expected to draw tens of thousands for an event that Robinson has been heavily attempting to monetise.</p> 
  <p>Other planned speakers include Ant Middleton, a former UK special forces soldier who has increasingly used far-right rhetoric, as well as an MP for Germany’s far-right AfD party and a far-right Polish MEP.</p> 
  <p>Other Americans making the trip include Joey Mannarino, a self-styled US rightwing commentator who said: “All rape cases have just become fake to me” after a civil case alleging sexual assault by Trump.<br><br>The rally is expected to attract upwards of 40,000 attenders, according to the anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate.

 <h2 class="block-title">Student who pressed Charlie Kirk on mass shootings before he was shot expresses grief on TikTok</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>When <strong>Hunter Kozak</strong>, a mathematics student at Utah Valley University, approached the mic to challenge <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong> on Wednesday, minutes before the fatal shooting of the conservative activist, the words “Prove me wrong” were emblazoned on the tent above the Turning Point USA founder.</p> 
  <p>Kozak was sure that he could do just that, having done quite a lot of research to debunk Kirk’s recent claim that transgender Americans were responsible for a disproportionate amount of mass shootings.</p> 
  <p>As Kozak had explained in a recent video on his TikTok channel, his statistical analysis shows that the opposite is true, and he was in the middle of explaining to Kirk that just five of the 6,000 mass shootings in the past decade have been carried out by transgender people when the gunman opened fire.</p> 
  <p>After the shooting, Kozak said in <a href="https://x.com/staxioms/status/1966205970339737766">an emotional TikTok video</a> that he was overwhelmed with grief and denounced people who might have welcomed the killing of the far-right activist.</p> 
  <p>“First off, you sick, fucking psychos that think this is the answer: it’s not. I don’t know what else to say. It’s fucking not. It’s awful,” Kozak said. “It’s a tragedy.”</p> 
  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/staxioms/status/1966205970339737766"> 
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I was talking to Charlie as he died. I made a video about it here.

  <p>“People have obviously pointed to the irony that, the point that I was trying to make is how peaceful the left was, right before he got shot, and that only makes sense if we stay peaceful,” he added.</p> 
  <p>“I stand by so little of everything that he said, but one of the things that he stood by was, conversation,” Kozak said. “And if you’re salivating about what happened: don’t. I don’t know if any of my audience is, but if you are, you’re not part of what I’m trying to build here, at all.”</p> 
  <p>Kozak’s response was significantly more empathetic than that of a conservative TikToker, who goes by the handle ElderTikTok. That fan of Kirk, who was in line to ask a question, recorded <a href="https://x.com/ratlimit/status/1965945538903421439">a live report</a> from the scene of the shooting, as people fled around him, in which he conveyed the news while simultaneously urging viewers to follow him on the platform. He later deleted that video, and issued an apology in which he pledged to be “a better content creator”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trial of Tyler Robinson in Utah state court will probably be televised – report</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Tyler Robinson</strong>, the 22-year-old Utah resident, suspected fatally shooting killed far-right activist <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong>, is expected to be formally charged with murder next week in a Utah state court.</p> 
  <p>The fact that charges will be brought by the state, and not the federal government, also means the trial is likely to be televised, a legal expert <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/12/charlie-kirk-shooting-charges-00562621">tells Politico</a>.</p> 
  <p>“Utah has one of the best cameras-in-the-courtroom rules in the country,” Jeff Hunt, a media lawyer, said. “There’s a presumption of electronic media coverage in our trial courts.”</p> 
  <p>Since Kirk, for all his importance to the current presidential administration, was not a federal official and was not killed on federal property, there appears to be no reason for federal charges to be filed.</p> 
  <p>Had Kirk’s suspected killer targeted him for his faith or race, federal prosecutors might have had an opening to charge the murder as a hate crime under federal law, but the suspect, like Kirk, is a white man from a Christian family.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'No one will ever forget my husband's name and I will make sure of it', Erika Kirk says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In what Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA described as his widow Erika Kirk’s “address to the nation”, the late conservative activist’s wife pledged to carry out his mission, urged young people to join his organization and called for a revival of Christian faith.</p> 
  <p>She told “the evil-doers responsible for my husband’s assassination”, that “if you thought that my husband’s mission was powerful before, you have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country and this world”.</p> 
  <p>“You have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife. The cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry,” she said. “The movement my husband built will not die.”</p> 
  <p>Kirk’s scheduled campus tour, and a conference scheduled for December, AmericaFest, “will go on” she said, as will his radio and podcast show.</p> 
  <p>“His wisdom will endure,” she said.</p> 
  <p>Kirk also urged young people to join Turning Point USA chapters around the country.</p> 
  <p>“If there isn’t a chapter, if you can’t find one, then start one,” she said.</p> 
  <p>She reiterated what she said was his constant refrain: “If you want to get involved, go to TPUSA.com”</p> 
  <p>Her address was also a plea for young Americans to embrace the Christian faith and join what she called “a Bible-believing church”.</p> 
  <p>“Now and for all eternity he will stand at his savior’s side,” she said of her husband, “wearing the glorious crown of a martyr”.</p> 
  <p>She also quoted what she called one of his favorite Bible verses: “Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for her.”</p> 
  <p>The struggle her husband was committed to, and she intends to continue, she said, was not just political, but “above all it is spiritual”.</p> 
  <p>“Spiritual warfare is palpable,” she said.</p> 
  <p>“I know my husband is still here,” she said “he’s watching over us.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Erika Kirk</strong>, the widow of the conservative activist and commentator <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong>, who was fatally shot on Wednesday, just began her address from a podium next to his desk on the set of his show.</p> 
  <p>Clearly struggling with emotion, and whispering at times, she began by thanking law enforcement and emergency services for their efforts to save her husband.</p> 
  <p>She went on to thank the other leaders at Turning Point USA, the political youth organization her husband created.</p> 
  <p>She then praised <strong>JD Vance</strong>, the vice-president, and his wife, Usha, for bringing his body back to Arizona from Utah on Air Force Two.</p> 
  <p>Addressing <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, she said: “Mr President, my husband loved you and he knew that you loved him too. Your friendship was amazing.”</p> 
  <p>Erika Kirk went on to stress her husband’s Christian faith, noted his faith-driven belief in marriage and said that her husband told her “if he ever ran for office” he intended to make it his top priority “to revive the American family”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Secret Service agent reportedly put on leave over Facebook comment that Charlie Kirk 'spewed hate and racism'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Secret Service, the agency that provides security to the president, the vice-president and visiting foreign officials, has reportedly suspended an agent who posted a critical comment about the conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Facebook.</p> 
  <p>According to <a href="https://x.com/susancrabtree/status/1966217485067366842">a screenshot</a> posted online by a conservative reporter for Real Clear Politics, after Kirk was killed, the agent, Anthony Pough, shared video of Kirk’s infamous comment, in 2023, that a Black congresswoman did not have “the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously” and “had to go steal a white person’s slot to go be taken somewhat seriously”.</p> 
  <p>Above the video, the agent wrote to his Facebook friends that anyone “mourning this guy” should unfollow him on the social network. “He spewed hate and racism on his show.”</p> 
  <p>“At the end of the day, you answer to GOD and speak things into existence,” he added. “You can only circumvent karma, she doesn’t leave.”</p> 
  <p>In response to the Real Clear Politics report, <strong>Marsha Blackburn</strong>, a Republican senator from Tennessee, wrote the director of the Secret Service demanding that the agent be fired for what she called his celebration and attempt to justify Kirk’s assassination.</p> 
  <p>“This employee was immediately put on administrative leave, and an investigation has begun,” the Secret Service said in a statement <a href="https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/charlie-kirk-shot-utah-death-09-12-25#cmfh8aluq00053b6q115y2efd">to CNN</a> and other news outlets on Friday.</p> 
  <p>Susan Crabtree, the reporter who first discovered the agent’s post also shared screenshots of other posts, including <a href="https://x.com/susancrabtree/status/1966250561923387520">one</a> in which the agent called Pete Hegseth’s decision to fire the Black air force general CQ Brown Jr as chair of the joint chiefs of staff “racism.” Three months before Hegseth took office, he had told a podcaster the next defense secretary had to “fire the chairman of the joint chiefs” because any general “that was involved in any of that DEI woke shit has got to go.”</p> 
  <p>Another post from Pough <a href="https://x.com/susancrabtree/status/1966250681028980760">shared by Crabtree</a> mocked Donald Trump for refusing to rule out a recession in 2025.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Pentagon to punish service members who mock Charlie Kirk's death on social media – report</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>, the former Fox weekend anchor serving as <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s defense secretary, has ordered Pentagon officials to scour social media for comments by service members that make light of Charlie Kirk’s death and punish anyone expressing dissident views, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/charlie-kirk-shooter-manhunt-live-updates-rcna230762/rcrd88299?canonicalCard=true">NBC News reports</a>.</p> 
  <p>Several service members have been relieved of their jobs already, Pentagon officials told the broadcaster.</p> 
  <p>The purge comes after <a href="https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1966274615975739604">Hegseth</a>, <a href="https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/1966255540012724522">his spokesperson</a> and the secretaries of the <a href="https://x.com/SecArmy/status/1966299714195959907">army</a>, <a href="https://x.com/SECNAV/status/1966330151127351715">navy</a> and <a href="https://x.com/SecAFOfficial/status/1966313089709871272">air force</a> all warned service members to express only the correct political opinions about Kirk and his killing.</p> 
  <p>The officials warned service members, and civilian employees of the Pentagon that “inappropriate comments” including “posts displaying contempt toward” Kirk, or comments that “celebrate or mock the assassination” would be “dealt with swiftly and decisively”.</p> 
  <p>The effort to root out dissidents in the ranks comes as online activists promised to get Kirk’s critics fired in a range of fields, including the military and academia.</p>

  <p><strong>Roy Corey</strong>, retired and in his 70s, was watering his marigolds on Friday morning in a neighborhood not far from the family home of <strong>Tyler Robinson</strong>, who was arrested in connection with the killing of <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong>, the conservative activist and influencer.</p> 
  <p>Corey moved to Utah and feels at home there because his wife and him are “patriots and Christians”. He has no relation to the Robinsons, but has been fielding visits all day – from local law enforcement, reporters and two people who said they were with a collections agency – because he lives in a house formerly owned by a Robinson relative.</p> 
  <p>Corey seemed amused by the coincidence, but saddened by Kirk’s death. He sees it as part of a broader pattern.</p> 
  <p>“Regardless of if Charlie got shot or not, it’s increasing,” Corey said.</p>

  <p><strong>Miles Meloni, 14, lives in the same neighborhood as the Robinsons. Meloni followed Kirk, and feels “great sorrow” for the Robinson and Kirk families.</strong></p> 
  <p>Meloni is alarmed by political violence in the country he is coming of age in.</p> 
  <p>“I want to see a change,” Meloni said. “I think for people like this, if the family sees any progression towards this view, that they need to hurt people, that they need to have their child, family member, friends, anybody, seek help.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Discord says they have 'no evidence' that lead suspect used messaging app to plan Kirk shooting</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Earlier today, Utah governor Spencer Cox said that investigators found several messages they believe <strong>Tyler Robinson</strong> sent via <strong>Discord</strong> –&nbsp;the messaging app frequently used by gamers – about the shooting at Utah Valley University, where Charlie Kirk was fatally shot. </p> 
  <p>Officials said that Robinson’s roommate showed them the messages. </p> 
  <p>Cox said that the contact, named ‘Tyler’ discussed the following details on the app: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>A need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Leaving the rifle in a bush. </p></li> 
   <li><p>Messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left.</p></li> 
   <li><p>A message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel. </p></li> 
   <li><p>A message that referred to engraving bullets, and a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Messages from Robinson which also mentioned that he had changed outfits. </p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>A Discord spokesperson told the Guardian that throughout the course of their own investigation they found an account associated with the suspect. However, they <strong>“have found no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord”</strong>. </p> 
  <p>The spokesperson added that: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The messages referenced in recent reporting about planning details do not appear to be Discord messages. <strong>These were communications between the suspect’s roommate and a friend after the shooting,</strong> where the roommate was recounting the contents of a note the suspect had left elsewhere. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Discord said they have removed the suspect’s account and “will continue to coordinate closely with law enforcement”, expressing sympathy to the Kirk family and all those affected. </p>

  <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/suspect-charlie-kirk-shooting">lead suspect</a> in Charlie Kirk’s killing, <strong>has a family residence in Washington, Utah, according public records</strong> - a small city located not far from the Arizona border and about 260 miles from where Kirk was killed in Orem.</p> 
  <p><strong>Walter Williams</strong>, a neighbor who has lived in the same neighborhood as the family for four years, expressed surprise when he heard the news.</p> 
  <p><strong>“I honestly didn’t know he lived here,”</strong> said Williams, 33, in an interview from the suburban streets of Washington. <strong>He called the neighborhood a “safe place”. </strong></p> 
  <p><strong>“Everybody knows each other, and takes care of each other,” </strong>he said. </p> 
  <p>Reflecting on America’s political division, Williams said that as a member of the Mormon church, he liked a lot of what Kirk said, but that he also respected everyone’s right to their own views.</p> 
  <p><strong>“I know everybody has their own opinions, that’s totally fine. That’s what the US is about,”</strong> Williams said. <strong>“Having different opinions and not forcing that on each other, not taking it out on each other.

 <h2 class="block-title">As we learn more about the suspect accused of killing Charlie Kirk, here's a recap of the day so far</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>After nearly two days of searching, authorities announced today <strong>that they have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting and killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk</strong>, at a speaking event at Utah Valley University (UVU) on Wednesday. <strong>Tyler Robinson, 22,</strong> is now in custody at Utah County Jail. </p></li> 
   <li><p>According to surveillance footage, authorities say that Robinson was seen arriving at the UVU campus on Wednesday in a Dodge Challenger. </p></li> 
   <li><p>FBI director Kash Patel said that <strong>Robinson was ultimately arrested in Washington County</strong> – which sits in the southwest corner of the state – <strong>at around 10pm local time on Thursday 11 September</strong>. </p></li> 
   <li><p>At a press conference earlier, governor Spencer Cox said that <strong>Robinson’s family friend turned him in, </strong>and told officers that Robinson <strong>“confessed to them or implied that he had committed the incident”. </strong>Cox also said that a family member that investigators interviewed described Robinson as becoming “more political in recent years” and was aware that Kirk was due to speak at UVU. </p></li> 
   <li><p>The weapon used was identified as a high-action bolt rifle, and Cox noted that several bullet casings were found at the scene of the crime. One of three unfired casings read <strong>“Hey fascist! Catch!”</strong>, a second read <strong>“Oh Bella Ciao”</strong> (which is the name of an anti-fascist Italian anthem), and a third casing had the following engraved: <strong>“If you read this, you are gay, LMAO”</strong>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Robinson has not been formally charged yet.</strong> Officials today said they have three days to prepare those documents, which will likely be filed early next week. According to court records obtained by CNN, Robinson is being held without bail on several initial charges, including <strong>aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice</strong>. </p></li> 
   <li><p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/utah">Utah</a> Valley University spokesperson confirmed today that Robinson <strong>is a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College</strong>. He also briefly attended Utah State University. </p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> was the first to break the news of the investigation’s development. He announced <strong>“with a high degree of certainty”</strong> that law enforcement had arrested a suspect in an interview with Fox News earlier today. </p></li>

  <p><em>For today’s instalment of our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/first-edition">First Edition newsletter</a>, my colleague <strong>Aamna Mohdin</strong> asks what the killing of Charlie Kirk means for a polarised US amid a climate of rising political violence. (Sign up for First Edition <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-first-edition-newsletter-our-free-news-email">here</a>!)</em></p> 
  <p>For some, Charlie Kirk’s killing marks <strong>a watershed moment in the politics of the US</strong>, a country long defined by deep polarisation and periodic outbreaks of violence. Not so for Cas Mudde, a Dutch political scientist and leading expert on populism and the far right who is based at the University of Georgia.</p> 
  <p>“This is an incredibly violent country. Yesterday, there was a separate <strong>mass shooting</strong> in a school where two students were critically injured,” Mudde said, pointing out that <strong>more than 300 incidents have been recorded so far this year</strong>. “Just remember that Trump was almost killed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/15/trump-safe-gunshots-golf-course">when he was a candidate</a> and it didn’t change anything.”</p> 
  <p>That of course might be different now – he’s far more equipped to make changes related to this shooting now he’s president than he was when he was running for office.</p> 
  <p>But Mudde believes <strong>the current climate around gun violence in the US means that real change might still be hard to come by</strong>. He compares the US to where he grew up, the Netherlands. In the latter, the rightwing politician Pim Fortuyn, who led his anti-immigration party to a position of prominence in the Netherlands, was assassinated in 2002.</p> 
  <p>“The assassination of Fortuyn transformed the Netherlands in many ways. It helped normalise the far right, made Fortuyn a martyr, and created an anti-left backlash,” Mudde said. “I don’t think that you will see the same effect here because <strong>it is just not so remarkable, sadly, that a prominent person is being assassinated</strong>.”</p> 
  <p>To his point, Reuters released an<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-cases-political-violence-roil-us-ahead-contentious-election-2024-10-21/"> investigation</a> in late 2024 identifying <strong>more than 300 cases of political violence in the US since the January 6 insurrection</strong> – the biggest increase in such threats since the 1970s – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/04/attacks-political-violence">only now more bloody</a>, <strong>targeting people</strong> rather than bricks and mortar. But little has changed by way of policy since then.</p> 
  <p>Will Kirk’s death change this? Mudde argued that <strong>the Trump administration will continue their unprecedented attack on democratic institutions and norms in the US</strong> (and would have done so had Kirk been killed or not). But just how far the administration is able to go remains unclear.</p> 
  <p>Many of the Trump administration’s most far-reaching orders have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/05/donald-trump-legal-woes-mount-supreme-court-rule-trade-tariffs">halted by the lower level courts</a>, but some have been pushed through by the rightwing supreme court. “We’re living in this weird period where there is still a functioning, if imperfect, democracy, but with an authoritarian leader,” Mudde said.</p> 
  <p>What is clear is that the struggle over America’s democratic future is far from over.</p>

  <p>A key figure in Donald Trump’s success, Kirk galvanized college-aged conservatives who moved in a different ecosystem from traditional media. <strong>The decade or so between Kirk’s beginnings as a teen activist and the shooting saw the rise of Maga politics alongside the shake-up of the conventional media landscape, with Kirk playing a crucial role in both.</strong></p> 
  <p>Adam Pennings, 25, is the executive director of Run Gen Z, a non-profit that supports young Republican candidates. “He’s always just been such an important part” of the young conservative party, Pennings said of Kirk. <strong>“He was everywhere.”</strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Opinion: Charlie Kirk’s shocking killing sets the stage for a dangerous federal crackdown</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>I disagreed with Charlie Kirk on pretty much everything, but his shocking and morally repugnant assassination is deeply concerning, and not just because it’s another example of the lethality of our politics. Kirk’s killing is also sending prominent conservatives on a warpath, setting the stage for a dangerous expansion of federal government repression.</p> 
  <p>Kirk was a social media megastar and the founder of Turning Point USA, the foremost rightwing youth organization in the country. His political positions were to the far-right, and his language was often combative, to say the least. He <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-tpusa-mlk-civil-rights-act/">called</a> Martin Luther King, Jr “awful” and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/charlie-kirk-tpusa-mlk-civil-rights-act/">said</a> “we made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s”. He believed in the so-called great replacement theory, which asserts that elites are encouraging mass migration to undermine white people in western countries. “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America,” he <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1965281328108343507">wrote</a> on X the day before he was killed. He also <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-blames-jewish-dollars-funding-cultural-marxist-ideas">blamed</a> “Jewish dollars” for funding “cultural Marxist ideas and supporters.”</p> 
  <p>Kirk said being “<a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1908231742642938386">trans is a mental delusion</a>”. He portrayed himself as a free speech champion while also running a “<a href="http://professorwatchlist.org/">Professor Watchlist</a>” against liberal professors. “Having an armed citizenry comes with a price,” he <a href="https://x.com/JasonSCampbell/status/1643977032509067272">said</a>, explaining his opposition to gun control. “I think it’s worth … [the] cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so we can have the second amendment.” And he also <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/charlie-kirk-bail-out-alleged-paul-pelosi-attacker-1234621493/">suggested</a> a “patriot” should pay the bail of the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/david-depape-man-attacked-paul-pelosi-hammer-sentenced-30-years-prison-rcna152614">rightwing conspiracy theorist</a> who attacked Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, with a hammer, fracturing his skull.</p> 
  <p>So, yeah. I find a lot of what Kirk peddled to be reprehensible, but he should still be alive to say it. Obviously, no one should be killed for their views. In an open society, people like Kirk should be able to say what they want, just as I should have the right to say what I want. And that includes the right to criticize.</p>

  <p><strong>A UK offshoot of Turning Point USA has said it has received death threats following the death of Charlie Kirk.</strong></p> 
  <p>Jack Ross, the chief executive of Turning Point UK, told the BBC: “We are certainly worried in the UK, we’ve had death threats from people. We’ve had people suggesting that we should be targeted in the UK as sort of the British Charlie Kirks, and that’s quite depressing,” he said.</p> 
  <p>“We’ve had people say online and highlight: ‘Oh, by the way, there’s UK Turning Point, maybe somebody should go after them’. We’ve had people send us horrific abuse. We’ve had horrific images of Charlie sent to us with laughing emojis. And it’s really heartbreaking. The internet isn’t the real world, but it’s certainly concerning that these people are out there and hold these extremist views.”</p> 
  <p>He added: “It’s really sad to see all the abuse … and certainly from our point of view, say this has happened to a prominent left-wing activist, we wouldn’t be out cheering, we’d be offering our condolences and support.”</p> 
  <p>Kirk co-founded and was the chief executive of the youth right-wing organisation Turning Point USA.</p> 
  <p>Ross said of Kirk’s killing: “We’re shocked … horrified really. We’re heartbroken.”</p> 
  <p>He added: “We are rattled, and it’s so wrong that he was killed whilst reaching out to people. He genuinely believed in reaching across the political divide. He didn’t believe in violence.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Virulent debater and clickbait savant: how Charlie Kirk pushed a new generation to the right</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>After clinching the title of top conservative podcast in America (and second overall news podcast, according to Apple’s ranking) in March, Charlie Kirk <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250327039914/en/Charlie-Kirk-Surges-to-1-Salem-Media-and-the-Next-Generation-of-Conservative-Media-Dominate-the-Charts">said</a>: “We’re not just talking. We’re activating a revolution.”</p> 
  <p>In the hours after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">his killing</a> at age 31 on the first stop of a buzzy college campus tour, the rightwing activist’s words echoed through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/who-is-charlie-kirk-profile">young conservative circles</a>. Social media eulogies rolled in, with users reposting clips of Kirk with his wife and children. Parents of teens <a href="https://x.com/JahonJamali/status/1965979711017795675">wrote</a> on X of learning about Kirk’s death through their children. “My 17 year old is bumming.

Another X user <a href="https://x.com/james_jinnette1/status/1965921039021486207">wrote</a> about speaking to teens at a church youth group: “Everyone I talked to is so distraught and heartbroken at his passing.”</p> 
  <p>A key figure in Donald Trump’s success, Kirk galvanized college-aged conservatives who moved in a different ecosystem from traditional media. The decade or so between Kirk’s beginnings as a teen activist and the shooting saw the rise of Maga politics alongside the shake-up of the conventional media landscape, with Kirk playing a crucial role in both.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">The Guardian view on the killing of Charlie Kirk: a perilous moment that may lead to more</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Democracy is the way that we have diverse societies that don’t kill each other, largely,” Lilliana Mason, a leading scholar of partisanship, <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=vIQiVQ21VN0">observed recently</a>. She added: “As soon as we stop believing in it, it disappears.” Dr Mason’s own research suggests that there is sharply rising tolerance of political violence. On Wednesday, it claimed one more victim.</p> 
  <p>The shocking killing of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">co-founder of Turning Point USA Charlie Kirk</a>, a hugely influential activist who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/who-is-charlie-kirk-profile">rallied young people</a> to Donald Trump’s cause and far-right ideology more broadly, has been widely and rightly condemned across the political spectrum. Leading Democrats and progressive activists made clear that such violence must not be tolerated.</p> 
  <p>Before a perpetrator had even been identified, the president, like several other Republicans, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/sep/10/trump-blames-radical-left-political-violence-for-killing-of-charlie-kirk-video">blamed</a> “radical left political violence”, claiming that liberal rhetoric against conservatives was “directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country”. Mr Trump himself faced two attempts on his life last year. He cited other victims, but not the many Democrats who have been targeted, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/melissa-hortman-remembered">Melissa Hortman</a>, the Minnesota state representative shot dead at her home alongside her husband, Mark, in June. Meanwhile, some far-right commentators spoke of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-death-trump-reaction">vengeance</a>.</p> 
  <p>Political violence is hardly a new phenomenon in a country that has seen a civil war, four presidential assassinations, and lynchings. But it is rising again. Ordinary Americans <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-rise-of-political-violence-in-the-united-states/">are being radicalised</a>. In such an environment, one thing unites the political poles; any prominent figure is vulnerable, though women and people of colour are <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/06/23/lillana-mason-political-violence-qa/">particularly targeted</a>. Threats to members of Congress <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/03/threats-members-congress-capitol-police-2024">rocketed last year</a>.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">A quiet Utah town reckons with Charlie Kirk’s shooting: ‘Nothing like this has happened here’</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Orem, Utah, a sleepy suburb of roughly 100,000 people at the feet of the Wasatch mountains, never asked for the national spotlight, </strong><em>writes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/cy-neff">Cy Neff</a>.</em></p> 
  <p>But in the wake of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">killing of far-right activist Charlie Kirk</a> in front of a packed audience at a university in the heart of town, the weight of the nation’s gaze was inescapable. A forest of American flags planted atop a highway interpass next to Utah Valley University (UVU), where Kirk was shot. A campus on lockdown and makeshift memorials. The ubiquitous presence of local cops and FBI agents.</p> 
  <p>With the shock of Kirk’s death fresh and a manhunt for the shooter still under way, many in the community are coming to terms with the magnitude of what happened here, and are split on the legacy Kirk leaves behind.</p> 
  <p>“I’m sad and just shocked. Nothing like this has ever happened in Utah, to this extent,” said Brice Nokes, 27. On Thursday, Nokes was standing at the UVU campus entrance holding a sign that said “I believe in you” in bold capital letters. He took it to the university’s entrance today, hoping to help spread positivity in the wake of the killing.</p> 
  <p>Tanner Lundquist, 31, and a former UVU student who came back to campus on Thursday, said that his community was “not meant to be on the world stage”.</p> 
  <p>“For me it’s very disturbing to see a courtyard where I used to do homework on CNN, on Fox News,” Lundquist said.</p>

  <p>If it was current and controversial in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics">US politics</a>, chances are that Kirk was talking about it. On his podcasts, and on the podcasts of friends and adversaries, and especially on college campuses, where he would go to debate students, Kirk spent much of his adult life defending and articulating a worldview aligned with Trump and the Maga movement. Accountable to no one but his audience, he did not shy away in his rhetoric from<strong> </strong>bigotry, intolerance, exclusion and stereotyping.</p> 
  <p>Here’s Kirk, in his own words. Many of his comments were documented by Media Matters for America, a progressive non-profit that tracks conservative media.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Oxford Union condemns president-elect’s reported comments on Charlie Kirk shooting</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Oxford Union has “unequivocally” condemned comments apparently made by its president-elect about the fatal shooting of the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk in the US.</strong></p> 
  <p>Kirk, 31, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-maps-videos-images">killed at a Utah Valley University show</a> on Wednesday in what authorities have called a political assassination.</p> 
  <p>George Abaraonye, who became president-elect of the debating society after a vote in June, posted comments in a WhatsApp group after his death, according to the Daily Telegraph.</p> 
  <p>One message was reported to have said “Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s fucking go”, while another thought to have been posted on Abaraonye’s Instagram account read “Charlie Kirk got shot loool”.</p> 
  <p>In a statement on Thursday, the Oxford Union criticised the student’s comments and said it “firmly opposes all forms of political violence and strongly stands by our commitment to free speech and considerate debate”.</p> 
  <p>“The Oxford Union would like to unequivocally condemn the reported words and sentiments expressed by its president-elect, George Abaraonye, with regards to the passing of Charlie Kirk,” the society wrote on X. “His reported views do not represent the Oxford Union’s current leadership or committee’s view.</p>

Vance’s wife, Usha, stepped off the plane with Kirk’s widow, Erika.</p> 
  <p>Vance helped carry Kirk’s casket with a group of uniformed service members as it was loaded on to the plane. Kirk’s conservative youth organisation, Turning Point USA, was based in Phoenix.</p> 
  <p>“So much of the success we’ve had in this administration traces directly to Charlie’s ability to organize and convene,” Vance wrote on social media, referencing Kirk’s role in getting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> elected last year. “He didn’t just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.”</p> 
  <p>Trump, who said he would award the Medal of Freedom posthumously to Kirk, spoke to Kirk’s wife on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>He said that authorities were making “big progress” towards tracking down the suspect and that in regards to a motive, he has an “indication … but we’ll let you know about that later”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">New video of Kirk suspect released</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>US officials have issued an urgent appeal for help from the public as they continue to search for the shooter of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, releasing new videos and photos from the scene of the attack in Utah.</p> 
  <p>More than 24 hours after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah">Kirk was shot while speaking</a> in front of thousands of people at a Utah university, the state’s governor, appearing alongside FBI director Kash Patel and other officials, said “we need as much help as we can possibly get.”</p> 
  <p>“We cannot do our job without the public’s help,” Utah’s governor, Spencer Cox said, adding that the FBI had received more than 7,000 leads and tips so far.</p>

  <p>The newly released video showed a person wearing a hat, sunglasses and a long sleeve black shirt running across a roof, climbing off the edge of the building and dropping to the ground. The suspect is believed to have fled into the local neighbourhood after firing the one shot and has not yet been identified.</p> 
  <p>Investigators said they had obtained clues, including a palm print, a shoe impression and a high-powered hunting rifle found in a wooded area along the path the shooter fled. But they were yet to name a suspect or cite a motive in the killing.</p> 
  <p>The direct appeals for public support at the night-time news conference, appeared to signal law enforcement’s continued struggles to identify the shooter and pinpoint the person’s whereabouts. Authorities didn’t take questions, and Patel did not speak at the news conference. The FBI is offering up to <a href="https://x.com/FBI/status/1966181099542843838">$100,000</a> for information leading to the identification and arrest of the person.</p> 
  <p>The death of Kirk – a close ally of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-trump">President Donald Trump</a> – has drawn renewed attention to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shooting-political-violence">escalating threat of political violence</a> in the United States which, in the last several years, has cut across the ideological spectrum. The assassination drew bipartisan condemnation from political leaders.</p> 
  <p>In appealing for information, Cox said on Thursday, “there is a tremendous amount of disinformation” online.</p> 
  <p>“Our adversaries want violence,” Cox said. “We have bots from Russia, China, all over the world that are trying to instil disinformation and encourage violence. I would encourage you to ignore those, to turn off those streams.”</p> 
  <p>Cox also pledged to find the killer and pursue the death penalty.</p>
