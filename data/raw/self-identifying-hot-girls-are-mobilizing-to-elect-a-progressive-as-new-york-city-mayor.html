<p>“Hot girls” may not be a pollster-approved voting bloc in the way that young men or the college-educated are, but since the 2020 election the demographic has held a particular status – at least for the very online.</p> <p>It started in 2020, when the model Emily Ratajkowski officially endorsed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/berniesanders">Bernie Sanders</a>’s pre-pandemic presidential campaign. Inspired by Ratajkowski, self-professed hot girls piled on their endorsements, posting selfies with the hashtag #HotGirlsForBernie. Some saw it as a way to counter the persistent <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/9/21168312/bernie-bros-bernie-sanders-chapo-trap-house-dirtbag-left">“Bernie bro” narrative</a>, a rebuke of the idea that Sanders’s fandom consisted solely of obnoxious, socialist-in-name-only men who lived their lives on Twitter. </p> <p>Five years later, “Hot Girls for Bernie” is a relic, one of the last gasps of hope young progressives felt before the reality of Trump 2.0 took hold. Nevertheless the phrase has returned, this time in support of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/who-is-zohran-mamdani-new-york-mayor-candidate">Zohran Mamdani</a>, the 33-year-old democratic socialist and state assemblyman from Queens who is running for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York City</a> mayor. This week, a social media account called “Hot Girls 4 Zohran” dropped on X and Instagram to give away free Mamdani swag.</p>    <p>Though the account is unaffiliated with the Mamdani’s official campaign (and Mamdani’s representative declined to comment), it speaks to the grassroots enthusiasm fueling the millennial’s run for office.</p> <p>Mamdani does not have the widespread name recognition of contenders such as the current mayor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-adams">Eric Adams</a>, who is running as an independent after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/eric-adams-corruption-case-dismissed">series of scandals</a>,<strong> </strong>or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/andrew-cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a>, who resigned as governor of New York in 2021 after facing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/andrew-cuomo-mayor-new-york-city">multiple sexual harassment accusations</a>, which he denied. But Mamdani’s campaign has tapped a hyper-progressive wellspring by putting forth policies that sound ripe for a Fox News scare segment. They include increasing the city’s minimum wage from $16.50 to $30, opening city-owned grocery stores, and making childcare and bus fares free.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>It’s empowering for women, and it brings us together. There’s an intersectionality to it</p> <footer> <cite>Cait</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mamdani, a failed rapper and son of the indie filmmaker Mira Nair, is most at home on social media, especially TikTok. He exudes a kind of nerdy-cool vibe, which has earned him a <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/zohran-mamdani-interview">GQ profile </a>and a <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/18-new-yorkers-put-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani-to-the-test">spread</a> in Interview Magazine, where he fielded questions from New York luminaries such as Chloë Sevigny, Cynthia Nixon, Eileen Myles and Julio Torres. Last month, more than 18,000 citywide donors helped his campaign <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2025/03/24/zohran-mamdani-maxes-out-fundraising-for-mayoral-primary">secure $8m</a>, hitting the fundraising limit set by the city.</p> <p>Hot Girls 4 Zohran is run by two friends, Cait, 24, and Kaif, 28, who live in Brooklyn and did not want their last names published due to privacy concerns. Cait, who is very active on X, says she has been harassed by users who don’t agree with her political opinions. But she’s fine with her face being out there – she posed for the account next to a box of Hot Girls 4 Zohran T-shirts.</p> <p>Cait and Kaif say they are supporting Mamdani because he wants to make the city more affordable for the working class and courts individual donors over the super-rich. “We’re both fairly skeptical of institutional politicians, especially given the last election,” said Cait, who works in marketing. “We really just want to get his name out there.”</p> <p>And hot girls help. Not in an ogling way, but as a tongue-in-cheek way for voters to self-identify and convince others to do so too. “It’s empowering for women, and it brings us together,” Cait said. “There’s an intersectionality to it.” Kaif says that they use the “girl” descriptor liberally – it’s more of a mindset than a gender classification. “So many men have also reached out to us asking for T-shirts,” he said.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/HotGirls4Bernie/status/1233554573094199296">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ahh look at all those &quot;&quot;&quot;BernieBros&quot;&quot;&quot;...

In 2020, after seeing playful memes about Ratajkowski’s support for Sanders, the then student at DePaul University in Chicago made a group chat for “hot girl” Bernie supporters. Katovich <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/24/21080573/hot-girls-for-bernie-sanders-emily-ratajkowski">told Vox</a> that 50 friends joined the group, which dropped a social media campaign featuring equally sexy and silly selfies.</p> <p>“I’m surprised people are still doing this,” said Katovich, who is now 25 and working for a feminist non-profit aimed at ending US warfare and imperialism. “Back then, journalists asked me: ‘What does Hot Girls for Bernie mean to you?’ I was 20 – it didn’t mean anything to me, since it started as a joke.”</p> <p>Katovich remembers people criticizing the “hot girls” label for being glib or exclusionary, but she insists it was inclusive. “Anyone could post a picture, non-binary people were included,” she said. “Sure, there were some dudes who would comment on a picture and say, ‘You’re actually more of a seven,’ but at the time, it didn’t feel like anyone who mattered really cared what you looked like at all.”</p>    <p>Kari Winter, a professor in the global gender and sexuality studies department at the University at Buffalo, agreed that “hot girls” can mean whatever posters want. “Although I personally would not use the term ‘hot’ or ‘girl’ as a trend, I like the way young women, LGBT, non-binary and disabled people use it to claim their own multi-faceted existence in the world,” she said. “It reminds me of a time when a lot of us had bumper stickers and T-shirts that said, ‘This is what a feminist looks like,’ and the point was to be inclusive, because feminists look like everything and anything.”</p> <p>A recent AARP New York and Siena College <a href="https://www.amny.com/news/nyc-mayors-race-cuomo-lead-mamdani-second-poll/">poll</a> shows that Cuomo holds a strong lead of 34% in the Democratic primary pack, thanks to older voters. Mamdani follows at 16%, and 20% of Democratic voters say they are undecided among the nine total candidates. The June primary is <a href="https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/politics/2025/02/24/nyc-june-primary-what-you-need-to-know-before-you-vote-2025">ranked-choice voting</a>, a confusing system that has New Yorkers listing candidates in order of preference. The winner will probably face off against Adams and a Republican in November.</p> <p>Despite Cuomo’s early lead, Winter says that Mamdani’s intense focus on courting working-class voters can serve as a lesson to Democrats. “Democrats need to understand that the way to energize people is not to keep trying to play to some mythical middle, but to galvanize people who are so sick of corruption and the pandering to wealth,” she said. “The only way forward is to galvanize people who care about common people and the common good.”</p>    <p>The Democratic national convention might not recognize a hot girl delegation, but Bernie evangelists say the movement wasn’t all frivolous.<strong> </strong>Hadiya Afzal, a former DePaul University student who was active in the Sanders group chat, says that many of her friends went on to work in progressive politics and still dedicate much of their time to the causes they care about.</p> <p>“I think that’s what folks should take away from this kind of campaign: at the end of the day, it’s about the policies,” Afzal said. “There would have been no Hot Girls for Bernie without an actual policy platform. That’s the backbone of what made it meaningful.”</p> <p>Over at Hot Girls 4 Zohran, Cait and Kaif want people do more with the T-shirts than pose in them for social media. “If you wear the shirt out and about, then it spreads the word, and we really want to mobilize voters of all ages,” Kaif said. Ultimately, he and Cait hope the moniker will aid the candidate in his <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/news/zohran-kwame-mamdani">goal</a> of building “the single largest volunteer operation” of any New York mayoral race ever. With a <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-mayoral-race-cuomo-gets-no-public-campaign-funds-zohran-mamdani-takes-home-4m">force</a> of 10,000 door knockers, Mamdani is well on his way.</p> <p>One of those volunteers is Joshua Leirer, a 37-year-old who lives in Ridgewood, Queens. When Leirer canvassed in one of Brooklyn’s parks in March, there were so many volunteers that they had to spread into the “outskirts”. And, crucially, “the volunteers are hot.”</p> <p>“The people I talked to were really cool and friendly,” Leirer said. “A lot of glasses, a lot of beanies. I would call it a Brooklyn hot.”</p>
