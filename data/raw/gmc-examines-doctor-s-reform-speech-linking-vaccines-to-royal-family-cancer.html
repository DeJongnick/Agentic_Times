<p>The General Medical Council is examining comments by a controversial doctor who used a speech at Reform UK’s conference to link Covid vaccines to cancer in the royal family, amid mounting condemnation of him by senior medics.</p> <p>The regulator, which is charged with upholding professional standards in UK medicine, is also progressing with an investigation into Aseem Malhotra, currently an adviser to Donald Trump’s health secretary, Robert F Kennedy, over a previous claim. It may consider whether to stop or limit his ability to work as a doctor in the UK in the interests of protecting the public.</p> <p>There have been warnings from medical bodies that his “pseudo-science” remarks could undermine trust in doctors.</p> <p>Keir Starmer used prime minister’s questions on Wednesday to hit out at Reform UK and Malhotra, saying: “The man who wrote Reform’s health policy has made shocking and baseless claims that vaccines are linked to cancer and that has been endorsed by Reform.</p> <p>“These dangerous conspiracies cost lives and it shows that Reform can’t be trusted with our NHS.”</p> <p>After being given a prime speaking slot at Reform UK’s conference, Malhotra set out what he said were findings showing that vaccines “created havoc” in the human body.</p> <p>He added that a doctor whom he described as one of Britain’s most eminent oncologists had asked him to share something, adding: “He thinks it’s highly likely that the Covid vaccines have been a factor, a significant factor in the cancer of members of the royal family.”</p> <p>Reform UK has sought to distance the party from the comments made by Malhotra, a British cardiologist who continues to practise in the UK and whose work includes being part of the team involved in a London “bio-hacking” firm offering “longevity solutions”.</p> <p>Malhotra accused Starmer of making “false statements” and said he was fully behind the role of “traditional” vaccines. In relation to Reform UK’s health policy, he said he had had conversations with David Bull, currently the party chair.</p> <p>Bull introduced Malhotra on Saturday as someone who “worked with me to write Reform UK’s health policy”.</p> <p>Malhotra told the Guardian on Wednesday: “There are plenty of political figures who support my position. I also have doctors who thank me for what I am doing.”</p> <p>Dr Jeanette Dickson, the chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, which represents doctors professionally, welcomed the GMC’s decision to examine his remarks.</p> <p>“I am not surprised the GMC is reviewing Dr Malhotra’s comments. Two years ago Dr Malhotra was claiming the Covid mRNA vaccine was responsible for excess heart disease. Last weekend he implied a link between the king’s cancer and the same vaccine.</p> <p>“Both propositions have been roundly condemned by experts. We all know this is how conspiracy theories begin, with anti-vaccine theories being particularly pernicious because they can and do save lives.”</p> <p>Malhotra’s action risked jeopardising the public’s widespread and longstanding trust in doctors, Dickson added. “People trust doctors because they practise evidence-based medicine. We cannot afford to diminish that concept with simple-sounding populism in search of a round of applause.”</p> <p>The British Medical Association also criticised Malhotra’s remarks. “It is dangerous and irresponsible to promote pseudo-science or anti-science messages, and give platforms to those who do,” said Dr Tom Dolphin, the BMA’s chair.</p> <p>“On the one hand, remarks like this from a doctor on such a prominent platform risk individual and public health if people take them seriously and avoid vaccines.</p> <p>“On the other, the more outlandish such claims get, the more likely we see reputation and trust in the medical profession undermined.”</p> <p>The GMC investigation relates to a complaint made by a leading doctor that Malhotra had been spreading allegedly “harmful misinformation” about Covid vaccines. The GMC <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj.q433">admitted last year</a> it had made a mistake not to look into concerns raised about him.</p> <p>However, the GMC, which maintains the official register of all the UK’s medical practitioners, also told the Guardian that it was “aware” of Malhotra’s comments at last weekend’s Reform conference and was considering if it needed to take action.</p>
