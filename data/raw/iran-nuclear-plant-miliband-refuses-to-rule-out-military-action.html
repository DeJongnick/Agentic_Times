<p>David Miliband today refused to rule out the prospect of military action against Iran over its nuclear ambitions but insisted the international focus was on a diplomatic solution after Tehran's admission it is building a second uranium enrichment plant.</p> <p>The foreign secretary's comments were followed tonight by remarks from Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Akbar Salehi, who said inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) would be allowed into the plant situated near the holy city of Qom, which he insisted had not been secret.</p> <p>Ali Akbar Salehi told Iranian television: "Inspection will be within the framework of the regulations ... we have no problem with inspection. We will work out this issue with the agency and will announce the date of the inspection later after reaching an agreement with IAEA."</p> <p>The US president, Barack Obama, the UK prime minister, Gordon Brown, and the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy accused Iran yesterday of constructing a secret underground uranium enrichment facility and of hiding its existence from international inspectors for years, although Obama said western intelligence had known of it for more than two years.</p> <p>The disclosures have paved the way for a showdown on Thursday in Geneva, where Iranian officials are due to meet representatives of six major powers, the E3+3 group. Failure to reach a resolution there would usher in a wave of wide-ranging economic sanctions.</p> <p>An aide to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the newly disclosed uranium enrichment plant buried deep inside a mountain in the arid centre of Iran would soon become operational.</p> <p>But Salehi said: "Under [non-proliferation] rules, we are required to inform the IAEA of the existence of such a facility 180&nbsp;days before introducing materials but we are announcing it more than a year earlier. Still, we see there is controversy. We are astonished," he said.</p> <p>Iran says the new facility won't be operational for 18 months so Iran has not violated any IAEA requirements.</p> <p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, had told journalists in New York yesterday had remained defiant on his country's nuclear ambitions, claiming the plant was legal and open for scrutiny.</p> <p>Yesterday however Obama - who earlier this year offered Tehran a chance of a "new beginning" – called on Iran to allow UN inspectors to visit the plant, which is south of Tehran near the holy city of Qom, a seat of Shia learning, or face sanctions "that bite" against the Islamic republic. Brown said that the discovery of the covert site had "shocked and angered" the international community.</p> <p>The statement by western leaders appears timed to give a push to waverers to back sanctions against Iran, especially China and Russia.</p> <p>Yesterday Moscow issued a separate statement describing the plant as a "violation" of UN security council decisions, and offering to support an investigation.</p> <p>In other developments today, there were reports from semi-official state media that Iran's Revolutionary Guard will stage missile defence simulation exercises tomorrow – a move sure to be seen as provocative to the west with mounting tension over the nuclear issue.</p> <p>The guards said the exercises would be to "maintain and improve" the country's deterrent capabilities, AFP reported citing an Iranian news agency.</p> <p>Miliband said there was a "100%" commitment to diplomacy but, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he repeatedly declined invitations to describe military intervention as inconceivable.</p> <p>Miliband said that during the meeting of the E3+3 group of Britain, France, Germany, the US, Russia and China, Iran had to take "practical and concrete steps to address the outstanding questions and the outstanding offer that's on the table for them and that's what we are waiting to see".</p> <p>Questioned about the likelihood of military force against Iran, Miliband said: "No sane person looks at the military question of engagement with Iran with anything other than real concern. That's why we always say we are 100% committed to the diplomatic track.</p> <p>"I think it's very important we stick to that because the diplomatic track of engagement on the one hand and pressure on the other is only now really being tried with the engagement of America."</p> <p>But Miliband declined to describe military action as inconceivable, the word used by Jack Straw when he was foreign secretary.</p> <p>"I always say to people look at what I do say, not at what I don't say and what I do say is that we are 100% focused on a diplomatic resolution of this question," Miliband said.</p> <p>The Iranians acknowledged the existence of the plant in a letter to the International Atomic Energy Agency on Monday after learning that its existence had been discovered by the CIA, MI6 and the French DGSE intelligence agency.</p> <p>"We don't have any problems with inspections of the facility. We have no fears," Ahmadinejad said yesterday.</p> <p>The Iranian president said the three western leaders would "regret this announcement", claiming it had been made to disrupt the Geneva talks.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad dodged a question about whether Iran had sufficient enriched uranium to manufacture a nuclear weapon but said Tehran rejects such armaments as "inhumane".</p> <p>Western officials claim the plant is big enough to accommodate 3,000 centrifuges. They said that was far too big to be a pilot plant, as Iran claims, but far too small to produce enough low-enriched uranium for electrical power generation.</p> <p>Nuclear experts say that 3,000 centrifuges can produce enough enriched uranium each year to make a bomb, if it is further refined to weapons grade purity. There are more than 8,000 such machines at Natanz, Iran's known industrial-scale enrichment facility.</p>
