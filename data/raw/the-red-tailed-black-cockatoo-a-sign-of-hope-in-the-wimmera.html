<p>The silhouette of a flock of south-eastern red-tailed black cockatoos cutting across the Wimmera sky was probably once a more common sight. But for decades, these <a href="https://bio-prd-naturekit-public-data.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/species_assessments/Calyptorhynchus_banksii_graptogyne_10264.pdf" rel="nofollow">endangered</a> birds have struggled to find the stringybark and slow-growing buloke trees that sustain them.</p> <p>It was read as a sign of hope, then, when they were spotted feeding on the stringybark revegetation in Bank Australia’s <a href="https://www.bankaust.com.au/about-us/conservation-reserve" rel="nofollow">conservation reserve</a> on Wotjobaluk Country in western Victoria. Spread across four properties outside Horsham, the 2,117-hectare reserve is the home of a long-term effort to restore native plants and provide habitat for native animals.</p> <h2>Caring for country, culture and community</h2> <p>The customer-owned Bank Australia acquired the first of the four properties in 2008, as a practical step towards acting on customers’ concerns about climate change and the protection of nature. The reserve has been managed in partnership with not-for-profit conservation organisations including Greening Australia. Its management is now led by Trust for Nature, in collaboration with traditional owners from the Wotjobaluk, Jaadwa, Jadawadjali, Wergaia, and Jupagulk peoples, represented by the Barengi Gadjin Land Council (BGLC).</p> <p>With the help of the <a href="https://www.aboriginalheritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/barengi-gadjin-land-council-aboriginal-corporation" rel="nofollow">BGLC</a> and the Country Fire Authority, the traditional land-care strategy of cultural burning has been reintroduced. These cool, low-intensity fires eliminate invasive weeds, encourage the growth of native grasses and reshape habitats to support native animal life.</p> <p>Conservationists, ecologists, community groups and schools have also participated in the project since its inception.</p> <h2>Signs of hope</h2> <p>The restoration efforts are showing signs of success, demonstrated by the results of a biodiversity survey conducted in 2022-23. Red-tailed black cockatoos were among <a href="https://cdn.bfldr.com/1R31Y8GR/as/w85k59kjpcvffh23kn7h9hq/Bank_Australia_Reserve_Monitoring_Report_FY23#page=36" rel="nofollow">283</a> native animal species identified in the survey, up from 229 recorded in a survey five years earlier. Among those most recently counted were nine threatened animal species, including the Australasian bittern.</p> <p>The diversity and abundance of bird populations is another sign that ecosystems are recovering, signalling the abundance of available food and shelter; <a href="https://cdn.bfldr.com/1R31Y8GR/as/w85k59kjpcvffh23kn7h9hq/Bank_Australia_Reserve_Monitoring_Report_FY23#page=50" rel="nofollow">113</a> bird species were detected in the 2023 survey, including 22 recorded for the first time on the reserve.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Galahs in flight on Wotjobaluk Country in Western Victoria</p></li> </ul> <p>Canopies in revegetated woodlands on the conservation reserve <a href="https://www.bankaust.com.au/about-us/why-us/spring-monitoring-report" rel="nofollow">increased</a> by about 20% over the five years between surveys, enhancing the habitat for native animals such as the western pygmy possum.</p> <h2>Commitment for the long term</h2> <p>As well as continuing restoration efforts, it’s equally important to protect the reserve’s older, original vegetation, the survey says. The remnant woodlands have greater structural complexity, and lots of tree hollows, providing vital shelter and protection for small animals.</p> <p>With tree canopies reaching maturity, efforts can now be focused on promoting greater diversity on the forest floor, improving habitat availability for invertebrates, reptiles and other ground-dwelling species.</p> <p>Bank Australia has made a commitment to protect nature. The reserve is permanently protected under a conservation covenant with Trust for Nature, which acts as a guarantee for intragenerational responsibility. It’s a binding safeguard that will protect what we have, while work continues to regenerate nature for the future.</p> <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.bankaust.com.au/bird-of-the-year?utm_medium=sponsorship&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_campaign=boty&amp;utm_content=regeneration" rel="nofollow">Switch to an ethical bank.
