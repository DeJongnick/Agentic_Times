<p>It’s disappointing to see that there is still such a gender gap for pilots (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/01/oh-youre-a-woman-why-are-more-than-90-of-pilots-still-men-and-can-anything-narrow-the-gender-gap">‘Oh, you’re a woman!’ Why are more than 90% of pilots still men – and can anything narrow the gender gap?, 1 May</a>). In a wildly unscientific survey based on&nbsp;my holiday flights, my sweeping generalisation is that female pilots&nbsp;are preferable for their excellent landing skills, whereas men tend to just dump the plane on the runway with abandon. If you are a British Airways pilot flying to&nbsp;Italy this&nbsp;month, please ignore the above – I applaud your skills.<br><strong>Anne Cowper</strong><br><em>Bishopston, Swansea</em></p> <p>• I too abandoned wearing a bra doing lockdown and very quickly realised how much more comfortable I felt (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/28/the-one-change-that-worked-i-took-my-bra-off-during-lockdown-and-never-put-it-on-again">The one change that worked, 28&nbsp;April</a>). Luckily, I don’t require any under-propping in that area and have now been unshackled for over five years. The only time it can be a bit awkward is when the weather is a bit “nippy”, shall we say. So thank you so much, Kathryn Bromwich. Adhesive nipple covers!

What is the dog depositing on the floors? Perhaps the answer to being asked to remove shoes is to say that it’s not a good idea as you have athlete’s foot.<br><strong>Jill Hughes</strong><br><em>Horsmonden, Kent</em></p> <p>• How about #Don’tBuyIt, then you won’t have to #TakeItBack (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/29/you-sold-it-now-recycle-it-the-protesters-mailing-worn-out-clothes-to-the-shops-they-bought-them-from">‘You sold it – now recycle it’, 29 April</a>)?<br><strong>Siobhán McGeough</strong><br><em>Rochester, Kent</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
