<p>Two decades ago, Sara Carlson, then a mother of three, was newly single because of a traumatic event, and the US’s food stamp program, now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), helped her feed her children with free food supplies.</p> <p>“I wouldn’t have been able to afford to live,” said Carlson, 45, who lives in Rochester, Minnesota, and now works as an operations manager for a wealth-management firm and serves on the board of Channel One Regional Food Bank, which works to increase food access.</p> <p>While the food stamps helped her, the government cut her off after a couple years because she started making too much money, which meant she again had to worry about having enough food.</p> <p>Now, nearly 42 million people around the country could face the same fate if the federal government shutdown continues and funding for Snap is cut off on 1 November.</p> <p>While Republicans have sought to blame Democrats for the potential loss in benefits that people who make little money rely on, those who work in the food-insecurity space say that is misleading because Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/30/food-banks-trump-snap-cuts">already eliminated</a> almost $187bn in funding for Snap through 2034, according to a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R48552">congressional budget office</a> estimate.</p> <p>Should funding run out at the end of the month, “we will have the greatest hunger catastrophe in America since the Great Depression, and I don’t say that as hyperbole”, said Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America.</p> <p>Snap supports working families with low-paying jobs, low-income people aged 60 years and older and people with disabilities living on a fixed income, according to the <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/food-assistance/the-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a>.</p> <p>Snap participants generally must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty line. The average participant receives about $187 a month, the center reports.</p> <p>The Department of Agriculture recently <a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/nation-world/snap-funding-government-shutdown-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-food-stamps-us-secretary-of-agriculture-brooke-rollins">sent a letter</a> to regional Snap directors warning them that funding for Snap will run out at the end of the month and directing them to hold payments “until further notice”.</p> <p>More than 200 Democratic representatives have urged the USDA to use contingency funds to continue paying for Snap benefits.</p> <p>“There are clear steps the administration can and must take immediately to ensure that millions of families across the country can put food on their table in November,” <a href="https://democrats-agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/251024_-_letter_-_house_dems_to_usda_on_snap_shutdown.pdf?utm_campaign=2270-520">a letter</a> from the lawmakers to the USDA states. “SNAP benefits reach those in need this November would be a gross dereliction of your responsibilities to the American people. We appreciate your consideration of these requests.”</p> <p>Democrats have refused to pass a funding resolution to reopen the government because they want the legislation to include provisions to maintain healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which the Trump administration cut and are set to expire at the end of the year.</p> <p>A USDA spokesperson blamed Democrats for the upcoming loss in Snap benefits.</p> <p>“We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,” the spokesperson told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-under-fire-food-stamp-funds-run-dry-42-million-americans-caught-shutdown-fight">Fox News</a>. “Continue to hold out for healthcare for illegals or reopen the government so mothers babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely Wic [special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children] and Snap allotments”.</p> <p>That claim <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2025/oct/01/jd-vance/government-shutdown-Democrats-immigrant-healthcare/">is inaccurate</a>: undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Affordable Care Act subsidies.</p> <p>While his organization is focused on food insecurity, Berg supports the Democrats in fighting for healthcare subsidies because “this has grave repercussions for the people we represent”, he said.</p> <p>“The population getting the healthcare subsidies may have a marginally higher income than people getting Snap, but there is certainly a lot of overlap,” Berg said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/senate-vote-essential-workers">US Senate fails to pass bill to pay federal essential workers and troops through shutdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brittany, a 38-year-old mother of three, lives in Greenup, Kentucky, and works 35 to 40 hours each week as a home health nurse.</p> <p>She also has received Snap benefits for a few years.</p> <p>“It’s not like I receive benefits and not work,” said Brittany, pushing back against the misconception that people who receive food stamps just sit on the couch.</p> <p>They allow her to get “most of the necessities throughout the month and then I just pay cash for the rest of them”, said Brittany, who did not want her last name used.</p> <p>If the Snap funding is cut off, she said, she would have to work on the weekends to make up the difference, which would mean she would have “hardly any time with my children”.</p> <p>Still, she supports Trump and blames Democrats for the shutdown because “they are not agreeing on anything that the Republicans offer”.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 26 October 2025 to correct that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated $187bn in Snap funding through 2034, not through 2024 as an earlier version said.</p>
