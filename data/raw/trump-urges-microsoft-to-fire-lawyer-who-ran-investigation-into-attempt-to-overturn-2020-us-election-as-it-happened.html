But it’s anarchy out there,” the president said.</p> <p>“You go out to Portland and you see what’s happening in Portland, this is like, nobody’s ever seen anything like it, every night, and this has gone on for years, they just burn the place down and you know the shop owners, most of them have left, but the few shops that are open, they just use plywood, just like 3/4 inch plywood, they don’t put store fronts in because they know it’s going to be burned down,” Trump insisted, falsely.</p> <p>Describing the small number of protesters who have gathered outside an Ice facility that has been illegally used for detentions in a residential southwest neighborhood, Trump claimed, without evidence: “These are professional agitators, these are bad people and they’re paid a lot of money by rich people.”</p> <p>“But we’re going to get out there and we’re gonna do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that,” the president said.</p> <p>“These aren’t your protesters that make the sign in their basement late in the evening because they really believe it,” the president added. “These are professional anarchists and agitators, and they get hired by wealthy people.”</p> <p>At Friday’s news conference, congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici, an Oregon Democrat, said: “This proclaimed ‘war on Antifa’ is completely a fallacy. Antifa is an ideology, it is not a group, and so we’re extremely concerned with what he’s going to try to do with that pronouncement.”</p> <p>“Donald Trump does not care about safety. If he cared about safety he would not have released 1,600 convicted insurrectionists into the streets. He cares about control and authoritarianism,” she added. “Portland does not need the military. We do not want them, we do not need them, we do not welcome them to come here under his orders.”</p> <p>At the same news conference, Jeff Merkley, Oregon’s other Democratic senator, pointed out that when they visited the Ice facility this week, there were no protesters present at all. He also disputed the notion “that Trump is trying to make a rational point based on evidence.”</p> <p>“That is not correct. He is trying to project an image to justify forces that he can roll in to create chaos and then justify further authoritarian actions,” the senator added.</p> <p>He also drew attention to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_aJUX5DeDQ">video evidence</a> from the local newspaper, the Oregonian, which showed that a recent clash between federal agents and a small number of protesters outside the facility had been entirely due to violence by the agents against the protesters, who remained peaceful.</p>       <figure class="element element-video"

general says she is deploying federal agents to guard Ice facilities</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The attorney general, Pam Bondi, said on Friday that she is “deploying DOJ agents to ICE

href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/1971740514295660577">posted on social media</a>, Bondi added that she is responding to Donald Trump’s designation of certain forms of protest against immigration enforcement as acts of “terrorism” by instructing the FBI’s “Joint Terrorism Task Forces across the country to disrupt and investigate all entities and individuals engaged in acts of domestic terrorism, including the repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents.”</p> <p>“The Department of Justice,” Bondi said, “will seek the most serious available charges against all

prepares for possible military strikes on drug targets inside Venezuela – report</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Days before hundreds of top US military commanders have been ordered to gather at a marine corps base in Virginia next week, Pentagon officials are preparing for possible strikes on suspected drug traffickers inside Venezuela in the coming weeks, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/us-preparing-options-military-strikes-drug-targets-venezuela-sources-s-rcna233734">NBC News reports</a>, citing unnamed sources.</p> <p>Critics of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> have already accused him of seeking to use military strikes against suspected drug traffickers off the coast of Venezuela in recent weeks as a distraction from the clamor over his administration’s decision not to release files from the investigations into <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>, the late sex offender Trump socialized with for more than a decade.</p> <p>If US strikes escalate to targets inside Venezuela, Democrats could echo the claims made by Republicans in 1998 when <strong>Bill Clinton</strong> fired dozens of Tomahawk missiles at a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan and a training camp in Afghanistan associated with Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Those <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/aug/21/usa.edvulliamy">20 August 1998 strikes</a> were launched two weeks after al-Qaida had killed 224 people in bombings of the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, but also just three days after Clinton had admitted to an inappropriate relationship with <strong>Monica Lewinsky</strong>.</p> <p>A chorus of Republicans quickly accused Clinton of trying to create a foreign crisis to distract attention away from the sex scandal, and the accusation was reflected on the banners and signs of Sudanese protesters who <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/africa/082398attack-sudan.html">marched in Khartoum</a> that weekend holding up <a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/two-sudanese-women-hold-an-effigy-of-monica-lewinsky-the-news-photo/1251936052?adppopup=true">a large, handmade sign</a> with an image of Lewinsky emblazoned with the slogan: “No War for Monika.”</p> <p>At a Pentagon news conference after the strikes aimed at the then relatively unknown bin Laden, one reporter asked Clinton’s defense secretary, <strong>William Cohen</strong>, about suggestions that the timing of the attack bore “a striking resemblance to Wag the Dog”, the 1997 film about a White House that hires a Hollywood producer to create a fake war to divert the public from a sex scandal involving the president.</p> <p>“The only motivation driving this action today was our absolute obligation to protect the American people from terrorist activities,” Cohen replied. “That is the sole motivation.”</p> <p>“I don’t think any president, regardless of party, would ever take military action to distract from personal problems,” <strong>Dee Dee Myers</strong>, Clinton’s former press secretary, told Jay Leno that week in an appearance on the Tonight Show<em>.</em> “Most of the Congress, most of the American people I think, will say: ‘I don’t believe that our president, regardless of how bad things are, would do that.’”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time

media platform, hours after Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told the United Nations that Israel’s military was “no done yet.”</p> <p>“Intense negotiations have been going on for four

testify</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Democrats on the House judiciary committee are asking its Republican leader to allow victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his associates to testify about “the institutional failures that enabled these horrific crimes”.</p> <p>The letter, signed by 17 Democrats and led by ranking member <strong>Jamie Raskin</strong> and congresswoman <strong>Deborah Ross</strong>, a leader in the Democratic Women’s caucus and longtime champion of sexual violence survivors, comes amid continued pressure for the Trump administration to authorize the release of more files related to the disgraced financier.</p> <p>“The release of Justice Department files related to the sex trafficking ring led by Mr Epstein, while necessary, is not a substitute for the voices of these survivors,” the letter reads.</p> <p>“The House Judiciary Committee has an important role to play in addressing the institutional failures that enabled these horrific crimes and failed to protect the women and girls he trafficked and abused.”</p> <p>Testimony by the survivors – some of whom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/jeffrey-epstein-files-release-survivors">appeared at a press conference</a> outside the US Capitol earlier this month – “will help Congress to better understand the systemic breakdowns and shortcomings that enabled Mr Epstein’s network to operate for so long, including potential gaps in law enforcement practices, prosecutorial discretion, victim protection protocols, reporting requirements, and institutional oversight.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the committee’s Republican chair, <strong>Jim Jordan</strong>, did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The demand comes as a petition to force a vote in the House on legislation to release the Epstein files draws near to receiving the 218th signature necessary for its success, after Democrat Adelita Grijalva <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/adelita-grijalva-house-seat-arizona">won a special election</a> for a vacant seat earlier this week.</p> </div>   <p

He has pledged to crack down on leftwing groups in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s killing and has repeatedly singled out Soros, a major funder of liberal groups, as a target. “We’re going to look into Soros, because I think it’s a Rico case against him and other people,” Trump said on 12 September, using an acronym to refer to racketeering charges. “Because this is more than like protests.

I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.</p> <p>We start with the news that <strong>James Comey, the former FBI director and one of Donald Trump’s most frequent targets, was indicted on Thursday on one count of making a false statement to Congress and one count of obstruction of a congressional proceeding</strong>, the latest move in the president’s retribution campaign against his political adversaries.</p> <p>The indictment, filed in federal district court in Alexandria, Virginia, shows Comey’s charges centred on whether he lied and misled lawmakers during testimony in September 2020 about the Russia investigation.</p> <p>Comey was expected to surrender and have his initial appearance in federal district court on Friday morning, according to a person familiar with the matter. Comey is expected to be represented by Patrick Fitzgerald, a former US attorney for the northern district of Illinois.</p> <p>While the precise details were not clear in the sparse, two-page indictment, it appeared to reference Comey’s testimony that he had never authorized someone at the FBI to leak to the news media about the Trump or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> investigations – a claim prosecutors alleged was false.</p> <p>“No one is above the law. Today’s indictment reflects this Department of Justice’s commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a>, the US attorney general, said in a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-bondi-director-patel-statements-regarding-indictment-former-fbi-director">statement</a> on Thursday.</p> <p>The indictment followed Trump’s instruction to Bondi to “move now” to prosecute Comey and other officials he considers political foes, in an impatient and extraordinarily direct social media post trampling on the justice department’s tradition of independence.</p> <p>It also came less than a week after Lindsey Halligan was installed as the top federal prosecutor in the eastern district of Virginia, after Trump fired her predecessor, Erik Siebert, after he declined to bring charges against Comey over concerns there was insufficient evidence.</p> <p>Halligan, most recently a White House aide and former Trump lawyer who has no prosecutorial experience, was also presented with a memo earlier this week laying out why charges should not be brought. But the justice department still pushed it through, people familiar with the matter said.</p> <p>Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the US senate intelligence committee, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Donald Trump has made clear that he intends to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Responding to the indictment, hours after it was filed, Comey said in a video statement posted on Instagram that he was innocent and welcomed a trial.</p> <p>“My family and I have known for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump, but we couldn’t imagine ourselves living any other way.
