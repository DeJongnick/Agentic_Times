 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Reminder that we are also waiting for a verdict in the <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong> robbery case, so here’s the latest from our Paris correspondent <strong>Angelique Chrisafis.</strong></p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>A Paris court <strong>will reach a verdict on Friday</strong> in the trial of 10 people alleged to have been involved in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/12/kim-kardashian-in-serious-terror-when-robbers-entered-suite-court-told">theft of jewellery </a>worth millions of euros from the American reality TV star <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> when she attended Paris fashion week in 2016.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Three pensioners and a man in his 30s are accused of breaking into a luxury residence in Paris, where they tied up Kardashian and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/21/grandpa-robbers-accused-of-kim-kardashian-jewel-heist-to-face-paris-trial">held her hostage at gunpoint</a> in her bedroom in the early hours of 3 October 2016.</em></p>

   <p><em>They arrived by bike or on foot at the smart residence in central <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/paris">Paris</a> and held a receptionist at gunpoint before going up to Kardashian’s room, where she had been sleeping.

 <h2 class="block-title">Polish election debate overshadowed by questions over candidate's football hooliganism</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>And since we mentioned <strong>Poland: </strong>the two candidates in the presidential election run-off on 1 June will face each other in a televised debate tonight.</p> 
  <p>Centrist Warsaw mayor <strong>Rafał Trzaskowski</strong> and radical-right historian <strong>Karol Nawrocki</strong> will have a chance to question each other in a high-stakes programme televised by multiple broadcasters.</p> 
  <p>Trzaskowski narrowly won the first round, and the run-off remains too close to call, with some polls even showing Nawrocki ahead.</p>

  <p>The fight saw 70 men on each side clash in fields near Gdańsk, according to <a href="https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/karol-nawrocki-bral-udzial-w-jednej-z-najslynniejszych-kibolskich-ustawek-w-polsce-7159569441295296a">a report by Wirtualna Polska.</a></p>

  <p>One big story that we will follow today is <strong>the expected verdict in the Kim Kardashian robbery trial in Paris.</strong></p> 
  <p>Kardashian was in Paris – a city she said she had “always loved” – for fashion week in October 2016 and was staying in a luxury hotel when the robbers attacked after she returned from dinner. Ten people – nine men and a woman aged between 35 and 78 – are on trial in connection with <strong>France’s biggest personal robbery in 20 years</strong>. Eight of the accused deny any involvement.</p> 
  <p>The suspects, nicknamed <strong>the “grandpa gang”</strong> because of their advanced age, fled with jewellery estimated at $10m (£7.5m) in value, including the 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring Kardashian’s then husband, rapper Kanye West, gave her, estimated to be worth $4m.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: Europe gets tougher on migration</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Italy</strong> and <strong>Denmark</strong> lead a group of countries <strong>pushing back on the European court of human rights’ interpretation of the Human Rights Convention</strong> when it comes to migration.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="file:///System/Volumes/Data/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/final-letter.pdf">a joint letter signed with seven other countries</a> - Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Poland, and the Baltics – they argued that a conversation was needed on how rights were being applied as <strong>“what was once right may not be the answer tomorrow.”</strong></p> 
  <p>They said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>Over the past decades, irregular migration has contributed significantly to the immigration to Europe.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Many have come here via legal pathways. They have learned our languages, believe in democracy, contribute to our societies and have decided to integrate themselves into our culture.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Others have come and chosen not to integrate, isolating themselves in parallel societies and distancing themselves from our fundamental values of equality, democracy and freedom.</em></p> 
   <p><em>In particular, some have not contributed positively to the societies welcoming them and have chosen to commit crimes.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It is <strong>beyond our comprehension how some people can come to our countries</strong> and get a share in our freedom and our vast range of opportunities, <strong>and, indeed, decide to commit crimes.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>Although this concerns only a minority of immigrants, <strong>it risks undermining the very foundation of our societies.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>It harms the trust between our citizens and it harms the trust in our institutions.</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a particularly stark paragraph, the letter said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>We believe that the development in the Court’s interpretation has, in some cases, <strong>limited our ability to make political decisions</strong> in our own democracies. And thereby affected <strong>how we as leaders can protect our democratic societies and our populations</strong> against the challenges facing us in the world today.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The leaders said “we believe that w<strong>e are strongly aligned with the majority of the citizens</strong> of Europe in our approach,” as they set out to <strong>“restore the right balance.”</strong></p> 
  <p>The move comes as <strong>migration dominates election after election across Europe</strong>, with voters increasingly frustrated with what they see as the lack of decisive leadership to resolve the issues. Just think of Germany in February and the rise of the anti-migrant sentiment, or about Poland’s ongoing presidential campaign.</p> 
  <p>One to watch.</p>
