<p>An alleged burglar appears to have taken the saying “sleeping on the job” literally after passing out with a half-eaten pie and covered in Doritos in a house near Glasgow.</p> <p> The 46-year-old man is alleged to have broken into the house in Coatbridge on Monday night, but to have then been too tired to actually leave. He was eventually discovered by the homeowners, who alerted the police.</p> <p> Monklands police tweeted: </p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/MonklandsPol/status/932962221201743873">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sleeping on the Job!<br>We all feel tired when we start a shift &amp; a thief who started his shift at 2345 yesterday was no different. He broke into a house on Corsewall St, decided on a pit stop, ate half a pie and fell asleep covered in Doritos.

A few years ago, Texan Kevin Connelly <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2892591/Who-s-sleeping-bed-Burglar-takes-leaf-Goldilocks-caught-having-nap-homeowner-mid-robbery.html">found a burglar asleep in his guest room</a> in Houston and called the police.<br></p> <p>In Florida, the Sarasota county sheriff’s office was called after <a href="https://patch.com/florida/sarasota/burglar-caught-sleeping-job-0">a cleaning lady found a man sleeping on a bed</a> next to a bagful of jewellery he had intended to steal.</p> <p> “The man was still sleeping when deputies arrived. They were able to snap his photo with the loot without him even noticing,” the sheriff said at the time.</p> <p>And in Purcell, Oklahoma, Steven Walker, who lived alone, said he was surprised to return from a doctor’s appointment and <a href="http://kfor.com/2015/04/07/burglar-falls-asleep-on-the-job/">discover a stranger in his home</a>. </p> <p>“I guess he was looking for something valuable. I just don’t have anything. Once he pilfered through everything, I think he gave up and took a nap,” Walker said.</p>
