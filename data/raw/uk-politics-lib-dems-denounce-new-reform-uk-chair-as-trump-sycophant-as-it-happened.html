Here are some of the other lines from the Q&amp;A.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Farage, the Reform UK leader, admitted that the party does not have a plan for implementing its policy on illegal immigrants, which is to deport all of them from the UK.</strong> Yesterday <strong>Zia Yusuf,</strong> the former Reform UK chair, told the Today programme:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I want to be crystal clear about what my position is, and Reform UK’s position is, which is we will deport everybody who is here in this country illegally, which is roughly about 1.2 million people.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked for details of how this would happen, <strong>Farage</strong> replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>As President Trump is discovering in Los Angeles, this is not an easy thing to do, which is why, whilst it has to happen, I’ve always been cautious about about delving into specifics on it.</p> <p>I will say this, there’ll be no deportations until we leave the ECHR [European convention on human rights]. There’ll be no deportations until British judges are freed to make their own decisions. Although, even when that comes, given our current crop of judges, then there may still be challenges, given the politicisation that has happened of the judiciary and the civil service and all the things in a post-Blair time.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Farage defended Reform UK’s decision to call its council cost-cutting teams Doge, after Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency in the US, even though the Musk has fallen out with Donald Trump.</strong> Asked about this, Farage said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We thought hard about this. We thought about we did have a name; there was a UK name that we thought we’d use. And then what polling showed us is one of the things that’s wildly popular in the UK that’s happening in America is the concept of Doge, and that Doge had seeped into public consciousness, and that to attempt to rebrand that would be a hell of a difficult effort. So that’s why we’ve stuck with it.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He claimed almost the successful business people he knows are thinking of leaving the country because of Labour’s high taxes.</strong> He said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Virtually everybody I know that has been successful in business is considering leaving this country. The last official figures were the 10,800 of the wealthy left Britain. The next set of figures - I don’t know what they’re going to be, 20,000, 25,000.</p> <p>You’ve only got to look at property prices in Westminster, Chelsea, Kensington and see they’ve all fallen by over 20%. Now that doesn’t really matter, and nor does it benefit ordinary folk, because these are houses priced in millions.</p> <p>But you don’t make those that are not doing so well in society better off by getting rid of your biggest taxpayers.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said he did not see the debate about whether or not the burqa should be banned as a priority issue. </strong>There were many more important issues, he said. But he went on:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Do I think, in cultural terms, the burqa fits in with the British way of life? Not really, no.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked about this a second time, he replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This is about priorities. I don’t like to see the burqa. I think it probably is anti British …</p> <p>But is it absolutely front line and centre of what we’re going to campaign for? Not given the other major crises we face.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He rejected claims that Reform UK was chaotic under his leadership.</strong> Asked if the number of senior Reform resignations undermined the party’s credibility, he replied:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Rows and resignations? Yes, that’s right. Seven Chairman since 2022, and four leaders. They’re called the Conservative party, and they’re like ferrets in a sack.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also insisted that he was good at retaining the loyalty of colleagues, using language much the same as when he addressed this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/09/labour-spending-review-end-austerity-home-office-conservatives-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-6846f56b8f0868a29b800df8#block-6846f56b8f0868a29b800df8">during his press conference yesterday.</a></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>He rejected claims that today’s figures showing donations to political parties in the first quarter of the year were a disappointment</strong>. The <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/media-centre/political-parties-accept-ps1295m-donations-first-quarter-2025">figures </a>show the party received £1.5m. Asked if the party was over-reliant on big donors, Farage said the donations were up ten-fold on the previous quarter. “The trend is in the right direction,” he said. He also said that, unlike the bigger parties, he was not able to attract donations by offering people peerages. (This was a joke, because selling peerages is illegal, but no one at Westminster thinks there is no link between donations and honours.) Farage said the honours system was “corrupted beyond belief”.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>He suggested it did not matter what Kemi Badenoch said because “no one’s listening”.</strong></p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-10T15:21:11.228Z">at 4.21pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6848434b8f08a2d0af27ac5d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-10T14:44:58.087Z">3.44pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Farage says having David Bull, qualified doctor, as Reform UK chair will help it counter Labour claims about its health plans</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Labour has attacked the new Reform UK chair, David Bull, over his previous comments about the NHS.

But, at his press conference this morning, <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> said that the fact that Bull worked as a hospital doctor before transferring to a career in TV would help the party. Farage said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Who knows? Having somebody inside that’s been a hospital doctor might actually be a very useful thing when it comes to answering questions about the National Health Service and the deficiencies within it, without people screaming that we want to make people pay £150,000 pounds for a hip operation, which appears to be what the Labour lie machine is roughly saying at the moment. </p> </blockquote>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-10T14:46:21.123Z">at 3.46pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68483c788f08a2d0af27abe9" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-10T14:17:15.857Z">3.17pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway join UK in sanctioning two far-right Israeli ministers</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>This morning Keir Starmer said that he wanted to take action against Israel alongside other allies.

Settler violence has led to the deaths of Palestinian civilians and the displacement of whole communities.</p> <p>We are steadfastly committed to the two-state solution which is the only way to guarantee security and dignity for Israelis and Palestinians and ensure long term stability in the region, but it is imperilled by extremist settler violence and settlement expansion.</p> <p>Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights. Extremist rhetoric advocating the forced displacement of Palestinians and the creation of new Israeli settlements is appalling and dangerous. These actions are not acceptable. We have engaged the Israeli government on this issue extensively, yet violent perpetrators continue to act with encouragement and impunity. This is why we have taken this action now – to hold those responsible to account.

The Treasury has set out them all in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thousands-of-jobs-to-be-created-as-government-announces-multi-billion-pound-investment-to-build-sizewell-c">a news release</a>. This is how it summarises the three linked announcements.</p> <p><strong>Sizewell C</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Sizewell C will provide 10,000 people with employment at peak construction and support thousands more jobs across the UK, including 1,500 apprenticeships …</p> <p>Despite the UK’s strong nuclear legacy, opening the world’s first commercial nuclear power station in the 1950s, no new nuclear plant has opened in the UK since 1995, with all of the existing fleet except Sizewell B likely to be phased out by the early 2030s. </p> <p>Sizewell C was one of eight sites identified in 2009 by then-energy secretary Ed Miliband as a potential site for new nuclear. However, the project was not fully funded in the 14 years that followed under subsequent governments. </p> <p>The government’s nuclear programme is now the most ambitious for a generation - once small modular reactors and Sizewell C come online in the 2030s, combined with Hinkley Point C, this will deliver more new nuclear to grid than over the previous half century combined.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Small modular reactors</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p> The government’s nuclear resurgence will support the UK’s long-term energy security, with small modular reactors expected to power millions of homes with clean energy and help fuel power-hungry industries like AI data centres. </p> <p>This follows reforms to planning rules announced by the prime minister in February 2025 to make it easier to build nuclear across the country - changing the rules to back the builders of this nation, and saying no to the blockers who have strangled our chances of cheaper energy, growth and jobs for far too long. </p> <p>The government is also looking to provide a route for private sector-led advanced nuclear projects to be deployed in the UK, alongside investing £300m in developing the world’s first non-Russian supply of the advanced fuels needed to run them. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fusion energy</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The government is also making a record investment in R&amp;D for fusion energy, investing over £2.5 billion over 5 years. This includes progressing the STEP programme (Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production), the world-leading fusion plant in Nottinghamshire, creating thousands of new jobs and with the potential to unlock limitless clean power. </p> <p>This builds on the UK’s global leadership to turbocharge economic growth in the Oxford-Cambridge corridor, while helping deliver the UK’s flagship programme to design and build a prototype fusion power station on the site of a former coal-fired plant.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68480e638f0847b9d7ae4aad" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-10T11:20:09.107Z">12.20pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Farage says restoring death penalty will become matter for 'major national debate' within next decade - but he is against</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> has just finished his press conference. It was his second in two days, and he took a large number of questions. Tim Montgomerie, the journalist who set up ConservativeHome and who is now a Reform UK supporter, says he thinks Farage has taken almost 100 questions from reporters at press events in the last fortnight, far more than any other party leader.</p> <p>The Q&amp;A covered a lot of topics but what was most interesting was Farage’s repeatedly willingness to float hard right or extreme propositions – while at the same time not quite fully adopting them. </p> <p>A good example came when he was asked about Reform UK’s position on the death penalty. Farage said that he expected calls for the restoration of the death penalty to become a major political issue over the next decade – while stressing that he was personally opposed. The result was that a hardline GB News viewer keen to see murders hang may have concluded that, under Farage, this would all be getting more likely – while a liberal-minded, Reform-curious former Tory voter watching may have concluded that Farage was reliably moderate on this issue after all.</p> <p>Asked by a reporter from the Sun what the party’s position on the death penalty was, Farage replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>These are issues of conscience, just as the assisted dying debate will be when it comes up on Friday, just as the abortion limit. These are all issues of conscience. Nothing on the death penalty will be part of party policy. </p> <p>I have to say, personally, given there have been 500 quite serious miscarriages of justice in this country since the early 1970s, I don’t think I could ever support it. But I understand why others take a different point of view.</p> <p>Although I do think it’s quite interesting there’s a younger generation coming through who seem to increasingly support the death penalty. And I suspect it will be back within the next decade as an issue of major national debate. Not quite yut, but it’s coming. </p> <p>But, certainly, these things will not be party policy, far, far from it. </p> </blockquote> <p>Farage was referring to <a href="https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/media/odycjqqk/death-penalty-polling-mic.xlsx">this polling </a>from More in Common UK released in January.

In particular, he was asked if the government would apologise for cutting WFPs last year, given that it has now decided to restore them for most pensioners.</p> <p>No, was the answer. Miliband told Times Radio:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We’re not going to apologise for the actions we took to stabilise the economy. That’s what happened last year. The chancellor came into office, saw a massive black hole in the nation’s finances. She took a whole series of measures. </p> <p>Now, what’s happened since then is two things. One, we have stabilised the public finances and secondly, we’ve listened to people. Now, we haven’t changed the principle that the winter fuel allowance should be means tested but we have listened to people on the threshold of how high the threshold should be for qualification. Personally, I think it’s the right thing that the chancellor has done.</p> </blockquote> <p>While being asked continually to apologise for the original WFP cut may have been irritating for Miliband, and will be for Keir Starmer when he inevitably gets asked the same question today, paradoxically it is a sign that the U-turn announcement yesterday has been relatively successful. That is because if the opposition, and the oppositon media, are focusing on calls for an apology in relation to a policy issue, that generally means they have run out of other, more important, things to complain about.</p> <p>While the media (see<a href="https://x.com/AlfieTobutt/status/1932184196803436901"> the Sun’s splash</a>), and MPs, seem to care a lot about apologies, members of the public may be more interested in the substance of what the government is doing. That is the case Miliband made to Times Radio. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’ve talked to lots of people on doorsteps about the winter fuel allowance. I can’t remember anyone who said, you should apologise. People wanted us to change the policy and that’s what we’ve done.</p> </blockquote> <p>Opposition MPs say the government should apologise because cutting the WFP was a bad decision in the first place. Privately, many ministers probably agree. But the government is arguing that the cut was needed because of the state of the government finances last year and ministers are not going to abandon that position.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6847d92a8f08b83ed0439a83" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-10T08:38:57.080Z">9.38am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Miliband says funding plan means Sizewell C will happen as Green party says money could be 'far better spent'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Good morning. As you will probably have heard already, <strong>Ed Miliband,</strong> the energy secretary, has announced plans to build a new nuclear power station in Suffolk, Sizewell C. Here is the Guardian story.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/apr/15/nuclear-sites-revealed">Potential sites for UK nuclear power stations revealed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oops. That is our story from 2009, when Gordon Brown was prime minister, Miliband was energy secretary for the first time, and Sizewell C was first getting the go-ahead from government.</p> <p>Often reading about British politics (and writing about it) can feel like being trapped in a circular doom loop of stasis, particularly when the government is talking about infrastructure policy. But this time it is different, Miliband claimed in interviews this morning. In an interview with Today, when <strong>Justin Webb</strong>, the presenter, pointed out that the last Conservative government also said that it was committed to Sizewell C and asked what was different this time, <strong>Miliband</strong> had a simple answer.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We’re funding it. And that’s the big difference.</p> <p>We’re actually putting put forward the money to make it happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>Miliband went on:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This is the biggest investment in nuclear, new nuclear, in more than half a century in Britain. Sizewell C. Small modular reactors, Rolls-Royce, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/rolls-royce-smr-selected-to-build-small-modular-nuclear-reactors">it was announced </a>at 7am this morning, have won that competition. Nuclear fusion.</p> <p>We’re doing this because we want energy security for the country, long-term energy security. Good jobs, 10,000 jobs, at Sizewell alone. And, frankly, something I care a lot about, to tackle the climate crisis, because we’ve got to get off insecure, volatile fossil fuels, both for security and for climate reasons.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is our overnight story, by <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station-ed-miliband-investment">Sizewell C power station to be built as part of UK’s £14bn nuclear investment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Miliband was doing an interview round this morning, and he will be in the Commons making a statement about this later. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is also giving a speech this morning that will cover nuclear power.</p> <p>At Westminster, opposition to the Sizewell C announcement is likely to be limited. The last Conservative government was in theory in favour. In the past the Liberal Democrats were sceptical about nuclear power, but <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/members/article/liberal-democrats-historic-vote-to-support-new-nuclear-power">that has changed under Ed Davey</a>. Judging by Nigel Farage’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/09/nigel-farage-reform-uk-welsh-elections-coalmining-revived"> speech yesterday</a>, you might conclude that Reform UK back opening coalmines as their preferred answer to the energy crisis, but they have not spoken out against nuclear power stations.</p> <p>So, on this issue, the Green party have the opposition side of the pitch all to themselves. This morning <strong>Adrian Ramsay</strong>, the party’s co-leader and MP for Waveney Valley, which covers parts of Suffolk and is not far from Sizewell, issued this statement. He said the money could be “far better spent” on green energy and better insulation.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Nuclear power is hugely expensive and far too slow to come on line. The only thing delivered by EDF so far at Hinkley Point in Somerset is overspend and delay. Electricity was promised by 2017 with a price tag of £22bn but this has mushroomed to 40bn and Hinkley is still producing no power.</p> <p>The money being spent on this nuclear gamble would be far better spent on insulating and retrofitting millions of homes, bringing down energy bills and keeping people warmer and more comfortable.</p> <p>We should also be investing in genuinely green power such as fitting millions of solar panels to roofs and in innovative technologies like tidal power. All this would create many more jobs than nuclear ever will.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Morning:</em> Keir Starmer is on a visit in Suffolk.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is speaking at the GMB conference.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, holds a press conference to announce the party’s new chair.
