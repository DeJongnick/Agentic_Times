<p>A US federal appeals court has ruled that most of president Donald Trump’s tariffs are illegal, describing the levies as “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”.</p> <p>The ruling, which will take effect on 14 October, is the biggest blow yet to Trump’s tariff policy and will likely<strong> </strong>mean the supreme court will have to rule on whether Trump has the legal right as president to upend US trade policy.</p> <p>Reacting to the decision on social media, the president said: “ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT!” If allowed to stand, the ruling would “literally destroy the United States of America”, he added.</p> <p>The president on Friday also revoked Secret Service protection for the former vice-president and 2024 election rival Kamala Harris after it was extended by Joe Biden before he left office. The move has been slammed by some as “another act of revenge”.</p> <p>Here are the key stories:</p>  <h2>Most of Trump’s tariffs are illegal, federal court rules</h2>  <p><a

to tax”, the court said.</p> <p>Many of Trump’s steep tariffs “are unbounded in scope, amount and duration”, the ruling added, and “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration has leaned on.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-tariffs-illegal-appeal-court-ruling"><sub>Read the full
