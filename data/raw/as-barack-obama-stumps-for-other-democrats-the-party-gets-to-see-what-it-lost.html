<p>“It’s not as if we didn’t see some of this coming,” said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama">Barack Obama</a>, a note of bleak humour in his voice. “I will admit it’s worse than even I expected, but I did warn y’all!”</p> <p>The crowd at a sports arena in Norfolk, Virginia, half-laughed and half-groaned. “I did,” Obama added. “You can run the tape.”</p> <p>He did. The former US president spent 2024 sounding the alarm about the horror show that awaited if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> ever got back to the Oval Office. Trump won the election anyway a year ago on Wednesday.</p> <p>Among the many unintended consequences is the return of Obama to the political stage. Former presidents used to slink away to running foundations or writing memoirs and avoid criticising their successors but that is one more norm that has bitten the dust.</p> <p>Obama has had 25 public engagements or remarks in the past six months, according to a list released by his office. He has tackled everything from USAID to redistricting to Tylenol. He is filling the vacuum left by Trump’s most immediate predecessor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>, who turns 83 this month.</p> <p>Now Obama is back on the campaign trail, for Democrats running for governor in New Jersey and Virginia. It gives him a platform to deliver an alternative State of the Union address. And the gloves are off.</p> <p>To hear the expectant buzz of the 7,000-plus crowd in Norfolk as candidate Abigail Spanberger promised that Obama’s entrance was just moments away was to be reminded that Democrats did once have a president who could match Trump’s superstar charisma.</p> <p>“We love you!” someone shouted from the stands, just as they do at Trump rallies. “We miss you!”</p> <p>The backdrop was a giant stars and stripes and supporters waving mini-flags and signs. But whereas Trump is all big orange hair, dark blue suit, white shirt and red tie, Obama’s hair was short and grey and he wore a blue shirt open at the collar with sleeves rolled up. Trump often gets compared to a stand-up comedian but Obama has the sharper act.</p>    <p>Liberated from the burden of seeking elected office for himself again, he clearly revelled in skewering the president with scathing and scorching lines, as if auditioning for late-night TV.</p> <p>“It’s hard to know where to start, because every day this White House offers up a fresh batch of lawlessness and recklessness and mean-spiritedness and just plain craziness,” Obama said, with the crowd cheering each word, wondering perhaps why Chuck Schumer and the rest of them can’t do plain talk like this.</p> <p>The former president ran through an exhausting but not exhaustive list of Trump’s offences: turning the justice department against his political opponents; replacing career prosecutors with loyalists; firing decorated officers because they might be more loyal to the constitution than to him; deploying the national guard to US cities to stop crime waves that don’t exist; ICE agents pulling up in unmarked vans and grabbing people, including US citizens; a health secretary who rejects proven science and promotes quack medicine; a top White House aide who calls Democrats domestic extremists; and a poor labour economist who got fired for reporting bad jobs numbers.</p> <p>“I mean, it’s like every day is Halloween,” Obama said, “except it’s all tricks and no treats.”</p> <p>He acknowledged that plenty of people voted for Trump because they were “understandably frustrated” with inflation and gas prices and the difficulty of affording a home and worried about their children’s children, saying: “So they were willing to take a chance.”</p> <p>It certainly worked out well for Trump and his family, with crypto ventures with hundreds of millions of dollars and for wealthy allies and corporations whose tax bills went down. But for ordinary people, Obama continued, life is harder than ever, with healthcare premiums set to double or triple and the government shut down.</p> <p>“As for the president,” Obama said, “he has been focused on critical issues like paving over the Rose Garden so folks don’t get mud on their shoes, and gold-plating the Oval Office, and building a $300m ballroom.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/01/obama-virginia-abigail-spanberger">Obama criticizes Trump and Republican policy in stump speech for Abigail Spanberger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Virginia, here’s the good news. If you can’t visit a doctor, don’t worry, he will save you a dance. And if you don’t get an invitation to the next White House shindig, you can always watch the festivities and all the beautiful people on Truth Social.”</p> <p>The crowd lapped it up. Obama was on a roll. He lambasted Republicans for putting on “a big show of deporting people and targeting transgender folks. They never miss a chance to scapegoat minorities and DEI for every problem under the sun.</p> <p>“You got a flat tire? DEI.</p> <p>“Wife mad at you?”</p> <p>The audience rejoined: “DEI!”</p> <p>It was a reminder that humour is a potent political weapon. That is why Trump’s allies tried to oust TV host Jimmy Kimmel and why California governor Gavin Newsom gets under their skin.</p> <p>Obama turned to the artificial intelligence videos that Trump posts on his Truth Social account, including one showing himself wearing a crown, flying a fighter jet and dumping brown liquid on No Kings protesters.</p> <p>“All the nonsense we see on the news every day, the over-the-top rhetoric, the fabricated conspiracies, the weird videos of a US president with a crown on his head flying a fighter jet and dumping poop on protesting citizens, all of that is designed to distract you from the fact that your situation has not gotten better,” he said.</p> <p>There it was: the man who had inspired with his words – yes, we can; hope and change; there is not a liberal America and a conservative America, there is the United States of America – had been reduced to uttering the word “poop” from the stage. When they go low ...</p> <p>Obama dutifully heaped praise on Spanberger and urged Virginians to vote for her. It was a performance of wit and wisdom that reminded America what it has lost – and Democrats what they have never been able to recreate. The party needs someone who will take the fight to Trump. But its best candidate for 2028 is the one who cannot run.</p>
