<p>China’s economy showed further signs of weakness last month as it comes under strain from Donald Trump’s trade wars and domestic problems, with factory output and consumer spending rising at their slowest pace for about a year.</p> <p>The disappointing data adds pressure on Beijing to roll out more stimulus to fend off a sharp slowdown, with a debt crisis denting the country’s once-booming property sector and exports facing stronger headwinds.</p> <p>Economists were split over whether policymakers should introduce more near-term fiscal support to hit their annual 5% growth target, with manufacturers awaiting further clarity on a US trade deal and domestic demand curbed by an uncertain job market and property crisis.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/evergrande-china-group-delisted-hong-kong-stock-exchange">Evergrande: China’s property giant delisted from Hong Kong stock exchange</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Industrial output grew by 5.2% year on year last month, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Monday, the lowest reading since August 2024 and below the 5.7% rise in July. Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, expanded 3.4%, the slowest pace since November 2024, and cooling from a 3.7% rise in the previous month.</p> <p>A spokesperson for China’s statistics bureau said on Monday that more efforts were needed to support China’s ailing property sector and that the “external environment is very severe”.</p> <p>China’s economy remains heavily reliant on exports which have been dealt a blow by the trade war with the US. Although the two countries agreed a pause on tariffs until 10 November, China recorded a slump in US-bound exports last month. China’s exports to the US fell by 33.12% year on year in August, according to customs data. Overall exports increased by 4.4% in August.</p> <p>“The activity data point to a further loss of momentum,” Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note. “While some of this reflects temporary weather-related disruptions, underlying growth is clearly sliding, raising pressure on policymakers to step in with additional support.”</p> <p>Factory activity was hit by the hottest conditions since 1961 and the longest rainy season for the same period.</p> <p>Authorities are leaning on manufacturers to find new markets to offset <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/trump-asks-eu-to-impose-high-tariffs-on-india-and-china-to-put-pressure-on-russia">Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies</a> and weak consumer spending.</p> <p>Separate data this month showed factory owners have had some success diverting US-bound shipments to south-east Asia, Africa and Latin America, but the drag from the property crisis continues.</p> <p>Lynn Song, the chief economist for Greater China at ING, suggested the weak data indicated “further stimulus support could be needed to ensure a strong finish to the year”.</p> <p>She said: “While it is too early to gauge the impact of the consumer loan subsidies coming into effect in September, it is likely that more policy support is still needed, given the broader slowdown across the board.” Song said there was a “high possibility” of further interest rate cuts in coming weeks.</p> <p>However, Zhaopeng Xing, a senior China strategist at ANZ, said that while the data showed momentum in the world’s second-largest economy was weakening, it was not yet bad enough to trigger a new round of stimulus.</p> <p>“Policies and measures to support service consumption are expected to offset the impact of aggregate demand this month,” he said, adding that an official crackdown on firms aggressively cutting prices made domestic demand appear worse than it was.</p> <p>Chinese households, which have seen their wealth shrink in the property downturn, have tightened their purse strings as business confidence falters, dampening the jobs market.</p> <p>Unemployment edged up to a six-month high of 5.3% in August, from 5.2% a month prior and 5% in June.</p> <p>Meanwhile, new home prices fell by 0.3% last month from July and by 2.5% on an annual basis, a different NBS dataset showed.</p> <p><em>Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report</em></p>
