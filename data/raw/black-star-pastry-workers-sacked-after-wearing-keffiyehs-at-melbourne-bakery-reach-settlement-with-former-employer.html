The case was lodged with the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal in March.</p> <p>The termination letter, seen by Guardian Australia, said wearing a keffiyeh while working was “divisive and inflammatory” for the store’s customers and staff and against its “vision to create a place of inclusivity”.
