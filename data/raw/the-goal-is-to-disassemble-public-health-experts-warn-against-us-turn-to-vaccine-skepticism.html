<p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/vaccines">vaccine</a> hesitancy increases in the US, isolated, tight-knit and religious communities have frequently been at the center of high-profile outbreaks.</p> <p>Such is the case in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c">west Texas</a>, where a rural community is the center of an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/texas-measles-outbreak-spread">expanding measles outbreak</a> that has already claimed the lives of two Americans – the first deaths from the disease in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/vaccines-measles-outbreak-immune-systemc">nearly a decade</a>.</p> <p>However, as the conspiracy theories of Maga conservatism marry the bugbears of the US health secretary and vaccine skeptic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, the one-time fringe view of vaccines has become increasingly <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/press-release/poll-trust-in-public-health-agencies-and-vaccines-falls-amid-republican-skepticism/">mainstream</a> – with activists in right-leaning population centers taking lessons learned from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid-19 pandemic</a> into the realm of childhood inoculations.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/vaccine-myth-autism-stigma">Debunked myths that vaccines cause autism are increasing stigma</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One need look no further than Sarasota, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida">Florida</a>, for a full-throated political denunciation.</p> <p>“Generally, people are weak, lazy,” said Vic Mellor, an activist based near Sarasota, and a close ally of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn.</p> <p>Mellor owns the We the People Health and Wellness Center in nearby Venice. Mellor, in a shirt that shouts “VIOLENCE MIGHT BE THE ANSWER”, is a self-professed attendee of the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol.</p> <p>“And that lazy part just makes them ignorant … Covid has proven that obviously this is true. I mean, all the facts are starting to come out on Covid now – that it was a hoax. That is just an extension of where this hoax began decades earlier with the vaccines, OK? This is all a money grab, this is all a power grab.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>This is not an isolated, rural, religious community. This is in the heart of everything</p> <footer> <cite>Kathryn Olivarius, Stanford University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pandemic was real, and it started Mellor down the road of questioning vaccines. Where he once opposed only the Covid-19 shots, he now opposes vaccines entirely – arguing they harm children despite experts on vaccines considering them one of mankind’s greatest medical achievements.</p> <p>“This is not an isolated, rural, religious community, which I think is what a lot of people associate with an anti-vaccine mentality,” said Kathryn Olivarius, the author of Necropolis: Disease, Power, and Capitalism in the Cotton Kingdom, and a historian of disease at Stanford University. “This is in the heart of everything.”</p> <p>Sarasota has become a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/power/interactive/2023/sarasota-maga-dream/">proving ground</a> for the Maga right. Among nail salons, mom-and-pop Cuban restaurants and roadside motels lining US 41, known locally as the Tamiami Trail, a visitor can find the gates of New College. This was once a public university prized for its progressive liberal arts education. Now it is part of the new conservative experiment in remaking higher education led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/11/new-college-of-florida-rightwing-takeover">activists</a> aligned with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and the Republican Florida governor, Ron DeSantis.</p> <p>Along the same road is the Sarasota memorial hospital, an aberration in American healthcare – it is publicly owned with open board elections. The normally sleepy election became contentious when insurgent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/21/1144798353/in-florida-health-freedom-activists-exert-influence-over-a-major-hospital">“health freedom”</a> candidates, supported in part by Mellor, entered the race. Three <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/08/23/sarasota-election-sarasota-county-hospital-board-health-freedom/10291181002/">won seats</a> on the nine-member board in 2022.</p> <p>Even the name of this stretch of sun-bleached asphalt is up for debate. This year, a state Republican lawmaker – who has also <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/222">introduced bills</a> to limit vaccine requirements – briefly proposed changing its name to the <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/25/bill-would-rename-us-41-road-tamiami-trail-to-gulf-of-america-trail/80264969007/">“Gulf of America Trail”</a> – a nod to Trump’s renaming of the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>Arguably the most salient artifact of this activism in Sarasota is the least visible: vaccination rates against measles.</p> <p>Measles vaccination rates for kindergarteners have plummeted over the last two decades – from 97% in 2004 to 84% in 2023, according to state health records. Sarasota is roughly on par with the vaccination rates in rural Gaines county, Texas – the center of the ongoing measles outbreak that sickened 279 people in <a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025">in that state alone</a>. Notably, both Gaines county and <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/news/local/2023/12/25/why-do-these-sarasota-manatee-parents-choose-to-homeschool-their-kids/71976358007/">Sarasota</a> have large home-schooling communities, meaning vaccination rates could in fact be lower.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>These are diseases that have killed hundreds of millions of people – and quite horribly too</p> <footer> <cite>Kathryn Olivarius, Stanford University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is well known in research circles that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/trump-adminstration-health-policy">right-leaning states</a> across the US south and west have worse health metrics – from obesity to violence to diseases such as diabetes. That reality was supercharged during the pandemic; as vaccine mandates became a fixation on the right, Republican-leaning voters became more skeptical of vaccines. In turn, places with politically conservative leaders <a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/political-ideology-of-u-s-elected-officials-linked-with-covid-19-health-outcomes/">experienced more Covid-19 deaths</a> and greater stress on hospitals.</p> <p>Measles is one of the most contagious diseases known to medicine. At least 95% of the population needs to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks of the disease. But despite a supremely effective vaccine that eliminated the disease from the US in 2000, vaccine hesitancy has increasingly taken hold.</p> <p>Conservative activism alone can’t be blamed for declining measles vaccination rates. The measles vaccine in particular has been subject to a sustained <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/majority-antivaxx-vaccine-ads-facebook-funded-by-two-organizations-study">firehose of misinformation</a> stemming from a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2011/jan/12/andrew-wakefield-fraud-mmr-autism">fraudulent paper</a> linking the vaccine to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/cdc-study-vaccines-autism">autism in 1999</a>. For years, this misinformation was largely nonpartisan. And Florida’s anti-vaccine movement was active even before the pandemic – with a vocal contingent of parents arguing against strengthening school vaccine standards <a href="https://www.gainesville.com/story/news/state/2019/10/13/anti-vaccine-movement-derails-bill/2544195007/">in 2019</a>.</p> <p>What appears new in Sarasota is how local conservative activists have brought opposition to vaccines into the heart of their philosophy. By Mellor’s telling, he and a loosely affiliated group of Maga activists began to adopt anti-vaccine beliefs as the pandemic wore on – helping organize major health protests in the area in recent years, such as mask mandate opt-outs and the “health freedom” campaign for hospital board seats.</p> <p>Mellor said his nearby property, the Hollow, was a <a href="https://www.thehollow2a.com/event-details/sarasota-memorial-hospital-board-meeting-2">gathering place</a> during the pandemic (it is also a part-time gun range). He cites ivermectin, an <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ivermectin-and-covid-19">anti-parasitic drug</a> that became a fascination of the right, as the reason “we didn’t lose people at all” during the height of the pandemic. Available clinical evidence shows it is not effective against Covid-19.</p> <p>Kennedy has fit neatly into this realignment. He enjoys trust ratings among Republicans nearly as high as Trump, according to polling from the health-focused <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/press-release/poll-trust-in-public-health-agencies-and-vaccines-falls-amid-republican-skepticism/">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>. Kennedy has already spread dubious information about measles vaccines in public statements (notably: from a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/rfk-jr-hannity-interview-beef-tallow"> Steak ’n Shake</a> in Florida) – a response one vaccine expert said “couldn’t be worse”.</p> <p>“While children are in the hospital suffering severe measles pneumonia, struggling to breathe, [Kennedy] stands up in front of the American public and says measles vaccines kill people every year and that it causes blindness and deafness,” said Dr Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the division of infectious diseases at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Severe side effects from the vaccine are possible, but they are much rarer than disability and death from measles.</p> <p>“This is what happens when you have a virulent anti-vaccine activist, a science denialist, as the head of the most important public health agency in the United States,” said Offit. “He should either be quiet or stand down.”</p> <p>The same poll found trust in public health agencies has fallen precipitously amid Republican attacks. More than a quarter of Republican parents report delaying childhood vaccines, the poll found, a rate that has more than doubled since 2022. There is no analogous trend among Democratic parents. Despite how claims espoused by vaccine skeptics can be easily refuted, their power has not been undercut.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/measles-spread-vaccine-misinformation">More US states report measles cases amid vaccine misinformation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The anti-vaccine business is <a href="https://counterhate.com/topic/anti-vaxx-misinformation/">big business</a>,” said Offit, pointing to the myriad unproven “treatments” offered by promoters of vaccine misinformation, some of which are offered at Mellor’s We the People health center. “We have been taken over by a foreign country, and the goal of that foreign country is to disassemble public health.”</p> <p>The misery of measles did not take long to appear in Texas – measles-induced pneumonia has already led pediatricians to intubate children, including at least one baby, according to the Associated Press. About one to three people out of 1,000 who are infected by measles die from the infection, and one in 1,000 suffer severe brain swelling called encephalitis, which can lead to blindness, deafness and developmental delays.</p> <p>“We actually don’t have the perspective people in the past had on these diseases,” Olivarius. “I have spent many, many, many years reading letters and missives from parents who are petrified of what’s going to happen to their children” if there are outbreaks of yellow fever, polio or measles, Olivarius said about diseases now largely confined to history – thanks to vaccines.</p> <p>“The lesson from history is these are not mild ailments,” she said. “These are diseases that have killed hundreds of millions of people – and quite horribly too.”</p>
