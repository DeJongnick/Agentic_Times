<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-09-18T10:00:11Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p>It is time once again for the Thursday quiz, newly restored to the Guardian website after a summer hiatus. If you are new to the format, think of it as a mix between a topical news quiz and a pub quiz, but sillier. Much, much sillier. There are no prizes, it is just for fun, but let us know how you got on in the comments. <em>Allons-y!</em></p>

    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:D - Peru's tourism minister, Desilú León, told local radio that 1,400 tourists were evacuated on Monday but 900 remained stranded in Aguas Calientes, the closest town to the much-visited cultural site, 2:C - A researcher said: "It was very unusual to see someone on such a vehicle. We were astonished. We don’t want to demonise him, but why take risk when you don’t need to?" They helped not to demonise him by publishing video of the incident that went viral, 3:B - You too can get the look – the tie is available from the club's website for £15, 4:D - Like the rest of the UK, where The Pitt isn't available, the Thursday quiz has not seen it and so cannot pass any judgment on the decision, 5:B - Jerry Greenfield has ushered himself out the door marked 'do one'. He had been there nearly a year for every day Liz Truss was UK prime minister, 6:B - The choir apparently sang a specially composed Canticle of Indignation. The Thursday quiz thinks it saw Canticle of Indignation at Download festival in 2008, 7:A - Apparently he had turned up at the wrong church for a wedding he was meant to be attending and found it increasingly hard to extricate himself from the situation, 8:A - Animal services and the Riverside county sheriff’s department responded and Cupid is now standing again and on the mend, 9:C - Poor pigeons, they are just hungry little critters, 10:B - The Thursday quiz thinks they've made a great publicity coup out of adding a "chatbot" to a website and labelling it an "AI minister", but what does the Thursday quiz know?, 11:D - As if any very naughty miniature dachshund would accept any bylaw concerning dog behaviour, 12:B - He is a co-founder of the software company Oracle, apparently, 13:C - Sushila Karki, the former chief justice of Nepal, took the oath of office late on Friday, after several tense days of negotiation, 14:B - It seems he hit seven straight shots into the water and frankly at that point the Thursday quiz would have gone home and found something less boring to do instead, 15:D - Well isn't that just lovely, eh?</p>
