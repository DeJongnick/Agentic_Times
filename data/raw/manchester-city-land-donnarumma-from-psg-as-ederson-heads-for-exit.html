The move paves the way for Ederson to move to Fenerbahce for £12.1m (€14m).</p> <p>Donnarumma has been deemed surplus to requirements by Luis Enrique at PSG, who signed Lucas Chevalier last month to be first choice at the European champions.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/manchester-united-keen-on-senne-lammens-or-emiliano-martinez-as-new-goalkeeper-option">Manchester United seal €21m deal for goalkeeper Senne Lammens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Italy keeper can expect to be Guardiola’s No 1 despite City having signed James Trafford from Burnley for £27m in July.
