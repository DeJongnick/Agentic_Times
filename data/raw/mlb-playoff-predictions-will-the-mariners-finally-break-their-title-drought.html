<h2><strong>Team that that will be most missed from the playoffs</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Pirates </strong>may have been abysmal again but have remained appointment viewing thanks to Paul Skenes, whose highlight reels make you question physics. It’s not just his raw pace, throwing 100mph+ deep into games, but his mastery of late-moving variations that mean batters can’t pick whether it’s a sweeper or a splinker until it’s already behind them. <strong>Alan Evans</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Astros. </strong>They’d made the playoffs for eight straight years, winning a couple of World Series, four American League pennants and seven AL West titles. Sure, they were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/17/houston-astros-sign-stealing-cheating-scandal">villains on merit</a>, but gravity-defying dynasties like Houston’s only make for richer postseason narratives. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> <p>Well, these days, it’s hard to miss any team because just under half of them make the playoffs. That said, the <strong>Orioles</strong> have great young talent and a fanbase starving for a winner. When Camden Yards is full and buzzing it’s one of the best atmospheres in North American sports. Their 2025 has to be considered one of the most disappointing seasons in recent memory, unless you’re a Mets fan of course. <strong>David Lengel</strong></p> <h2><strong>High seed at risk of going out early</strong></h2> <p>The<strong> Brewers</strong> surged to the best record in baseball (96-65) with an astonishing summer after having been 25-28 on 24 May. But their momentum slowed in September, and with the new extended wildcard format giving the best teams a five-day break, that may be enough to knock them off their rhythm and send them home early. <strong>AE</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Brewers</strong> could be vulnerable. The NL Central champions have come back to earth after the 14-game win streak that vaulted them to the best record in baseball. There are questions over the fitness of closer Trevor Megill and they’ll have a tricky NLDS draw with the Padres or Cubs after a five-day layoff. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>That has to be the <strong>Tigers</strong>, who are facing a Guardians team that came out of nowhere to capitalize on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/26/detroit-tigers-baseball-al-central-cleveland-guardians">a historic Detroit collapse</a>. Cleveland’s recent stretch of allowing just 32 earned runs in 19 games was otherworldly, and it’s helped earn them three home games v Detroit. There’s only one Tarik Skubal pitching for the Tigers, so that means they’re in trouble. <strong>DL</strong></p>    <h2><strong>Dark horse to win</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Padres</strong> are used to being overlooked in favor of their more glamorous neighbors in Los Angeles, but they have a dangerous core led by Manny Machado and Fernando Tatis Jr, and the bullpen’s 3.06 ERA is by far the best in baseball. If they can keep games close early on, they will be hard to shake off. <strong>AE</strong></p> <p>The<strong> Mariners</strong> are the lone major league team to have never reached a World Series much less won one. They have a strong chance of finally breaking that hoodoo thanks to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/17/mariners-cal-raleigh-hits-55th-and-56th-homers-of-season-to-break-mickey-mantles-record">Cal Raleigh’s brilliance</a> and proven October commodity Randy Arozarena. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Red Sox</strong> have come out of this dormant phase, won back their temporarily apathetic fan base and are quite good, and importantly, well-rounded. They do everything well, and despite the <a href="https://www.masslive.com/redsox/2025/09/boston-red-sox-roman-anthony-heading-to-fort-myers-no-timetable.html">loss of rookie phenom Roman Anthony</a>, probably have enough to oust the Yankees this round, and more. They have the ace in Garrett Crochet and two Comeback Player of the Year candidates in Trevor Story and Aroldis Chapman. Don’t be surprised if they pull of their fifth title of the century. <strong>DL</strong></p> <h2><strong>Most important factor this postseason/offseason</strong></h2> <p>The Dodgers already have the best – and best-paid – lineup in baseball, but are still likely to give <strong>Kyle Tucker</strong> a megacontract this offseason. If that does happen, calls will grow for a long-overdue look at competitive balance and the rules about salary deferrals. This won’t stop the Dodgers winning 100+ games a year for the next decade, but it could shape the outcome of the collective bargaining agreement due after next season. <strong>AE</strong></p> <p><strong>Bullpen upgrades</strong>. In today’s game, the difference between winning and losing in October often comes down to late-inning arms in high-leverage situations. Any team that can lock down seventh-to-ninth inning relief dominance will head into 2026 with a huge competitive edge. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Well, so much of the pitching world surrounds <strong>bullpens</strong> these days, with starters having trouble going deep into games. LA’s relief core has struggled, but now that their starters are healthy, and the pen can breathe a little, the Dodgers are well placed to use their core more effectively. San Diego’s bullpen, with Mason Miller is terrifying. On the flip side, expect the Yankees bullpen to let them down at just the wrong time. <strong>DL</strong></p>    <h2><strong>NLCS</strong></h2> <p>Dodgers over Padres. <strong>AE</strong></p> <p>Phillies over Brewers. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Dodgers over Brewers. <strong>DL</strong></p> <h2><strong>ALCS</strong></h2> <p>Yankees over Mariners. <strong>AE</strong></p> <p>Mariners over Yankees. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Mariners over Blue Jays. <strong>DL</strong></p> <h2><strong>Your World Series champions will be …</strong></h2> <p>The <strong>Dodgers</strong> may be facing injury struggles, most notably catcher Will Smith’s fractured hand, but no team has a deeper roster. They have the best player in the world in Shohei Ohtani, an experienced batting lineup who know how to win in the postseason, and the potentially powerful storyline of retiring team hero Clayton Kershaw being used as a super-reliever if they make the World Series. His teammates would love to send him off with another championship, and they have the quality and consistency to dominate any opponent. <strong>AE</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Phillies</strong> boast one of the most balanced rosters in baseball, even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/23/zack-wheeler-phillies-thoracic-outlet-surgery-injury">without ace Zack Wheeler</a>. Cristopher Sánchez, Ranger Suárez and Jesús Luzardo headline a rotation that can carry games deep, sparing a top-heavy bullpen. Jhoan Duran, electrifying in the ninth, has turned Citizens Bank Park into a theater of intimidation. Offensively, Kyle Schwarber and Bryce Harper – two of the generation’s best October sluggers – anchor a lineup bolstered by Rob Thomson’s platoons and a supporting cast with eight double-digit homer hitters. Harper feels destined for a World Series MVP run after 2022’s near-miss, while Schwarber (56 homers) has generally thrived under pressure. The X-factor? NL batting champion Trea Turner’s return from a hamstring injury. If he finds his rhythm, Philadelphia’s cocktail of power, depth and home-field magic make them the most compelling case to win it all. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Mariners</strong> were born in 1977 and have never won the big one. Nearly 50 years later, they’re ready to shock the Dodgers and finally bring that elusive title to the northwest corner. It won’t be a shock, because Seattle have the talent and they’re peaking at the right time. With should-be MVP Raleigh, Arozarena and Julio Rodríguez, their lineup is beefy. But it’s the pitching rotation, with depth from Bryan Woo, Luis Castillo and Logan Gilbert that’s found elite form over the last month, combining with a pen in top gear that make them so formidable. Yes, they really can match LA, and if they can somehow strikeout a little bit less, they’ll pip the Dodgers in seven. <strong>DL</strong></p>
