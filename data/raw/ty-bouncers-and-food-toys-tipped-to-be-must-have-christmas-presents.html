<p>A £7 furry bouncy ball with a face is tipped to be one of the must-have toys this Christmas, according to expert buyers at Hamleys.</p> <p>The Ty Bouncers – essentially fluffy tennis balls – range from cats, cows and monkeys to Spider-Man and Paddington. With 80 to collect, Victoria Kay, the head of buying and merchandising at Hamleys, said the bouncy soft toys offered “uncomplicated fun”.</p> <p>“They’ve been building steadily all year to a point now where they’re a full-on craze,” Kay said. “They are simple – no tech, no instructions – just bounce and laugh. They also offer tactile engagement, with soft textures and a sensory break from digital overload.”</p>    <p>At this time of year, Hamleys produces a shortlist of the toys it expects to feature on Christmas lists come December. With soft-toy collecting back in vogue for children and adults, the list includes one of its classic teddy bears and Evie Pig (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/may/21/peppa-pigs-new-baby-sister-could-evie-pig-become-a-billion-dollar-brand">baby sister to Peppa</a>) at a time when its buyers have identified a “growing cultural shift towards simplicity”.</p> <p>Hamleys, known for its landmark store on Regent Street, London, is also selling cutesy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/11/croissants-coffee-cups-food-toys-christmas-retail-jellycat-amuseables">toy versions of food and drinks</a>, including a £12 cuddly slice of pizza, as tactile food-themed toys are a big toy trend.</p> <p>The list of 15 items is not all low-tech, as it includes a robotic Woody from Toy Story (the priciest item at £80), a remote-controlled drifting car and Soccer Dash, an AI-powered football skills game that uses a “smart” ball.</p>    <p>After a difficult 2024, UK toy sales are running up 8% so far this year, according to data firm Circana, buoyed up by the popularity of the Minecraft and Lilo &amp; Stitch films, as well as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/06/he-man-poised-to-be-next-retro-name-to-join-uk-toy-newstaligia-trend">wave of “newstalgia”</a> – when parents re-buy toys they once owned as children, such as Barbie, Care Bears and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p> <p>In a nod to this trend, the Hamleys “Festive 15” includes a £40 Star Wars Power Crystal Lightsaber that has seven blade colours.</p> <p>The toy industry is also increasingly catering for “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/21/hamleys-kidults-top-10-toys-for-christmas-2023">kidults</a>” (buyers aged 12 or over) who spend their spare cash on expensive Lego sets and collectible figurines. With the Circana data highlighting a growing interest in manga and anime merchandise, a figurine inspired by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/nov/19/japanese-anime-one-piece-to-air-its-1000th-episode-in-80-countries">Japanese cartoon series One Piece</a> makes the list. The “retro-futuristic” collectible characters are designed by the sculptor Jason Freeny.</p> <h2><strong>Hamleys Festive 15</strong></h2> <p>Lego Marvel Spider-Man vs Doc Ock Subway Train Scene <strong>£45</strong></p> <p>Roblox Dress to Impress fashion doll <strong>£30</strong></p> <p>TY Bouncers <strong>£7</strong></p> <p>L.O.L.
