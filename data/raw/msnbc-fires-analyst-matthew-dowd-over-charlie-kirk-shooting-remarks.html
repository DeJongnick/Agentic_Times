<p>MSNBC fired its senior political analyst Matthew Dowd after he suggested on air that the slain conservative activist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah">Charlie Kirk</a>’s own radical rhetoric may have contributed to the shooting that killed him.</p> <p>During his appearance on Katy Tur Reports, Dowd suggested that Kirk’s rhetoric may have contributed to the violence that claimed his life. Kirk, 31, had a history of rightwing provocation and <a href="https://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/scursas/2024/posters/22/">Christian nationalism</a>, and frequently espoused bigoted rhetoric about <a href="https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1929357064754589868">Islam,</a> <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/charlie-kirks-hardline-abortion-views-resurface-after-his-killing-in-utah-viral-video-101757562999575.html">women </a>, <a href="https://lgbtqdems.org/statement-on-the-murder-of-right-wing-agitator-charlie-kirk/">LGBTQ+ </a>communities and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/mike-freeman/2024/02/04/charlie-kirk-black-pilot-comment-tuskegee-airmen/72412319007/">people of color</a>.</p> <p>“Hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” Dowd said, adding: “You can’t stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have and then saying these awful words and then not expect awful actions to take place.”</p> <p>Dowd also speculated about the circumstances of the shooting, saying: “We don’t know if this was a supporter shooting their gun off in celebration. So we have no idea about this.”</p> <p>The network issued an apology and announced Dowd’s dismissal, which came shortly after Kirk was shot dead during a question-and-answer session at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, where he was kicking off a nationwide campus debate tour. MSNBC’s president, Rebecca Kutler, described Dowd’s comments as “inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable” in a statement posted to social media.</p> <p>“We apologize for his statements, as has he,” Kutler wrote. “There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise.”</p> <p>The network almost immediately severed ties with Dowd, with Deadline reporting that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/msnbc">MSNBC</a> had cut its relationship with the analyst citing “furor over remarks he made in the aftermath of the shooting”.</p> <p>Dowd, who served as chief strategist for George W Bush’s 2004 presidential campaign and was formerly a political analyst for ABC News, issued his own apology following the controversy.</p> <p>Writing on Bluesky, he said: “My thoughts &amp; prayers are w/ the family and friends of Charlie Kirk. On an earlier appearance on MSNBC I was asked a question on the environment we are in. I apologize for my tone and words. Let me be clear, I in no way intended for my comments to blame Kirk for this horrendous attack. Let us all come together and condemn violence of any kind.”</p> <p>Kirk, co-founder of Turning Point USA and a prominent figure in conservative youth politics who had been credited with boosting the Maga youth vote during the 2024 election, was fatally shot in the neck during the campus event on Wednesday afternoon, with multiple videos of the moment spreading across social media.</p> <p>Federal authorities are investigating the shooting, with two persons of interest initially taken into custody before being released. Both were briefly detained but released without charge, and a suspect is still at large.</p> <p>The killing has drawn sharp criticism from across the political spectrum. </p>
