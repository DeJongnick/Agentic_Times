 <h2 class="block-title">Dfat officials in Tel Aviv liaising with Israel after interception of Gaza-bound aid flotilla</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) </strong>says its officials at the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv are travelling to Ketziot to provide consular assistance to “any Australian who requests it”.</p> 
  <p>Members of the Global Sumud flotilla – which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/03/australians-gaza-flotilla-detained-government-pushing-israel-for-information">intercepted by Israel</a> on its way to deliver aid to Gaza – will be handed over to the police before being transferred to Ketziot prison, a large facility in the Negev desert.</p> 
  <p>It’s been reported that at least five Australians who were on board are among those detained.</p> 
  <p>This afternoon, Dfat said in a statement that its officials in Tel Aviv were liasing with Israeli authorities and had formally requested confirmation of the detention of any Australians.</p> 
  <p>The department added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Australia calls on all parties to respect international law, to ensure the safety and humane treatment of those involved.</p> 
   <p>We understand that people want to help deliver aid to those suffering in Gaza – we also want to see critical aid delivered.</p> 
   <p>For some time, we have warned against attempts to breach the naval blockade and strongly advised Australians not to do so because of the risks to their safety.</p> 
   <p>We repeat our call on Israel to enable the sustained, unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Former Israeli PM supports Gaza peace plan</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The former Israeli prime minister <strong>Ehud Barak</strong> has been interviewed on the ABC about his views on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/trump-peace-plan-gaza-israel-hamas">Trump administration’s peace plan for Gaza</a>.</p> 
  <p>Barak said the plan was the best chance at a ceasefire and, even though it was a “good starting point for Israel to have a serious discussion about ending the war”, it could have been done at least six months ago.</p> 
  <p>Barak, who has previously publicly urged Israel to agree to a ceasefire deal, said the Israeli prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>, had inadvertently committed an “irony of history” with his assault on Gaza, because:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>He came to kill or block any possibility of Palestinian state and ended up mobilising the whole world to impose upon Israel the Palestinian state.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Barak said he supported the aspect of Trump’s plan which states Gaza would be governed by a transitional “apolitical” committee, which would be headed by US president and include former British prime minister <strong>Tony Blair</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Barak told the ABC the committee would be beneficial for both Israel and the nearby Arab countries, and that:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The international body is very important and these are people who are well accepted, especially Tony Blair.</p> 
   <p>It helps both sides in fact, because for Israel it is easier to discuss with Tony Blair than with any other Palestinian figure and even for the Arab countries, for Egypt, for the Emiratis, the Saudis, it is easier to talk to Tony Blair than direct to Israel.</p>

  <p><strong>Major banks and retailers secure payment agreement with Armaguard</strong></p> 
  <p>Australia’s major banks and retailers have secured an agreement with cash transit company Armaguard over how to pay for physical money to be transported around the country.</p> 
  <p>The agreed pricing mechanism follows a lengthy period of negotiation prompted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/28/armaguard-collapse-fears-coles-cash-withdrawal-limit">warnings from Armaguard</a> almost two years ago its distribution operations were unsustainable due to falling demand for physical cash.</p> 
  <p>Any disruptions to physical money transit services would hit Armaguard’s main clients, including banks, supermarkets and other major retailers. The availability of cash for the community would be curtailed.</p> 
  <p>Armaguard has a near-monopoly on cash distribution in Australia.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The Australian Banking Association, which was involved in the negotiations, said in a statement today:</p> 
   <p>The final independent pricing mechanism report has been provided to Armaguard as well as the major banks and major retailers.</p> 
   <p>This is an important milestone in working to keep cash available around Australia, even while people are using less of it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The independent pricing mechanism will use a third party to oversee contract prices. The agreement will require authorisation from the competition regulator.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'We have the right to march’: Pro-Palestine Opera House protesters vow to fight police block in court</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Palestine Action Group</strong> has vowed to fight in court the police’s decision to oppose a march to the Sydney Opera House.</p> 
  <p>The group had announced on social media two days ago its plan to march from Hyde Park to the Sydney Opera House on 12 October to mark the two year anniversary since October 7 and to call for an end to genocide in Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Earlier today, NSW police said they had knocked back the group’s application to facilitate the protest, citing safety concerns.</p> 
  <p>The group submitted what is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/jul/02/hannah-thomas-injury-sparks-questions-over-nsw-protester-rights-what-does-the-law-say-ntwnfb">known as a “form 1” to police</a>. The form is a notification to hold a public assembly that, if accepted by police, protects those attending from being potentially charged under anti-protest laws.</p> 
  <p>Now that organisers have vowed to challenge the police’s decision to deny the application, the supreme court will have the final say over whether protesters will be afforded legal protections or not.</p> 
  <p>Assistant commissioner <strong>Peter McKenna</strong> told reporters earlier today “it’s not even a matter about it being at the Opera House itself. It’s about public safety”.</p> 
  <p>He said the police were trying to negotiate an alternative route with organisers and that they “understand that this is a significant anniversary”.</p> 
  <p>The group said in a statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have the right to march, the right to protest, and the right to demand an end to Israel’s genocide of the Palestinian people.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>South Australia police are scaling back the search for Gus, a four-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/01/footprint-found-in-south-australian-outback-search-for-four-year-old-boy">missing since last Saturday</a>, at a regional property about 40km south of the township of Yunta.</p> 
  <p>Assistant commissioner <strong>Ian Parrott</strong> said “considerable” police resources had been searching for Gus since he was last seen at his family property. Parrott told those at a press conference SA police had thrown “absolutely everything we can in an effort to try to locate Gus safely and safe as well and alive”.</p> 
  <p>He went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Whilst we have all been hoping for a miracle, that miracle has not eventuated and the last 48 hours, despite the professional advice, it would be unlikely that Gus would have survived. We have maintained and in fact, increased the effort to try and locate him and bring him back to his family.</p> 
   <p>Unfortunately, at no point has there been any significant evidence that has enabled us to really focus in a direction for our search, give us any clues as to where he may have gone. We’re confident that we have done absolutely everything we can to locate Gus within the search area.</p> 
   <p>But despite our best efforts, we have not been able to locate him and unfortunately we are now having to scale back this search for Gus.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Parrott said officials would not rest until they can try and find the answer to Gus’ disappearance.</p>

  <p>Returning to the police operation in south-west Sydney this morning, <strong>NSW police</strong> have now confirmed it has concluded.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, a spokesperson said police were called to a house on Wollongbar Avenue in Panania just before 8am today, following reports four men, one of whom was believed to be armed with a firearm, were seen entering the property.</p> 
  <p>The incident drew a massive police response, with officers from Bankstown area command assisted by the tactical operations unit, dog unit, traffic and highway patrol, police negotiators, a PolAir helicopter and the Raptor Squad, which focuses on organised crime, including bikie gangs.</p> 
  <p>The operation concluded about 11.30am. Police have been told a male occupant was assaulted by the men, but did not require treatment.</p> 
  <p>Police have established a crime scene at the property, and say the occupants of the house are assisting with their inquiries.</p>

  <p><strong>Telstra ordered to pay $18m penalty for misleading Belong customers over NBN speeds</strong></p> 
  <p>Telstra was <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/telstra-fined-18-million-for-misleading-belong-customers-over-broadband-speed-claims">ordered to pay an $18m penalty</a> for breaching Australian consumer law after it moved nearly 9,000 customers on its Belong service to a lower speed plan without telling them.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission</strong> (ACCC) said between October and November 2020, Telstra moved those customers on Belong brand NBN plans from a plan with maximum upload speeds of 40 Mbps to service that provided just 20 Mbps in upload speeds. Download speeds were unaffected.</p> 
  <p>Telstra did not tell the customers of the change at the time.</p> 
  <p><strong>Anna Brakey,</strong> the commissioner of the ACCC, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The $18m penalty sends a strong message to all businesses that they cannot mislead consumers by making changes to key aspects of a service without informing customers of those changes.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Telstra will also remediate customers with a credit or payment of $15 for each month the customer had been on the lower speed plan. The total value of that remediation could be more than $2.3m.</p>

  <p><strong>War crimes trial for former SAS soldier could take years to go to court </strong></p> 
  <p>The nation’s first war crime murder trial involving an Australian defence force soldier won’t happen until at least 2027, giving defence minister <strong>Richard Marles</strong> time to suppress certain matters, AAP reports.</p> 
  <p>Both the prosecution and defence in the case of former SAS soldier <strong>Oliver Jordan Schulz</strong> say they are yet to see all the evidence because a decision about what can be released hasn’t yet been made.</p> 
  <p>Schulz pleaded not guilty in the NSW supreme court on Friday to allegations he committed a war crime in the murder of a young man in Afghanistan. He is accused of killing Afghan man <strong>Dad Mohammad</strong> during a mission in May 2012.</p> 
  <p>A trial date was not set because national security concerns had delayed both sides from seeing much of the evidence against Schulz.</p> 
  <p>Schulz is the first serving or former ADF member to face a war crime charge of murder under domestic law.</p>

  <p>South Australia’s ambulance service was signed up to a new system that is supposed to send notifications when Optus has a triple zero outage, but says it was not notified during the outage last month.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/30/optus-triple-zero-outages-anika-wells-meeting-singtel-lot-of-work-to-do">September’s triple zero outage</a> was caused by a network firewall upgrade which blocked emergency calls for Optus customers in South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and parts of New South Wales.</p> 
  <p>The outage has been linked to the deaths of two people in SA and one in WA. A fourth death, of an infant in SA, was found to be likely unrelated.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian Electoral Commission</strong> (AEC) launched federal court proceedings against a man who allegedly distributed unauthorised electoral pamphlets during the 2025 federal election.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">

  </aside> 
  <p>The AEC said <strong>Jarrod Davis </strong>allegedly breached the Commonwealth Electoral Act by failing to put his name and address on about 47,000 pamphlets that were distributed in the electorate of Wentworth. The alleged pamphlets contained material opposing the local member, <strong>Allegra Spender.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Jeff Pope</strong>, the AEC election commissioner, said in a statement the court action demonstrated the agency’s role upholding Australian elections:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Australia’s democracy is rightly regarded as world leading, and central to that integrity is the ability for any voter to know the source of electoral advertising through authorisation messages.</p> 
   <p>The AEC takes cases involving the complete absence of authorisation information and its widespread dissemination particularly seriously.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Failure to authorise electoral communication can carry a penalty of up to $39,600 per contravention, at the discretion of the court.</p>

  <p><strong>Too hard to work out how many people affected by Centrelink’s unlawful debt calculations, government bureaucrat says</strong></p> 
  <p>Back in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation committee, the department of social services is speaking about the Australians affected by Centrelink’s unlawful debt calculation.</p> 
  <p><strong>Matt Flavell</strong>, the deputy secretary of social security said the department did not know how many people were affected:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The practice of income apportionment, we understand, went back to the early 1990s. It isn’t possible to say with precision how many debts may be affected, because that would require going into each individual debt and seeking to determine exactly whether it was or wasn’t impacted by income apportionment.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked if the debts should be waived, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That would mean, effectively, going back and refunding millions and millions of debts going back to the early 1990. <strong>The number of hours involved in doing that is significant.</strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Pro-Palestine protest could be tested in the supreme court</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Palestine Action Group is deciding whether to go before the supreme court once again about a planned protest after the police opposed a march to the Sydney Opera House.</p> 
  <p>Assistant commissioner <strong>Peter McKenna</strong> addressed reporters a short time ago to say police had decided to oppose the planned route outlined in the group’s ‘Form 1’ protest permit because of safety concerns linked to limited exit points from the Opera House forecourt.</p> 
  <p>He said police would lodge an objection to the protest in the NSW supreme court, but were still discussing altenative routes with the action group.</p> 
  <p>Mckenna said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They have indicated to us that they will give us a response later about whether they themselves will test this matter in the supreme court, or whether they will consider the alternative routes that we may be able to negotiate.</p> 
   <p>We understand that this is a significant anniversary</p> 
   <p>We’re not anti-protest. We facilitate thousands of protests, and in fact, in this particular group, we’ve been facilitating protests and public assemblies for the last two years. So it’s not a matter of us not wanting them to have a public assembly.</p> 
   <p>It’s not even a matter about it being at the Opera House itself. It’s about public safety.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Mckenna said organisers had estimated in their Form 1 that 10,000 people would attend. However, he said he was skeptical of the estimate, given how the number of people that marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in August vastly exceeded what organisers expected.</p>

  <p>Here’s more from that <strong>AAP report</strong> about <strong>Beaumont Lamarre-Condon</strong>’s court appearance today, and some background about his upcoming trial.</p> 
  <p>Last year, Lamarre-Condon became the first serving NSW police officer charged with murder in several decades after he was accused of shooting couple <strong>Luke Davies </strong>and <strong>Jesse</strong> <strong>Baird</strong>, at Baird’s Paddington home in Sydney’s east.</p>

  <p>For the first time since he was arrested, the words “not guilty” left Lamarre-Condon’s lips in open court today, as he was asked to answer to two counts of domestic violence-related murder.</p> 
  <p>He also pleaded not guilty to aggravated break and enter.</p> 
  <p>The 30-year-old appeared on screen from prison, wearing a green polo shirt and sporting facial stubble.</p> 
  <p>His trial will begin on 21 September 2026.</p>

  <p>Today, the <strong>Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee</strong> is discussing the government’s decision to offer about $3m to Australians affected by Centrelink’s unlawful debt calculation method.</p> 
  <p>People with unlawful debts of between $250 and $2,000 will receive $200, those between $2,000 and $5,000 will receive $400, and debts of more than $5,000 will receive $600.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">NSW psychiatrists to receive temporary 20% pay bump, commission decides</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) has handed down a decision finding the state’s psychiatrists will receive a temporary pay rise of 20% for a 12-month period.</p> 
  <p>The case comes after 200 psychiatrists threatened to resign in January, saying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/19/nsw-psychiatrists-threatening-to-resign-say-its-not-about-money-its-about-the-collapse-of-the-system">it was not about the money</a> but being unable to continue working in a system causing them moral injury, knowing they were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/28/my-daughter-was-involuntarily-admitted-to-a-psych-ward-in-nsw-i-saw-the-crisis-first-hand">providing substandard care to their patients</a> when one in three permanent psychiatrists positions were vacant.</p> 
  <p>The Australian Salaried Medical Officers’ Federation (Asmof), the doctors’ union representing the psychiatrists against NSW Health, argued that the special levy was necessary to avoid the “collapse” of psychiatric care in the state.</p> 
  <p>This morning Justice <strong>David Chin </strong>announced that a special case had been made out which justifies the payment of a temporary allowance for the purpose of attracting and retaining psychiatrists.</p> 
  <p>Chin said the psychiatrists would receive a “combined interim uplift of 20% for period of 12 months”.</p> 
  <p>He said this increase was including the 10%<strong> </strong>abnormal duties allowance paid to psychiatrists since 3 February, and that the increase would be absorbed into any increase in the general award for doctors across the state. Asmof was separately still in negotiations for a new award which would apply across all doctors working in the public sector.</p> 
  <p>The NSW government has said they will accept the IRC’s decision, whatever the outcome.</p>

  <p><strong>Millions of Australians eligible for 5% first home buyers scheme may be unable to afford repayments</strong></p> 
  <p>Millions of Australians eligible to take up the federal government’s new 5% deposit scheme could be unable to afford mortgage repayments, new analysis has shown.</p> 
  <p>Data compiled by the Parliamentary Library and commissioned by the Greens shows of the 3.8 million Australians in the top 10 most common professions in Australia, the vast majority would be unable to afford mortgage repayments on the median Australian home without falling into housing stress.</p> 
  <p>On Wednesday, the government expanded the scheme, which helps eligible first-time buyers get into the market with a deposit of as little as 5% by lifting borrowing limits and income caps.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The likelihood of finding a little boy lost in the outback is fading as family and searchers cling to hopes he has found shelter and is waiting to be rescued.</p> 
  <p>Defence personnel have joined the search for the four-year-old who has not been seen for almost a week.</p> 
  <p>August, known as Gus, went missing from his family’s sheep station in the remote South Australian mid-north on Saturday afternoon.</p> 
  <p>The only trace found of the preschooler is a tiny footprint in the dirt about 500 metres from the family homestead, which brought hope, but police now admit it “could have been there a week”.</p> 
  <p>“A four-year-old lad, they just don’t disappear into thin air,” Supt <strong>Mark Syrus</strong> said yesterday.</p> 
  <p>“Our job is to try and find which way he has gone and once we find those little clues, it gives us a bit of an idea.”</p> 
  <p>Searchers turned their efforts to the homestead area after the footprint was found, but no further clues were discovered.</p> 
  <p>The search was expanded as almost 50 Australian defence force personnel joined the operation.</p> 
  <p>Alone in searing temperatures and without food or water, authorities’ best-case is that Gus has crawled into shelter and is waiting to be rescued from the property near Yunta, about 300km north of Adelaide.</p> 
  <p>But hope is fading and police have prepared the family for the worst as the search shifts from a rescue to a recovery operation.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The former head of Australia’s submarine squadron has urged Australia against outsourcing boat construction overseas, as bureaucrats express confidence the US won’t scuttle Aukus.</p> 
  <p>A parliamentary inquiry yesterday ran the rule over the Geelong treaty, a 50-year Aukus cooperation agreement between Australia and the UK signed in July.</p> 
  <p>Under Aukus, the US has promised to sell at least three Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia from the early 2030s.</p> 
  <p>A submarine solution closer to home should be examined instead, retired navy rear admiral <strong>Peter Briggs</strong> argued.</p> 
  <p>“Depending on an overseas supply chain for such a critical capability as our submarines is a folly,” he told the inquiry.</p> 
  <p>Briggs had serious concerns with the plan, including limiting Australia’s commercial interests, and said the nation should build more submarines as it had done previously with the diesel-electric Collins class.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is no minimum protection in the treaty for a guaranteed work share for genuine Australian industry.</p> 
   <p>The Collins project has established a viable submarine supply chain within Australia.</p> 
   <p>We should build on this, not sign a treaty mandating it out of existence.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Briggs cast doubt Australia would receive submarines from the US on time, pointing to it falling behind in building its fleet.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The NSW Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) will this morning announce its decision whether the state’s psychiatrists will receive a 25% pay increase.</p> 
  <p>The doctors union, the Australian Salaried Medical Officers’ Federation (Asmof), representing psychiatrists, is arguing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/17/nsw-psychiatrists-arbitration-hearing-pay-conditions">psychiatric care in NSW is facing “collapse” because of poor pay and conditions</a>, and the special levy would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/18/nsw-psychiatrist-quit-when-workload-threatened-patient-safety-court-hears-ntwnfb">stem the flow of specialist doctors leaving the state’s public system.</a></p> 
  <p>In January, more than 200 psychiatrists threatened to resign, saying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/19/nsw-psychiatrists-threatening-to-resign-say-its-not-about-money-its-about-the-collapse-of-the-system">it was not about the money but being unable to continue working in a system causing them moral injury</a>, knowing they were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/28/my-daughter-was-involuntarily-admitted-to-a-psych-ward-in-nsw-i-saw-the-crisis-first-hand">providing substandard care to their patients</a> when one in three permanent psychiatrists positions were vacant.</p> 
  <p>In response, the mental health minister, <strong>Rose Jackson</strong>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/20/nsw-government-in-11th-hour-bid-to-postpone-mass-resignation-of-psychiatrists">submitted a request to the IRC to urgently arbitrate the dispute</a> and said the government would accept whatever its decision.</p> 
  <p>The hearing was supposed to take place across a single week in March but issues raised by NSW Health with Asmof’s expert evidence, and subsequently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/08/with-a-drip-in-his-arm-this-patient-came-out-of-a-sydney-hospital-to-support-striking-doctors">Asmof proceeding with statewide industrial action</a> against the IRC’s direction, saw the hearings delayed and only concluded in late June.</p> 
  <p>While over 60 psychiatrists have followed through on their resignations, other psychiatrists held off awaiting the outcome of the IRC decision. In the meantime before the outcome is announced at 9.15am, you can read our report on the hearing’s closing submissions in June:</p>
