<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s investigation into the criminal cases brought against him during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration">Biden administration</a>, including the special counsel prosecutions, will be overseen by a group of justice department officials who all have vested interests that could undercut even legitimate findings of misconduct by prosecutors.</p> <p>The new attorney general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a>, has taken steps in recent weeks to create the “weaponization working group” to carry out Trump’s day one <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/donald-trump-executive-orders-signed-list">executive order</a> directing the department to review possible abuses of the criminal justice system over the past four years.</p> <p>Bondi’s group, according to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1388506/dl?inline">her memo laying out its structure</a>, will be composed of the attorney general’s office, the deputy attorney general’s office, the office of legal policy, the civil rights division and the US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia as it examines cases that angered Trump.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/27/trump-cabinet-confirmations">Tracking Trump cabinet confirmations – so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The investigation is already politically charged because the group is tasked with sending reports to Trump’s deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, an arrangement that deputizes the justice department to the White House in an unusual way.</p> <p>But the involvement in various adversarial litigation against the Biden administration by the lawyers leading the five offices conducting the investigation – notably into former special counsel Jack Smith’s team that indicted Trump – give rise to a tangle of possible conflicts.</p> <p>The problem with conflicts is that they could undercut any conclusions finding impropriety even if they are colorable claims, such as the allegation that a top prosecutor once <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/lawyer-trump-valet-nauta-mar-a-lago-classified-documents-misconduct-allegation">tried to strong-arm a defense lawyer</a> into making his client give evidence to incriminate Trump.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/02/archive-zip/giv-45596rn0O9ngwSRp/" data-alt="Diagram of people related to the special investigation mandated by Donald Trump.

But some of those career attorneys were recently fired – and replaced in at least one instance by a lawyer who worked for Blanche when he defended Trump.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/02/archive-zip/giv-4559bonGlHINM33C/" data-alt="A diagram of conflicts of interest with those investigating Jack Smith.

Coincidentally, one of Miller’s lawyers during the investigations into Trump was John Rowley – who was also part of the Trump legal team.</p> <p>Also on the wider Trump legal team was Stanley Woodward, now serving as a top lawyer in the White House chief of staff’s office.</p> <p>Woodward was the lawyer pulled into a contentious meeting in 2022 convened by Jay Bratt, a senior prosecutor on the special counsel team who allegedly suggested Woodward’s application to be a DC superior court judge would be derailed if he did not convince his client, Trump bodyman Walt Nauta, to testify against Trump.</p>
