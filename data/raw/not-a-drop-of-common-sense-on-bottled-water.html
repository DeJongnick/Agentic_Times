<p>You report (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/09/harrogate-spring-water-planning-to-cut-down-wood-schoolchildren-bottling-plant">9 December</a>) that Harrogate Spring Water – owned by the multinational Danone, the world’s second-largest producer of bottled water – is planning to cut down a wood planted by schoolchildren in order to expand its bottling factory.
