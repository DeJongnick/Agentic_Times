<p>Manufacturers will press ministers today to resurrect plans for a high-speed rail line reaching Leeds and Manchester as part of a large strategic investment to get lorries off Britain’s roads and cut emissions.</p> <p>Business lobby group Make UK and Barclays Corporate Bank said research showed companies believe the move would significantly increase passenger numbers and free up capacity for rail freight on existing lines.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/09/hs2-already-billions-over-budget-with-work-just-over-halfway-done-says-rail-boss">HS2 already billions over budget with work ‘just over halfway done’, says rail boss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A survey of 200 manufacturers showed that nine in 10 believe the original <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9313/">high-speed rail line HS2</a> should still go ahead, while a similar number said there should be greater investment in faster connections between Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Hull and Newcastle.</p> <p>HS2 has suffered huge cost overruns and is being overhauled under new management. The transport minister, Heidi Alexander, said this year that problems with the line would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/17/reviews-show-tories-wasted-billions-of-pounds-on-hs2-transport-secretary-to-say">delay its opening beyond 2033</a>.</p> <p>Many of Labour’s regional mayors support moves to extend the line to Manchester to boost economic growth across the north of England.</p> <p>However, Keir Starmer, the prime minister, has indicated there is little cash available to extend HS2, even under “HS2-lite” plans that would have allowed for more capacity north of Birmingham.</p> <p>Verity Davidge, the director of policy at Make UK, said: “It’s clear that the current levels of rail capacity aren’t suitable for the levels of freight traffic the government is predicting in the future.</p> <p>“As a result, if industry is to make greater use of rail then we need the extra capacity which a high-speed link for passenger traffic would free up.</p> <p>“This would provide a valuable opportunity to invest in multi-mode hubs which would improve connectivity between our major ports and better integrate road and rail routes through the spine of the country.”</p> <p>The survey found that road is overwhelmingly the main mode of transport for nine in 10 manufacturers, with six in 10 regarding road investment as critical for their just-in-time operations. This compares with just under half (46%) for investment in ports and just under four in 10 for rail.</p> <p>Lee Collinson, the head of manufacturing, transport and logistics at Barclays UK Corporate Bank, said: “Upgrading and integrating our road, rail and port systems is crucial for boosting productivity, decarbonising transport and supporting long-term competitiveness.”</p>
