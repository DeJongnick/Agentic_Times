<p>Cory Singer, co-owner of the homebuilding firm Dolan Design &amp; Build, raced to start construction as quickly as possible in the wake of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california-wildfires">wildfires</a>. He was determined to stay ahead of the demand surge he saw coming and eager to help his clients begin to rebuild their lives.</p> <p>The firm broke ground in the Pacific Palisades on Saturday – one of the first companies to do so.</p> <p>But by that time, Singer had a new crisis to contend with: tariffs.</p> <p>Singer, whose firm is currently working on 10 homes in the Palisades, is in talks with clients to place shipping containers on their burned lots and store construction materials there, allowing him to order and stockpile materials in bulk before tariff price increases hit the market.</p> <p>“I’m definitely nervous,” he said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/apr/09/california-is-somewhere-else-art-exhibition">‘There’s so much beauty’: artists celebrate California in the wake of tragedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> announced, walked back and continually modified <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">tariff</a> policies in recent weeks, throwing the global stock market into chaos. The tariffs are widely expected to substantially increase construction costs in California and across the country.</p> <p>Singer is already dealing with tariff-related price hikes. One of his tile vendors placed a tariff surcharge on an order on 2 April, the same day the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs, even though the materials had already been imported. Singer is especially worried about materials like plumbing, tiles and fixtures, which are often imported from China, and he is advising clients to factor in a 10% contingency to their budgets in anticipation of the costs.</p> <p>“If you don’t spend it, great,” he said, “but at least mentally prepare.”</p> <p>Three months after the worst wildfires in Los Angeles’s recent history flattened miles of city blocks and killed 30 people, signs of life are emerging. Insurance payouts have begun arriving. Contractors have plastered streets in Altadena and the Palisades with flyers and signs advertising their services. The army corps of engineers is slowly clearing and flattening lots, replacing the charred and toxic mess of cars, washing machines and chimneys with the blank canvases of empty lots.</p>    <p>But homeowners, contractors, architects and developers across fire-ravaged Los Angeles are girding themselves for the tariffs. For homeowners seeking to rebuild, the tariffs add a new layer of stress to the uncertainties of navigating insurance, mortgages, short-term housing and piecing together plans for the future.</p> <p>The Trump administration is currently levying a 10% tariff on most countries, a 25% tariff on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/trump-steel-aluminum-tax">steel, aluminum</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/trump-new-car-tariffs">cars and car parts</a>, and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/president-trump-administration-news-updates-today">125% tariff on Chinese goods</a>. The administration on Wednesday retreated on further planned global hikes after news of the tariffs prompted trillions in stock market losses worldwide, but Angelenos remain uncertain about what this means for their homes and plans.</p> <p>In Altadena, a middle-class neighborhood with fewer resources than the wealthy Palisades, the strain is especially acute. Homeowners worry tariffs will hinder their ability to afford rebuilding and exacerbate already widespread issues with underinsurance.</p> <p>“It’s really scary,” said Ken Yapkowitz, a longtime Altadena resident who lost his home and two rental income properties in the Eaton fire.</p> <p>Yapkowitz is waiting to see what his final insurance payouts will be and starting to map out how to rebuild his properties. He had already been factoring in a 25% bump in materials costs before the tariffs were announced, he said, and figured there would be a surge in demand for materials and labor. He expects tariffs to add substantial costs, and wonders if he will be able to rebuild on his lots as planned.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/children-los-angeles-wildfires">Her home and school burned down in the LA fires.

But he worries that tariffs, paired with a painfully slow permitting process and other soaring costs, will cause them to change their minds. He has three clients in the process of drawing up plans with architects, but many others have called him for estimates only to disappear.</p> <p>“By the time people are ready to start construction, I believe the prices are going to be higher,” he said. Flores has noticed the prices of lumber, copper and roofing tick up in recent months. But he can’t afford to stockpile materials, he said, and has no place to store them even if he could. He has no choice but to wait and see what happens.</p> <p>“I think that’s the case for most of us contractors in the area,” Flores said.</p> <p>Following the tariffs’ announcement, the California governor, Gavin Newsom, asked his administration to pursue independent trade relationships with other countries and to explore ways to protect access to construction materials in the wake of the California wildfires. But he did not specify what measures the state could deploy to do that.</p> <p>Flores, the contractor, said he doubted that the governor’s office could actually rein in prices.</p> <p>Newsom’s office did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <h2>‘We just don’t know right now’</h2> <p>Some residents and business owners are already seeing the tariffs affect wildfire response. Brett Taylor, an Altadena resident who owns a local window and door supplier and who lost his home in the Eaton fire, said his suppliers mostly manufacture domestically, but that many of them source parts from abroad. In late March, he contacted approximately 10 window vendors to ask whether they would be open to providing package discounts to fire victims. Almost all of them said yes.</p> <p>But before the deals could be finalized, the administration announced tariffs. At least one of Taylor’s vendors walked back their commitment, citing price uncertainty, and Taylor anticipates others will do the same in coming days.</p>    <p>Others are tapping personal connections and devising makeshift plans to try to defray costs. James Peddie, an Altadena realtor who lost his home, has been helping develop plans for a group of homeowners hoping to rebuild collectively. He knows from his years in construction that a substantial portion of southern California’s lumber is imported from Canada, and when tariffs were announced, he understood that meant increased costs.</p> <p>Peddie went to high school in Montana, and has friends in the lumber industry there. He also knows a builder who personally went to Oregon to source lumber when prices soared during the rebuilding of Paradise, California, after the devastating 2018 Camp fire.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/us-wildfires-cities-dangers">Millions of Americans believe they’re safe from wildfires in their cities.

They promised to keep their commissions low and to keep him updated on price fluctuations. “They’re people I can trust,” he said. “We can probably get the lumber for a really good deal.”</p> <p>This shift – from purchasing overseas to domestically – is exactly what the administration hopes the tariffs will prompt.</p> <p>But with the rebuilding process still in its earliest phases, and plans and permits far from finalized and approved, it felt premature to put a deposit down and commit to the lumber, Peddie said. Doing so would mean needing to find and pay for long-term storage, as well as betting that the cost of lumber was only going to increase.</p> <p>“Where is it going to be stored? Is it going to be more expensive to ship it in?” he said. “We just don’t know right now.”</p> <p>He estimated it would be seven months before he would be ready to order. It is anyone’s guess what the tariff landscape – and market – would look like by then.</p>
