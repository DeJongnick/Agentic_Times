The plan is to reach out to other networks to achieve similar agreements.”</p> <p>Both One America News and Newsmax are openly partisan channels that work to elect Republican candidates and support Trump.</p> <p>Voice of America was known for its rigorously non-partisan journalism and provided news and information to countries where independent reporting is rare or impossible.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-689d24948f082e195c5b84d6" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-14T00:51:39.254Z">1.51am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">EJ Antoni, Trump's pick to oversee job numbers, was at the Capitol on January 6</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The White House <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-bureau-labor-statistics-nominee-ej-antoni-jan-6-bystander-rcna224645?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma&amp;taid=689d1a8050292000018197a0&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">confirmed to NBC News</a> on Wednesday that <strong>EJ Antoni</strong>, the conservative economist <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has chosen to run the Bureau of Labor Statistics, was in the crowd of Trump supporters that surrounded the Capitol on January 6 2021.</p> <p>A man of Antoni’s appearance, wearing a red varsity jacket, was caught on video posted on the conservative social network Parler walking through the crowd of Trump supporters massed outside the west side of the Capitol about 10 minutes before the mob broke through police lines and into the building.</p> <p>That video, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/parler-capitol-videos/?id=nkL4Fpk5C8U1">archived by ProPublica</a>, shows the man in what appears to be a varsity jacket with the University of Pennsylvania crest on it walking away from that entrance to the Capitol at about 1.51 pm that day.</p> <p>According to NBC News, the man also appears in other footage recorded on the east side of the Capitol building during the riot.</p> <p>Approached for comment by NBC News, the White House confirmed that the man in the images was Antoni.</p> <p>“These pictures show EJ Antoni, a bystander to the events of January 6th, observing and then leaving the Capitol area,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers wrote to NBC News. “EJ was in town for meetings, and it is wrong and defamatory to suggest EJ engaged in anything inappropriate or illegal.”</p> <p>Antoni, who attended a Catholic high school and then St Charles Borromeo Seminary in the Philadelphia suburbs, likely has family links to the University of Pennsylvania, which is also Trump’s alma mater.</p> <p>The economist’s full name, given on <a href="https://www.niu.edu/commencement/_pdf/aug-dec-2020-program.pdf">a commencement program</a> from Northern Illinois University, is Erwin J Antoni III.

But some of the biggest news came out of the far-reaching press conference he held after announcing this year’s honorees (which include ‘Rocky’ star and fervent Trump supporter <strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump promised ‘very severe consequences’ if Vladimir Putin doesn’t agree to ceasefire at their Friday meeting in Alaska. </strong>He didn’t, however, elaborate on what those penalties will be. He also floated the idea of a trilateral summit with Volodymyr Zelenskyy <strong>“almost immediately”</strong> after his individual meeting with Putin.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The president said that he’s eyeing an extension of the initial 30-day limit for the federal takeover of the DC Metropolitan Police. </strong>“I don’t want to call national emergency. If I have to I will. But I think the Republicans in Congress will approve this pretty much unanimously,” Trump said. He added that any discussions about DC statehood are <strong>“ridiculous”</strong> and <strong>“unacceptable”</strong>.</p></li> <li><p>When it comes to the surge of federal law enforcement on DC streets, <strong>a White House official said 43 arrests were made on Tuesday night</strong> –<strong>twice the total of the previous evening</strong>. More than 1,450 officers participated, about half of which were from the city’s police department, while only 30 national guard troops were deployed of the roughly 800 that defense officials have said are expected to arrive for the mission.</p></li> <li><p>The city’s Democratic mayor, <strong>Muriel Bowser</strong>, has sought a cordial working relationship with the president since his return to the White House, but changed her tone on Tuesday, urging residents and voters during a social media event <strong>“to protect our home rule and get to the other side of this guy and make sure we elect a Democratic House so that we have a backstop to this authoritarian push”</strong>.</p></li> <li><p>At his Kennedy Center appearance today, the president continued to disparage <strong>Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell</strong>. “He’s truly incompetent,” Trump said. He went on to reveal that he’ll be naming the nomination for Powell’s replacement “sometime in the next week”. He’s down to “three of four names,” he added. <strong>A reminder that Powell’s term ends in May</strong>.</p></li> <li><p>Additionally, on the foreign diplomacy front, <strong>the president took part in a virtual meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders today</strong> which the German chancellor described as <strong>“very good”</strong> and <strong>“constructive”</strong>. Zelenskyy confirmed that <strong>Trump would call him straight after the Friday meeting with Putin</strong> to talk it through details.</p></li> <li><p>And finally, for now at least, a federal appeals court <strong>lifted</strong> <strong>a lower court’s injunction that required the state department to continue making payments to foreign aid contractors</strong>.

My name is Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news.</p> <p>We start with the news that <strong>Donald Trump will be visiting the Kennedy Center on Wednesday, the same day that the recipients of this year’s honors are announced</strong>.<br><br>Trump avoided the Kennedy Center Honors during his first term after artists said they would not attend out of protest. This year, he has taken over as the Kennedy Center‘s new chair and fired the board of trustees, which he replaced with loyalists.<br><br>In a Truth Social post Tuesday, Trump teased a name change for the performing arts center and said it would be restored to its former glory, AP reported.<br><br>“GREAT Nominees for the TRUMP/KENNEDY CENTER, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, AWARDS,” Trump wrote. He said work was being done on the site that would be “bringing it back to the absolute TOP LEVEL of luxury, glamour, and entertainment.”<br><br>“It had fallen on hard times, physically, BUT WILL SOON BE MAKING A MAJOR COMEBACK!!!” he wrote.<br><br>It is unclear how this year’s batch of honorees were chosen, though Trump had indicated he wanted a more active role. Historically, a bipartisan advisory committee selects the recipients, who over the years have ranged from George Balanchine and Tom Hanks to Aretha Franklin and Stephen Sondheim. A message sent to the Kennedy Center press office asking how this year’s honorees were selected wasn’t returned Tuesday.<br><br>The Kennedy Center did post this on social media, however: “Coming Soon ... A country music icon, an Englishman, a New York City Rock band, a dance Queen and a multi-billion dollar Actor walk into the Kennedy Center Opera House ...”</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The DC national guard began deploying on the city’s streets Tuesday night,</strong> a day after Trump ordered their arrival and took control of the city’s police force, calling Washington DC a “lawless” city, despite official crime statistics saying otherwise.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to immediately improve conditions at a New York City immigration holding facility</strong>, acting on mounting complaints from detainees that the cells are overcrowded, unsanitary and inhumane.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Texas Senate approved a GOP-drawn congressional map that would give Republicans five more House seats ahead of the 2026 midterms. </strong>But since House Democrats continue to break quorum, the legislation isn’t going anywhere. Speaker Dustin Burrows said the House will adjourn until Friday, at which point the legislature will attempt to reach quorum one more time.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump is due to speak with European leaders, including Volodymyr Zelenskyy, today ahead of Friday’s meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin. </strong>Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt characterised Friday’s meeting between Trump and Putin as a “listening exercise” for the president, confirming that Zelenskyy would not be in attendance, but the president has hopes for a trilateral meeting in the future.
