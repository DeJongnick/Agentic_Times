<p>A student who was booked on the Air India flight to London Gatwick that crashed on Thursday missed boarding the plane by 10 minutes due to traffic.</p> <p>Bhoomi Chauhan, a Bristol-based business administration student, was on holiday in western India and had booked to travel home on flight AI171.</p> <p>However, the 28-year-old was turned away by airline staff after arriving at Ahmedabad airport less than an hour before the flight was due to depart.</p> <p>The plane crashed into a medical college shortly after takeoff, killing 241 people onboard. A British man, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/saw-people-dying-british-survivor-describes-air-india-plane-crash">sole survivor</a>. At least five medical students were also killed and about 50 injured, and there are fears the number of people killed on the ground could rise.</p> <p>Chauhan had checked in online and was assigned the economy-class seat 36G. She arrived at the airport at 12.20pm local time, 10 minutes after boarding was scheduled to start.</p> <p>She told the BBC’s Gujarati service: “We got very angry with our driver and left the airport in frustration … I was very disappointed. We left the airport and stood at a place to drink tea and after a while, before leaving … we were talking to the travel agent about how to get a refund for the ticket. There, I got a call that the plane had gone down.”</p> <p>The student said it was a miracle that she had missed her flight, having been caught in traffic in Ahmedabad city centre after travelling from Ankleshwar, about 120 miles south of Ahmedabad.</p> <p>She said: “When I missed the flight, I was dejected. [The] only thing that I had in mind was: if I had started a little early, I would have boarded the plane. I requested airline staff to allow me inside as I am only 10 minutes [late]. I told them that I am the last passenger and so please allow me to board the plane, but they did not allow me.”</p> <p>Investigations are continuing into the cause of the crash, the first involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner.</p> <p>The Foreign Office said any British nationals requiring consular assistance or who had concerns about family or friends should call 020 7008 5000.</p>
