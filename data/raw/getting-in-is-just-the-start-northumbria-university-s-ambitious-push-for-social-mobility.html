<p>From support for an outreach centre that helps children as young as seven with their schoolwork to academics researching the <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/new-book-outlines-why-basic-income-could-be-the-solution-to-poverty-and-inequality/" rel="nofollow">benefits of a universal basic income</a>, a commitment to driving social mobility and tackling inequality is deeply ingrained in <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/university-strategy/?sc_camp=&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=advertorial&amp;utm_campaign=ccrm-ex_25_news_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x&amp;utm_term=socialmobility_universitystrategy_theguardiancampaign_25&amp;utm_content=qr-code" rel="nofollow">Northumbria University’s DNA</a>.</p> <p>Participation in higher education remains lower in the north-east of England than in other parts of the country, and while Northumbria has an impressive record on access – <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/a-pathway-to-university-for-all/" rel="nofollow">40% of its students</a> come from areas with low rates of higher education participation, the highest of any research-intensive university – it’s constantly striving to ensure students from all backgrounds can excel.</p> <p>For vice-chancellor <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/leadership-governance/university-executive/vice-chancellor-and-chief-executive/" rel="nofollow">Prof Andy Long</a>, what makes Northumbria stand out is its recognition that social mobility for universities is not just about students getting in – the business of “widening participation” – but getting on: making sure they have all they need to do well both in their studies and when they graduate.</p>    <p>Long has set an <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/university-strategy/vice-chancellors-intro/?sc_camp=&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=advertorial&amp;utm_campaign=ccrm-ex_25_news_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x&amp;utm_term=socialmobility_universitystrategyvicechancellors_theguardiancampaign_25&amp;utm_content=qr-code" rel="nofollow">ambitious new target</a>: making sure that by 2030, students from low-participation backgrounds are just as likely as any of their peers to be in highly skilled work or further study 15 months after they graduate.</p> <p>“It’s no good just chipping away at the gap in outcomes,” he says. “We want to eliminate it.”</p> <p>That means making sure courses are taught flexibly in a way that fits around other demands students may be juggling, such as caring responsibilities or doing part-time work to support themselves. Students facing extra challenges, such as care leavers or caregivers, are given additional support through schemes such as <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/study-at-northumbria/support-for-students/student-inclusion-and-success/nu-belong/?sc_camp=&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=advertorial&amp;utm_campaign=ccrm-ex_25_news_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x&amp;utm_term=socialmobility_studentinclusion_theguardiancampaign_25&amp;utm_content=qr-code" rel="nofollow">NU Belong</a> or the <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/alumni-association/giving-to-northumbria/?sc_camp=&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=advertorial&amp;utm_campaign=ccrm-ex_25_news_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x&amp;utm_term=socialmobility_alumniassociation_theguardiancampaign_25&amp;utm_content=qr-code" rel="nofollow">Higher Education Without Barriers</a> fund.</p> <p>Most important for Long is a drive to include meaningful experiential learning – learning by doing – in every programme, so students who may have no links with the world of work associated with their studies have the opportunity to realise they could flourish in it.</p> <p>Final-year law students, for instance, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/shaping-futures-driving-change/2025/jun/13/real-world-university-impact-justice-local-business">work alongside a qualified solicitor from the student law office</a> doing pro bono work in the community, while business school students act as “consultants” for local companies.</p> <p>“I’ve spoken to law students who will tell me they don’t know anyone who works in the legal profession,” Long says. “Our approach ensures they can make those links that then give them the experience and confidence to think they could pursue it as a career.”</p> <p>When it comes to raising aspirations, Northumbria’s <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/study-at-northumbria/information-for-schools-and-colleges/nu-allstars/?sc_camp=&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=advertorial&amp;utm_campaign=ccrm-ex_25_news_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x&amp;utm_term=socialmobility_nuallstars_theguardiancampaign_25&amp;utm_content=qr-code" rel="nofollow">Allstars</a> guidance programme offers outreach sessions at schools across the north-east and priority access to university taster days and scholarships. And in 2021, Northumbria worked with the charity <a href="https://intouniversity.org/" rel="nofollow">IntoUniversity</a>, together with Newcastle University, to open <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/alumni-association/giving-to-northumbria/intouniversity/?sc_camp=&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=advertorial&amp;utm_campaign=ccrm-ex_25_news_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x&amp;utm_term=socialmobility_intouniversity_theguardiancampaign_25&amp;utm_content=qr-code" rel="nofollow">the region’s first IntoUniversity centre</a>, where seven to 18-year-olds experiencing disadvantage can get support with academic work, university applications and more, plus opportunities such as visits from employers, mentoring and work experience.</p> <p>This centre, in Newcastle’s east end, has worked with more than 2,000 students so far – with 64% of leavers going on to higher education – and a second centre, in Gateshead, will open in September.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ryderarchitecture.com/" rel="nofollow">Ryder Architecture</a>, a long-term partner of the university, supports IntoUniversity through Northumbria’s <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/alumni-association/giving-to-northumbria/?sc_camp=&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=advertorial&amp;utm_campaign=ccrm-ex_25_news_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x&amp;utm_term=socialmobility_alumniassociation_theguardiancampaign_25&amp;utm_content=qr-code" rel="nofollow">Higher Education Without Barriers</a> fund, and offers work experience and workshops with its people.</p>    <p>Managing director Mark Thompson says: “IntoUniversity helps us put more structure around our work with school-age children and young people, and links it to an outcome too, where students are actively encouraged to consider university. Anything that inspires somebody to push themselves academically and want to do more has to be a good thing.”</p> <p>The company, which helped Northumbria University develop its <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/study-at-northumbria/courses/master-of-architecture-degree-apprenticeship-dtpara1/?sc_camp=&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_medium=advertorial&amp;utm_campaign=ccrm-ex_25_news_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x&amp;utm_term=socialmobility_degreeapprenticeships_theguardiancampaign_25&amp;utm_content=qr-code" rel="nofollow">architecture degree apprenticeship</a>, has put colleagues through the course, and has provided work placement opportunities for Northumbria students across the business. “We do well out of it as well,” says Thompson, who studied at the university back when it was Newcastle Polytechnic. “There’s a business benefit to unearthing people on our doorstep who might otherwise go into different careers.”</p> <p>At <a href="https://bedeacademy.org.uk/" rel="nofollow">Bede academy</a>, a local school in Blyth, Northumberland, and longtime Allstars partner, Northumbria University has been instrumental in the development and delivery of a <a href="https://bedeacademy.org.uk/new-t-level-course-to-encourage-young-people-into-health-careers/" rel="nofollow">new T-level course in health</a>. The course is equivalent to three A-levels and designed as an alternative route to university and careers in the NHS and social care.</p> <p>As well as supporting the school with the design of the curriculum and upskilling staff to deliver the course, Northumbria helped create a brand new <a href="https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/about-us/news-events/news/healthcare-training-facility-opens-to-support-delivery-of-new-t-level-course/" rel="nofollow">healthcare training facility</a> that simulates a hospital environment, giving students hands-on experience.</p>    <p>“Northumbria have been absolutely phenomenal in supporting us,” says the school’s principal, Andrew Thelwell, who pays tribute to the university’s “strong moral purpose” around social mobility. “We can’t speak highly enough of their dedication, commitment and passion.”</p> <p>But it’s not just about the facilities, Thelwell says – or even the professional workplace uniforms the university provides that are worn proudly by the students every day. “Our students are working alongside university staff at the age of 16 or 17, and building professional relationships with them,” he says. “They start to see themselves heading towards university – it becomes something very real for them. And that really is transformative.”</p> <p>The first cohort of students are now finishing their first year, and the vast majority are expected to apply for university places. Northumbria will provide support with that process too, and the school is now exploring future partnerships around sports education.</p> <p>It’s clear that the university recognises the important role it plays in transforming lives in all aspects of its work, with Northumbria’s dedication to addressing inequality extending to its research too.
