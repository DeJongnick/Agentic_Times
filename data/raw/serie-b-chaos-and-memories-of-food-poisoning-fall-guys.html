<h2><strong>FOOD FOR THOUGHT</strong></h2> <p><em>“Real Gs move in silence like lasagne” –</em> Lil Wayne, 2011.</p> <p>With the transfer window opening, closing and opening again, it might surprise you to learn that the domestic season in Italy, specifically in Serie B, is not yet over. The relegation playoff to decide who falls into the Italian third tier rages on, with Sampdoria – who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/15/sampdoria-relegation-serie-c-first-time">originally had been automatically relegated</a> following a dismal season – given a late reprieve after Brescia were docked points for financial irregularities. Samp and playoff opponents Salernitana are now slugging it out for survival, which feels a little too accurate in the latter’s case now that the southern side have got a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/16/salernitana-serie-b-relegation-playoff-sampdoria-food-poisoning">serious case of food poisoning</a> after a 2-0 first-leg defeat in Genoa on Sunday. Twenty-one of Salernitana’s players and staff have been struck down with illness, a large part requiring hospital treatment upon disembarking from their flight in Salerno. Salernitana have called for an investigation into the “causes of this widespread and serious episode”.</p> <p>“We are truly shocked by what happened and by the series of events that risk jeopardising Salernitana’s smooth and peaceful approach to the final and crucial minutes of the season,” said club suit Maurizio Milan, putting a smooth and peaceful shine on his side’s disastrous first-leg defeat. “Many players and staff, at the moment, are not even able to show up at the sports centre to resume training.” There is no suggestion of foul play or that it was a dodgy lasagne (no, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jan/20/the-knowledge-kevin-lasagna-and-other-footballers-with-tasty-dishes-for-surnames">not Kevin</a>) that was to blame, but it does give us an opportunity to revisit the biggest food-poisoning scandal on English soil in recent years: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/08/newsstory.sport2">lasagne-gate</a>.</p> <p>Tottenham, shock, were the fall-guys on that occasion as almost the entire squad fell ill on the eve of their last game of the 2005-06 Premier League season at West Ham. Spurs’ depleted and deteriorating squad would lose 2-1 the following day, bitterly handing Big Cup qualification to arch-rivals Arsenal in perhaps the most famous example of St Totteringham’s Day. “While the gaffer [Martin Jol] was giving his team talk before the game, players were being sick in the toilets,” Jermaine Jenas later wrote. Spurs’ players had dined in a private room at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/09/sport.lifeandhealth">the five-star London Marriott West India Quay Hotel</a> and sat down to a buffet of steak, chicken and pasta prepared by the hotel chef on the advice of the club’s nutritionist. By 5am many were ill with diarrhoea and vomiting, and club officials asked for the police to be called. However, after the hotel’s general manager said no other guests were affected and the kitchens and food preparation areas were given the all-clear, fan forums went into overdrive as to the cause of the food poisoning. “We had 10 players in bed,” sobbed Jol. “Then we asked the Premier League to postpone the kick-off for three hours until six o’clock and that wasn’t possible.”</p> <p>Serie B officials have acted with a little more compassion, granting Salernitana a postponement with Friday’s second leg now moved to Sunday after medical documents were produced by the club and a criminal complaint filed with prosecutors. Sure, Football Daily might have a soft spot for Sampdoria and obviously cannot confirm or deny that we were preparing sandwiches for a flight out of Genoa airport on Sunday, but we would absolutely hate to see another important Italian match influenced by off-pitch matters. Here’s hoping Salernitana’s players and staff make a full recovery.</p> <h2><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></h2> <p>“There was no way to simply buy water. You could go to a beer-only stand but there were no water stands and no extra water stations” – John Celmins is one of a number of fans in Pasadena <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/17/club-world-cup-fans-dangerous-conditions-rose-bowl-california-heat-water">recounting their grim experiences of water shortages</a> at Sunday’s game between PSG and Atlético, which kicked off at midday in brutally sweltering conditions and featured Fifa’s trademark directive on banning bottles with any contents taking precedence over the Rose Bowl’s usual rules.</p>    <h2><strong>FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS</strong></h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Nice contrast regarding football management IQ in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/16/club-world-cup-opening-weekend-football-daily-newsletter">yesterday’s Football Daily</a>. The Copa Gianni had PSG and Atlético kick off on Sunday at noon under the California sun. Meanwhile, six miles away, the Angel City (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/15/angel-city-immigrants-shirt-soccer">AKA Immigrant City</a>) match on Saturday sensibly started at 7pm local time. Much better for the players, the supporters, and the game in general, no?” – Mike Wilner.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Just a thought about the ongoing debate around the Club World Cup and player welfare. How about – borrowing from the format of Ryder Cup Sunday – every player has to play a certain amount of time (updated for each round)? It would be fascinating to watch each manager use their entire squad rather than rely on their first team, and ensure some rest for all” – Nick Hewat.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’m surprised that ‘Hugh Lloris’ is a goalkeeper for LAFC (yesterday’s News, Bits and Bobs, full email edition). I would think he’d be a coach, as he is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__G4RrlGmVk">a proven experienced manager</a>. This means that when LAFC faces the Seattle Sounders in MLS, Lloris and <a href="https://www.mlssoccer.com/players/stefan-frei/">the opposing goalkeeper</a> combine to offer A Bit of Frei and Lloris” – Dan Davis.</p> </blockquote> <p>Please send your letters to <a href="mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com?utm_term=684ae7ed553b7e9725c5aebbe2906314&amp;utm_campaign=TheFiver&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=fiver_email">the.boss@theguardian.com</a>. <strong>Today’s winner of our letter o’ the day competition is </strong>… <strong>Dan Davis</strong>,<strong> who gets some Football Weekly merch.
