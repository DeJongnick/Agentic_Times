The school district has said that was done as a result of a student-led process and that the bathroom had 12ft-tall partitions (3.6 meters) for privacy and security.</p> <p>The school district later added a second all-gender restroom on the same floor, which it said was meant to address concerns of unfairness. At the time, it said that students would continue to have access to gender-specific restrooms and single-stall, all-gender bathrooms.</p> <p>The education department said it was giving the school district a chance to voluntarily make changes, including converting multi-stall, all-gender bathrooms back to ones designated by gender, within 10 days or risk unspecified enforcement action.</p> <p>It also wants the district to use biology-based definitions for the words “male” and “female” in all policies and practices related to Title IX and to rescind any policies or guidance allowing students to use bathrooms based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex.</p> <p>Craig Trainor, the acting assistant secretary of the department’s civil rights office, referred to the Denver school district’s policies as an endorsement of “self-defeating gender ideology”.</p> <p>Denver public schools officials said they had received the results of the investigation and were “determining our next steps”.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-29T00:01:46.139Z">at 1.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b0cc1c8f08f1b70dab9a2d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-28T22:29:11.415Z">11.29pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Thiel ally named to lead CDC is not a doctor, or a scientist of any kind</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>When <strong>Susan Monarez</strong> was confirmed by the Senate as CDC director <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1191/vote_119_1_00445.htm">less than a month ago</a>, she was the first non-physician to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/history/pastdirectors.html">since 1953</a>, and only the second ever to not be a medical doctor.</p> <p>But Monarez holds a doctorate in microbiology and did postdoctoral work in immunology at Stanford University school of medicine.
