<p>Rolls-Royce pressurised water reactors have powered British nuclear subs since 1966, but small modular reactors (SMRs) aren’t yet proven at scale anywhere on land (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/rolls-royce-uk-small-nuclear-reactors-smr-sizewell-c">Rolls-Royce named winning bidder for UK small nuclear reactors, 10 June</a>). Only three are operating worldwide: two in Russia, one in China. Argentina is constructing the world’s fourth; is Labour simply keen to keep up with historical geopolitical rivals (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station-ed-miliband-investment">Sizewell C power station to be built as part of UK’s £14bn nuclear investment, 10 June</a>)?</p> <p>The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) reported actual <a href="https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/SMRs%20Still%20Too%20Expensive%20Too%20Slow%20Too%20Risky_May%202024.pdf">cost overruns of 300% to 700%</a> for all four projects. Rolls-Royce claims costs of <a href="https://www.foundation.org.uk/getattachment/49f7f99c-6cde-46f5-867e-faf48a9759c3/rolls-royce-smr-fst-15jun2022.pdf">£35 to £50 per MWh</a>; so should we triple this? The government says the SMR project would create 3,000 new low-carbon British jobs, but at what cost? The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, can’t know the true costs yet, and three reactors doesn’t scream “economies of scale”.</p> <p>Yet £2.5bn is already 10 times more than Great British Energy has invested into simple, cheap rooftop solar, which democratises energy savings. The true cost of renewables must consider intermittency and balancing costs, but why not invest more in flexibility through distributed renewables and grid-scale storage? And what of energy security? SMRs may mitigate against Putin snipping offshore wind cables, but increased reliance on imported uranium, and a heightened nuclear waste security threat, are significant risks.</p> <p>Last May, the <a href="https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/SMRs%20Still%20Too%20Expensive%20Too%20Slow%20Too%20Risky_May%202024.pdf">IEEFA concluded</a> that SMRs “are still too expensive, too slow and too risky”, and that we “should embrace the reality that renewables, not SMRs, are the near-term solution to the energy transition”. Has this truly changed? The climate crisis requires scaling all feasible solutions as fast as possible, but, with limited capital, we should prioritise those that make economic sense today.<br><strong>Laurie Hill</strong><br><em>MBA student, Cambridge Judge Business School</em></p> <p>• As Nils Pratley says, Great British Energy’s budget has been nuked to divert funding away from local energy initiatives (11 June). But let’s get away from the idea that SMRs are a cutting-edge technology. Rolls-Royce is proposing a 470MW reactor, the same size as the first-generation Magnox reactors. Their “small” modular reactor, if it ever emerges, will use the familiar method of generating a lot of heat in a very complex and expensive manner, in order to boil water and turn a turbine. It will bequeath yet more radioactive waste to add to the burden and risk at Sellafield.</p> <p>In the meantime, if government SMR funding continues, it takes money away from opportunities for cutting-edge technical and social innovation, discovery and training all around the country, as schools, hospitals, community groups, network operators and all of us get to grips with renewables-based systems. This sort of innovation is necessary, it’s already benefiting us and it needs full-on government support rather than uneasy compromises with an increasingly redundant nuclear industry.<br><strong>Sarah Darby</strong><br><em>Emerita research fellow, Environmental Change Institute</em></p> <p>• I’m a Scot who moved to the US in 1982. I returned to the UK seven years ago. In my time in the US, I worked with a few contractors as a chemist and health and safety manager on a number of environmental clean-up projects, chemical, biological and nuclear. The nuclear clean-up sites I worked on directly and indirectly were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/15/us-government-nuclear-waste-doge">Hanford</a> in Washington state, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/22/new-us-refuge-rocky-flats-plutonium-toxic">Rocky Flats, Colorado</a>.</p> <p>The multibillion-dollar Hanford cleanup is ongoing. Most of the problems there are as a result of gross mismanagement of nuclear waste during the cold war. </p> <p>I very much believe in wind, solar and other environmental solutions to energy production. I am cautiously supportive of small‑scale nuclear energy, but outraged by this government’s failure to include the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nuclear-provision-explaining-the-cost-of-cleaning-up-britains-nuclear-legacy/nuclear-provision-explaining-the-cost-of-cleaning-up-britains-nuclear-legacy#latest-estimate">costs of the disposal of past</a>, current and future nuclear waste in its support of “cheap energy”.</p> <p>Has Ed Miliband taken into account future waste management issues? Google Hanford cleanup to see the real expense. Can we trust this and any future government to protect the environment, public health and the taxpayer from future&nbsp;nuclear “cost overruns”?<br><strong>Peter Holmyard</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>• The more I read about the government’s nuclear intentions, the more it sounds like HS2 all over again, ie another financial boondoggle. Where are the detailed costings? What is our experience with cost overruns, eg at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/06/starmer-nuclear-watchdog-regulations-delays-reactors">Hinkley Point C</a>? What is the overseas experience with pressurised water reactors (the kind proposed for Sizewell C) at Olkiluoto, at Flamanville, at Taishan? Uniformly bad in all cases, actually. </p> <p>No matter which way you look at this, viz the future cost overruns, the facts that we consumers will be&nbsp;on the hook for them, that reactors are never constructed on time, that nuclear wastes are unaudited, that we have to import all our uranium, that the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in 2023 that renewables are <a href="https://x.com/dorfman_p/status/1802289974944944407?lang=en-GB">10 times better</a> than nuclear at lowering carbon emissions, all point to a remarkably poor decision by the government, sad to say.<br><strong>Dr Ian Fairlie</strong><br><em>Independent consultant on radioactivity in the environment; vice-president</em><em>, </em><em>Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
