<p>A caveat to any good news about roles for older women (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/07/hollywood-female-characters-over-40-demi-moore-jodie-foster-nicole-kidman">Demi, Jodie and Nicole: is Hollywood finally ready to recognise complex female characters over 40?, 6 January</a>), the Golden Globes were a depressing line-up of emaciated women with plastic faces.

I’ve happy memories of taking refreshments there when walking the Pennine Way. I got locked in my local leisure centre on Saturday.

They’re close to the M40 and could provide a wizard attraction. <br><strong>Elaine Steane</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>• On Monday, I had my first Creme&nbsp;Egg of 2025. Still delicious, and still&nbsp;the same size!<br><strong>Jane Gregory</strong><br><em>Emsworth, Hampshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
