 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The foreign minister, <strong>Penny Wong</strong>, is speaking to Sky News, reiterating comments by the prime minister that the government welcomes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/15/gaza-ceasefire-deal-agreed-between-hamas-and-israel-qatari-pm-says">the ceasefire deal made in Gaza</a>:</p>

  <p>Domestically, Wong also says the ceasefire is an opportunity to turn down the temperature on the conflict.</p> 
  <p>She called out the opposition leader, <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, and the Greens leader, <strong>Adam Bandt</strong>, saying they both have a role in toning down their language.</p>

  <p><strong>Greens call for a Minister for disability inclusion</strong></p> 
  <p>Greens Senator <strong>Jordon Steele-John</strong> says the appointment of Amanda Rishworth to the NDIS portfolio, on top of her social services portfolio, was a “missed opportunity”.</p> 
  <p>The Greens spokesperson for disability rights says a minister for disability inclusion, rather than a minister for the NDIS was a recommendation of the royal commission into violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of disabled people.</p> 
  <p>Steele-John wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A Minister for Disability Inclusion would be responsible for improving the lives of all disabled Australians – not just those who are eligible for the NDIS.</p> 
   <p>A Minister for Disability Inclusion would enable us to have the cross-government action we need to improve the lives of disabled people across all areas of life.</p>

  <p><strong>Man charged after allegedly fraudulently inheriting $4.5m estate</strong></p> 
  <p>A man will face court today with allegedly creating a fraudulent will, to inherit a $4.5m estate in Wollongong.</p> 
  <p>Strike Force Sarina investigated the 38-year-old man, who has been charged with 27 offences, including making a false document to obtain financial advantage, and making a false document to obtain property.</p> 
  <p>Police allege the fraud involved four homes and two bank accounts.</p> 
  <p>Officers in Wollongong received a report of a break in at a home in January 2024, which was an unoccupied deceased estate.</p> 
  <p>In September 2024, strike force officers located documents under a search warrant at the home, which they say included an original will.</p> 
  <p>Yesterday a second search warrant was executed at the same address, where officers allegedly found two rifles, four gel blasters, ammunition, methylamphetamines, cash, three motor vehicles, a jetski and a motorcycle.</p> 
  <p>The man was refused bail to appear in Wollongong local court today.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A woman has been charged with torture after she allegedly gave prescription medicines to a one-year-old girl without medical approval for months, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Police allege the 34-year-old gave the child, who is known to her, unauthorised prescription and pharmacy medicines between August and October 2024.</p> 
  <p>The woman allegedly disregarded medical advice and went to lengths to get unauthorised medicines to give to the child, including old medications for a different person that were available at the house.</p> 
  <p>The woman filmed and posted videos to social media of the child while she was in “immense distress and pain”, police say. The videos were allegedly used to entice monetary donations and increase online followers.</p> 
  <p>Police say she concealed her efforts to give the child medicine until it was reported to police by hospital staff in Brisbane’s south when the little girl was admitted in October.</p> 
  <p>After officers were alerted to the allegations, they tested the child for unauthorised medication which returned a positive result on 7 January.</p> 
  <p>Detectives went to a home, southeast of Brisbane, and arrested the woman today. She has been charged with five counts of administering poison with intent to harm, three counts of preparation to commit crimes with dangerous things, and one count each of torture, making child exploitation material and fraud.</p> 
  <p>The 34-year-old will face Brisbane Magistrates Court tomorrow.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Rail, Tram and Bus Union</strong> has responded to the state government’s indication it would apply to stop protection industrial action under the Fair Work Act, labelling this a “desperate attempt to shift the blame for its own failure to negotiate with workers.”</p> 
  <p>The union said the government has “failed to engage in a single bargaining meeting” for 44 days, and “continues to drag its feet and refuse to negotiate in good faith.” The statement from the union continued:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If the NSW government truly cared about its essential workers … it would have come to the table long ago with a fair offer for these important workforces. Instead, it engages in cheap political tricks designed at achieving headlines, pays law firms top dollar to bring bogus legal cases, and anything else it can to avoid sitting at the bargaining table.</p> 
   <p>Now, instead of negotiating, the government is scapegoating rail workers, blaming them for economic disruption they themselves caused. The real cost to the economy isn’t the industrial action—it’s the government’s refusal to negotiate a fair deal.</p> 
   <p>The workers of NSW are asking for basic, fair wages, safer conditions, and job security … The longer the government refuses to take this seriously, the longer this dispute will drag on.</p>

  <p><strong>Greens issue statement on ceasefire deal: ‘welcome and overdue’</strong></p> 
  <p>Greens leader <strong>Adam Bandt</strong> and foreign affairs spokesperson <strong>Jordan Steele-John</strong> have released a statement on the ceasefire deal – which they described as “welcome and overdue”.</p> 
  <p>The pair said over the past 15 months “we’ve witnessed unimaginable tragedy as Gaza – an area half the size of Canberra with a population of more than two million – has been invaded and tens of thousands of people have lost their lives.”</p> 
  <p>The Greens are want Labor to call for a permanent ceasefire “that sees the end of the occupation of Palestine by the state of Israel”, and to end the two-way arms trade between Australia and Israel.</p> 
  <p>The party is also calling on Labor to sanction members of the Israeli government “directly involved in war crimes”, and for Australia to “formally intervene” on behalf of South Africa at the ICJ and commit to uphold ICC warrants.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is a testament to the millions of people who have peacefully protested week-on-week over the past year, including here in Australia, that we’re seeing news of a ceasefire today …</p> 
   <p>We must ensure international humanitarian law is upheld and those who have committed war crimes are held to account. And we must recognise the right to self-determination, the statehood of Palestinians, and the right of both Palestinians and Israelis to live in peace.</p>

   <p>Today’s softening jobs figures provide yet more evidence of the need for an urgent rate cut.</p>

  <p>The New South Wales premier, <strong>Chris Minns</strong>, is addressing the media amid the train disruptions across the state.</p> 
  <p>He said nearly 2,000 services were cancelled across the network yesterday, and today more than 1,000 were expected to be cancelled:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Now you think about the economic activity that has been smashed as a result of that massive, wide-scale industrial action, and think about the incalculable cost on the NSW economy, of having a major international city’s public transport system completely rendered, or next to rendered, useless.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Minns said the government would make an application in the Fair Work Commission to end protected industrial action and move to an arbitrated decision by the Fair Work umpire:</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We will ask for that decision to be expedited and made urgently by the commission, and we’re hopeful that the commission could step in at this point and end wide scale industrial disruption that’s affecting hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Authorities have provided an update on the fatal house fire in Truganina, in Melbourne’s west, overnight (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jan/16/australia-news-live-sydney-train-delays-storm-damage-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-adam-bandt-election-campaign?page=with:block-678822e18f08f12e25241670#block-678822e18f08f12e25241670">you can read more earlier in the blog here</a>).</p> 
  <p>A Victoria police spokesperson said a 27-year-old woman called triple zero just after 2am, saying she was trapped in the three-storey townhouse – where she was housesitting. She lost her life.</p> 
  <p>They said a vehicle had parked in the vicinity of the address and alleged that accelerant was poured inside the home, which engulfed the premises.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I know the question is going to be the why, and that’s something we’ll have to work through. It’s very early days. What I can say is this: This individual is completely innocent and should not have died. We have no history on this individual, nor the family.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Police speculated the alleged offenders may have targeted the wrong address, “which is nothing short of a tragedy.” He said the investigation would be complex:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I hope for the family’s sake, we can bring this to a conclusion to give a sense of comfort. Unfortunately, what I would say to the offenders, whether they meant this or not, we are investigating a homicide now …</p> 
   <p>[She was the] type of girl who doesn’t leave home very much. You know, probably her first time really away and by herself. <strong>House-sitting for her brother who is on a honeymoon, and she’s been subjected to the most appalling, despicable act one could imagine.</strong></p>

  <p>The Executive Council of Australian Jewry has welcomed news of a ceasefire in the Middle East, saying Australia’s Jewish community is relieved and eager to see the return of Hamas-held hostages.</p> 
  <p>The ECAJ president, <strong>Daniel Aghion,</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For the past 15 months, we have watched in dismay as civilian hostages have been held and used as a bargaining chip to achieve Hamas’ evil ends.

  <p>The ECAJ is Australia’s peak body representing the Jewish community. Aghion continued:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is still the question of Hamas control of Gaza, which will need to be dealt with if the Palestinians are to have any chance of self-determination in the Gaza Strip.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The man accused of killing missing Victorian woman <strong>Samantha Murphy</strong> has pleaded guilty to drink and drug driving, months before the alleged murder.</p> 
  <p><strong>Patrick Stephenson</strong>, 24, appeared in the Ballarat magistrates court this morning via video link. He was fined $2,500 for drink and drug driving charges related to a single-vehicle motorcycle crash in October 2023.</p> 
  <p>Stephenson allegedly returned a blood-alcohol reading of .148 and tested positive for MDMA after he fell off his motorcycle in Ballarat, the court heard.</p> 
  <p>Two of the five charges had been withdrawn, with Stephenson pleading guilty to the remaining charges for the single-vehicle motorcycle crash, which also included careless driving.</p> 
  <p>Stephenson’s defence lawyer, <strong>Moya O’Brien</strong>, said Stephenson had attended an AFL grand final party on the day of the crash.</p> 
  <p>Magistrate <strong>Guillaume Bailin</strong> imposed a total fine of $2,500, with conviction, for the three charges.</p> 
  <p>In November, Stephenson pleaded not guilty to the murder of Murphy, opting to have the case fast-tracked to the Victorian supreme court.</p>

  <p><strong>Mortgage holders brace for jobs data</strong></p> 
  <p>The latest Australian jobs data is due out late morning, and the results will help determine whether there is an interest rate cut next month.</p> 
  <p>Given core inflation has been drifting towards the Reserve Bank’s 2-3% inflation target, a resilient labour market has emerged as one of the major hurdles to a rate cut.</p> 
  <p>In other words, the Reserve Bank is looking for signs of a weakening jobs market before stimulating the economy through a lower cash rate.</p> 
  <p>Australia’s jobless rate recorded a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/12/australia-unemployment-rate-november-abs-interest-rates-inflation">surprise drop in November to 3.9%</a>, amid robust employment growth. Economists expect that growth continued in December, with an additional 15,000 jobs, while the unemployment rate could tick slightly higher to 4%.</p> 
  <p>If the figures come in stronger, a rate cut will be less likely next month while weaker than expected numbers will fuel calls for interest rate relief.</p> 
  <p>Before the December data, investors are pricing in a 73% chance of a quarter percentage point rate cut to 4.1% when the RBA board next meets in February.</p> 
  <p>Weaker jobs data would typically weigh on the Australian dollar, which has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/03/why-is-the-australian-dollar-falling-and-what-does-it-mean-for-interest-rates-travel-and-the-economy">under pressure</a> this year.</p>

  <p><strong>Ceasefire deal welcome, but fails to address systemic issues: Apan</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>Australia Palestine Advocacy Network</strong> has welcomed the “long-overdue” ceasefire deal in Gaza, but says it is far from sufficient – and “fails to address the systemic issues of Israel’s genocide, illegal occupation, and apartheid”.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, Apan said the international community, including Australia, “must ensure this ceasefire is not merely a temporary pause” in attacks from Israel:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Without an arms embargo, sanctions, and mechanisms to ensure accountability and liberation for Palestine, a ceasefire will be little more than a bandage over an open wound.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Apan president, <strong>Nasser Mashni</strong>, said a ceasefire is a “fleeting reprieve that will never undo the profound pain caused by Israel’s genocide, nor will it, alone, prevent the next wave of bloodshed”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The ceasefire must not be a smokescreen for complacency. Australia must rise to this moment by cutting all military ties with Israel, imposing sanctions and holding Israeli officials and entities accountable in international courts.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>More than 46,000 Palestinians have been reportedly killed in the conflict, which has caused a humanitarian catastrophe and laid waste to most of Gaza’s infrastructure. The international court of justice is studying claims that Israel has committed genocide.</p> 
  <p>About 1,200 Israelis were killed on 7 October 2023, and another 250 taken hostage. One hundred were freed in exchange for 240 women and children held in Israeli jails in a ceasefire deal struck in November 2023 that collapsed after a week.</p>

  <p>Outgoing minister and former opposition leader, <strong>Bill Shorten, </strong>will begin his new role as vice-chancellor of the University of Canberra (UC) next Monday after a tumultuous few months for the institution.</p> 
  <p>The UC has been in the midst of ongoing restructuring and redundancies, with dozens of courses cut and around 50 positions axed to make up for financial shortfalls.</p> 
  <p>The acting chancellor at UC, <strong>Patricia Kelly</strong>, said the it was an honour to welcome Shorten to the university:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>His values of providing opportunity to all and reducing inequalities were clearly reflected in his most recent role as the minister for the NDIS Scheme and Government Services. His passion for equity for all sits perfectly with UC’s vision to be the most accessible university in Australia.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Shorten said it was a “pivotal time”, not only for the University of Canberra, but for the higher education sector more broadly:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I will work collaboratively with the University Council and community to chart a course for a sustainable and successful future and continuing excellence in education and research. UC is a small university but our impact is big, particularly in the ACT region, which we serve as a priority.</p>

   <p>We need to get serious about this, because the police need every tool to make sure that this stops, because innocent people, including women who are turning up to work at supermarkets, are the subject of these horrible, horrible incidents.</p> 
   <p>These incidents are more and more prevalent and we need to do everything that we can to take the knives out of the hands of these young [people] who have no business whatsoever in carrying knives into a shopping centre or into a playground or into a school.

 <h2 class="block-title">PM announces small cabinet reshuffle</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, has announced a small reshuffle of his cabinet before the retirement of the NDIS minister, <strong>Bill Shorten</strong>.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/14/rishworth-tipped-to-take-over-ndis-from-shorten-in-pre-election-cabinet-reshuffle">As we flagged on Tuesday,</a> the social services minister,<strong> Amanda Rishworth</strong>, will take the reins of the NDIS from Shorten, who is quitting politics to become vice-chancellor of the University of Canberra.</p> 
  <p>Rishworth was widely considered the logical choice to succeed Shorten given she already has oversight of policy for disabled Australians who aren’t on the NDIS.</p> 
  <p>The case to merge the NDIS and social services portfolios is strengthened by the fact Rishworth is responsible for the new system outside the NDIS – known as “foundational supports” – that will be rolled out to ease the burden on the disability scheme.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, Rishworth said the NDIS is “critical for our nation and I am honoured to continue the important work of its reform”.</p> 
  <p>The early childhood education minister, <strong>Anne Aly,</strong> has been handed extra responsibilities assisting Rishworth with the huge task of reforming the fast-growing NDIS.</p> 
  <p>The finance minister, <strong>Katy Gallagher</strong>, will take on the government services portfolio.</p> 
  <p>Shorten’s retirement opened up a spot in Albanese’s cabinet, which will be filled by the aged care minister, <strong>Anika Wells</strong>. Albanese said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I am proud to lead a strong, united and stable cabinet government focused on delivering for Australians now, while building Australia’s future.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The ministers will be sworn into their new roles at a ceremony at Government House in Canberra on Monday morning.</p> 
  <p>The opposition leader, <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>,<strong> </strong>is also preparing a pre-election reshuffle to replace retiring frontbenchers <strong>Simon Birmingham </strong>and <strong>Paul Fletcher.</strong></p>

  <p>The Greens have released a $6.8bn plan for the public school system as part of their election commitment to fully fund the sector by midyear.</p> 
  <p>Under the plan, the Greens would increase the commonwealth’s share of spending on public schools from 20% to 25% by July and abolish a Morrison-era loophole that allows states and territories to deduct 4% of non-classroom costs from their funding contribution.</p> 
  <p>Labor has committed to a 2.5% increase to 22.5%, while remaining in a standoff with the largest states over who should fit the remainder of the bill.</p> 
  <p>The Greens would also create a $1.25bn capital grants fund for public schools, which are currently ineligible for ongoing infrastructure funding, and fund airborne hazard risk reduction measures in all classrooms with a $388m “safer classrooms” program.</p>

  <p><strong>Bandt says he wants alliance with Labor to keep Dutton out of lodge</strong></p> 
  <p>As promised earlier, we have an exclusive interview with Greens leader <strong>Adam Bandt</strong> in which he pins his colours firmly to the mast in saying that he wants an alliance with Labor to keep <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> out of the Lodge.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There’s a real opportunity in the next parliament, with all of the commentators predicting a minority government, to have a golden era of progressive reform. </p> 
   <p>A minority parliament can keep Peter Dutton out and get those progressive reforms that I think will set the country up for generations.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Hope for prospective home buyers, Domain says, as price increases slow</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The autumn selling season could be the best time for prospective homeowners to get a foot on the property ladder as house prices hit peak affordability, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Annual property price increases have slowed to their lowest levels in Australia since September 2023 as affordability pressures and limited borrowing power take their toll on demand, Domain’s house price report for the December quarter shows.</p> 
  <p>Softer clearance rates and more listings were giving buyers more of a choice and helping to take away urgency from their purchasing decisions, said the Domain chief of research and economics, <strong>Nicola Powell</strong>.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are seeing a rapid slowdown across pretty much all of our capital cities. We’ve got stable pricing, some cities in decline and those that are rising, they’re not rising as fast as they were.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>House prices across the capital cities grew at 1.1% over the last three months of 2024, slower than the average of recent years but maintaining the markets’ positive growth streak of eight consecutive quarters.</p> 
  <p>Sydney, the country’s most expensive property market, was the only capital to go backwards, with median house prices declining $1,300 over the quarter.</p>

  <p><strong>Wages for low-and-middle income earners growing at higher rates under Albanese government</strong></p> 
  <p>Wages for low and middle-income earning Australians are growing at higher rates under the Albanese government than previous Coalition governments, a new Labor analysis of wage growth rates shows.</p> 
  <p>Wages for those earning under $54,000 rose 6.2% on average between June 2022 and September 2024 while Labor was in government, while it rose 2.4% between September 2013 and June 2022, the analysis showed.</p> 
  <p>In higher incomes, or those earning more than $125,000, wages rose 3.3% on average over the 27-month period while incomes rose 1.9% on average between 2013 and 2022.</p> 
  <p>Overall, Labor’s analysis showed wages, on average, had risen 3.8% between June 2022 and September 2024 compared with 2.2% between September 2013 and June 2022 while Coalition governments were in power.</p> 
  <p>The treasurer, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, said Australians are doing it tough but it would be worse under the opposition leader, <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The choice at the next election is between a Labor government which has been creating jobs, getting wages moving again and rolling out cost-of-living help versus a Coalition that wants Australians working longer for less.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">NSW mental health minister to meet doctors</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The NSW mental health minister will today meet with representatives of the psychiatrist workforce as the impending resignation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/15/half-of-the-psychiatrists-in-nsws-public-service-are-preparing-to-resign-heres-why">more than half the state’s specialist mental health doctors comes into effect next week.</a></p> 
  <p>There are 443 psychiatrist positions in NSW Health, of which there were already 30%-40% pre-existing vacancies, in addition to which at least 205 are set to resign from 21 January.</p> 
  <p>The doctors are resigning because they say they cannot continue to work in the understaffed mental health system, arguing they need higher pay and better conditions in line with other states to retain more staff, but the government says they cannot agree to their demand for a 25% pay rise.</p> 
  <p>The mental health minister, <strong>Rose Jackson</strong>, said she hopes meeting today with the doctor’s union, the Australian Salaried Medical Officers’ Federation (Asmof), as well as the NSW branch of the peak body for psychiatrists, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, could offer “an opportunity for discussion, perhaps an opportunity for a path forward.”</p> 
  <p>In a press conference Asmof held on Wednesday, an emergency doctor said they stood in solidarity with their psychiatrist colleagues because the state’s mental health services are “on the brink of a collapse, this isn’t a crisis any more”.</p> 
  <p>Psychiatric trainee Dr <strong>James Leader </strong>said being physically unable to provide the care to mental health patients is causing “moral injury” to doctors in the public hospitals. “The system is forcing us to compromise in ways that we do not want to.”</p>

  <p><strong>Overnight wrap of Sydney train chaos</strong></p> 
  <p>As people start planning their journeys – or maybe just starting planning a WFH day – here’s our overnight report on the Sydney Trains chaos.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sydney braces for more train disruption</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Our reporter <strong>Mostafa Rachwani</strong> is out and about and will be bringing us some updates on the train situation very soon.</p> 
  <p>But in the meantime, this is the statement from Sydney Trains last night warning about disruption today:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>All suburban and Intercity trains will return to their stabling yards by midnight to help Sydney Trains manage the ongoing severe impacts of today’s industrial action, as this evening’s severe weather also takes out more services across the network. </p> 
   <p>The decision has been taken to assist the return of the fleet wherever possible, to be ready to run from their home stabling yards on Thursday morning. </p> 
   <p>It means train services will progressively reduce frequency from around 9pm to ensure all trains would be in their assigned locations before the last service, which typically ends at 1am each weekday.</p> 
   <p>Sydney Trains is <strong>forecasting another heavily degraded day on the network from early Thursday</strong> when passengers will again face lengthy delays, service cancellations and large service gaps as a result of over 350 bans that have been notified.</p> 
   <p>Passengers should also be aware that tonight’s wild storms have caused trees to fall on overhead wiring at <strong>Normanhurst</strong> and <strong>Bell</strong>, and caused power outages at <strong>Lidcombe</strong>, <strong>Cabramatta</strong> and <strong>Flemington</strong>, multiple signal/track failures at <strong>Shellharbour Junction</strong> and flooding at <strong>Town Hall</strong>, which have all had varied impacts to services. </p> 
   <p>During Wednesday, 1,500 services were cancelled up until 7.30pm as a result of industrial action, approximately 40% of all Sydney Trains timetabled services.</p> 
   <p>With more than 350 work bans in place across the network as part of the Combined Rail Unions industrial action, we urge passengers to delay non-essential travel, use alternative forms of public transport, and plan ahead by checking the latest updates on <a href="http://transportnsw.info/">transportnsw.info</a> and live travel apps.</p> 
   <p>Where possible, NSW TrainLink booked passengers are contacted via SMS to alert them to changed travel arrangements.</p> 
   <p>Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink apologise to our passengers again for the disruption and thank them for their understanding as staff at the Rail Operations Centre and across the network work to minimise the impacts of this difficult industrial period.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m <strong>Martin Farrer</strong> with some of the top overnight stories before <strong>Emily Wind</strong> comes along shortly.</p> 
  <p>The chaos across Sydney’s train network caused by industrial action yesterday is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/16/sydney-train-turmoil-set-to-worsen-as-residents-warned-of-lengthy-delays">expected to worsen today</a>, as a standoff over a new pay deal between rail unions and the New South Wales government drags on. Train bosses warned passengers last night that today would be “another heavily degraded day on the network” with “lengthy delays, service cancellations and large service gaps as a result of over 350 bans that have been notified”.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/15/sydney-hit-by-severe-electric-storm-causing-flooding-and-transport-chaos">Last night’s severe storm</a> in the greater Sydney area will only make matters worse, Sydney Trains warned, after flooding hit Town Hall station concourse, brought down trees on to lines and caused power cuts. We’ll have updates on both the trains and the storm damage soon.</p> 
  <p><strong>Adam Bandt</strong> says a Greens-Labor power-sharing parliament could see a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/16/bandt-says-labor-greens-power-share-would-bring-golden-era-and-confirms-goal-is-to-stop-dutton">“golden era of progressive reform”</a> as he confirms that stopping <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> becoming prime minister is now his party’s main election focus. However, the Greens leader faces a challenge on his own doorstep as the former AFL player and failed Melbourne lord mayoral candidate <strong>Anthony Koutoufides</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/16/anthony-koutoufides-afl-player-independent-government-run-adam-bandt-greens">considers a tilt at Bandt’s seat</a>.</p> 
  <p>Annual property price increases have slowed to their lowest levels since September 2023 as affordability pressures and limited borrowing power take their toll on demand, according to a new report from Domain. It echoes the findings of a recent CoreLogic study and offers some hope for prospective buyers – and for federal ministers hoping the housing crisis will ease before the election. They will also hope for good news from today’s unemployment numbers due at 11.30am. More coming up.</p>
