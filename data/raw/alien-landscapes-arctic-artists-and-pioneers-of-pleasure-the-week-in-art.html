His works are created using flies regurgitating a mixture of coloured paint and sugar water on to canvasses. After he lost his home and entire archive in the California wildfires earlier this year, his work has taken on a new perspective. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/14/john-knuth-art-flies-new-york-exhibition">Read more here</a>.</p> <h2>What we learned</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jul/12/historys-most-devastating-document-of-war-the-simple-yet-graphic-details-of-the-bayeux-tapestry">The Bayeux tapestry is the most engaging depiction ever made of a mighty battle</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/13/virtual-beauty-exhibition-somerset-house-london">AI, social media and virtual identities are transforming our understanding of beauty</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jul/15/london-arts-centre-to-amplify-global-majority-voices-and-urgent-questions">A new 10,000 sq ft London arts centre aims to spotlight global majority voices</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/14/please-do-touch-sculpture-exhibition-curated-by-blind-people-to-feature-tactile-works">A show of tactile art curated by blind people aims to challenge ‘ocularcentrism’</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/16/london-underground-tube-line-corporate-transport-for-london">Plans for the corporate rebranding of a London tube line dismayed our critic</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jul/17/no-barriers-to-entry-george-the-poet-reframes-art-world-for-young-people-with-immersive-exhibition">Podcaster George the Poet joined an initiative to make masterpieces more accessible</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/17/angelus-millet-life-on-the-land-national-gallery-london-modern-art">Jean-François Millet’s masterpiece The Angelus electrified modern art</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/17/photographer-paz-errazuriz-dare-to-look-hidden-realities-chile-mk-gallery-milton-keynes">Photographer Paz Errázuriz’s tender images outraged Chilean society</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/17/sculpture-in-the-city-bloomberg-space-review-ai-weiwei-wilson-sabin">A new art trail through the City of London is full of echoes of ancient ritual</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2> <p><strong>The Shore at Egmond-aan-Zee by Jacob van Ruisdael, circa 1675</strong></p>    <p>Seaside views from the 17th century are rare. It shows how precocious Dutch art and life were in the 1600s that Van Ruisdael depicts people visiting the shore for fun – strolling on the sands, enjoying the strong sea breeze, flirting to the splash of the waves. Of course, they don’t strip off and swim – the figures in the water are fishing folk. Sea bathing wouldn’t become fashionable until about a century later, and the hedonism of modern beach life would gradually appear in art, from impressionist Normandy to Picasso and Matisse on the Riviera. All of that lies in the future here – and to be honest those looming clouds don’t augur well for a day at the seaside. But these beachgoers are pioneers of pleasure.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/jacob-van-ruisdael-the-shore-at-egmond-aan-zee">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in </strong><strong>touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
