<p>The NBA tips off this week with Australia’s two biggest basketball names – Ben Simmons and Patty Mills – without a roster spot for the first time in a decade.</p> <p>Their absence signals a changing of the guard, as Boomers’ backcourt duo Josh Giddey and Dyson Daniels emerge as key starters for playoff aspirants, with recently signed nine-figure contracts making them some of Australia’s highest sporting earners.</p> <p>But they are not alone. Fourteen Australians are set to compete for minutes around the league, ranging from veteran centres Jock Landale and Duop Reath, emerging wings in Johnny Furphy and Josh Green, to intriguing draftees like Tyrese Proctor and Rocco Zikarsky.</p> <h2>Josh Giddey out to prove himself</h2> <p>After protracted negotiations with the Chicago Bulls, Giddey finally signed his rookie extension worth $US100m ($153m) over four years last month. It’s a huge contract for the Melburnian, but in NBA terms it is cheap for Giddey’s position and profile as a lead playmaker. The reluctance for Chicago’s front office to pay top dollar means the 23-year-old enters this season with much to prove.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/28/chicago-bulls-vs-la-lakers-nba-josh-giddey-buzzer-beater-upset">‘Never done that before’: Josh Giddey hits half-court buzzer-beater as Bulls stun Lakers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having been traded by Oklahoma City at the start of last season, Giddey watched as his old team stormed to the NBA championship without him. As the Bulls look to make the playoffs in the weaker Eastern Conference, he will need to demonstrate his shooting and defence are starter-worthy or else he may fall back towards the NBA’s fringe.</p>    <h2>Dyson Daniels eyes another step</h2> <p>Daniels signed the same deal as Giddey this week, and after his most-improved player award last season, the Hawks guard’s career has taken off in Atlanta following his departure from the Pelicans. He is now lauded as one of the league’s best perimeter defenders, and led the league in steals with three per game – more than one whole takeaway per match higher than the tally of second place.</p> <p>Playing next to flamboyant Trae Young in Atlanta, the 22-year-old can be successful this season as a secondary ballhandler and elite defender as long as the Hawks make the playoffs. But if he can elevate his three-point shooting, which was below league average last year, and continue to develop his passing and driving, Daniels could become one of the league’s most versatile players.</p> <h2>Johnny Furphy on highlight watch</h2> <p>Pacers wing Furphy has emerged as a fan favourite in Indiana following a succession of highlight-reel dunks in pre-season. His acrobatics prompted NBA personality Pat Beverley to describe him as the “best white dunker we’ve seen in a while”, and an invite to the mid-season dunk contest could be on the table.</p> <p>After playing just eight minutes per contest over 50 games in his rookie campaign, the former Maribyrnong College student is in contention for a Pacers rotation that might lean towards youth following injury to lead guard Tyrese Haliburton.</p>    <h2>Tyrese Proctor an outside shot</h2> <p>Guard Proctor fell in the June draft all the way to the 49th pick, where Eastern Conference contenders Cleveland picked him. The Cavs are favourites to make the NBA finals from the East, so it would be rare for a rookie taken in the second round to see much court time. But the Sydney product has seen minutes in pre-season, and his NBA-ready shot gives him a chance to contribute.</p> <h2>Minutes crunch looms for veteran quintet</h2> <p>Veteran centre Jock Landale has a chance to secure the starting centre position in Memphis given highly-touted Zach Edey will miss the start of the season after ankle surgery.</p>    <p>In Portland, Duop Reath is the veteran backup to young centres Donovan Clingan and Yang Hansen, but could play consistent minutes if the Blazers find themselves competitive. His teammate Matisse Thybulle is likely to be used as a defensive spark off the bench.</p> <p>In Charlotte, Josh Green’s off-season shoulder surgery has left him without a timeline to return. The 24-year-old still has a contract for next season, but won’t want to give his teammates at the rebuilding Hornets too much of a head start. And injury has already slowed Dante Exum, who has a knee complaint and has missed key pre-season opportunities in Dallas.</p> <h2>Australian NBA players on the fringe</h2> <p>Then there are those who are unlikely to see much, if any, court time this season. Thirty-eight-year-old Joe Ingles is back in Minnesota, but appears to be little more than a big brother keeping Anthony Edwards in check.</p> <p>Rocco Zikarsky is likely to be developed by Minnesota Timberwolves through their G-League team. Fellow rookies Lachlan Olbrich in Chicago and Alex Toohey for the Golden State Warriors are also in the slow cooker, while the more seasoned Luke Travers will be hoping to win minutes alongside Proctor for the Cavs.</p> <h2>Ben Simmons and Patty Mills fish for a deal</h2> <p>If there were any doubts Mills was set to retire, he answered them with a workout video posted on his social media over the weekend, showing the 37-year-old remains sharp and focused on securing another NBA contract.</p> <p>What Simmons is thinking is anyone’s guess after an off-season in Australia, going fishing and playing with a Sherrin. Although he took to Instagram last month to reject suggestions he was retired, the 29-year-old – an All Star as recently as 2021 – has yet to surface.</p>
