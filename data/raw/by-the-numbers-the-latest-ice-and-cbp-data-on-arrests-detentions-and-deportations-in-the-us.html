<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> campaigned on a platform of mass deportation. Since he took office, his administration has reshaped immigration enforcement across the country. The Guardian US, using data published every two weeks by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (ICE), is tracking the number of people the administration has arrested, detained and deported.</p>

<h2>Notes on the data</h2> 
<p>ICE publishes <a href="https://www.ice.gov/detain/detention-management">detention statistics</a> for the current fiscal year every two weeks. The Guardian US has been archiving each release of detention management statistics since January 2025 and received older releases from the Vera Institute for Justice. We calculated the number of people arrested, detained and deported during each reporting period by scraping data from each release and comparing the totals with previous releases.</p> 
<p>The data for ICE arrests comes from the ICE Initial Book-Ins by Arresting Agency and Month: FY2025 table. Arrest figures may be an undercount because ICE reports only arrests that result in someone entering ICE detention.</p> 
<p>Detention totals come from the ICE Currently Detained by Criminality and Arresting Agency: FY2025 table. Deportations come from the ICE Removals: FY2025 table.</p> 
<p>The Guardian US did not visualize the first data release of FY2025. The first release of each year includes carryover data from the previous fiscal year and includes more than two weeks of arrests and deportations.</p>
