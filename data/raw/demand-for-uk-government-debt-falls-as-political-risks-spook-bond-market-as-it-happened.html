Although Starmer is unpopular and the government’s approval ratings are through the floor, a change of leadership could exacerbate the UK’s fiscal problems even more. 10-year bond yields are higher by more than 5 bps today, 30-year yields are also rising. Although global bond yields are rising, the UK is the outlier, and is a major underperformer compared to our peers.</p> <p>Andy Burnham’s rhetoric of nationalizing utilities and questioning why the government needs to be in ‘hock’ to the bond market, has awoken the bond market vigilantes. After protecting Rachel Reeves’ job earlier in the summer, the bond market could save the day for Kier Starmer. The problem with Burnham’s rhetoric is that the UK government needs to be very aware of the bond market, because we have a budget deficit, which has been exacerbated by Labour’s current spending plans. His agenda could widen the deficit and push up borrowing costs even more, which is why bond yields are rising on Thursday.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/sep/25/co-op-cyber-attack-cost-it-80m-profits-loss-government-support-jlr-suppliers-business-live-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68d524ba8f08af03abbe7b4e#block-68d524ba8f08af03abbe7b4e">The weak demand for UK debt </a>is another reason Labour should swerve Andy Burnham, <strong>Brooks</strong> adds:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Burnham and his leadership bid comes at a bad time for the UK’s bond market. This week has seen weak demand across debt auctions. For example, today’s 9-year debt auction saw demand fall to 2.9 times the amount on offer, down from 3.22 in July. This is not disastrous, but it suggests that sentiment towards UK debt remains fragile.</p> <p>Stronger yields and better than expected economic data has boosted the dollar on Thursday, which is now the top performer in the G10 FX space, reversing earlier losses.

But it would be technically difficult, because the carmaker does not have significant spare warehouse space to store extra parts, which are supplied in huge volumes.</p> <p>Such a scheme would also be based on the idea that JLR has not suffered a permanent loss of sales due to the shutdown. The scale of any government purchase could be “very significant”, ITV News said.</p> </blockquote> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/24/government-looks-at-buying-up-jaguar-land-rover-parts-to-protect-jobs-suppliers-cyber-attack">Government looks at buying up Jaguar Land Rover parts to protect jobs at suppliers</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The agenda</h2> <ul> <li><p>8.30am BST: Switzerland interest rate decision</p></li> <li><p>1.30pm BST: US weekly jobless figures</p></li> <li><p>1.30pm BST: US trade data for August</p></li> <li><p>3pm BST: US existing home sales for August</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-25T12:00:18.833Z">at 1.00pm BST</time></p>  </div>
