<p>Good morning. The Greens and the Australian Christian Lobby – typically polar opposites in political debates – have set aside their long-held animosity to push for a clampdown on late-night pokies in NSW.</p> 
<p>As Israel and Hamas prepare to discuss Donald Trump’s peace plan, new polling suggests that a majority of Australians would support the imposition of tough sanctions on Israel over its relentless attacks on Gaza.</p> 
<p>Feathers will fly as voting opens in this year’s bird of the year poll. Plus: Brisbane celebrates a rugby league double crown, Ange Postecoglou’s Nottingham Forest woes continue, and Oscar Piastri’s F1 title hopes have taken a dent at the Singapore Grand Prix.</p>

<p>Amid growing threats to Sydney’s urban tree canopy, the NSW government is expected to introduce new legislation, including bigger fines, later this year in an attempt to curb illegal tree destruction. It comes as some councils and advocates call for even stiffer punishments – including jail time for serious offences. So, Penry Buckley asks, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/06/australia-tree-wars-need-new-solution">do Australia’s “tree wars” need a new solution</a>?</p>

<p>With his grandmother Djandjay having passed away, it only felt right to Aria-winning rapper Baker Boy that he name his sophomore record after her. “She was the reason I fell in love with hip-hop,” he says. Djandjay is also the name of a Yolŋu octopus spirit that guides souls forward. And that means guiding audiences towards new expressions of his art: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/06/baker-boy-interview-new-album-djandjay-named-for-his-grandmother">an album containing his most overtly political music yet</a>.</p>
