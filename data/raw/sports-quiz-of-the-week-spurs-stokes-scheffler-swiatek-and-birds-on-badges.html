    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - Fulham have come close on a couple of occasions, losing the FA Cup final in 1975 and the Europa League final in 2010. They did win the Intertoto Cup in 2002 (along with two other clubs) but that doesn’t count. , 2:B - And Wigan also did it by beating Manchester City 1-0 in an FA Cup final., 3:B - The opening game of the competition, between France and Ireland, has been brought forward to Thursday 5 February to avoid a clash with the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Milan the following day., 4:D - Chelsea won a domestic treble without losing a game. However, they more than met their match in the Champions League semi-finals, where they were hammered 8-2 on aggregate by Barcelona., 5:B - Umeå​ were one of the most successful clubs in Europe in the early 2000s. They reached five Champions League finals, winning two of them in 2003 and 2004., 6:C - The England captain says he’ll never be "completely sober" but that the lack of booze has helped him recover from a hamstring injury. , 7:C - The Championship, League One and League Two playoff finals are all kicking off slightly late to support Every Minute Matters, a campaign by the British Heart Foundation that aims to inspire fans to learn CPR., 8:B - Scheffler was arrested for a few motoring offences on his way to the tournament, although the charges were later dropped. , 9:B - These are the teams where Ange Postecoglou has won trophies in his second season. He never fails in his second year, even with Australian youth teams. , 10:B - Spurs won the very first Uefa Cup final in 1972, beating Wolves over two legs. A few months before the final, Spurs manager Bill Nicholson offered his players’ wives and girlfriends a trip to the away leg of the final if they made it. Wolverhampton was probably not the destination they had in mind. , 11:A - Newcastle are nicknamed the Magpies but, confusingly, have seahorses and a tiny lion on their badge. They are considering changing the badge, so perhaps the magpie will feature next season. , 12:B - Northampton beat Munster (who did score a try) 9-8. , 13:C - Lockyer, who was at Wembley for the final, scored 10 goals in the competition for Ashford United, who play in the Isthmian League South East Division – the eighth tier of English football., 14:C - The match was billed as Magnus Carlsen v The World. After each of Carlsen’s moves his 143,000 opponents would vote on what to do next. The wisdom of the crowd prevailed. , 15:A - The vote required the support of 24 out of 32 NFL owners, but fell two votes short. The Super Bowl winners’ manoeuvre sees players pushing quarterback Jalen Hurts forward in short-yardage situations. , 16:C - Lenglen won six titles at Roland Garros, including four in a row from 1920-23, although the tournament was only open to members and French nationals. The venue’s second show court was named in her honour in 1997. </p>
