<h1>Royal arms, traffic jams and plastic bans – take the Thursday quiz</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-01-09T11:00:02Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p>Welcome once again to the Guardian Thursday quiz, a test of the little grey cells and how much useless information they have retained from the week’s news, as well as a smattering of general knowledge and pop culture questions. It is like a pub quiz, but without any feedback from the mic or drunk heckling about the answers in the background. Although we do sometimes get that in the comments. We hope you enjoy it – and let us know how you get on …</p> 
<p><strong>The Thursday quiz, No 192</strong></p>

    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - He has been PM for nearly a decade, and his predecessor, Stephen Harper, lasted a similar amount of time, meaning that bizarrely thanks to Conservative party leadership shenanigans, the UK has had approximately 1,057 prime ministers over the same period, 2:A - It is intended to give greater prominence to Greenland and the Faroe Islands within the kingdom of Denmark, 3:A - Lucky old London, 4:B - Thai customs officials said more than 1.1m tonnes of plastic scraps were imported between 2018 and 2021, with Japan being one of the biggest sources, 5:B - The bananas – about 15 to 20 are left each time – are placed on a plate opposite a church, 6:C - It was Braverman, but maybe, since last week the Thursday quiz got the capital of Nigeria wrong in a question, it should refrain from throwing stones in this particular greenhouse, 7:A - The flag of Ghana is a horizontal triband of red, gold, and green with a black five-pointed star in the middle of the gold stripe, and that is why their men's football team is known as the Black Stars, 8:C - He said Meta will get rid of factcheckers, “dramatically reduce the amount of censorship”, and recommend more political content on its platforms. It was last week that the UK's former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg headed for the lucrative door at Meta marked exit, 9:D - Yes, somewhat oddly she is named after a type of potted meat. A bit like adopting a chicken and then calling it KFC, 10:C - It is Hamlet that they make happen inside the game, a play on the play's structure which includes a play-within-a-play, 11:C - Alumni include Patrick Stewart, Daniel Day-Lewis and Olivia Colman, but there will be no class of 2025 as it works towards creating what it described as "a long-term sustainable future", 12:B - You get three points for a valid kick to the head. If you put a bit of spin on it, you can score five points for a valid turning kick to the head. Make sure you do it in the competition area though, in other places you can get sent down for three months for delivering a kick to the head, even with a valid reason, 13:A - Kowalski is about to undergo a Voight-Kampff test, and then the fun begins …, 14:C - A man who a few years ago won nine of the 10 major titles got absolutely demolished by the 17-year-old, 15:C - He said he had received “an error in information” which led to him announcing he wasn't going to do it. He's 79, you know</p>
