<p>Two experiences are guaranteed to provide moments of joy on a trip to Singapore. The first: sitting down for a meal at a hawker centre or a <em>zi char</em> (“cook fry”, or home-style) restaurant. Over-ordering is optional, but ideal. The second? Getting on the MRT. That’s the Mass Rapid Transit system, for the uninitiated.</p> <p>Singapore’s sterling public transport is unironically one of the best things about the city. Punctual and stunningly frequent, the MRT is the perfect way to seamlessly explore Singapore on foot, without an exhausting step count. Here’s a selection of mini-itineraries that make full use of public transport so you can maximise the sights and sounds of Singapore like a local.</p> <h2>Hawker centres and heritage</h2> <p>Stretch your legs (and everything else) with a morning yoga class at <a href="https://www.freedomyoga.sg/" rel="nofollow">Freedom Yoga</a>, in Holland Village. From there, take the MRT to Botanic Gardens, where an eight-minute walk gets you to breakfast at Adam Road Food Centre. Take your pick from the hawker stalls – we recommend getting the prawn noodles, or <em>nasi lemak</em> if you want a rice dish – before enjoying a late-morning stroll through the <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/SBG" rel="nofollow">Singapore Botanic Gardens</a>.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Chinatown Heritage Centre.

From there, it’s a short stroll into Chinatown. Stop to take in the intricate facade of <a href="https://smt.org.sg/" rel="nofollow">Sri Mariamman Temple</a>, Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple, and the displays at the newly revamped <a href="https://www.chinatownheritagecentre.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">Chinatown Heritage Centre</a>. Round out the day with dinner and cocktails at <a href="https://www.fura.space/" rel="nofollow">Fura</a>, a sustainability-focused bar and restaurant just a few minutes’ walk away.</p> <h2>The local lifestyle</h2> <p>If you’ve seen enough of the CBD, start your day in the heart of the residential neighbourhood Ang Mo Kio. Dotted with fish markets and <em>kopitiams</em> (coffee shops), it has plenty of spots for a casual breakfast. One of Singapore’s largest urban green spaces, <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/visit/parks/park-detail/bishan-ang-mo-kio-park" rel="nofollow">Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park</a>, is a short bus ride away. Take in the riverbank scenes, then relax with a massage at <a href="https://www.aramsaspas.com/" rel="nofollow">Aramsa – The Garden Spa</a>, which is nestled within the park.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park.

Take the MRT from Bishan to Ubi, where you can try a short <a href="https://www.theteacrafters.com/" rel="nofollow">tea-blending</a> or <a href="https://www.sugarandspice.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">soap-making</a> workshop. Sit down for dinner at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yangmingseafood/?hl=en" rel="nofollow">Yang Ming Seafood</a>, a seafood <em>zi char</em> restaurant known for its unique dishes – try the Andrew lobster with <em>chee cheong fun</em> (rice noodle rolls) – and cap off your evening at <a href="https://pinkblossomsbrewing.com/" rel="nofollow">Pink Blossoms Brewing</a>, a relaxed craft brewery.</p> <h2>West is best</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Photo credit: Ah Hua Teochew Fishball Noodles.</p></li> </ul> <p>Start with an MRT ride to Lakeside for a slow morning in <a href="https://juronglakegardens.nparks.gov.sg/" rel="nofollow">Jurong Lake Gardens</a>. One of Singapore’s most photogenic green spaces, the park is filled with pagodas, wetlands and walking trails. When hunger strikes, a bus ride takes you to Ah Hua Teochew Fishball Noodles in Pandan Gardens, where handmade fishballs have earned a loyal following. Next, head to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/immoutletmall/?hl=en" rel="nofollow">IMM</a> for outlet shopping or a coffee break.</p> <p>Treat yourself to an elegant dinner at <a href="https://www.hyundai.com/sg/naoh" rel="nofollow">Na Oh</a>, a contemporary Korean restaurant in the Hyundai Motor Group Innovation Centre, which is well worth the bus trip to Jalan Boon Lay. The Michelin-starred chef Corey Lee serves a seasonal tasting menu, blending traditional Korean cuisine with modern sensibility. Book ahead and linger over dessert before catching an easy ride home.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://www.flightcentre.com.au/holidays/sg" rel="nofollow">Book your next trip to Singapore now.</a></strong></p>
