<p>The UN human rights chief has warned of a “fundamental shift” in the US and sounded the alarm over the growing power of “unelected tech oligarchs”, in a stinging rebuke of Washington weeks into Donald Trump’s presidency.</p> <p>Volker Türk said there had been bipartisan support for human rights in the US for decades but said he was “now deeply worried by the fundamental shift in direction that is taking place domestically and internationally”.</p> <p>Without referring to Trump by name, Türk, an Austrian lawyer who heads the UN’s rights body, <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2025/03/turbulence-and-unpredictability-amid-growing-conflict-and-divided">criticised the Republican president’s measures</a> to overturn longstanding equity and anti-discrimination policies, as well as repeated threats against the media and politicians.</p> <p>“In a paradoxical mirror image, policies intended to protect people from discrimination are now labelled as discriminatory. Progress is being rolled back on gender equality,” Türk said in <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2025/03/turbulence-and-unpredictability-amid-growing-conflict-and-divided">comments to the UN human rights council</a> in Geneva.</p> <p>“Disinformation, intimidation and threats, notably against journalists and public officials, risk undermining the work of independent media and the functioning of institutions,” he added. “Divisive rhetoric is being used to distort, deceive and polarise. This is generating fear and anxiety among many.”</p> <p>Since returning to power, Trump has continued to attack the press. Last month, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/trump-associated-press-gulf-of-mexico-ban">barred the Associated Press news agency</a> – on which local and international media have traditionally relied for US government reporting – from the White House.</p> <p>His administration has launched a purge of anti-discrimination policies under the umbrella term of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), and moved to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/transgender-us-military-personnel-pentagon-memo-stood-down-trump-administration">slash rights</a> for transgender people. At the same time, the administration has sent panic through communities with its widespread and muddled immigration crackdown.</p> <p>Internationally, the US has moved to withdraw funding for international organisations that promote health and human rights, such <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-order-who-withdrawal">as the World Health Organization</a>, and imposed economic sanctions on the international criminal court, which is investigating war crimes in Gaza.</p> <p>Washington’s traditional allies, including Canada, France and Germany, are feeling increasingly alarmed as Trump lashes out at democratic leaders while expressing a fondness for autocrats, including the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>In his speech on Monday, Türk presented a concerned overview of the global rights situation, saying the world was “going through a period of turbulence and unpredictability”.</p> <p>“[What] we are experiencing goes to the very core of the international order – an order that has brought us an unprecedented level of global stability. We cannot allow the fundamental global consensus around international norms and institutions, built painstakingly over decades, to crumble before our eyes.”</p> <p>He called out the growing influence wielded by “a handful of unelected tech oligarchs” who “have our data: they know where we live, what we do, our genes and our health conditions, our thoughts, our habits, our desires and our fears”.</p> <p>Türk added: “They know how to manipulate us.”</p> <p>While his comments were not directed at the US, they come at a time of rising and consolidated power among American tech and social media billionaires who have fallen in line behind Trump.</p> <p>They include Elon Musk, who owns X and has been the 78-year-old president’s most prominent backer, but also Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, who has ended factchecking programmes on Facebook and Instagram – a move the UN chief, <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/meeting-summaries/2025/02/human-rights-council-opens-fifty-eighth-regular-session-and-holds-minute?sub-site=HRC#:~:text=Recent%20rollbacks%20on%20fact%2Dchecking,to%20engage%20on%20these%20platforms.">António Guterres, has warned</a> will open the “floodgates to more hate, more threats, and more violence”.</p> <p>Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, the world’s third-richest man and owner of the Washington Post, which in the last US presidential election declined to endorse a candidate for the first time in decades, recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/26/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion">banned opinion articles</a> that did not support his views on “personal liberties and free markets”.</p> <p>Türk, whose comments were not limited to the situation in the US but could also apply to tech leaders in China and India, said that “any form of unregulated power can lead to oppression, subjugation, and even tyranny – the playbook of the autocrat”.</p> <p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events/2025/feb/18/100-days-of-trumps-presidency-with-jonathan-freedland-and-guests">100 days of Trump’s presidency, with Jonathan Freedland and guests</a><br>On 30 April, join Jonathan Freedland, Kim Darroch, Devika Bhat and Leslie Vinjamuri as they look at Trump’s presidency on his 100th day in office, live at Conway Hall, London, and livestreamed globally. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events/2025/feb/18/100-days-of-trumps-presidency-with-jonathan-freedland-and-guests">Book tickets here</a> or at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events?INTCMP=live_uk_header_dropdownhttp://guardian.live">guardian.live</a></p>
