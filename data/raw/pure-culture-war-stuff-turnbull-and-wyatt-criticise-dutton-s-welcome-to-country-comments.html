<p>Former Liberal prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has dismissed Peter Dutton’s concerns about welcomes to country as “pure culture-war stuff” that will cost votes, hours after Australia’s first Indigenous minister warned the opposition leader’s comments were damaging social harmony.</p> <p>Ken Wyatt, a former Liberal minister and the first Indigenous minister for Indigenous Australians, said he was disappointed by some of the commentary about an alleged overuse of the ceremonies and told politicians to “stay out of it”.</p> <p>Dutton has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/27/peter-dutton-says-welcome-to-country-ceremonies-overdone-as-he-clashes-with-anthony-albanese-in-final-leaders-debate">described the ceremonies as “overdone”</a> and unnecessary at many public events, including Anzac Day, while stating RSLs and organisations should decide when to have them.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/27/peter-dutton-flicks-switch-to-culture-wars-as-cost-of-living-proves-tough-egg-to-crack">Peter Dutton flicks switch to culture wars as cost of living proves tough egg to crack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Welcome to country ceremonies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/apr/25/welcome-to-country-booing-melbourne-anzac-day-dawn-service-ntwnfb">were booed by a small number of people</a> at Anzac Day services in Melbourne and Perth last week – including far-right fringe groups. The protests received bipartisan condemnation on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Asked on Tuesday whether Dutton had handled the issue responsibly, Wyatt said: “When you start to politicise elements of Aboriginal affairs or cultural practices, then you start a process of allowing division to occur.”</p> <p>“I’m disappointed with anybody who doesn’t take the time to understand the importance of friendship – welcoming and acknowledging that you are part of the community and you’re being welcomed into somebody’s home country, home region – and to politicise it just adds to the division,” the former Liberal MP said.</p> <p>“We have enough challenges in dealing with so many issues.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Wyatt, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/06/former-indigenous-affairs-minister-ken-wyatt-quits-liberals-over-partys-voice-opposition">quit the Liberal party</a> during the voice referendum over the party’s stance, said politicians should “stay out of it”.</p> <p>“The political debate on this issue does not help with the harmony of this country,” Wyatt said.</p> <p>“Even when I was in politics, I did not venture into discussions about welcome to country because it is an invitation from an organisation and an Aboriginal community.”</p> <p>Turnbull said Dutton’s comments about country acknowledgements were “pure culture-war stuff” that “turns a lot of people off”.</p> <p>“I think it’s a mistake to go down that route,” Turnbull told the ABC. “This is Peter Dutton going to things that aggravate his base, that play well on Sky News and 2GB and the rightwing media system [from] which he has drawn a lot of his inspiration and ideas, and unfortunately for him, they played poorly, I would say, in the general electorate.”</p> <p>On Monday, Dutton said it was appropriate to have a welcome to country at “significant events” like the opening of parliament, but downplayed the need elsewhere.</p> <p>“It’s ultimately a decision for the individual organisers at the events, and they can make a decision based on their membership and what their board wants to do, and that’s a decision for them, and I respect that,” Dutton said.</p> <p>The Coalition’s campaign spokesperson, James Paterson, agreed with Dutton that welcome to country ceremonies had become “overdone”. Paterson said in some cases they were “tokenistic and insincere”.</p> <p>“We are not going to establish any national law about this,” he told the ABC. “We are not dictating from the federal government when it should and should not happen.”</p> <p>When asked why Dutton had raised concerns during the final week of the campaign, Paterson said the opposition leader was responding to questions from the travelling press gallery.</p> <p>“It is important for a political leader, especially in an election campaign, to be open and honest and direct and deal with questions that are put … and that is what Peter has been doing,” Paterson said.</p> <p>Dutton said on Monday that the majority of veterans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/28/dutton-claims-majority-of-veterans-dont-want-welcome-to-country-at-anzac-day-ceremonies-ntwnfb">did not want the ceremonies at Anzac Day events</a>. The opposition leader did not say how his view about the “majority” of veterans was formed. The RSL declined to comment.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/28/duttons-comments-show-we-are-back-to-punching-down-on-indigenous-australians-for-attention-and-votes">Dutton’s comments show we are back to punching down on Indigenous Australians for attention – and votes | Lorena Allam</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/26/melbourne-storm-welcome-to-country-cancellation-nrl-anzac-day-ntwnfb">NRL club Melbourne Storm came under fire</a> for cancelling a welcome to country ceremony at the last minute on Friday, Guardian Australia contacted major sporting codes for clarification on their policies.</p> <p>A Football Australia spokesperson said the league remained “deeply committed to reconciliation in Australia”.</p> <p>The AFL, NRL and Rugby Australia were contacted for comment.</p>
