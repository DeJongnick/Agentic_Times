<p>Having infiltrated products ranging from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DICEKT0uHnw/">chips to pancakes</a>, protein is now being marketed as a healthy addition to … water.</p> <p>Influencers on TikTok and Instagram have been paid to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/proteinwater?lang=en">promote protein water sachets and premade drinks</a>, praising the confectionery-like flavours for helping them meet their “protein goals”. The products are also appearing in vending machines and are being handed out as freebies at fitness studios.</p> <h2>What exactly is protein water and do we need it?</h2> <p>The accredited dietitian Daisy Coyle, who is also a research fellow at the George Institute, says protein water is “almost a mashup between a protein shake and a sports drink as they have the protein of a traditional protein shake with the hydration and fruity flavour of a sports drink”.</p> <p>“These products are surging in popularity within the health and fitness industry and are often marketed as a lighter alternative to traditional protein shakes, which are a lot heavier, milkier and higher in calories.”</p> <p>But as Dr Evangeline Mantzioris, a sports dietitian at the University of South Australia, points out: “Australians don’t need more protein.”</p> <p>“About 99% of the healthy Australian population get the protein they need in their diet,” she says.</p> <p>“Per serve, these drinks seem to contain about 20 grams of protein, and that’s a significant amount. For someone who was struggling to get protein in, because they might have an illness, for example, this may be useful. But if you don’t need it, your body just stores it as fat.”</p> <p>This counteracts the claims on some protein drinks that the products help with weight loss and building lean muscle mass, she says.</p> <h2>Weight-loss claims ‘misleading’</h2> <p>Danielle Shine, a PhD candidate researching nutrition misinformation on social media and an accredited dietitian and nutritionist, says positioning protein waters as effective weight-loss aids is misleading, especially when compared with whole-food sources of protein.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/15/pregnancy-skincare-products-target-women-vulnerable-time-truth-myths">Pregnancy skincare products target women at a vulnerable time.

Prolonged high sodium intakes can raise blood pressure and increase the risk of heart disease, particularly in people with hypertension.”</p> <h2>No substitute for a healthy diet</h2> <p>Mantzioris says because the products are so expensive people often commit to finishing the entire canister. </p> <p>“People pick the one product and consume all of it in a large amount continuously, as opposed to having a bit of cheese from this area, and chicken that comes from over there, and fish that comes from the sea.”</p> <p>Instead of the protein craze, she says she wishes people would focus on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/22/the-fibre-phenomenon-30-easy-ways-to-get-your-fill-of-this-life-changing-nutrient">getting more fibre</a>.</p> <p>“Australians get on average 11 grams of fibre per day, and we need to be having somewhere between 25 and 30 grams. And we know that fibre is actually critical for reducing your risk of getting bowel cancer, and for overall health.”</p> <ul> <li><p>Melissa Davey is Guardian Australia’s medical editor.
