While the Broncos found early ascendancy, taking a 12-point lead into the sheds at half-time, the Roosters would not be stopped. I think we’d all love to hear exactly what John Strange said to rev them up during the break, because they came out a changed team. Once they scored their first try, they looked unstoppable and continued to build momentum.</p> <p>In hindsight, I think the non-try to Julia Robinson that was originally awarded, but then taken away by the bunker for a knock on after the forward pass, was the real turning point. While the points weren’t awarded, it gave the Broncos real belief that they still had the ability to win the game. When they got the ball back through the scrum feed, they played harder and faster and no longer seemed to be on the back foot. From there, they continued to surge at the Roosters’ line with persistence and determination and eventually came away with the win. </p> <p>While the finish was not without controversy, it was certainly a memorable game that will be talked about for many years to come. The Roosters will feel disappointed to have let the match slip through their fingers when they were in control, especially after such a strong season. But no doubt they will be back better and stronger next year. </p> <p>Thanks so much for joining me today – I hope you enjoyed the frenetic pace of the game as much as I did. Certainly one of the great grand finals. Let’s hope the men’s game can live up to the excitement of this one!</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e216d18f083fd2f004ec37" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-05T07:00:28.860Z">8.00am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>We now hear from the winning co-captains – Tamika Upton and Ali Brigginshaw.</p> <p>“Strangie and the Roosters, what a game,” said Brigginshaw. “I know that you faced some adversity there with so many injuries, but you just showed how truly classy your team is and the club and what you’ve been able to do as a club.”</p> <p>Upton finishes it off with a succinct message to her team.</p> <p>“We bloody love you guys.

Her voice is full of disappointment, but she stands up and delivers a classy address.</p> <p>“I just want to thank the Brisbane Broncos for a great match,” she said. “You guys have been incredible all season, and I’m really glad that it was us showcasing what we can do in women’s rugby league for the grand final, so thank you. To my team and the coaching staff, I think we’ve had such an incredible year off the field. The footy is just a bonus that we get to play together. I think when you look at our group and the adversity and the resilience that we’ve built this year with so many injuries to key players, I’m so proud that the scoreline was close, because we just dug so deep and we did everything we could for each. I’m so proud to call myself a Rooster.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e215b38f0801443103d989" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-05T06:54:30.352Z">7.54am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Karen Murphy Medallist: Mele Hufanga</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>No surprises here, Hufanga was pivotal in this match – what a superstar.

I’d like to thank our friends and family who turned up to Sydney today. Last but not least, to my teammates.

The Broncos get a penalty with 30 seconds left. Brigginshaw leaves the field for an HIA with 20 seconds to go, but she has done her job well and truly. The game ends with a four-point win to the Broncos and immediately a fight breaks out.

Surprisingly, it seems like neither are being removed for the HIA. The Broncos get another attempt through the line drop out and the Roosters must get through a tough set with injuries all over them.

Some of the key stats that stand out are that the Broncos lead 5-2 in line breaks and 35-18 in tackle breaks. The Roosters will need to turn these stats around if they want to make an impact in the second half.</p> <p>The standout player for me so far has been Broncos centre Mele Hufanga. She always just seems to be in the action, from line breaks to tackles – she has been absolutely key for them so far. For the Roosters, Jocelyn Kelleher has put in a few great kicks, but I think they need more from her and Olivia Kernick to drag their team into the match.</p> <p>It’s a warm day in Sydney, currently 28 degrees in Sydney Olympic Park, so fatigue will play a role in the second half.

It’s a competition that has grown bigger and better each season, from just four teams back in 2018 to a much more significant 12 teams. And yet, somehow we still ended up with the Roosters and Broncos in the grand final, just as we did back in 2018. Nevertheless, we persist!</p> <p>Both teams have been outstanding this season – the Roosters are yet to be defeated in 2025 and the Broncos have lost only one game. Both sides have superstars all across the park and either are very capable of taking this out on their day.</p> <p>They have not met since round three – back in July – when the Roosters got the win by just four points. That day, the Roosters got the jump early, got out to a strong half-time lead, before the Broncos put on a second half fightback. Olivia Kernick scored a late try to get the defending premiers over the line in a highly entertaining game. If both teams are up for repeating their antics from that game, we will be in for a treat today. </p> <p>There is plenty of excitement ahead of us, so let’s get into it!</p> </div>   </div>
