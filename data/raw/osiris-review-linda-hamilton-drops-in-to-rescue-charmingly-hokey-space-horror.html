<p>An entertaining-enough space-horror, a mishmash of storylines and character types that sees some special forces commandos abducted by a gang (herd? flock? troop?) of aliens whose intentions are aligned more closely with the likes of the predator than lovely little ET the Extra-Terrestrial. The pop culture off-worlders these beasties most resemble physically, however, are the xenomorphs from James Cameron’s Aliens – and not the massive multi-limbed queen, mind you, but the smaller foot-soldier guys who can be played by a fella in a suit.</p> <p>This fella-in-a-suit aspect is the one of the film’s strengths. You might argue that it hinders the willing suspension of disbelief, because you always know you’re looking at a fella in a suit. But in truth there’s something about the physicality of even the hokiest practical effect that is more enjoyable than all but the most skilfully rendered digital efforts.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqlqZWv_PO4"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oqlqZWv_PO4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Another area in which the film recalls the earlier work of James Cameron is in the casting of Linda Hamilton (Terminator 2: Judgment Day) in the role of a tough, uncompromising military type. Lest fans get too excited by the Hamilton-heavy marketing for the film, she certainly gives good Hamilton while on screen, but she doesn’t appear for the first hour; it’s very much an “and Linda Hamilton” credits situation. And that’s fine: it’s better to have practical effects and a modest helping of recognisable actors than A-listers sleepwalking through expensive CGI glop for a paycheck. Osiris is far from a perfect film, and it’s certainly not an original one, but it understands the assignment and delivers.</p> <p>• Osiris is on digital platforms from 28 July.</p>
