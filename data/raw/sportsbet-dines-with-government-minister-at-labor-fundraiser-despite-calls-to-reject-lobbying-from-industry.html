<p>Sportsbet was invited to a Labor party fundraising dinner with an Albanese government minister earlier this week, despite bipartisan calls for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/19/labor-mps-worried-albanese-government-may-sideline-gambling-reform-until-after-election">the party to ignore lobbying</a> from the wagering industry and introduce tougher regulation.</p> <p>A Sportsbet employee was among a small group of donors who attended the “boardroom dinner” with the minister for regional development, Kristy McBain, on Tuesday night. The dinner was organised by Labor’s fundraising vehicle.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, four crossbench MPs held a press conference in parliament house urging the federal government to act on the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/28/ads-for-online-gambling-should-be-banned-in-australia-within-three-years-inquiry-recommends"> two-year-old recommendations</a> of an inquiry led by late Labor MP Peta Murphy, which included a comprehensive ban on gambling ads.</p> <p>Invitations to the event seen by Guardian Australia show tickets to the 90-minute event cost $4,000, but members of the forum were charged a discount rate of $3,000. Some members were entitled to a number of free tickets.</p> <p>Sportsbet’s attendance at the small dinner was confirmed by multiple sources unable to speak publicly.</p> <p>Gambling companies have recently been turned away from Labor fundraising events that feature the prime minister and the communications minister.</p> <p>The change was introduced after former minister Michelle Rowland <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/09/michelle-rowland-faces-calls-to-resign-for-accepting-gaming-company-donations-before-election">faced calls to resign</a> in 2023 over a dinner with Sportsbet, which the wagering company paid for. Rowland said the donation was within the rules, but vowed to no longer accept money from the gambling industry.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/05/time-is-running-out-sportsbet-offered-share-of-1m-in-bonus-bets-if-customers-gambled-on-afl-grand-final-day">‘Time is running out’: Sportsbet offered share of $1m in bonus bets if customers gambled on AFL grand final day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The dinner was held within 24 hours of an <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-10-06/losing-streak/105859060">ABC Four Corners documentary</a> on the gambling industry, which highlighted its political influence.</p> <p>Sportsbet has previously paid $110,000 for a platinum membership to Labor’s business forum, which provides it increased access to ministers including cabinet members. But it downgraded its membership to the $88,000 option last financial year, according to latest disclosures, which show it also donated $60,000 to the Liberals and $15,000 to the Nationals.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>A Sportsbet spokesperson said the company was “one of hundreds of businesses involved in consultations with the government through business forums”.</p> <p>“Our memberships to these forums are disclosed in accordance with the law and our spend on these memberships has decreased over each of the past three years,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>“Through our dialogue with governments, Sportsbet has advocated for safer gambling regulatory measures including a credit card ban, Betstop and zero-day verification for customers.”</p> <p>McBain’s office was contacted but referred questions to the national secretariat, which is responsible for the forum. Ministers often do not know who is invited to events until they arrive, with details managed by the organisational wing of the party.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Labor’s national secretariat did not comment on Sportsbet directly, but said the forum’s events provided a “platform for engagement between the business community and the Australian Labor party”.</p> <p>“Our events create opportunities for constructive dialogue on issues that matter to Australia’s economy and community.”</p> <p>The federal government has faced intense lobbying from broadcast television networks and the gambling industry not to adopt the total ban on gambling ads recommended by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy.</p> <p>The government had planned to introduce legislation before the federal election in May but reforms were shelved amid fierce opposition.</p> <p>The communications minister, Anika Wells, has restarted negotiations with industry and several gambling sources have told Guardian Australia they expect to see legislation by the end of the year. That timeline has not been confirmed by the minister.</p> <p>The Greens also support <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/04/labor-under-pressure-to-enact-gambling-reforms-before-election-after-greens-pledge-to-help-pass-stalled-law">a ban on gambling ads</a> while the Coalition has previously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/13/peter-dutton-cranks-up-pressure-on-labor-to-further-restrict-gambling-ads">proposed a stricter ban on gambling ads</a> one hour before, during and one hour after live sports broadcasts. Several Labor MPs have also agitated for change, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/22/labor-mp-jerome-laxale-albanese-gambling-ads">during the federal election campaign</a>.</p> <p>The Sportsbet spokesperson said the company would “continue to advocate strongly for further measures such as an industry-wide ban on commissions and affiliates which we implemented in 2022”.</p> <p>Transparency groups believe fundraising dinners damage faith in democracy and provide inequitable access to decision makers.</p> <p>The Centre for Public Integrity’s chair, Anthony Whealy KC, has previously said he and his colleagues “thoroughly disapprove” of these fundraisers.</p> <p>Transparency International Australia’s chief executive, Clancy Moore, has accused the dinners of being an example of “cash-for-access” or “pay-to-play”.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
