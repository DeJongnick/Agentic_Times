<p>The superfast evolution of technology can create a digital divide between parents and their teens. Gen X and millennials may have had their childhoods transformed by tech, but they’re now parenting generations Z, Alpha and Beta who are traversing entirely different online landscapes, particularly in the world of online gaming.</p> <p>At the same time, cyber-attacks are increasingly in the news, with major players in an array of industries falling victim. Among those under investigation for these hacks are young people with advanced digital skills. In fact, <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/one-in-five-children-found-to-engage-in-illegal-activity-online?highlight=WyJuYXRpb24iLCJuYXRpb25hbCIsIm5hdGlvbmFsbHkiLCJuYXRpb25zJyIsIm5hdGlvbmFsaXR5IiwibmF0aW9uYWxzIiwibmF0aW9ucyIsIm5hdGlvbmFsbHknIiwibmF0aW9uYWxpdGllcyIsIm5hdGlvbidzIl0=" rel="nofollow">according to the National Crime Agency</a>, one in five children engage in behaviours that violate the Computer Misuse Act, which criminalises unauthorised access to computer systems and data. The figure is higher for those who game, standing at 25%.</p> <p>This is why Co-op is taking a different approach to prevention. As part of its long-term strategy to support young people in putting their tech skills to good use, Co-op has partnered with <a href="https://www.thehackinggames.com/" rel="nofollow">The Hacking Games</a>, which is dedicated to helping brilliant gamers get jobs in cybersecurity.</p> <p>This joined-up approach matters because, as former National Crime Agency senior officer and director of 4D Cyber Security, Greg Francis, explains: “It takes a digital village to raise a digital native.” Early intervention is key and parents have an important role to play. “Parents are paramount because they’ve got so much influence, but they can’t be passive, and they need to have a basic understanding of the hacker’s world,” says Francis, who is also a cyber ambassador for The Hacking Games. So where should you start?</p> <h2><strong>Take a judgment-free interest</strong></h2> <p>First, know that an interest in hacking isn’t necessarily cause for dismay.</p> <p>“Ethical hacking is a fast-developing world, and it is understandable that children may be interested in it as an exciting way to use the skills they have developed online,” says Lynn Perry, chief executive of children’s charity Barnardo’s, which is partnering with Co-op to raise funds to support creating positive futures for young people.</p> <p>Keeping conversations open is vital, as is starting them early. “The best time to start is today,” says Perry. “As soon as your child starts showing an interest in online technology, it’s time. Conversations should be frequent and age-appropriate, so that an open dialogue is maintained.”</p>    <p>She recommends getting involved with your child’s online life when they’re young. “Use technology together and discuss what to do if something unusual or scary pops up. As they get older, they will need more independence, but regular dialogue will still allow children to lead the conversation, ask questions, and share concerns.”</p> <p>For those who came of age in a much more basic digital era than their children, understanding the sophisticated world of online gaming – dominated by titles such as Roblox, Minecraft and Call of Duty – can feel impossible. But both Francis and Perry emphasise that you don’t have to know everything to be able to provide support.</p> <p>Parents of keen gamers should check age ratings and make use of parental controls, including friends-only features to keep in-game chat functions safer. Online initiative <a href="https://www.askaboutgames.com/get-started/setup-parental-controls" rel="nofollow">Ask About Games</a>, has detailed information on the most popular games and guides for setting up safety controls.</p> <p>It’s also worth asking if your young gamer has ever been “booted” offline. Booting is a form of DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) in which a gamer hacks another gamer’s IP address and floods it with so much data that it shuts down their internet. To online gamers, booting can seem like a harmless way to get one up on their online rivals, but it’s serious. As Francis explains: “What they don’t realise is that that is a contravention of the Computer Misuse Act.” In fact, DDoSing/booting can be <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/who-we-are/publications/596-nac-youth-pathways-into-cyber-crime/file" rel="nofollow">one of the first steps</a> on the pathway to cybercrime that Francis has identified in his work with the multi-agency Prevent programme.</p> <p>Asking questions goes hand in hand with observing red flags such as excessive time gaming online, social isolation, unexplained tiredness, unusual equipment or new technology purchases (especially if you don’t know how they’re being paid for) and multiple email addresses. Just one of these signs isn’t necessarily serious but, collectively, they can be cause for concern.</p> <p>Mary* has first-hand experience of these red flags. “I had a son who was hacking on the darknet. He would lock himself in his room, avoid sleeping, and I literally had no idea what he was doing,” she says. “I met a cybersecurity expert and told him about the challenges I was having with my son. It turned out he was on the darknet trying to enter into the crypto world; he was 13 at the time.”</p>    <h2><strong>A new route for young neurodivergent people</strong></h2> <p>For neurodivergent young people in particular, gaming and spending time online can have a major upside when it comes to things such as <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychiatry/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2023.959846/full" rel="nofollow">socialisation</a>, and providing a <a href="https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjdp.12424" rel="nofollow">means to switch off and regulate their emotions</a>. At the same time, it is important to remember that for all of these benefits, the downsides of <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/parenting4digitalfuture/2024/12/11/bytes-of-advice-parenting-neurodiverse-children-in-the-digital-world/" rel="nofollow">internet or gaming addiction</a>, as well as the associated risk of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/from-play-to-purpose/2025/oct/27/ethical-hacking-for-young-gamers-cybersecurity-programme">being lured into cybercrime</a>, remain significant.</p> <p>However, as more than 50% of tech workers <a href="https://www.techtalentcharter.co.uk/reports/diversity-in-tech-report-2024/" rel="nofollow">self-identify as neurodivergent</a>, according to the Tech Talent Charter, there is a huge opportunity for young neurodivergent people in the sector. That’s why The Hacking Games is directly aimed at “digital rebels” with “raw talent” and “unconventional minds,” matching them with cybersecurity jobs and mentors, as well as providing community via a Discord group chat.</p> <p>In fact mentorship and awareness of career pathways can be transformative, as Mary attests. “The cyber expert supported my son as a trusted source, and then finally ended up mentoring him for me,” she says. “He spent time getting my son to understand that his skills could be put to great use, so he could see the positive side of using his skills on the internet, and as a result, my son also ended up helping others.”</p> <p>While this issue may seem alarming, there are ways for parents to intervene at every stage. Ensuring you remain curious and compassionate, rather than judgemental, is key to helping your child stay on the right path. Here are some top tips for parents who are concerned about their children.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Conversations about online gaming safety should start early and be compassionate rather than condemnatory. Staying calm helps keep communication open.</p> <p><strong>2 </strong>You don’t need to know everything but healthy curiosity goes a long way. Ask questions about which games your kids are playing and where they’re hanging out online. Think of it this way: you’d ask these questions about who they’re playing with on the playground, so you should ask the same for their online community. Look out for red flags such as strangers friending them, people offering them free things, and being invited to new worlds or games without their friends. These are all grooming red flags.</p> <p><strong>3 </strong>Be proactive. Game age ratings are useful and there for a reason, but the best way to judge what is appropriate for your child is to take turns at playing games with them yourself, or at least to watch them as they play. And when it comes to pathways into cybercrime, it is worth remembering too that children and young people are just as likely to be recruited on Minecraft as on Call of Duty. Any game with a community or “freemium” options is tantalisingly easy for young people to want to find that extra in-game money or cheat to get the better equipment. That’s how it can start.</p> <p><strong>4 </strong>Look out for red flags such as social isolation, excessive time spent gaming online, lack of sleep, unexplained tech purchases and multiple email addresses.</p> <p><strong>5 </strong>Speak to your child’s school. Ask how they’re encouraging digital responsibility and check in with the computer science teacher, who will often know which students need dedicated outlets for their skills. It may be an early chance for them to channel their talents in a positive direction through programmes such as <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberfirst/overview" rel="nofollow">CyberFirst</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/cyber-choices" rel="nofollow">Cyber Choices</a>, or coding communities such as <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" rel="nofollow">Girls Who Code</a>.</p> <p><em>*Mary’s name has been changed to protect her family’s anonymity</em></p> <p><em><a href="https://thehackinggames.com/co-op?utm_source=Display&amp;utm_campaign=Hackinggames&amp;utm_content=Article&amp;utm_term=Article" rel="nofollow">Find out more</a></em></p> <p><em><a href="https://www.barnardos.org.uk/get-support/support-for-parents-and-carers/child-abuse-and-harm/keeping-children-safe-online" rel="nofollow">Help keep children and young people safe online with Barnardo’s online safety guidance</a></em></p>
