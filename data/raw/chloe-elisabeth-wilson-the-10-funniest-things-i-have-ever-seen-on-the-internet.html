<p>The funniest thing I have ever seen on the internet came to me in 2012. It was a notification from Instagram, letting me know that a user called jilly2bogpodcom had started following me. It turns out my mum, Jillian, had tried to sign up for Instagram but had entered her email in place of a username. After a couple of typos and a suggestion from Instagram, Mum accepted this hilarious moniker as her online persona. My friend Nick still calls her Jillybogpod to this day.</p> <p>In lieu of being able to show you that notification, here are a series of things that have made me smile, giggle, chuckle, snort and of course guffaw over the years. I only signed up for Twitter/X last year (I know, he ruined it), because a Rachel Weisz stan account had posted something about a movie she was making, and in order to scroll through the account’s posts chronologically I had to log in.</p> <p>I followed two profiles, as was compulsory: Deadline and Variety. Somehow, by following these film news sites and checking the Rachel Weisz stan account regularly, I managed to curate the most pristine algorithm known to girls (32-year-old women) on the internet. For example, last night I opened the app and the first tweet in the queue read: “You want me to do PILATES? The thing that killed JESUS?” Incredible. People are amazing. Anyway, here are the things.</p> <h2><strong>1. Courtney Take Your Break</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v8LF-YWKfo"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_v8LF-YWKfo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>One thing about me is I went to university to study musical theatre. Throughout my time at drama school, I did <em>so</em> many embarrassing things. Which is why I feel it’s OK for me, personally, to laugh at this clip from a high school production of Legally Blonde: The Musical. Specifically, the role of Salesgirl #2. The account is titled Courtney Take Your Break for a reason, and you will understand that reason when you reach the 4:45 mark.</p> <h2><strong>2. He roled he’s eye</strong></h2>    <p>One for the writers in the house! I have written so many versions of “he roled he’s eye” over the years – just yesterday I wrote “a loaf of bred” in a sentence and was so tired I spent about four minutes trying to work out what was wrong with it.</p> <h2><strong>3. Saturday Night Live: Super Showcase Spokesmodels</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoTv5sjom8k"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IoTv5sjom8k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I hate to be that person, but I miss this era of SNL. Kristen Wiig corpsing at least once a week? Incredible entertainment. I still use “I think it <em>could </em>be beef” as a response to many of life’s big questions.</p> <h2><strong>4. ‘You could stop at five or six stores’</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCeQLeQiRP4"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YCeQLeQiRP4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This audition compilation plays like something from the minds of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/may/30/i-think-you-should-leave-tim-robinson">Tim Robinson</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jul/31/the-rehearsal-hbo-nathan-fielder-reality-tv">Nathan Fielder</a>, but as far as I’m aware it’s 100% real. If you’ve ever auditioned for a commercial, this one’s for you (I once had to pretend to watch my 18-year-old son graduate high school – I was 22 at the time – for a casting director who was so bored they looked at their phone from the minute I walked in to the minute I left).</p> <h2><strong>5. <a href="https://x.com/reallydiatar">Lydia Tár’s Twitter account</a></strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/RealLydiaTar/status/1592210120884514816">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Free bowing” <a href="https://t.co/w6KLndHENW">pic.twitter.com/w6KLndHENW</a></p>&mdash; Lydia Tár (@RealLydiaTar) <a href="https://twitter.com/RealLydiaTar/status/1592210120884514816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2022</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>When Todd Field’s psychological thriller <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jan/11/tar-review-cate-blanchett-is-perfect-lead-in-delirious-sensual-drama">Tár</a> (starring our very own Cate B) hit theatres in 2022, many audience members were under the impression the film was a biopic. Spoiler alert: it isn’t. Lydia Tár is not real, but whoever created this parody account was soooo real for choosing the handle @RealLydiaTar.</p> <h2><strong>6. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/25/mario-not-so-super-at-forty">Mario by Simon Rich</a></strong></h2> <p>Highbrow rec alert! Not really, but the fact this piece was published by the New Yorker makes me feel like a suave intellectual who would never laugh at a bird saying “What the f–?’”<br><br>It’s Mario (yes, that Mario) at 40, wrestling with the challenges of approaching middle age – in particular, his rapidly deteriorating body after years of “crushing Koopas, dodging hammers, and jumping through castle after castle”. I first found out about this piece on a long drive, when my partner decided to read it aloud to me in full, and actually? 10/10 road trip activity.</p> <h2><strong>7. This bird saying ‘What the fuck?’</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL4mI7XWbq4"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WL4mI7XWbq4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>It does what it says on the tin.</p> <h2><strong>8. Pwincess</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Video of woman speaking into the camrea. Text over video says “Gonna start leaving these video messages for my girls when they don’t answer my FaceTimes”. Text with post reads: “I will 100% regret posting this in about an hour”">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@bellagarciaxo/video/7363067882076376366&quot; data-video-id=&quot;7363067882076376366&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@bellagarciaxo&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@bellagarciaxo?refer=embed&quot;&gt;@bellagarciaxo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;I will 100% regret posting this in about an hour &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;♬ original sound - Bella&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7363067955405523754?refer=embed&quot;&gt;♬ original sound - Bella&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>I can’t claim to have discovered this video – I got it from my partner, who got it from our friend Stella. I think this woman should receive a Golden Globe.</p> <h2><strong>9. Kim Cattrall scatting</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S37dLbR9WA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1S37dLbR9WA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I’m sure this video has appeared multiple times in this column, but you know what? It’s a classic. And I AM just like the other girls. People taking themselves extremely seriously will always be funny to me. I love ya, Kim. Sa-fah-sa-RAY!</p> <h2><strong>10. This video of Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban &lt;3</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_45jbE5_Y8"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X_45jbE5_Y8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This video should be the subject of academic studies. First of all, whose idea was it? Did it come from Keith himself, or did a record exec call him to say, “Hey man, yeah I need you and Nicole to go out to the car and film yourselves singing along to the song. All good? OK, great.” I wouldn’t say I find this video “funny” as much as I absolutely adore it. They are so in love!!! Nicole Kidman has an Academy Award, and yet here she is squealing “Oh my God, I love this song!” on the internet for free. That’s amore, folks.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><a href="https://www.penguin.com.au/books/rytual-9781761346699">Rytual by Chloe Elisabeth Wilson</a> is out 6 May through Penguin. <a href="https://mwf.com.au/program/culture-club-podcast-live-with-chloe-elisabeth-wilson">Culture Club Podcast: Live with Chloe Elisabeth Wilson</a> is at Wheeler Centre on 9 May as part of Melbourne writers’ festival.</em></p></li> </ul>
