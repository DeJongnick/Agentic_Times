Together they pioneered solarisation in photography, whereby the negative is exposed momentarily to light during processing. Although Man Ray would get the credit for the first use of the technique in art, a new show quietly and rightfully reattributes it to Miller.

This is just one of his incredibly spontaneous and sincere paintings of his two daughters, Mary (who’s about 10 here) and Margaret (about 8). As Margaret holds a cat, Mary embraces her. The cat is just a sketch, for this is a free painting of life in motion, and not a formal portrait. All of Gainsborough’s intent has gone into capturing his girls’ faces at this passing moment in their young lives. Remember, there were no cameras 250 years ago. Only an artist had this power to record his children’. Mary and Margaret both have eyes filled with feeling as well as intelligence: this combination of sense and sensibility deeply impresses their father, who hoped they might have careers as professional artists.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/thomas-gainsborough-the-painter-s-daughters-with-a-cat">National Gallery</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in </strong><strong>touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
