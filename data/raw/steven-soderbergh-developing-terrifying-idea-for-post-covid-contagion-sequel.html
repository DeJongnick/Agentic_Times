<p>The director Steven Soderbergh has “terrifying” ideas for a sequel to Contagion, his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/contagion-film-review">2011 film</a> about a global pandemic which enjoyed a resurgence under Covid-19, but feels it would be “irresponsible” to base a movie around them.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/15/black-bag-review-glossy-steven-soderbergh-spy-thriller-is-less-slow-horses-more-show-pony-cate-blanchett-michael-fassbender-tom-burke">Black Bag review – glossy Steven Soderbergh spy thriller is less Slow Horses, more show pony </a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We talk about it and have come up with some terrifying ideas,” Soderbergh said, while describing conversations with pandemic experts. “There would have to be, I think, a plot that doesn’t feel predictable.</p> <p>“I don’t want to torture people,” he said. “There are scenarios that you could come up with that I would categorise as irresponsible. You know, that I would go, ‘That’s a big idea, but I’m not sure I want to put that idea out there, frankly.’ I do think about that.”</p> <p>Soderbergh was speaking to <a href="https://www.onedecision.com/podcast">One Decision</a>, a podcast whose co-hosts include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/27/mi6-richard-dearlove-covid-artificial-intelligence-misunderstands-science">Sir Richard Dearlove</a>, a former head of the British intelligence service MI6, the former CIA director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/03/leon-panetta-trump-defense-national-security">Leon Panetta</a> and now <a href="https://x.com/kateemccann?lang=en">Kate McCann</a>, a Times Radio presenter. True to Dearlove and Panetta’s background, Soderbergh was there to discuss his new film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/15/black-bag-review-glossy-steven-soderbergh-spy-thriller-is-less-slow-horses-more-show-pony-cate-blanchett-michael-fassbender-tom-burke">Black Bag</a>, an espionage thriller starring Michael Fassbender and Cate Blanchett.</p>    <p>But conversation also turned to Contagion. Staring Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne, Kate Winslet and Marion Cotillard, the film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion">surged back</a> to prominence in early 2020, as Covid emerged from China and much of the world locked down. In the UK, thanks to then health secretary Matt Hancock, Soderbergh’s movie even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/feb/02/how-matt-hancocks-obsession-with-matt-damon-film-inspired-uks-vaccine-strategy">informed vaccine policy</a>.</p> <p>At the time, Scott Z Burns, who wrote<em> </em>Contagion, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/16/802704825/fact-checking-contagion-in-wake-of-coronavirus-the-2011-movie-is-trending">told NPR</a> he and Soderbergh wanted to depict a “plausible” outbreak, “not a Hollywood exaggeration”.</p> <p>“We were trying to tell a story that was credible within the boundaries of scientific understanding, but also illuminate how our world might respond – that is why the poster of the movie says ‘Nothing spreads like fear’,” Burns said.</p> <p>Soderbergh told One Decision: “They found a vaccine in the movie faster than you would have been able to then. In the interim, a couple of years before Covid, new technology allowed us to get to a vaccine in a shockingly short period of time.</p> <p>“I mean, the scientific community was aware of what was happening in Wuhan in November and by January, they had a working vaccine [<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html">US authorities say</a> Covid was detected in December 2019, with the first human vaccine trials in March 2020]. That’s insane how fast that happened and how many lives were saved. This typically when we made Contagion would have been three to four years.”</p> <p>Responding to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/27/mi6-richard-dearlove-covid-artificial-intelligence-misunderstands-science">Dearlove’s</a> description of his belief that Covid-19 escaped from a laboratory, a theory at first downplayed but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/26/cia-now-backs-lab-leak-theory-to-explain-origins-of-covid-19">increasingly taken seriously</a> instead of the position that the virus spread from a food market, Soderbergh said “the people I’m talking to” about pandemics believed Covid came from a lab but had “a zoonotic origin”.</p> <p>“We think it was scooped up and we think, to use the phrase from Contagion, it walked out of there on somebody’s shoe. That’s what I’ve heard.”</p> <p>Returning to the espionage theme – and his dislike of James Bond films – Dearlove said: “There’s a real design flaw in the Bond villain plan to engineer a virus [Ernst Stavro Blofeld, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/23/on-her-majestys-secret-service-film-recap">On Her Majesty’s Secret Service</a>] which is the virus doesn’t respect any boundary and will go everywhere including back into your house.”</p> <p>McCann asked if Soderbergh was considering a sequel to Contagion. Soderbergh mentioned his “terrifying” ideas, and said: “It’s [about] being responsible and understanding how people take things in … I have my own standard of what I think is being deeply irresponsible and exciting.</p> <p>“I think about that whenever I’m about to unleash something to the public, whether that’s a post or a movie or a TV show or an article, I think it’s important to run through the potential consequences of what you’re saying. And first of all, I would hope that whatever you’re saying is true and that it’s defensible and that you can lay out the logic of what you’re saying.</p> <p>“But secondly, I don’t want to contribute to what I consider to be noise. I want to be signal. I don’t want to be noise. And noise to me is just things that are insincere, ultimately. If not downright cynical.”<br></p>
