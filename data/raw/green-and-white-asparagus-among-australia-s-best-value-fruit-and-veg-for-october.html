<p>“Asparagus is where it’s at,” says Graham Gee, the senior buyer at the Happy Apple in Melbourne. “We’re at peak season for our Koo Wee Rup growers,” he says of the Victorian growing district – Australia’s largest for asparagus. They’re selling for less than $2 a bunch in supermarkets.</p> <p>If weather conditions stay favourable, asparagus will be in good supply from now until December. White asparagus, considered a delicacy in Germany, has a shorter, five-week season. Sold loose, this variety is about $39 a kilo on shelves now, but likely to come down in price.</p> <p>Try the spring vegetable in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/07/mussel-soup-asparagus-spaghetti-and-slow-roast-lamb-joe-trivelli-italian-easter-recipes">Joe Trivelli’s asparagus, anchovy, parmesan and egg spaghetti</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/02/thomasina-miers-recipe-asparagus-fried-egg-salsa-macha">simply topped with egg and Mexican salsa</a>.</p>    <p>Iceberg and cos lettuces are also in season, Gee says. “Mignonettes and butter lettuces are coming too, and it’s no coincidence to see them as the weather warms up.”</p> <p>You can get a head of iceberg for $2 or $3.

Broccoli, fennel and herbs, such as local basil in New South Wales, are also in season, Flamminio says.</p> <p>Though Gippsland growers are starting to see snow peas and sugar snaps, supply is expected to increase in two or three weeks.</p> <h2>Mangoes are on their way</h2> <p>“Mangoes from the Northern Territory will start to come down in price later in October,” Flamminio says. Keep an eye out for Kensington prides, he says.</p> <p>At Galluzzo’s, mangoes are two for $10 for premium, large fruit. You can find smaller ones for about $4 each in supermarkets. One of the largest varieties, R2E2s, are also on their way, but KPs are the best-quality crop, he says.</p> <p>Stone fruit fans can look forward to the first peaches and nectarines to hit shelves. “We’re already seeing it hit the markets, albeit small and expensive,” Flamminio says. Apricot season is set to follow later this month, and will be in their prime in November.</p> <h2>Seek out Western Australian strawberries</h2> <p>Berries are beautiful and very affordable, at the moment, Flamminio says.<strong> </strong>“Western Australian strawberries are new in season, at about $2.99 a punnet.” <br><strong><br></strong>Use them in sweet or savoury dishes, such as this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/yotam-ottolenghi-strawberry-recipes">custard slice</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/30/yotam-ottolenghi-strawberry-recipes">tomato, strawberry and basil salad</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/24/strawberry-recipes-basil-tart-ketchup-sorrel-ice-cream-yotam-ottolenghi">strawberry and basil tart</a>.</p>    <p>Blueberries are $3 a punnet and raspberries $4.50 a punnet. At grocers, you will also find mulberries in stock for a short four-week season.</p> <p>For something different, try yellow champagne watermelon from Queensland, which is about the same price as red watermelon ($3.99 a kilo), Flamminio says. Lychees are also hitting the stands, as well as mangosteens from northern Queensland.</p> <p>It’s your last chance to savour citrus, Flamminio says, as sumo mandarins are now scarce and imperials are finished. But Afourer mandarins will last until December at about $5 to $6 a kilo. Apples and pears are also on their way out of season.</p> <p><strong>Buy: <br></strong>Asparagus<strong><br></strong>Avocado<br>Blueberries<br>Broccoli<br>Cucumber<br>Lettuce, particularly cos and iceberg<br>Lychees<br>Mangoes<br>Mangosteens<br>Mulberries<br>Raspberries<br>Strawberries<br>Tomatoes<br>Watermelons<br><br><strong>Watch: <br></strong>Apples<br>Apricots<br>Cherries (end of October)<br>Grapes <br>Limes (demand spikes in early November)<br>Nectarines<br>Passionfruit<br>Pears<br>Peaches</p>
