<p>When I was 16, for a high school English assignment I composed a short play titled <em>Deconstructing Hamlet</em>, made up entirely of decontextualised quotes from Shakespeare’s play, all placed in conflicting dialogue with each other. It probably wasn’t as clever as I thought at the time, but it was early proof to me of the Danish tragedy’s endless adaptability – a virtue that the film industry has amply seized upon over the past century or so. Even with that in mind, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/07/gta-online-grand-theft-hamlet-documentary-melbourne-international-film-festival">Pinny Grylls and Sam Crane</a>’s ingenious documentary <strong>Grand Theft Hamlet</strong>, in cinemas next month (and <a href="https://mubi.com/en/gb/films/grand-theft-hamlet">on Mubi early next year</a>), stretches the point further than most, examining a lockdown staging of the play within the online digital realm of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2023/dec/07/grand-theft-auto-every-game-and-controversy-explained">Grand Theft Auto</a></em>, emerging as a strangely moving testament to the communal comforts of gaming and performance alike.</p> <p><em>Hamlet</em> has been filmed so frequently that it has earned something of a hiatus. The last major “straight” version on screen was Michael Almereyda’s <strong><a href="https://tv.apple.com/gb/movie/hamlet/umc.cmc.30id8koez74kx8e4nkc9qinpu?playableId=tvs.sbd.9001%3A1520266992">2000 version</a></strong> (on Apple TV+), with a moody Ethan Hawke as the procrastinating prince out for revenge on his elders. A modern-dress interpretation awash in glossy Y2K styling, it’s now pretty much a period piece capturing what seemed cool at the turn of the century. Hawke is rather good, but it’s undeniably try-hard, while its fashioning of <em>Hamlet</em> as a critique of corporate corruption, with Claudius as the CEO of “Denmark Corp”, had already been better done by Akira Kurosawa in his nasty, spiralling 1960 neo-noir <strong><a href="https://player.bfi.org.uk/subscription/film/watch-the-bad-sleep-well-1960-online">The Bad Sleep Well</a></strong> (BFI Player).</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps if Shakespeare’s prince had been taught Hakuna Matata, things might have turned out better for him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Almereyda’s film capped off a busy decade for <em>Hamlet</em> in cinemas, and a veritable heyday at the time for English teachers with VHS players. Franco Zeffirelli’s scowling, action-oriented 1990 version sheared the text and amped up the Oedipal vibes by casting nine-years-apart Mel Gibson and Glenn Close as Hamlet and Gertrude. (Oddly, it’s only available on physical media these days.) Six years later, Kenneth Branagh’s extravagant <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/hamlet-1996">four-hour version</a></strong> won the purists’ vote by leaving the play unabridged, but showed real cinematic verve with its heightened Victorian aesthetic and dizzy long takes in Panavision. It remains Branagh’s best film – the main course to his minor, enjoyable comedy <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/a-midwinters-tale">In the Bleak Midwinter</a></strong>, about a dishevelled community Christmas staging of <em>Hamlet</em>, released the year before.</p>    <p>Laurence Oliver, unsurprisingly, remains the name principally associated with <em>Hamlet</em> on screen: his handsomely classical <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/hamlet-1948">1948 version</a></strong> won the best picture Oscar – the first non-American film, and still the only Shakespearean adaptation, to do so – and his agonised, Oscar-winning portrayal of the prince is as good as any you’ll see, though the film itself feels a little stiff alongside Olivier’s more elaborate cinematic visions for <em>Henry V</em> and <em>Richard III</em>. Comparatively underrated is Tony Richardson’s severe, starkly minimalist <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/hamlet">1969 version</a></strong> with a tremendous Nicol Williamson, plus a surprisingly effective Marianne Faithfull as Ophelia. Meanwhile, the Bard’s words sound just fine in Russian in Grigori Kozintsev’s impressively sweeping, outdoor-heavy <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzN1isLYc_A">1964 version</a></strong> (Shakespeare Network), though the original Shostakovich score is perhaps the main draw.</p> <p>Veering away from the text, Robert Eggers delved back to the <em>Hamlet</em>-inspiring Norse legend of Amleth for his magnificently louring, violent Viking epic <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/the-northman">The Northman</a> </strong>(2022), finding its own kind of poetry in visceral grunts. Disney’s <strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/the-lion-king">The Lion King</a></strong>, of course, works from the bare skeleton of <em>Hamlet</em>, with significant diversions: perhaps if Shakespeare’s prince had been taught Hakuna Matata, things might have turned out better for him. Claire McCarthy’s 2018 <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0011pn4/ophelia">Ophelia</a></strong> (BBC iPlayer) nobly attempted a feminist reorientation of the play around its most underwritten character, played by a stoic Daisy Ridley, but its empowerment angle is awfully heavy-handed.</p>    <p>Finally, Tom Stoppard’s antic 1990 film of his play<a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/rosencrantz-and-guildenstern-are-dead">Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead</a></strong> remains the cleverest comic riff on material not noted for its abundance of laughs, though it still feels resolutely stagebound. Ernst Lubitsch’s <strong><a href="https://archive.org/details/to-be-or-not-to-be-1942-hd-lubitsch">To Be or Not to Be</a></strong> (1942; Internet Archive) has precious little to do with Shakespeare, but this frenzied second world war farce about a theatre company tackling Shakespeare in Nazi-occupied Warsaw remains the funniest work in all <em>Hamlet</em>-adjacent cinema.</p> <p><em>All titles in bold are widely available to stream unless otherwise specified.</em></p> <h2>Also new on streaming and DVD</h2>    <p><strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/the-wild-robot">The Wild Robot</a> </strong>A well-timed VOD release as the holidays approach, this elegant, highly affecting environmental fable about a shipwrecked android finding her place in nature is as sophisticated a major studio animation as any we’ve seen in years – and maybe a DreamWorks peak.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/cuckoo-2024">Cuckoo</a></strong> True to its title, Tilman Singer’s thoroughly delirious horror comedy makes not a lick of sense as it plunges a jittery American teenager (Hunter Schafer) into a suspiciously tranquil Alpine retreat: every obstacle is a new logical puzzler. But its stylish and gleefully absurd, with Dan Stevens having a whale of a time on villain duty.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://shop.bfi.org.uk/watership-down-limited-edition-4k-ultra-hd-edition.html?srsltid=AfmBOorwvsk792rsBTye1NiNTJ0wCET3RpYQv2sfnba4poOWPippx_XF">Watership Down</a></strong> (BFI) If your children are made of sturdier stuff, meanwhile, the BFI’s immaculate new 4K restoration of Martin Rosen’s viscerally grownup 1978 cartoon about exile, warfare and the circle of life – all in the realm of some very resilient rabbits – is an essential, exquisite rite of passage.</p>
