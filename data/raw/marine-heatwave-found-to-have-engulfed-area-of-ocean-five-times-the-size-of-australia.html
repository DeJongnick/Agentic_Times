<p>Almost 40 million sq kilometres of ocean around south-east Asia and the Pacific – an area five times the size of Australia – was engulfed in a marine heatwave in 2024, a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) report has revealed.</p> <p>WMO scientists said the record heat – on land and in the ocean – was mostly driven by the climate crisis and coincided with a string of extreme weather events, from deadly landslides in the Philippines to floods in Australia and rapid glacier loss in Indonesia.</p>    <p>The region was 0.48C hotter than the average recorded between 1991 and 2020, the WMO’s State of the Climate report stated.</p> <p>Satellite measurements showed sea levels were rising almost 4mm per year – “significantly higher” than the global average of 3.5mm, the report said.</p> <p>The WMO secretary general, Prof Celeste Saulo, said ocean heat and acidification had combined to “inflict long-lasting damage” to marine ecosystems and economies.</p> <p>“Sea-level rise is an existential threat to entire island nations. It is increasingly evident that we are fast running out of time to turn the tide,” Saulo said.</p>    <p>The report said extreme events that coincided with 2024’s heat included:</p> <ul> <li><p>Extreme rainfall in the Philippines in January and February causing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/10/philippines-rescuers-find-girl-alive-60-hours-after-landslide">flooding and landslides, killing at least 93 people</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Early-season heatwave in Australia resulting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/31/australia-heatwave-weather-sydney-melbourne-august-heat-record-temperatures">record August temperatures</a> across the country’s centre.</p></li> <li><p>Major flooding in Singapore and Malaysia, displacing 137,000 people and killing six.</p></li> <li><p>Flash flooding in March on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and major flooding in north Australia at the start of 2024.</p></li> <li><p>Rapid glacier loss in the west of New Guinea island, Indonesia, where the report said total ice loss could occur by 2026 or soon after.</p></li> <li><p>The Philippines struck by 12 tropical cyclones – double the average – with damage estimated at US$430m.</p></li> <li><p>Australia’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/23/australias-ski-season-could-melt-away-early-as-snowfall-drops-to-nearly-half-the-average">snow season ended “abnormally early”</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p>Ben Churchill, the WMO director for the region, said: “This is a message for stronger climate action. This report shows we’re seeing things we have never seen before.”</p> <p>The report found that in January, April, May and June last year, almost 40 million sq kilometres of the region’s ocean surface experienced moderate to strong heatwaves.</p>    <p>The ocean heat also drove the fifth mass coral bleaching across Australia’s Great Barrier Reef since 2016, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/19/graveyard-of-dead-coral-great-barrier-reef-bleaching-damage">causing widespread coral death</a>.</p> <p>Assoc Prof Alex Sen Gupta, a climate scientist at the University of New South Wales, said the heatwave was “pretty remarkable” and was part of a record-breaking jump in ocean temperatures globally that started in 2023.</p> <p>“We’ve really never seen anything like it and we’re struggling to explain why we saw such a big jump,” Sen Gupta said.</p> <p>The heatwave will have stressed many organisms in the ocean that have temperature thresholds, he said. “If you go beyond them, the organism starts to fail – they either move or die.”</p>
