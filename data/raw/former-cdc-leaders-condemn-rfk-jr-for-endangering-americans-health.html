<p>Nine former officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>’s leadership of the US health and human services department is “unlike anything our country has ever experienced” and “unacceptable”. They also warned that Kennedy’s leadership “should alarm every American, regardless of political leanings”.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/01/opinion/cdc-leaders-kennedy.html">guest essay</a> for the New York Times, the former CDC leaders said Kennedy’s actions were “unlike anything we have ever seen at the agency”.</p> <p>The letter comes days after Kennedy sought to dismiss Susan Monarez, the CDC director he appointed just months earlier. Monarez refused to leave her post, and was later fired by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>. Monarez said through lawyers the clash came after she refused to sign off on Kennedy’s directives.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/rfk-jr-vaccine-injury-compensation">RFK Jr says he’ll ‘fix’ a vaccine program - by canceling compensation for people with vaccine injuries</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the essay, titled “We Ran the C.D.C.: Kennedy Is Endangering Every American’s Health”, the former leaders, including Rochelle P Walensky, Mandy Cohen and Tom Frieden, said they were concerned Kennedy is “focusing “on unproven ‘treatments’ while downplaying vaccines” and cancelling medical research “that will leave us ill prepared for future health emergencies”.</p> <p>The former officials accused Kennedy of replacing “experts on federal health advisory committees with unqualified individuals who share his dangerous and unscientific views”.</p> <p>The letter comes as the Trump administration is pushing back on criticism of Kennedy’s leadership. </p> <p>The White House said last week that Trump and Kennedy aim to make the agency “more public-facing” and “more accountable”, and that they would be “strengthening our public health system and restoring it to its core mission of protecting Americans from communicable diseases, investing in innovation to prevent, detect and respond to future threats”.</p> <p>The arguments over the direction of the CDC center in part on disagreements over vaccination policies.</p> <p>Monarez was reportedly fired after clashing with Kennedy over vaccine policy.</p> <p>In a sign that it is a debate even Trump can’t escape, the president on Monday <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115128985245605660">in a Truth Social post</a> called on pharmaceutical companies to “justify” the success of the Covid vaccines that were initiated during his first term.</p> <p>“Many people think they are a miracle that saved Millions of lives. Others disagree! With CDC being ripped apart over this question, I want the answer, and I want it NOW.”</p> <p>Trump added that while the drug companies “go off to the next ‘hunt’ and let everyone rip themselves apart, including Bobby Kennedy Jr. and CDC”, they should “figure out the success or failure” of Covid drugs.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/cdc-demetre-daskalakis-rfk-jr-health">Former CDC official ‘only sees harm’ to public health under RFK Jr’s leadership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The White House has named deputy health secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/jim-oneill-cdc-profile">Jim O’Neill</a> to serve as acting CDC director.

He can only serve as an interim leader of the agency until a permanent director is confirmed by the Senate.</p> <p>Following Monarez’s firing, hundreds of CDC staffers rallied outside the agency’s headquarters in Atlanta in protest.
