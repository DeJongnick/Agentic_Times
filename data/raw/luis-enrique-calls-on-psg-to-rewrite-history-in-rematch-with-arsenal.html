<p>Luis Enrique believes that Paris Saint-Germain’s record against English clubs in the Champions League this season should give them confidence as they prepare to face Arsenal in the semi-final, and he hinted that he does not view the Premier League as the best in the world.</p> <p>The French champions face Mikel Arteta’s side at the Emirates Stadium in the first leg on Tuesday having already knocked out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/11/liverpool-psg-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/15/aston-villa-psg-champions-league-quarter-final-match-report">Aston Villa</a> to reach the last four after finishing 15th in the league stage. Luis Enrique suggested that their experience of playing against English clubs could be an advantage as they attempt to reach the final for only the second time in their history.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/28/nasser-al-khelaifi-psg-champions-league-arsenal">Nasser al-Khelaifi: powerful, divisive and fuelling PSG’s European dream</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“In terms of confidence, it is very positive for us,” he said. “We beat Liverpool and they won the Premier League this year. But that doesn’t mean anything because every single match is different. Everybody speaks about the Premier League as being the best league in the world. I don’t know if I agree or not. But we are full of confidence and looking forward to playing in the semi-final.”</p> <p>Luis Enrique said before taking over at PSG in 2023 that he wanted to work in English football in the future and has previously been linked with Chelsea and Tottenham. Asked to clarify whether he thought the Premier League is the best in the world Luis Enrique, who has a spiky relationship with the French media despite his successful record so far, said: “It doesn’t matter. Whatever I say, everybody is going to criticise me.”</p> <p>PSG were without their top scorer Ousmane Dembélé for their last trip to north London in October after the France forward had a falling out with Luis Enrique, with Kai Havertz and Bukayo Saka sealing a comfortable <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/01/arsenal-paris-saint-germain-champions-league-match-report">2-0 victory</a> for Arsenal. Luis Enrique said that his side, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/25/nice-hand-paris-saint-germain-first-league-defeat-before-arsenal-showdown">lost 3-1 against Nice</a> at the weekend to end a run of 30 matches unbeaten in Ligue 1, have learned from that game and are ready to make history after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/23/bayern-munich-paris-saint-germain-psg-champions-league-final-match-report">losing against Bayern Munich</a> in the 2020 final.</p> <p>“The game that you are talking about took place on 1 October so that was seven or eight months ago. There are huge differences between now and then,” he said. “I have reviewed the game, and seen how far our game has come and we are better now. We are a more complete team.</p> <p>“Our next objective is to rewrite history and there is only one way to do that. I would like to remind you that Arsenal has not won the Champions League before and only one of us will get the ticket to the final over the two legs and I hope that will be PSG.”</p> <p>Vitinha has been outstanding in PSG’s run to the semi-finals, although the Portugal midfielder said he has not been on his best form since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/15/aston-villa-psg-champions-league-quarter-final-match-report">the 3-2 defeat</a> to Villa in the second leg of their quarter-final. He only made 19 appearances for Wolves after joining them on a season’s loan from Porto as a 20-year-old in 2020 and believes he has benefited from the experience.</p> <p>“I don’t think I saw it as positive at the time,” he said. “When you’re young, you always want to play and be at your best. But it was incredible. It was positive and incredible. I developed on the pitch and in a human way. It also allowed me to be there. I wouldn’t change anything if I could.”</p>
