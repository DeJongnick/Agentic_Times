<p>Children as young as 11 feel tempted to try betting after being “flooded” by celebrities and sports stars promoting it, according to two reports that found nearly 90% of children aged 13-17 are exposed to gambling content online.</p> 
<p>The UK’s leading gambling charity, GambleAware, which commissioned the reports, urged regulators and policymakers to address <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/may/09/revealed-how-fun-social-media-accounts-direct-fans-to-betting-giant">social media accounts and influencers producing betting content</a> on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok and Twitch in light of the findings.</p> 
<p>In one survey of 2,100 children aged 11-17, a quarter said seeing a celebrity gambling, or advertising it, had made them want to follow suit, rising to more than a third (36%) among boys aged 16-17.</p> 
<p>This was despite the fact that almost four in five children agreed that nobody under the age of 18 should be exposed to content and advertising about gambling. The legal age to bet is 18.</p> 
<p>In a second study, based on focus groups with children aged 13-17, 16% reported seeing content creators sharing links and sign-up codes for gambling operators, while 14% reported seeing them sharing betting tips and tricks.</p> 
<p>The reports warned about content produced by mainstream UK operators as well as unlicensed sites promoting newer or unregulated products associated with video games <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/04/its-rotting-young-peoples-brains-the-murky-world-of-gambling-in-video-games">such as “skins betting”</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/02/video-game-loot-boxes-problem-gambling-betting-children">“loot boxes”</a>.</p> 
<p>Both involve the use of in-game digital items that have value to players and can be traded, staked or won via mechanisms that replicate real-life gambling.</p> 
<p>Niks Kolosnicins, 24, developed a gambling addiction that severely disrupted his schoolwork and lasted into his university years.</p> 
<p>“I used to see a huge amount of gambling ads when watching online streamers and esports – and with my favourite influencers promoting gambling, and many of my friends regularly betting, gambling became normalised for me,” he said.</p> 
<p>Children who contributed to the study referred to seeing well-known sports stars in gambling content.</p> 
<p>The Labour MP Beccy Cooper, who has called for a new gambling act to replace 2005 legislation introduced under Tony Blair’s government, said existing laws were “failing to protect children from online gambling marketing where influencers portray gambling as socially acceptable or aspirational”.</p> 
<p>She added that “future generations should look back on this era of proliferation, targeting and sports gamblification with the same level of disbelief”.</p> 
<p>The Liberal Democrat peer Don Foster described the report as “extremely concerning” and called for greater scrutiny of gambling advertising.</p> 
<p>Heather Wardle, a professor of gambling research and policy at Glasgow University, said content seen at an early age can mean that gambling becomes “embedded deeply within social practices”.</p> 
<p>“Evidence shows there is a real risk of escalating harms among this already higher-risk age group,” she added.</p> 
<p>The previous government and Labour have taken steps to tighten up elements of gambling regulation – including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/feb/23/online-slot-machine-stakes-capped-great-britian">cutting the maximum stake on online slot machines to £5</a> – but have stopped short of strict curbs on advertising.</p> 
<p>Zoe Osmond, the chief executive of GambleAware, said: “It is unacceptable that children’s environments continue to be flooded with age-restricted content.”</p> 
<p>A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: “We recognise the impact harmful gambling can have on individuals and their families, and we are absolutely committed to strengthening protections for those at risk, including children and young people.</p> 
<p>“There are already a range of robust rules in place on gambling adverts, including rules to ensure adverts are not targeted at or strongly appeal to children.</p> 
<p>“We will continue to work closely with the gambling industry to ensure that advertising is appropriate, responsible, and does not exacerbate harm.”</p> 
<p>The Guardian approached the Betting and Gaming Council for comment. </p>
