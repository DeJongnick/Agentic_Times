<h1>Thursday news quiz: resignations, recriminations and a mysterious doorbell menace</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-09-11T10:00:51Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p>After <a href="https://martinbelam.com/2025/guardian-thursday-quiz-hiatus-boooooooooooooo/">a summer hiatus</a>, the Thursday quiz is back, back, back, baby! For new readers, that means every Thursday on the Guardian app or website you face 15 questions on stories that have been in the news the week before, alongside a smattering of general knowledge and pop culture. Think of it like a combination between a topical pub quiz and Trivial Pursuit. As you will discover, it also doesn’t <em>entirely</em> take itself seriously.</p> 
<p>For regular and returning readers, thank you so much for your many kind emails and <a href="https://martinbelam.com/2025/guardian-thursday-quiz-hiatus-boooooooooooooo/#comments-start">comments</a> about the absence of the quiz this summer. Rest assured, having had weeks and weeks to think about and redesign the format, it is basically still going to be the same old nonsense. There are no prizes, it is just for fun, and we love it when you tell us how you got on in the comments. Allons-y!</p>

The Thursday quiz said some rude words, 7:D - The work was based around a daily newspaper of the same name that was published between 1711 and 1712, 8:C - Atlético Dorking isn't quite such an outlandish suggestion, as the women's team that the Thursday quiz supports –&nbsp;London Seaward – appear to have changed their name to Atlético London., 9:A - Some people have a lot of time on their hands, don't they?, 10:B - The Irish chef has already become a regular on the BBC’s cooking programmes, and both have previous experience as guest judges on the show, 11:D - He will be reprising his role as a priest, 12:C - Having opening in 1960 as one of the first ever purpose built TV studio complexes, it was sold in 2012 with lots of the old offices converted into flats. Rumours that the Thursday quiz has repeatedly tried to purchase the flat that used to be the Doctor Who production office have been denied, 13:C - Acutis, who died of leukaemia aged 15, built multilingual websites to spread Catholic teaching, later earning him the nickname 'God’s influencer', 14:A - I mean, it isn't like the Thursday quiz hasn't ever done it either, it is just the quiz wouldn't be telling everybody in interviews, 15:C - The slug had been sliding up and down the bell plate, creating havoc in the building</p>
