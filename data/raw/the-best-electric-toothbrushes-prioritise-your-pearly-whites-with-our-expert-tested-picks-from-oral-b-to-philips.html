<p>If you grew up using a conventional toothbrush – essentially a stick with bristles on the end – you may be surprised to learn just how long the electric toothbrush has been around. The first was designed in the late 1930s, but that model was a long way from the sleek, feature-packed and Bluetooth-enabled beasts you can buy today.</p> <p>There are now dozens of ultra-advanced versions on the market, but which ones are worth your cash? For the past two months, my teeth have become figurative guinea pigs to help you find the answer to that question. I put a bunch of electric toothbrushes from Oral-B, Philips, Suri, Ordo, Silk’n, Foreo and more through their paces to separate the best from the rest. Here are my conclusions.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>At a glance</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Best electric toothbrush overall:</strong><br>Spotlight Sonic Pro</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://uk.spotlightoralcare.com/products/sonic-pro-pure-white" > £100.23 with code GUARDIAN5 at Spotlight </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best value electric toothbrush:</strong><br>Icy Bear Next-Generation sonic toothbrush</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bear-Next-Generation-Sonic-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B0DT72NKTH/" > £64.99 at Amazon </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best electric toothbrush for sustainability:</strong><br>Suri 2.0</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.trysuri.com/products/suri-2-sustainable-sonic-toothbrush-uv-c-led-case" > £105 at Suri </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best premium electric toothbrush:</strong><br>Philips Sonicare Smart 9400</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-Sonicare-DiamondClean-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B09BW5SJBD" > £222.97 at Amazon </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best oscillating toothbrush:</strong><br>Oral-B iO3</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.boots.com/oral-b-io3-electric-toothbrush-matt-black-travel-case--10331465" > £65 at Boots </a>  <p>***</p> <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>As well as having the physical qualities required to test electric toothbrushes (my own teeth and a reliable toothpaste budget), I’ve been testing electronics – phones, drones and everything in between – for more than a decade.</p> <p>Also – and I’ll put this delicately to prevent you from closing the page in justified disgust – as someone who has to wear a retainer every night after Invisalign treatment, the toothbrushes weren’t short of nasties to clean during testing. They’ve seen things, man.</p> <h2>How I tested</h2>    <p>I doubt many people include the four minutes spent brushing their teeth as a highlight of even the most tedious day, so spare a thought for the months when it became my life’s obsessive focus. Fortunately, and purely by chance, this coincided with a dentist’s visit in which I appeared to have undergone a Damascene conversion to good oral hygiene, so it did have its upside.</p> <p>Anyway, the process was actually pretty simple: brush, brush and brush again, taking note of mouthfeel, grip, cleanliness, the features that appealed and those little things that made me irrationally grumpy. I used plaque-disclosing tablets, which turn your teeth a charming shade of pink and blue to reveal areas where plaque resides. Even the cheapest brushes did a good job of removing the blue, though, even if they didn’t <em>feel</em> as clean, so this test proved unhelpful.</p> <p>Ultimately, while each of the 21 brushes I tested was leagues ahead of manual toothbrushes, I ordered them based on performance, features, feel, stamina and – perhaps most importantly, given how close the final results were – value for money.</p> <p>A quick note on that: toothbrush recommended retail prices (RRPs) are often what you’d call “aspirational”. They’re frequently on offer, and even £500 models regularly go on sale for less than half price. It’s worth clicking through and checking what today’s price is on the off-chance.</p> <h2>***</h2> <h2>The best electric toothbrushes in 2025</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best electric toothbrush overall:</em> <br>Spotlight Sonic Pro</h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://uk.spotlightoralcare.com/products/sonic-pro-pure-white" > £100.23 with code GUARDIAN5 at Spotlight </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jet-BlackSonic-Pro-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B0CMV771ND" > £105.50 at Amazon </a>  <p>The Spotlight Sonic Pro is a great all-rounder, with excellent features and a price that doesn’t verge on ridiculous. Founded by two sibling dentists, Spotlight has only two electric toothbrushes for adults at the moment, and the Pro model tested here delivers on every metric that counts.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>First of all, the Spotlight Sonic Pro performs an impressive clean. Its four modes range from 30,000 (gentle) to 50,000 (polish) brush strokes a minute (BPM). That makes it the second most powerful sonic brush I tested, and the two that delivered more have RRPs starting at £400. While not completely necessary for a healthy mouth, such speeds help provide that “fresh from the hygienist” feeling, even when your teeth are crying out for a thorough clean after a day mainlining soft drinks.</p> <p>It also packs a pressure sensor to make sure you’re not brushing too hard and potentially damaging your gums, and there are four lights just below the head to show how far you are into your two-minute brushing cycle.</p> <p>Flip the heads over and you’ll find a tongue cleaner, plus it comes with a handy travel case too. While this doesn’t charge the brush, the magnetic USB-C charging base is pretty compact, and a single charge can last up to 70 days, which is above average for an electric toothbrush. Even at the higher speeds I was using it at, it didn’t show any signs of slowing down during the testing period, so that feels accurate. </p> <p>If you can do without the pressure sensor, progress lights, tongue cleaner and polish setting, you’re likely to be just as happy with the <a href="https://uk.spotlightoralcare.com/products/spotlight-sonic-brush">non-Pro version</a> and can save a few quid.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>modes aren’t labelled on the brush itself, even if you can easily feel the difference.</p> <p><strong>Type: </strong>sonic <br><strong>Modes</strong>: four (gentle, clean, white and polish) <br><strong>Power</strong>: 50,000 BPM <br><strong>Pressure sensor: </strong>yes <br><strong>Battery life</strong>: up to 70 days <br><strong>App</strong>: no</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best value electric toothbrush:</em> <br>Icy Bear Next-Generation sonic toothbrush</h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bear-Next-Generation-Sonic-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B0DT72NKTH" > £64.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>There were three strong contenders in the £50-65 price bracket that I was considering for the best-value pick (the <a href="https://www.ordolife.com/products/ordo-sonic-toothbrush-charcoal-grey">£59.99 Ordo Sonic+</a> and the <a href="https://www.silkn.co.uk/sonicsmile-plus-SILK000157.html">£50 Silk’n SonicSmile Plus</a> were the others), but I ultimately chose the £65 Icy Bear because it was the only one to come with a pressure sensor. In fact, this was the cheapest toothbrush I reviewed that had one.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Oddly, the pressure sensor isn’t pitched as the main selling point, which is instead, rather confusingly, fingerprint recognition. This isn’t some kind of added dental security – it’s to prevent it from being activated in luggage without needing an extra case, and it works pretty well (with a perfectly angled edge and a lot of effort, I was able to turn it on without skin contact – but it’s not something you’ll do by accident).</p> <p>Otherwise, it ticks all the boxes. The top of the handle glows white when in use, and flashes ominously if you’re pushing too hard, and there are a generous five brushing modes. At its maximum power, it hits a very respectable 40,000 BPM for a solid clean, too.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>there’s no charging stand, and you’ll need to open up a flap on the base for USB-C charging.</p> <p><strong>Type: </strong>sonic<strong> <br>Modes:</strong> five (clean, whiten, polish, massage and sensitive) <br><strong>Power</strong>: 40,000 BPM <br><strong>Pressure sensor: </strong>yes <br><strong>Battery life</strong>: up to 45 days <br><strong>App</strong>: no</p> <p><strong>***</strong></p> <h2><em>Best electric toothbrush for sustainability:</em> <br>Suri 2.0</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.trysuri.com/products/suri-2-sustainable-sonic-toothbrush-uv-c-led-case" > £105 at Suri </a>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0FLR3YRFL" > £105 at Amazon </a>  <p>The <a href="https://www.trysuri.com/products/suri-sustainable-sonic-toothbrush-uv-c-led-case">original Suri toothbrush</a> was not only solid, but also the only real choice for the climate-conscious in an industry that doesn’t seem to have taken much notice of the climate emergency.</p> <p>Unfortunately, it had a couple of issues that held it back: it lacked a pressure sensor, and the spring-pin charging system broke no fewer than three times on me. Both of these problems have been fixed in Suri 2.0, making it an easy recommendation.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>In short, you no longer need to feel like you’re missing out by opting for a green option. The Suri 2.0’s slim design is lightweight and better suited for trips away than ever, thanks to a new travel lock and plant-based head cover.</p> <p>Meanwhile, its unreliable spring-pin charger has been replaced by a wireless version (both in the bundled case and stand), and its new pressure sensor vibrates three times and pauses the brush if you push too hard.</p> <p>All of this builds on what made the original so good: its eco-friendly credentials. The company has been working with ClimatePartner to offset 100% of its emissions (including transport and manufacturing), and it provides a postage-paid compostable bag to send the used heads back for recycling. These <a href="https://www.trysuri.com/products/suri-sustainable-sonic-replacement-heads">heads (three for £14.99, or cheaper on a subscription</a>), incidentally, are cornstarch, with the bristles made of castor oil.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>it’s a little lacking in the power department, with its 33,000 BPM vibration frequency feeling noticeably less thorough than its rivals.</p> <p><strong>Type: </strong>sonic<strong><br>Modes: </strong>two (clean and polish)<strong><br>Power:</strong> 33,000 BPM<strong><br>Pressure sensor: </strong>yes<strong><br>Battery life:</strong> 1+ month<br><strong>App: </strong>no</p> <p><em><strong>To find out more, read our full <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/03/suri-20-electric-toothbrush-review">Suri 2.0 toothbrush review</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best premium</em><em> electric toothbrush:</em> <br>Philips Sonicare Smart 9400</h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/philips-sonicare-diamondclean-smart-9400-electric-toothbrush-with-charging-case/black/p6066291" > £399.99 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-Sonicare-DiamondClean-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B09BW5SJBD" > £222.97 at Amazon </a>  <p>If you have a toothbrush budget most people could only dream of, then the Philips Sonicare Smart 9400 is the one to go for. I also tested the <a href="https://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/HX9992_12/sonicare-9900-prestige-power-toothbrush-with-senseiq">DiamondClean 9900</a>, which retails for slightly more than the Amazon price, but I actually slightly prefer the way this one charges.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>When I took the Sonicare 9400 out of the box, I thought they’d packed the wrong charger. It turns out that the handy rinse glass included in the package <em>is</em> how it charges. You rest the charging puck underneath it, and the toothbrush charges through the glass when not in use. What a time to be alive.</p> <p>With up to 62,000 motions a minute, it’s the joint most powerful sonic brush I tested (tying with the aforementioned DiamondClean 9900), and you can really feel the results after use. It has four modes – clean (with three intensities), deep clean, gum health and white – feels comfortable in the hand, and comes with a charging case if you don’t want to take the magical glass charger on the road.</p> <p>It also connects to a rather excellent app to track your brushing habits. Unlike with the DiamondClean 9900, where it’s the only way to cycle between modes, you don’t have to use it. But if you do, you’ll receive guidance on your brushing, showing the areas you’ve missed and giving you the option to spend a bit longer on them if needed. It can be connected with Apple Health for iPhone data nerds, and it’ll even automatically reorder brush heads for you if you want, so you’re never caught short.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>it misses out on the sensitive mode of the DiamondClean 9900, so those with tooth pain may want to look elsewhere. Battery life is also rather stingy, thanks to the Bluetooth.</p> <p><strong>Type: </strong>sonic<strong> <br>Modes:</strong> four (clean, deep clean+, gum health and white+) <br><strong>Power</strong>: 62,000 BPM <br><strong>Pressure sensor: </strong>yes <br><strong>Battery life</strong>: up to 14 days <br><strong>App</strong>: yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best oscillating toothbrush:</em> <br>Oral-B iO3</h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.boots.com/oral-b-io3-electric-toothbrush-matt-black-travel-case--10331465" > £65 at Boots </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Oral-B-Electric-Toothbrush-Christmas-Whitening/dp/B0C3HXG15J" > £65 at Amazon </a>  <p>This oscillating toothbrush (which moves the bristles in a circular motion, rather than vibrating like most other brushes here – see the buying guide below for more information) isn’t technically the best one you can buy, as you can probably tell from the fact that Oral-B’s iO line goes all the way up to the iO10. But because they all use the same motor and brush, and thus offer similar performance, this is the one I recommend: it jettisons unnecessary extras (like a connected app and screen) in order to simply deliver the features you need for a great clean.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>It boasts three modes – daily clean, sensitive and whiten – and its round heads are small enough to get into tight areas. Most importantly, its pressure sensor won’t only tell you when you’re applying too much pressure, but also when you’re applying too little, via an easy-to-understand white/green/red lighting system in a ring at the top of the handle.</p> <p>While it has fewer modes than the higher-numbered iOs, it delivers the same dentist-fresh-feeling performance, while retailing for a fraction of their optimistic RRPs.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>at £15 for two, <a href="https://shop.oralb.co.uk/toothbrush-heads/io-series.list">replacement heads</a> are a touch on the pricey side.

The sonic vibrations are still present here – with 16 intensities – but they’re significantly more gentle than the other models, as they’re designed to be supplemented by traditional brushing motions.</p> <p>Foreo reckons that said bristles are up to 10,000 times more hygienic than their nylon counterparts, which means the head needs replacing only every six months. The company also says the brush will go for an entire year on a single charge. Naturally, it’s been impossible to emulate that much use during the testing period, but it’s certainly shown no signs of slowing down, and given a charge takes only two hours, it won’t be a big hardship if it falls a little short.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> for me, it simply didn’t remove plaque as effectively in two minutes as its more traditional rivals, even with the added push of manual scrubbing.</p> <p><strong>Type: </strong>sonic hybrid;<strong> modes:</strong> one (with 16 intensity levels); <strong>power</strong>: 11,000 BPM; <strong>pressure sensor: </strong>no; <strong>battery life</strong>: up to 365 days; <strong>app</strong>: no</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Coulax C8</h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sonic-Electric-Toothbrush-Adults-Kids/dp/B0CD467G3F" > £19.99 at Amazon </a>  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> if money is tight</p> <p>I thought the cheap and cheerful <a href="https://www.superdrug.com/toiletries/dental/electrical-toothbrush/superdrug-procare-rechargeable-electric-toothbrush-black/p/780348">£18.50 Superdrug ProCare model</a> would be the most affordable model on test, but this bestseller from Amazon comes with a surprising number of features.</p> <p>For less than £20, you get a toothbrush with five settings, up to 40,000 BPM and eight(!) brush heads in the box. While my mouth didn’t feel as fresh as with more expensive models, bluntly, it didn’t feel like a quarter of the performance for a quarter of the price.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because … </strong>while I had no issues with my test unit, Amazon’s AI analysis of its customer reviews found that “some customers report that it turns on randomly, doesn’t charge, and doesn’t retain any charge”.

The answer is lots, but not enough to justify its price, hence the inclusion here.</p> <p>It comes with a whopping seven cleaning modes (daily clean, sensitive, gum care, intense, whiten, super sensitive and tongue clean), a colour screen to cycle through them, and built-in 3D teeth tracking that can detect 16 mouth zones to indicate how your technique is in the connected app. It charges quickly too – just three hours via the magnetic charging stand or the bundled snazzy charging case and proprietary cable with a plug.</p> <p>There is a middle ground between this and the recommended iO3 above, with the <a href="https://shop.oralb.co.uk/io6-grey-opal-electric-toothbrush-with-travel-case/13525808.html">Oral-B iO6</a> offering a black-and-white screen and a connected app, albeit with slower charging, a non-charging case, weaker position tracking and fewer modes.

As such, plenty of people may find that manufacturers inadvertently (or, cynically, advertently) oversell their stamina.</p> <p>Still, if battery life is the be-all and end-all for you, you should give the Silk’n SonicYou a look. Although it is not as good as that of the Foreo, the manufacturer suggests you’ll get up to 300 days’ use with it, if you use the sensitive (30,000 strokes a minute) setting twice a day for a total of four minutes. That’ll obviously go down faster if you brush more often, for longer, or use the 37,000-stroke-a-minute whitening mode, but given most of the brushes I was testing were rated in the 14- to 90-day area, it’s still a stamina champion. It certainly didn’t need charging while I was using it.</p> <p>Infrequent charging can be a curse if you’re dealing with a bespoke charger that you can’t find when the time comes, but thankfully you just need to pop open the base and connect a common-or-garden USB-C cable to top it up.</p> <p><strong>I</strong><strong>t didn’t make the final cut because … </strong>battery life is often directly linked to the power of the brush, and while 37,000 BPM is nothing to be sneezed at, you can get more power if you’re prepared to charge more often.</p> <p><strong>Type: </strong>sonic;<strong> modes:</strong> three (sensitive, clean and white); <strong>power</strong>: 37,000 BPM; <strong>Pressure sensor: </strong>no; <strong>battery life</strong>: up to 300 days; <strong>app</strong>: no</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Whites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrush</h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.superdrug.com/toiletries/dental/electrical-toothbrush/whites-beaconsfield-sonic-led-electric-toothbrush/p/mp-00142013" > £49.99 at Superdrug </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Whites-Beaconsfield-Sonic-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B092FL92KQ" > £49.99 at Amazon </a>  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> whitening</p> <p>While many toothbrushes (including this one) have a built-in whitening setting that adds time or alternates speeds to remove surface stains, the Whites Beaconsfield sonic LED toothbrush – with its terrifying picture of a toothy strawberry on the box – goes the extra mile by including blue light whitening technology. The company says this can whiten teeth by an average of 2.5 shades in three days.</p> <p>A week’s use did indeed appear to make my teeth appear <em>slightly </em>lighter in before-and-after shots, although you shouldn’t expect miracles. All the same, combining this with whitening toothpaste and other products could really make a difference in the long run.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because … </strong>other toothbrushes offer a cleaner-feeling mouth.

Without them, “it’s harder to get the same result”, says Caitlin Miller, head of hygiene and therapy at Bupa Dental Care UK. “To get the same level of cleaning found with an electric toothbrush, you’d have to spend a lot longer than two minutes brushing with a manual.”</p> <p>The reasons are threefold, she explains: manual dexterity, people are more likely to use their expensive electric device properly and sheer power.</p> <p>“You don’t have to really do anything with it, and it does a better job,” Miller says. “That’s not to say that they suit everybody. There are people who can do a perfectly good job with a manual toothbrush, but for most of my patients, I will see improvements when people go on to an electric toothbrush.”</p> <h2>How do you use an electric toothbrush?</h2> <p>“You want to hold your toothbrush at a 45-degree angle – half on the gum, half on the tooth. You should just be holding it horizontally, sweeping across the tooth and gum margins,” says Miller, adding that you should move slowly, allocating a couple of seconds for each tooth.</p> <p>“You don’t move it up and down, you don’t need to move it round and round. That’s the beauty of the electric toothbrush: you can be pretty lazy with it and it still does a good job.”</p> <p>But a common mistake is to press too hard, which is why some of the brushes in our guide come with pressure sensors – something actively recommended by Miller. “If you’ve got too much pressure, you’re essentially dampening the vibrations and bristles.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/06/best-mattress">The best mattresses: sleep better with our six rigorously tested picks</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How often do you need to charge an electric toothbrush?</h2> <p>This varies hugely between toothbrushes, and depends on how often you brush and the settings you use. The only certainty is that you need to charge them more often than a manual toothbrush – which is to say “at all”.</p> <p>According to Miller, plenty of patients fall back on inferior manual brushing because of this. “The number of people who say, ‘Oh, I do have an electric toothbrush, but I always forget to charge it, and then it takes three days, so I just use my manual toothbrush,’” she laments. “Keeping it charged is quite important.”</p> <p>The good news is that batteries now tend to be lithium-ion, meaning they charge quickly, and they last a decent amount of time, too.</p> <p>The ones I tested had manufacturer-quoted battery lives of between 14 and 365 days, which is an enormous gulf. Plenty of factors play into this, including power, connectivity and the size of the battery itself, but it’s also worth bearing in mind how this is measured. Generally, a manufacturer counts a day as four minutes of brushing over two sessions, but it might be more or less, so read the small print.</p> <p>You may instinctively be drawn to brushes with longer battery ratings, but convenience is also a factor. A proprietary charger might be more of a faff than a USB-C one, or a charging dock that sits neatly on the sink, especially if months go between charges and you forget where your cable lives.</p> <p>You may also want to charge more often than required. Anecdotally, I can easily feel the difference in strength between a toothbrush approaching the end of its battery and the same model fresh off the charger.</p> <h2>How often do you need to replace your toothbrush head?</h2> <p>As for replacing the heads, Miller suggests you do this every three months – or earlier if it looks splayed or frayed because its cleaning performance will suffer. “You can see it under a microscope: it gets really worn on top.”</p> <p>Beyond an electric toothbrush, Miller stresses the importance of cleaning between the teeth, and she has a clear order of preference: interdental brushes, then floss and finally <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jun/03/best-water-flosser-uk">water flossers</a>.</p> <p>“If I’ve got patients who won’t use anything often, if I can get them on a water flosser, then that’s better than nothing,” she says.</p> <h2>The different types of electric toothbrush: oscillating v sonic toothbrushes</h2> <p>There are two main types of toothbrushes on the market: oscillating and sonic – with the latter seemingly dominating at the moment. “They work differently, but they’re both doing a similar sort of thing,” says Miller.</p> <p>In short, an oscillating toothbrush moves the bristles back and forth in a circular motion, while sonic brushes use vibrations to move the bristles in two directions to loosen plaque. The latter is measured in brush strokes per minute (BPM) and my selection was rated between 11,000 and 62,000 BPM. Miller says some of her clients find the sonic brushes a bit “ticklish” at first, but this is something you can get used to over time.</p> <p>Which is better? A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/idh.12597">systematic review and meta-analysis of 38 comparison studies</a> published in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene found a “small but clinically relevant advantage” for oscillating brushes. But it added that it’s “unlikely that dental care professionals in routine examination would be able to detect [the] small differences” between the two, meaning that personal preference should ultimately rule supreme.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Alan Martin is a </em><em>writer</em><em> who </em><em>has been putting products – </em><em>including phones, gaming devices and wearable</em><em>s – through their paces for </em><em>more than a decade</em><em>.
