<p>Sales of electric vehicles continue to climb, with 12% of new sales between January and June this year being battery electric or plug-in hybrid – up from 9.6% in the same period last year – data from the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) shows.</p> <p>As drivers across the country <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/16/positives-and-negatives-is-it-better-to-learn-to-drive-in-an-electric-or-a-petrol-vehicle">adapt to the new technology</a>, Guardian readers share their tips and biggest surprises since switching from an internal combustion engine [ICE] car to an EV.</p> <p>Readers said they preferred the simplicity of “one-pedal driving”, a feature of some EVs that lets the driver control acceleration and braking using only one pedal.</p> <p>Many also mentioned regenerative braking, found in electric and hybrid vehicles, which recovers energy from braking to recharge the battery. Here’s what they said on these and other issues: </p> <h2>One-pedal driving</h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I love the one-pedal driving with the regenerative braking. For the first time in my life (I’m 53, have had a number of cars in my life, all manual) I feel calmed by driving.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jen, Brisbane, Queensland</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>One-pedal driving is the best thing since sliced bread, though I could do with even more aggressive dynamic braking. I find that the high level of braking you get without using friction brakes changes the way you drive.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Brett, Gladstone, Queensland</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Big difference is regenerative braking, and even bigger [is] one-pedal driving. In China, they’ve found if learners only use [one-pedal driving] they have no familiarity with the brake pedal, there have been instances of them hitting the accelerator pedal instead of the brake in an emergency.</p> <p>I think learners should experience driving a non-regenerative braking vehicle as well as an electric one.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Mike, Falcon, Western Australia</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Love it, but one thing to learn. There is one-pedal mode and the normal two-pedal mode. One-pedal mode is great – foot off the pedal and the car will brake and stop. [Two-] pedal mode and the car will brake but continue at approximately 5km/h. Be aware of it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Steve, Traralgon, Victoria</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/16/positives-and-negatives-is-it-better-to-learn-to-drive-in-an-electric-or-a-petrol-vehicle">Positives and negatives: is it better to learn to drive in an electric or a petrol vehicle?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Clear air</h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I have long been something of a petrolhead but the one thing people never mention is that combustion engines, and particularly petrol ones, stink.</p> <p>Every time I go to a capital city I am struck by the noise and stink of cars in the built-up areas. Some years ago when electric cars started to look like a reality, it dawned on me that this was completely unnecessary. I started to wonder if once sufficient people were driving electric, the public’s intolerance for breathing the pollution of other people’s exhaust would drive combustion engines out of cities.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Brett, Gladstone, Queensland</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Smoother, easier, cheaper to operate, cleaner, quieter, better performance. All together nicer.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Peter, Canberra, ACT</strong></p> <h2>Solar savings</h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It’s fast, quiet, low-cost to run and every morning I start with a ‘full tank’ from home charging. With off-street parking and a proper wall charger, especially paired with solar, running costs plunge. Public charging is only for road trips, and the car tells you exactly where and how long to charge.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>David, Port Melbourne, Victoria</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>When we have to drive to Brisbane for medical appointments (almost 500km round trip) – the EV means our trip costs as little as $5 in fast charger fees. We could make it without charging but like to keep a buffer for the Cunninghams Gap road works. We use our solar to charge at home which is good because the solar credits are so low as to be negligible.</p> <p>When we did a holiday trip to Melbourne earlier this year it cost us $400 for the round trip – inland [on the way] and coast on return. We only stopped in towns with chargers to reward them for putting in the infrastructure – I know that several towns such as Goulburn have installed them since our trip.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Maree, Stanthorpe, Queensland</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I like adaptive cruise control, lane assist, regenerative braking, quick off the mark, quiet, very cheap to run – we have solar and battery. The only potential disadvantage is that I don’t have these things in my diesel 4WD so have to be mindful of the different cruise control and no auto stop.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Matt, Junortoun, Victoria</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Smoother, quieter, better tech. We charge it from solar, so it’s only cost us $15 so far this year. We’d never go back to an ICE vehicle.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Geoff, Ashbury, New South Wales</strong></p> <h2>Joy of driving</h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I rate the Kona EV as the best car I have ever driven after 59 years of driving experience. I was not expecting the move to an EV to provide such joy of driving.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>John, Sarsfield, Victoria</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Fast. Fun. Furious. Scorching hot hatch. Manoeuvrable. Fabulous brakes. Super clever safety features, including autonomous emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, lane departure warning, traffic jam assist, rear cross-traffic alert, blind-spot detection and 360-degree camera. Great app. Like switching from a rotary dial phone to an iPhone.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Tim, Canberra, ACT</strong></p>
