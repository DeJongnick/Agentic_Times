<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Israel began its long-threatened <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-launches-ground-offensive-deep-inside-gaza-city">ground offensive in Gaza City</a> on Tuesday, sending tanks and remote-controlled armoured cars packed with explosives into its streets, in defiance of international criticism and a UN commission of inquiry’s finding that it was committing genocide in the Palestinian territory.</p> <p>Israel’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, said the goals of the offensive were “defeating the enemy and evacuating the population”, omitting any mention of the freeing of the remaining Israeli hostages, which had been a constantly stated war aim until now. Hostage families and their supporters protested near Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence on Tuesday, accusing him of abandoning their loved ones.</p> <p>The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said it was clear that Israel had no interest in a peaceful outcome. The ground assault was launched on the day that a panel of human rights experts commissioned by the UN published a report <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry">accusing Israel of committing genocide</a>.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What are Palestinians in Gaza City reporting?</strong> Many have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/running-from-death-to-death-gaza-city-residents-face-impossible-choice">forcibly displaced</a> numerous times in “unbearable” conditions and some say they will remain in Gaza City despite the risks. Fatima al-Zahra Sahweil, a researcher, said: “There is not a single day without bombings and deaths in the south, even in the so-called humanitarian zones that the army declared. So, would I just be running from death to death?”</p></li> <li><p><strong>This is a developing story. </strong>Follow on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/17/israel-gaza-offensive-middle-east-latest-news-updates">our liveblog</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Suspect in Charlie Kirk killing</strong><strong> charged with aggravated murder</strong></h2>    <p>Utah state prosecutors have charged Tyler Robinson, the man accused of killing the far-right activist Charlie Kirk, with aggravated murder and said they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/charlie-kirk-shooter-charged">intend to seek the death penalty</a> if he is convicted.</p> <p>Jeff Gray, the top prosecutor in Utah county, where Kirk was shot dead on 10 September, said Robinson had ordered his roommate to delete incriminating text messages and stay silent if questioned after the Turning Point USA executive director’s killing.</p> <p>The charges filed against Robinson include aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm and witness tampering.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Why have prosecutors said they will pursue the death penalty?</strong> Gray said the aggravating circumstances were the 31-year-old Kirk’s “political expression” and the fact that children were present to witness the killing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>What do we know about Robinson’s possible motivations?</strong> He is alleged to have sent a text message to his roommate reading: “I had enough of his hatred.
