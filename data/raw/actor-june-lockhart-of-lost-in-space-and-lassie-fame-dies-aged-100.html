<p>June Lockhart, the popular actor known for her work in film and television, has passed away at the age of 100.</p> <p>She died on Thursday night of natural causes, with daughter June Elizabeth and granddaughter Christianna by her side, according to <a href="https://people.com/june-lockhart-dead-lassie-and-lost-in-space-actress-dies-at-100-8621340">People</a>.</p> <p>Family spokesperson Lyle Gregory, a friend of 40 years, told the Associated Press: “She was very happy up until the very end, reading the New York Times and LA Times every day. It was very important to her to stay focused on the news of the day.”</p> <p>Born in New York City in 1925, Lockhart was the daughter of actors Gene and Kathleen Lockhart. She first appeared on the stage at just eight years old in a Metropolitan Opera production of Peter Ibbetson. Her first film appearance came in 1938’s A Christmas Carol, playing the daughter of Bob Cratchit.</p> <p>On Broadway, she starred in For Love or Money in 1947 and The Grand Prize in 1955. Her performance in For Love or Money earned her a special Tony award for outstanding performance by a newcomer in 1948.</p> <p>The actor began her television career in 1949 with guest appearances on programs such as Hallmark Hall of Fame, Shirley Temple’s Storybook, Wagon Train and Gunsmoke. Over nearly 80 years in entertainment, she continued to work steadily, appearing in shows such as Petticoat Junction, General Hospital, Beverly Hills 90210, The Beverly Hillbillies, Happy Days, Full House, Roseanne and Grey’s Anatomy.</p> <p>She achieved particular fame for her leading role on Lassie beginning in 1958. Then, from 1965 to 1968, she portrayed the matriarch of a family of space explorers in Lost in Space. Decades later, in 2021, she made a voice cameo in Netflix’s reboot of the same series.</p> <p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.wusf.org/2004-04-27/june-lockhart-recalls-lassie-lost-in-space">NPR</a> in 2004, Lockhart reflected on how the Lost in Space series had inspired viewers: “People would tell her that watching Lost in Space inspired them to become scientists. I did Lassie for six years, and I never had anybody come up to me and say: ‘It made me want to be a farmer.’”</p> <p>Lockhart received two Emmy nominations, including one for best actress in a leading role in a dramatic series, for Lassie. She was honored with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for film and one for television.</p> <p>In 1951, she married John F Maloney. The couple had two daughters, Anne and June Elizabeth, before divorcing in 1959.</p> <p>Funeral services will be held privately. The family has requested that, instead of sending flowers, donations be made to the Actors Fund, ProPublica and International Hearing Dog Inc.</p>
