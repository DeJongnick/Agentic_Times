<p>When giving advice about protein intake linked to exercise, the performance nutritionist Bethan Crouse says: “If you are just a casual gym-goer doing resistance training three to four times a week” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/01/is-it-true-that-you-should-eat-protein-after-workouts-to-see-muscle-gains">Is it true that … you should eat protein immediately after working out?, 1 September</a>). I was surprised that this training was described as casual. I would suggest the other 99.9% of non-elite humans would consider this level of commitment regular, dare I say even serious.<br><strong>Diego Penagos</strong><br><em>Surbiton, London</em></p> <p>• It is clear that Richard Tice neither believes in free speech nor understands the Christian gospel, since he thinks the archbishop of York should not “interfere with international migration policies” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/31/richard-tice-church-archbishop-criticism-reform-immigration-policy">Richard Tice hits back at C of E criticism of Reform immigration policy, 31 August</a>). Does he plan to tell Christians the matters on which we are now allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;express opinions?<br><strong>Michael Sanderson</strong><br><em>Elsecar, South Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• There’s no justification for flying Adam Zampa from Australia to deliver 20 balls in the Hundred final at Lord’s (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/31/oval-invincibles-trent-rockets-men-hundred-final-match-report">Report, 31 August</a>). What a sad indictment of our cricket standing that we have to fly someone halfway around the world for such a ridiculous contribution to a&nbsp;major home tournament.<br><strong>Andrew Barson</strong><br><em>Anlaby, East Riding of Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• We have flown the Welsh flag, Y Ddraig Goch, in our back garden for a number of years (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/31/is-flying-the-st-georges-cross-a-sign-of-racism-or-patriotism">Letters, 31 August</a>). It is a good indicator of which way the wind is blowing.<br><strong>Helen Evans</strong><br><em>Ruthin, Denbighshire</em></p> <p>• My favourite politicians’ phrase: “lessons will be learned” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/give-more-respect-to-women-killed-by-their-family">Letters, 31 August</a>). We’re all still waiting.<br><strong>David Prothero</strong><br><em>Harlington, Bedfordshire</em> </p> <p>• On returning from the V&amp;A, I was surprised to read that, according to two scholars, there was no such place as Palestine in the early 20th century (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/28/embroidering-history-the-va-should-take-a-pluralistic-approach-in-the-middle-east">Letters, 28 August</a>). This would have come as some surprise to my grandfather, who sent beautiful locally crafted gifts and postcards to my grandmother in 1918, giving his address as Palestine. He died too young and I never met him, but I think he might be horrified at the current attempts to eradicate that country, and even its history.<br><strong>Richard Ingham</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
