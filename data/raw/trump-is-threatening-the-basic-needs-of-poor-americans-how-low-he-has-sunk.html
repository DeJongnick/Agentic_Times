<p>The Democrats had a great day on Tuesday. It’s crucial that they hone their economic message for next year’s midterms to focus on affordability and fairness.</p> <p>Trump is doing the opposite. Although <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension">a federal court ordered</a> him to continue to provide food stamps to about 42 million low-income Americans who depend on them, Trump threatened to deny them anyway until the end of the government shutdown.</p> <p>In a post on social media on Tuesday, he said benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), commonly referred to as food stamps, “will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up the government, which they can easily do, and not before!” The <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-snap-food-stamps-government-shutdown/">White House later confirmed</a> it would comply with a court order to use emergency funds to support Snap – but the administration said users would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-partially-fund-food-stamps-snap">receive only half</a> of what they typically do. On Thursday, the saga continued, with a court ordering the administration to fully fund Snap benefits in November; the administration <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-must-fully-fund-food-aid-benefits-by-friday-us-judge-rules-2025-11-06/">moved to appeal</a>.</p> <p>How low Trump has sunk.</p> <p>Eighty-eight years ago, in his second inaugural address, Franklin D Roosevelt told America that “the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little.”</p> <p>It was not a test of the nation’s military might or of the size of the national economy. It was a test of our moral authority. We had a duty to comfort the afflicted, even if that required afflicting the comfortable.</p> <p>The Trump regime has adopted the reverse metric. The test of <em>its </em>progress is whether it adds to the abundance of those who have much and provides less for those who have too little. It is passing this<em> </em>test with flying colors.</p> <p>What is the Democrats’ demand amid the shutdown? That lower-income Americans continue to receive subsidized healthcare. Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/emboldened-democrats-dig-health-care-demands-shutdown-fight-rcna236625">healthcare premiums for millions</a> of lower-income Americans will soar next year in large part because the Trump Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act (really, Big Ugly Bill) slashed Obamacare subsidies.</p> <p>Republicans had rammed the Big Ugly Bill through Congress without giving Senate Democrats an opportunity to filibuster it because Republicans used a process called “reconciliation”, requiring only a majority vote of the Senate.</p> <p>The Big Ugly Bill also requires Medicaid applicants and enrollees – also low-income – to document at least <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/tracking-the-medicaid-provisions-in-the-2025-budget-bill/">80 hours of work per month</a></p> <p>Many people dependent on Medicaid won’t be able to do this, either because they’re not physically able to work or won’t be able to do the required paperwork to qualify for an exemption from the work requirement.</p> <p>The Congressional Budget Office, as assessed by <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/allocating-cbos-estimates-of-federal-medicaid-spending-reductions-across-the-states-enacted-reconciliation-package/">KFF</a>, estimates the work requirement will be the largest source of Medicaid savings, reducing federal spending on the low-income Americans by <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/allocating-cbos-estimates-of-federal-medicaid-spending-reductions-across-the-states-enacted-reconciliation-package/">$326bn</a> over 10 years and <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/by-the-numbers-harmful-republican-megabill-will-take-health-coverage-away-from">causing millions to become uninsured</a>.</p> <p>All told, the Big Ugly Bill cuts roughly <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/1-trillion-in-medicaid-cuts-1-trillion-in-tax-giveaways-for-the-richest-1-percent-the-one-big-beautiful-bills-budget-math/">$1tn</a> over the next decade from programs for which the main beneficiaries are the poor and working class, and gives about <a href="https://itep.org/top-1-to-receive-1-trillion-tax-cut-from-trump-megabill-over-next-decade/">$1tn</a> in tax benefits to the richest members of our society.</p> <p>It is the most dramatic reversal of FDR’s moral test in American history.</p> <p>By the time of FDR’s second inaugural address in 1937, most of the country was still ill-housed, ill-fed, and ill-clothed. Yet we were all in it together. The fortunes of the robber barons of the Gilded Age had mostly been leveled by the Great Crash of 1929.</p> <p>Perhaps it was easier under those circumstances to accept the idea that the test of our progress wasn’t whether we added more to the abundance of those who had much but provided enough for those who had too little.</p> <p>Today, though, the moneyed interests lord it over America – exerting so much economic and political power that the nation is badly failing FDR’s test.</p> <p>Last weekend, just as millions of low-income Americans were losing their food stamps, Trump <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hosted-great-gatsby-halloween-party-hours-snap/story?id=127091016">threw a lush Great Gatsby-themed party</a> at his Mar-a-Lago estate, replete with 1920s flappers and Gatsby-inspired music from the roaring 20s.</p> <p>Some critics have called it “tone deaf”, but it was an accurate rendition of the tone Trump has set for America.</p> <p>Trump is throwing a huge party for America’s wealthy – giving them tax cuts and regulatory rollbacks to ensure that their wealth (and support for him) continues to grow.</p> <p>Meanwhile, he is throwing to poor and working-class Americans the red meat of hatefulness – hate of immigrants, people of color, the “deep state”, “socialists”, “communists”, transgender people and Democrats.</p> <p>This is the formula strongmen have used for a century – more wealth for the wealthy, more bigotry for the working-class and poor – until the entire facade crumbles under the weight of its own hypocrisy.</p> <p>On Tuesday, millions of American voters refused to go along with this unfairness. They repudiated, loudly and clearly, the formula Trump and his regime have used.</p> <p>It is the responsibility of all of us to return the nation to a path that is morally sustainable.</p> <ul> <li><p>Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is a professor of public policy emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.
