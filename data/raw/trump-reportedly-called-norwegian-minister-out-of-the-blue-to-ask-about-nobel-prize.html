<p>Donald Trump cold-called Norway’s finance minister last month to ask about a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, Norwegian press reported on Thursday.</p> 
<p>The Norwegian outlet <a href="https://www.dn.no/politikk/fredsprisen/nobelprisen/jens-stoltenberg/kilder-til-dn-trump-tok-opp-nobelpris-i-tolltelefon-med-stoltenberg/2-1-1857308">Dagens Næringsliv</a>, citing unnamed sources, reported: “Out of the blue, while finance minister Jens Stoltenberg was walking down the street in Oslo, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> called … He wanted the Nobel prize – and to discuss tariffs.”</p> 
<p>The outlet added that it was not the first time that Trump had raised the question of a Nobel peace prize nomination to Stoltenberg.</p> 
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-told-norwegian-minister-he-wants-nobel-prize-newspaper-says-2025-08-14/">statement </a>to Reuters, Stoltenberg, the former Nato secretary-general, said the call focused on tariffs and economic cooperation ahead of Trump’s call with Jonas Støre, the Norwegian prime minister.</p> 
<p>“I will not go into further detail about the content of the conversation,” Stoltenberg said, adding that several White House officials including the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, were on the call.</p> 
<p>Each year, the five-member Norwegian Nobel committee reviews hundreds of candidates before choosing laureates. The committee members are appointed by Norway’s parliament according to the will of Alfred Nobel, a 19-century Swedish industrialist. Laureates are announced in October.</p> 
<p>Trump has previously <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/all-the-times-trump-complained-about-not-getting-a-nobel-peace-prize?srsltid=AfmBOopsv6Rg4POeaBJjiHA7gSc2JzR4zKVLWA8dsPlNHHEqNxOw_Pf6">complained multiple times</a> about not receiving the Nobel peace prize, an award which four of his predecessors, including Barack Obama,<a href="https://www.nps.gov/jica/learn/historyculture/nobel-peace-prize-presidents.htm"> have received.</a></p> 
<p>In his most recent tirade, Trump took to Truth Social in June, saying: “No, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran, whatever those outcomes may be, but the people know, and that’s all that matters to me!”</p>
