<p>At last, 50 years on from their debut on the world stage, India’s dream came true: a first World Cup triumph, in front of a deafening full house in Navi Mumbai, as they defeated South Africa by 52 runs.</p> <p>Laura Wolvaardt struck a magnificent century, going back-to-back after her winning effort against England in the semi-final, but while she finished the tournament with 571 runs – the most by any woman in a World Cup – the ultimate prize belonged to India.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/nov/02/india-v-south-africa-womens-cricket-world-cup-final-live">India beat South Africa by 52 runs to win Women’s Cricket World Cup final – live reaction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They had two history-making heroes. The first was the unlikely figure of Shafali Verma, playing in this match only because of the ankle injury sustained by Pratika Rawal in the group stage but who chimed in with a career-best 87 from 78 balls and two wickets.</p> <p>Then, just as this final threatened to become a nailbiter, Deepti Sharma – who had contributed 58 runs – executed the perfect yorker to bowl Annerie Dercksen, and followed it up with the key scalp of Wolvaardt as Amanjot Kaur ran round from deep midwicket to take a diving juggle‑catch. For Amanjot it was third time lucky with the catch: for India, third time lucky in a World Cup final.</p> <p>“I am so grateful for this crowd – thank you for being there for us,” India’s captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, said, even as their booming cheers made it impossible for her to hear the post-match interview questions. “We lost three back-to-back games, but we knew this team had something special to turn things around.”</p> <p>The India head coach, Amol Mazumda, said: “They’ve done every Indian proud. It’s a watershed moment for Indian cricket.”</p> <p>For South Africa, the nightmare: after the T20 despair of 2023 and 2024, another World Cup slipping through their fingers. Shafali and Deepti contributed half-centuries, while Richa Ghosh struck 34 off 24 balls as India reached 298 for seven – and yet all had offered up chances.</p>    <p>Most egregious was the catch spilled at deep midwicket by Anneke Bosch, who grassed Shafali’s slog‑sweep at deep midwicket when the India opener was on 56.</p> <p>For the 21-year-old Shafali, this was the culmination of a surreal week: Tuesday, approved as an injury replacement for Pratika; Thursday, dismissed after five balls in the semi‑final; Sunday, hitting the winning knock in a World Cup final.</p> <p>Then there was her bowling, which took everyone by surprise – not least the South Africans. Before Sunday, Shafali had bowled just 14 overs in 30 one-day internationals. But in Navi Mumbai, in a World Cup final, her 15th and 16th proved to be deeply significant. First, Suné Luus pinged back a limp return catch. Then Marizanne Kapp poked at one down the leg side and was caught behind.</p> <p>Harmanpreet called Shafali’s spell the turning point: “I just saw Shafali standing there, and the way she batted today, I knew it was her day. I thought: ‘I have to go with my gut feeling. I’m going to give her one over.’ She was like: ‘I’m going to bowl 10 overs for the team.’ That shows how confident she was.”</p> <p>Play had been delayed for two hours by rain, leading South Africa to opt to bowl first in the hope of sticky, tricky batting conditions first up.</p> <p>A rollicking start from Shafali and Smriti Mandhana quickly put paid to that theory, the pair adding 104 inside 18 overs for the first wicket.</p> <p>The fact India failed to reach 300 after that platform speaks to the quality of South Africa’s bowling under pressure. Nonkululeko Mlaba conceded 47 in her 10 overs of left‑arm spin and bowled Harmanpreet after the India captain shaped to cut and missed. Ayabonga Khaka finished with three for 58, having India’s semi‑final hero Jemimah Rodrigues caught at extra-cover for 24 and returning at the death to have Richa caught.</p>    <p>South Africa had beaten the odds once in a run chase in this tournament, against this same opposition, after a thundering effort from Nadine de Klerk at the death.</p> <p>Now, Dercksen smashed Radha Yadav for the biggest six of the tournament, 84 metres, while De Klerk threatened to punish India for their poor use of the decision review system, given not out lbw to Deepti – a decision India were unable to send upstairs after burning through both their reviews earlier in the innings.</p> <p>But it was Deepti who had the last word, adding a fifth wicket to her tally: De Klerk sent a catch flying up to cover, Harmanpreet plucked it out of the air, and the pair converged with joy to begin a celebration which will no doubt last long into the night.</p>
