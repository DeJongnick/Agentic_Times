<p>Your article about Björn Ulvaeus implies that he disagrees with artists who want to protect their copyright because he believes AI isn’t a “creative threat” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jun/04/abba-bjorn-ulvaeus-ai-musical-london">Super Trouper meets supercomputer: AI helping Abba star to write musical, 4 June</a>).</p> <p>In fact, in his role as president of the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers, Ulvaeus has spoken in discussions with the UK government about protection for artists from “profit-seeking tech&nbsp;companies”. </p> <p>In <a href="https://www.cisac.org/Newsroom/news-releases/abba-co-founder-and-cisac-president-bjorn-ulvaeus-urges-uk-government-not">a speech to MPs and peers</a>, he said: “Copyright is the oxygen which creators and the creative economy depend on for their existence and survival. They cannot be sacrificed.”</p> <p>It is also worth noting that your article described the&nbsp;“Abbatars” in the Abba Voyage show as holograms, which they very much aren’t.<br><strong>Simon McEnery</strong><br><em>Salisbury</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
