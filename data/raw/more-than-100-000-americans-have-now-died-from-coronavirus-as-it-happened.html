  <p>Johnson, a Vietnam war veteran who was jailed with John McCain at the POW prison that US troops referred to as the “Hanoi Hilton”, was a conservative stalwart during his long stint in Congress. <br></p> 
  <p>He was a founding member of the Conservative Action Team, a conservative voting bloc in Congress that pushed to defund the National Endowment for the Arts and strengthen the Second Amendment. </p> 
  <p> Greg Abbott, the Texas governor, called Johnson a “great Texan”. “Sam Johnson was a fearless patriot and an American hero, and we are incredibly proud and fortunate to have called him a fellow Texan,” Abbott said in a statement today.</p>

  <p><strong>A million respirator masks sold by a former Trump administration official to the Indian Health Services do not meet federal standards</strong> for “use in healthcare settings by health care providers,” according to a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/masks-sold-by-former-white-house-official-to-najavo-hospitals-dont-meet-fda-standards">report</a> from ProPublica. </p> 
  <p>The masks, which the Indian Health Service purchased to meet a desperate need at Navajo hospitals, are KN95 masks, a Chinese version for N95 masks that do not meet the FDA guidelines, even after the agency relaxed standards during the pandemic. </p>

  <p><strong>France is banning the use of hydroxychloroquine to cure Covid-19, according to a decree from the country’s health ministry. </strong>The health ministry initially advised against using the drug outside of clinical trials.

  <p>The news comes after <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, who has frequently touted the unproven drug as a cure, said he finished taking a course of the medication as a prophylactic measure. </p>

  <p><strong>The number of recorded coronavirus deaths has just surpassed 100,000. But the actual death toll probably hit that figure days before. And despite scientists’ best efforts, that date may forever go unmarked.</strong></p> 
  <p>Coronavirus was probably spreading through the US before the Trump administration restricted travel from China, before the US had a reliable supply of diagnostic tests, and before the disease caused by the virus was even named. Models of the Covid-19 outbreak estimate that the virus was making its way through America’s major cities, undetected, weeks before a California woman in early February became the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-killing-americans-weeks-earlier-than-thought">first American known to have died</a> of related causes.</p> 
  <p>Researchers are now doing detective work, revisiting autopsies from early this year and studying how the virus has subtly evolved to try to trace when Covid-19 may have first sickened and killed people in the US. Infectious disease experts caution, however, that finding a “patient zero”, or even figuring out exactly how many Americans were infected and died before testing was available, will be nearly impossible.</p>

  <p>The death toll in the United States is still climbing, however, and federal officials warn that the likely actual toll from the coronavirus is higher than the official figure.</p> 
  <p>A <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm">tracking project by the Centers of Disease Control</a> (CDC) of “excess deaths” in each state beyond seasonal averages suggests the official count of Covid-19 deaths could leave out thousands of cases.</p>

  <p><strong>The California health officer credited with leading the nation’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-bay-area">first regional shelter-in-place </a>order expressed concerns that governor Gavin Newsom may be reopening the state too quickly. </strong></p> 
  <p><em>The Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/vivian-ho">Vivian Ho </a>reports: </em></p> 
  <p>Earlier this month, Newsom modified the statewide stay-at-home order to allow retailers to offer curbside pickup. In the weeks that followed, Newsom expanded the modifications to allow counties that had not been as affected by the virus as others to apply for looser restrictions. As of Tuesday, 47 out of the state’s 58 counties have self-attested, and will be allowed to reopen hair salons, offices, some schools, all with modifications. <br></p> 
  <p>“The pace at which the state has made these modifications is concerning to me,” said Dr Sara Cody, health director in Santa Clara county, location of what is believed to be the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-killing-americans-weeks-earlier-than-thought"> first Covid-related death</a> in the country. </p> 
  <p>Cody voiced these concerns at a local board of supervisors meeting on Tuesday, where she called for the county to take a more cautious approach. Since the start of the stay-at-home order, local variance has taken precedence, meaning if a county health officer called for stricter measures than the state order, then the county would comply with the county order. <br></p> 
  <p>Cody continued: “We can’t see the effect of any of these changes, the effect on Covid, for at least 14 days, an incubation period, and 21 days is even better,” she said. “So the state modifications are being made without a real understanding of the consequences of what the last move has been and with the possibly serious effects for health and possibly serious risks of an exponential growth in cases and therefore a risk to social and economic well-being.”<br></p> 
  <p>In particular, Cody had reservations about Newsom’s decision to authorize county health officers to allow religious, cultural and political gatherings of 100 people, a move she said “poses a very serious risk of the spread of Covid-19, based on probability alone”.<br></p> 
  <p>Cody’s concerns come as California crossed the threshold on Wednesday of more than 100,000 positive cases – 101,229 to be exact. The state is reporting 3,894 deaths. Santa Clara has had 2,675 cases and 24 deaths. <br></p>

   <li><strong>The planned SpaceX launch was scrapped due to bad weather. </strong>The president and the vice president were on hand to witness the launch, but it has been rescheduled for Saturday afternoon. It’s unclear whether <strong>Trump </strong>will travel back to Florida this weekend.</li> 
   <li><strong>The US coronavirus death toll is inching toward 100,000. </strong>According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, 99,983 Americans have already died from coronavirus.</li> 
   <li><strong>The first ever House proxy vote was cast. </strong>Weeks after the House passed a resolution allowing voting by proxy, congressman <strong>Brendan Boyle </strong>cast a vote on behalf of fellow Democrat <strong>Zoe Lofgren. </strong>House <strong>Republicans </strong>have filed a lawsuit to block the resolution, claiming proxy voting is unconstitutional.</li> 
   <li><strong>Secretary of state Mike Pompeo told Congress that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous from China. </strong>Pompeo’s pronouncement, which came after China issued a law aimed at bringing Hong Kong more under Beijing’s control, could trigger sanctions or other punitive measures against China.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>Washington will lift its stay-at-home order Friday. </strong>DC mayor <strong>Muriel Bowser </strong>said the city would also start relaxing some social distancing restrictions this week, even as White House officials voice concern about the rate of positive test results in the Washington metropolitan region.</li>

  <p>America’s largest professional association of obstetricians and gynecologists has filed a lawsuit against the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to end a ban on prescribing medication abortions via telemedicine. </p> 
  <p>Mifepristone is a medication used to treat women who miscarry early or to induce an abortion. It is the only medication, of the more than 20,000 the FDA regulates, which patients self administer at home but must see a doctor in-person to obtain, the lawsuit said.</p> 
  <p>The American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists said the ban was “medically unnecessary” and, during the Covid-19 pandemic, would expose women to unnecessary risk of coronavirus infection by forcing them to seek face-to-face treatment. </p> 
  <p>“At every other turn during this pandemic, the federal government is trying to make it easier for patients to get the medical care they need without unnecessary health care visits that jeopardize their safety,” said Julia Kaye, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union’s Reproductive Freedom Project, which is representing ACOG among other plaintiffs. </p> 
  <p>“But when it comes to patients who need to end an early pregnancy or treat a miscarriage, the administration is forcing them to travel to a hospital, clinic, or medical office just to pick up a pill they are already permitted to swallow later at home. This administration apparently would rather subject patients and clinicians to life-threatening medical risks than lift an unnecessary barrier to abortion care.”</p>

  <p>“Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,” Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456">tweeted</a> on Wednesday morning. “We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.”</p>

  <p>“I think we need to reserve judgment right now because we’re still a few months from there,” Fauci told CNN.</p> 
  <p>The infectious disease expert said the country would have to see a signficant decline in cases in order to safely move forward with the conventions.</p> 
  <p>“Hopefully we will see that diminution [of coronavirus cases],” Fauci said. “If we don’t, then as I’ve said before, I would have significant reservations about that.”</p> 
  <p>In contrast, <strong>Trump </strong>said Monday he wanted a “guarantee” from North Carolina’s Democratic governor that <strong>Republicans </strong>could hold their convention at full capacity in August. </p> 
  <p>Realistically, as Fauci’s comments indicate, no governor can actually make that guarantee right now, but that didn’t stop the Republican governors of Georgia and Florida from offering up their states to replace North Carolina as the convention site.</p>
