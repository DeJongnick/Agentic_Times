<p>Pep Guardiola, the man who coached Lionel Messi, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi Hernández, has said that Rayan Cherki is among the most talented players he has seen and is convinced the forward will buy into the team ethic at Manchester City.</p> <p>The 22-year-old Frenchman, who has played only seven times since his £30.5m move from Lyon in time for the Club World Cup in June, returned from a thigh injury at the weekend. A five-minute appearance in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/18/manchester-city-everton-premier-league-match-report">2-0 win against Everton</a>, in which he almost set up Erling Haaland for a third goal, has been followed by him travelling to Villarreal for what would be his Champions League debut at the club.</p> <p>And although he urged patience, the manager was at a loss for words to explain Cherki’s qualities, suggesting that the only doubt could be how he settles into the structure and adapts to doing simpler things well.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/20/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Rayan is one of the huge stars I have ever seen in my career,” Guardiola said, puffing out his cheeks. “Technically and individually he is top. The question is how he settles and what we are going to do, how he reads the game and every action the game needs. He started at the [Club] World Cup, but then there was some time off. [We have to go] step by step, but the talent he has: I have the feeling that most of the time when the ball comes to him, the situation gets better.</p> <p>“Not all the time he has to play, like, make exceptional things, he has to play just football. But he has something. [Such as] the pass for Erling in the last moment [against Everton], many, many things that he can do.</p> <p>“He is a guy that doesn’t feel the pressure when is going to get the ball. He’s like a street player. He is grumpy – ‘give me the ball, give me the ball’ – when he doesn’t get the ball, you know. He has been a short time here; it will take a bit of time because you have to play with your [team]mates.”</p> <p>Asked if Cherki will fit within the team ethic, Guardiola replied: “Yes of course. These kinds of players are so intuitive, so intelligent. They see everything.”</p> <p>The City manager also spoke highly of Nico González, who looks poised to start in the heart of the midfield. Rodri has travelled to his former club, who are expected to honour him before the game at the Estadio de la Cerámica, but is unavailable with a muscle injury. Guardiola said: “I have the feeling that Nico is getting better and better. We are really pleased with his behaviour and he will get better year by year. He is cultured, open minded, he is a lovely, lovely guy. His mum and dad have to be so proud of how he is as a human being and a player. He has to be himself but when you play with top, top players you always learn. You can see how your game can be better but Nico has to be Nico, for sure.”</p> <p>Guardiola was also effusive about City’s improving form. “We score a lot of goals, create a lot, a lot, of chances, and we are not conceding much. It’s only eight games in the Premier League and two in the Champions League but I have the feeling that every game is better than the previous one and worse than the next.</p> <p>“We talk a lot about what we can do better, how we can read things better. I have incredible confidence in the players and I know these players are working a lot. We are very good.”</p>
