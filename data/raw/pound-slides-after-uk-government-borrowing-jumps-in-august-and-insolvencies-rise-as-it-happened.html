decisions” on the horizon for Rachel Reeves to tackle, says the EY ITEM Club.</strong></p> <p><strong>Matt Swannell, </strong>chief economic advisor to the<strong> EY ITEM Club</strong>, explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“In August, the Government borrowed £18bn, the largest August deficit in five years and £5.5bn more than the OBR expected. As the Budget approaches, this leaves the UK finances in a fragile position. So far this fiscal year, the Government has borrowed £83.8bn, outstripping the OBR’s £72.4bn forecast.</p> <p>“However, the Government’s performance against its primary fiscal rule will be judged by the progress made on the current budget, which accounts for how much it borrows to cover day-to-day spending. In August, the current budget deficit was £13.6bn, up from £9.6bn at the same time last year. Across the fiscal year-to-date, the current budget is in deficit by £62bn, well above the OBR’s March forecast of £46.6bn. The OBR expects a marked reduction in current borrowing in the latter half of this fiscal year, so it looks like it will only become more difficult to carefully manage the day-to-day finances from here.”</p> <p>“The Government has pledged to only borrow to invest by FY2029-2030, and while the latest data shows it may be starting from a more difficult position than expected at the Spring Statement, greater fiscal challenges loom. A combination of gilt market stress and reversals on welfare reform has used up the thin margin for error in the Government’s current spending plans, meaning taxes will almost certainly need to rise if the fiscal rules are to be met. Even then, the task of getting the public finances back on track could be made much more difficult by a downgrade to the OBR’s very optimistic growth forecasts, leaving a £20bn hole in tax revenue.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68cd04ce8f08895801e08306" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-19T07:30:34.444Z">8.30am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Pound falls and bond yields rise after UK borrowing soars</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>This morning’s UK public finances are going down badly in the City.</strong></p> <p>The pound has dropped by half a cent this morning, to $1.35.
