In a weekend dotted with finals, Will Magee considers what could be the latest in a series of spectacular upsets, this time in Germany where the dream DFB-Pokal run of Arminia Bielefeld, the third division champions, reaches its conclusion on Saturday against Stuttgart of the Bundesliga.</p> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>Join Emillia Hawkins and Rob Smyth for our special liveblog covering all the breathless buildup to the afternoon’s big games: the Scottish Cup final that pits Aberdeen against Celtic (3pm); the Championship playoff final at Wembley as Sheffield United and Sunderland face off for a place in the Premier League (3.01pm); and the Women’s Champions League final, with Arsenal taking on serial European champions Barcelona in Lisbon at 5pm. Ben Fisher checks in from the Championship playoff final at Wembley and is ready to answer your questions on the so-called richest game in football.

The first Test of summer looked like a mismatch on paper, Zimbabwe having lost heavily to an inexperienced county XI last week, and the hosts have so far lived up to lofty expectations at Trent Bridge. Tim de Lisle and James Wallace are on hand for over-by-over coverage, with Ali Martin and Andy Bull offering reports and analysis from the ground. We’ve got the domestic scene covered too, as Tanya Aldred roves across the County Championship fixtures with our rolling live blog.</p> <p>2.45pm</p> <p>Northampton v Bordeaux-Bègles live</p> <p>European Rugby Champions Cup final</p>  <p>Northampton are aiming to lift the Champions Cup for the first time in a quarter of a century with victory over Bordeaux-Bègles in Cardiff and, after their stunning 37-34 semi-final win against the tournament favourites, Leinster, in Dublin, Saints fans are rightly dreaming of a first European crown since edging out Munster at Twickenham 25 years ago. Still, Bordeaux will present Saints with another stern test of their trophy ambitions, having reached the final with a 35-18 victory over the defending champions, Toulouse. Join Daniel Gallan for updates on the unfolding action, then our rugby experts Robert Kitson and Michael Aylwin at the Principality Stadium with reports, news and comment.</p>   <p>3pm</p> <p>Monaco Grand Prix qualifying live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>This weekend sees the F1 circus roll into Monte Carlo for the sport’s blue riband event and a race that the Monaco resident Oliver Bearman was supposed to be relishing. The 20-year-old British driver was thrust into the F1 spotlight in March 2024 when he was parachuted into Carlos Sainz’s Ferrari seat at the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix after the Spaniard was struck by appendicitis, finishing seventh on debut. His performances were enough to earn him a permanent seat with Haas … but his return to his “home” track got off to a terrible start, with a 10-place penalty imposed on Friday for overtaking under a red flag during practice. Keeping a watchful eye on qualifying will be John Brewin, with our F1 reporter Giles Richards in Monte Carlo to report on the race for pole.</p> <p>3.01pm</p> <p>Sheffield United v Sunderland live</p> <p> Championship playoff final </p>  <p>One of theses two will play Premier League football next season and this is the game where the winner takes all – and them some. The Black Cats – who finished one place but 14 points behind the Blades after 46 regular games – have spent eight seasons outside the top flight, four of them in League One. Chris Wilder’s United are favourites to earn an instant return and in so doing end their playoff hoodoo at the 10th attempt, with nine previous playoff campaigns – including three Championship finals – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/23/sheffield-united-championship-playoff-final-football-sunderland">having ended in defeat</a>. Rob Smyth is your live host, with Ben Fisher and Paul MacInnes our reporting team at Wembley.</p> <p>5pm</p> <p>Arsenal v Barcelona live</p> <p>Women’s Champions League final</p>  <p>Arsenal have made it back to the final as part of an impressive turnaround this season under Renée Slegers, who took charge – initially on an interim basis and then permanently – after Jonas Eidevall resigned in October. The Gunners produced second-leg fightbacks to get past Real Madrid in the quarter-finals and Lyon in the semis, the latter a stunning 4-1 win in France but Barcelona, whose squad features the double Ballon d’Or winners Aitana Bonmatí and Alèxia Putellas, are heading into their sixth final and fifth in a row, having won the last two to add to their maiden success in 2021. Pere Romeu’s side opened their campaign with a 2-0 defeat by Manchester City, but they have been in ruthless form since, thrashing Wolfsburg 10-2 and Chelsea 8-2 on aggregate in the last eight and semi-finals respectively. It’s certain to be a compelling finale, with Sarah Rendall keeps you up to date with the latest action, while Suzanne Wrack, Jonathan Liew and Tom Garry deliver reports, news and analysis from Lisbon.</p>   <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Join Taha Hashim and Emillia Hawkins for the latest news and buildup to Sunday’s final round of Premier League fixtures – 10 games all kicking off at 4pm. The biggest game of the day? Jacob Steinberg believes that would be Nottingham Forest against Chelsea, where a place in the Champions League is the big prize. He’ll be checking in from the City Ground to set the scene.</p> <p>10am</p> <p>French Open live</p> <p>Tennis</p>  <p>Our liveblog keeps tennis fans up to date with day one’s action in Paris.</p> <p>11am</p> <p>County Championship live</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p>Join Tanya Aldred helms our liveblog for day three of the latest action around the grounds.</p> <p>1pm</p> <p>Charlton v Leyton Orient live</p> <p>League One playoff final</p>  <p>An all-London final and Charlton are one win away from a return to the Championship five years after they were relegated. The Addicks’ manager, Nathan Jones, lasted just three months in the Premier League at Southampton, and collapsed to his knees in tears at the final whistle after the 1-0 win over Wycombe in the semi-final second leg. Charlton have come a long way in just over a year, having been 18th when Jones took over in February 2024. Leyton Orient survived a shootout to reach Wembley. The east London club prevailed 4-1 on spot-kicks after an absorbing semi-final with Stockport ended 3-3 on aggregate. Richie Wellens’ side qualified for the playoffs in sixth after a late charge, winning their last six matches of the regular season, and are one game away from playing in the second tier for the first time since 1982. Taha Hashim follows the action live while John Brewin reports from Wembley.</p> <p>2pm</p> <p>Monaco Grand Prix live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>The jewel in the F1 crown and undoubtably the most famous event on the 24-race calendar but the prestigious venue, where the cars hurtle past Casino Square, round the famed Fairmont hairpin, through the tunnel and along the principality’s yacht-lined harbour, rarely tends to lend itself to great racing. So the FIA has imposed a minimum two pit stops for the 82nd staging of this year’s race in an attempt to mix up strategies and offer more entertainment. Luke McLaughlin brings you the lap-by-lap action.</p>   <p>4pm</p> <p>Nottingham Forest v Chelsea live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Five clubs will battle over three available Champions League slots on the last day of the top-flight season, and Scott Murray keeps the updates flowing as fifth-placed Chelsea visit seventh-placed Nottingham Forest, who are just a point below them. Chelsea still have a chance to finish in the top three, with third-placed Manchester City only two points above them. But a loss or draw could force them out of the league’s top five.</p> <p>4pm</p> <p>Final-day clockwatch live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Rob Smyth and Sarah Rendell return to bookend our weekend football coverage – and it’s an all-action card in the Premier League. As well as the abovementioned Forest v Chelsea game, there will be updates from around the grounds as Liverpool finally get to lift the trophy at Anfield with goals, news, reaction and more.</p>
