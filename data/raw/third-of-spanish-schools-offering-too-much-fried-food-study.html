<p>Almost a third of Spain’s school canteens are offering students too many portions of fried food each week, while more than a third are not providing them with enough fresh vegetables, according to a <a href="https://www.dsca.gob.es/es/comunicacion/notas-prensa/tercio-menus-escolares-no-estan-supervisados-profesionales-acreditados">study from the country’s national food agency</a>.</p> <p>The findings, based on figures from 2023, come as Spain’s socialist-led government prepares legislation that aims to reduce obesity by targeting unhealthy, sugary foods and making the food agency’s recommendations obligatory.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.aesan.gob.es/AECOSAN/docs/documentos/nutricion/observatorio/Diptico_ALADINO_2019.pdf">2019 study</a> found that 40.6% of Spanish children aged six to nine were over their recommended weight, of whom 17.3% were classed as obese.</p> <p>According to the report, a third of school menus are not overseen by people with nutritional qualifications, and 29.2% of schools are serving up three of more portions of fried food a week, exceeding the recommended maximum of two portions. It also found that more than 70% of schools were not following the recommendation to fry food in olive oil or sunflower oil high in oleic acid.</p> <p>Meanwhile, 37% of schools are serving two or fewer portions of fresh vegetables a week, against the recommended three or four portions. About 7% of school canteens never offer fish, while 16% do not offer the recommended four or five weekly portions of fruit. It also found that a third of canteens offer pre-cooked dishes four times a week or more.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/13/about-stimulating-children-how-school-lunches-look-europe">Pizza, plum cake and pickled red onion: how school lunches look across Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reacting to the report, Spain’s consumer and social rights ministry said it was working on a royal decree that would make the food agency’s recommendations binding “and tighten up the criteria on the foods that are most damaging to health”.</p> <p>It added: “The royal decree will ban the serving of sugary drinks – or other alternatives to water – during school mealtimes, a measure that takes into account another of the reports findings: that there are fewer and fewer schools that only offer water at mealtimes.”</p> <p>The ministry said that while 99.7% of schools offered only water at mealtimes in 2021, the percentage had fallen to below 85% in 2023.</p> <p>In a post on Bluesky, Spain’s consumer affairs minister, Pablo Bustinduy, said that action needed to be taken to stop socio-economic factors determining children’s health.</p> <p>“Thirty per cent of canteens serve three or more portions of fried food a week,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pbustinduy.bsky.social/post/3lhdmkkxhd22g">he wrote</a>. “The canteens royal decree will establish common criteria that follow international nutritional standards. Childhood health can’t depend on postcodes.”</p> <p>Nearly a third of primary school-age children in Europe are <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/05/1136547#:~:text=A%20new%20World%20Health%20Organization,only%20set%20to%20rise%20further.">either overweight or obese</a>, while almost a quarter of children in the EU are at risk of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Children_at_risk_of_poverty_or_social_exclusion#:~:text=24.4%25%20of%20children%20in%20the,compared%20with%2021.1%20%25%20of%20adults.&amp;text=In%202021%2C%20dependent%20children%20living,in%20the%20EU%20(44.1%25)">poverty or social exclusion</a>.</p> <p>In October 2023, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/13/children-should-get-one-healthy-school-meal-a-day-say-eu-experts">coalition of experts said children across Europe needed to get at least one nutritious school meal a day</a> if governments wanted to tackle rising obesity rates, prevent chronic illnesses and reduce social inequalities.</p> <p>With the cost of living crisis stretching many families on the continent beyond breaking point, members of a four-year EU-funded initiative, focused on healthy eating, said action was urgently needed to ensure all European children could rely on at least one healthy meal every day.</p> <p>“Once you say that every child needs to get a healthy school meal every day – whether they’re, rich, poor, in a deprived neighbourhood or wherever – that’s a minimum standard that would make quite a lot of sense in Europe,” said Peter Defranceschi, a member of the <a href="https://schoolfood4change.eu/about/">SchoolFood4Change project</a>.</p>
