It’s the opening of an opportunity. What the chapter does close is the damaging shutdown that is only getting worse, that is only going to impact more and more people,”<em> </em>said <strong>Angus King</strong>, the Independent lawmaker from Maine who caucuses with Democrats.</p> <p><strong>Maggie Hassan</strong>, the Democratic senator from New Hampshire, who was part of the bipartisan talks to strike a deal with Republicans, addressed the fact that the revised bill forgoes the Obamacare subsidies that Democrats made a central part of their negotiations.</p> <p>“Congress has one month to engage in serious, bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act’s expiring tax cuts for health insurance,” Hassan wrote in a statement, referring to the vote that GOP lawmakers promised Democrats. “My Democratic colleagues and I have been ready to work on this for months. With the government reopening shortly, Senate Republicans must finally come to the table – or, make no mistake, Americans will remember who stood in the way.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, senator <strong>John Fetterman</strong> of Pennsylvania, who was part of the small faction of Democrats in the upper chamber who voted in favor of the original House-passed funding bill on several occasions, said that “it should’ve never come to this,” referring to the ongoing 40-day shutdown. ““I’m sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven’t been paid in weeks,” he added.</p> <p>An important note. <strong>None of the Democratic senators who voted yes on Sunday’s procedural motion are up for re-election in 2026</strong>. Two of them, <strong>Dick Durbin</strong> of Illinois, and <strong>Jeanne Shaheen</strong> of New Hampshire, are retiring next year, while the earliest that any of the others would face a challenge would be in 2028.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-10T15:25:39.509Z">at 3.25pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6911fb628f08a98bc75926f8" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-10T15:03:10.171Z">3.03pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Supreme court denies hearing for challenge to same-sex marriage</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The supreme court has <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/111025zor_bqmc.pdf">rejected </a>hearing a case that challenges the constitutional right for same-sex couples to marry.</p> <p>The court denied a long-shot effort from <strong>Kim Davis</strong>, a former Kentucky county clerk, who refused to issue marriage licenses on religious grounds.

Earlier this year, Republican senator Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill proposing <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/hawley-introduces-legislation-to-send-rebate-checks-to-working-americans/">$600 in tariff rebates</a> for nearly all Americans and their dependent children.</p> <p>“Americans deserve a tax rebate after four years of [Joe] Biden [White House] policies that have devastated families’ savings and livelihoods,” Hawley said at the time. He said the legislation would “allow hard-working Americans to benefit from the wealth that Trump’s tariffs are returning to this country”.</p> <p>However, US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in August that the administration’s main focus remains reducing the national debt, which stands at $38.12tn, using funds from tariff collections. He said the money would be used first to start paying down the federal debt – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/bessent-says-us-tariff-revenues-rise-substantially-focus-reducing-debt-2025-08-19/">not to give</a> rebate checks to Americans.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/09/trump-tariffs-refund">Trump weighs giving Americans $2,000 from tariff revenues in bid for support</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6911e8018f087ec9f3660d02" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-10T13:44:38.556Z">1.44pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Hegseth announces new strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats, killing six</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US forces</a> struck two more alleged drug trafficking boats off the coast of South America, killing six people, the Trump administration’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, has said.</p> <p>The US began carrying out such strikes – which some experts say amount to extrajudicial killings even if they target known traffickers – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/trump-venezuela-boat-lethal-strike">in early September</a>, taking aim at vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.</p> <p>“Yesterday, at the direction of President Trump, two lethal kinetic strikes were conducted on two vessels operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” Hegseth said.</p> <p>He added in a social media post <a href="https://x.com/SecWar/status/1987863821868732447?s=20">on X</a>: “Both strikes were conducted in international waters and 3 male narco-terrorists were aboard each vessel.
