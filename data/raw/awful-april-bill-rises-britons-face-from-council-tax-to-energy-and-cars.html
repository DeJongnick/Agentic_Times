<p>Millions of households face sharp rises in everything from council tax to water from Tuesday, in what has been labelled “Awful April”.</p> <p>The exact amount extra that consumers will pay will depend on where they live and their personal circumstances. Despite some respite – including an increase in the minimum wage and a modest rise in most benefits – budgets are expected be squeezed.</p> <p>Here are the main bills that are increasing – and what can be done to cushion the blow.</p> <h2><strong>Council </strong><strong>tax</strong></h2> <p>Most households in England will face the maximum increase of 4.99%, and this means the average council tax bill on a typical band D property is going up by £109 a year, to £2,280. </p> <p>Six councils<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/03/six-english-councils-granted-permission-to-raise-council-tax-bills-by-up-to-10"> were given government permission</a> to raise bills by more than a nationwide cap. </p> <p>In Scotland most homes will receive a rise in council tax of at least 8%. Households in Wales will get council tax rises of 4.5% to 9.5%.</p> <p>Northern Ireland uses a domestic rates system, instead of council tax. All of Northern Ireland’s councils have put up rates by up to 5.9%.</p> <p><strong>What can I do about it?</strong> Check whether you qualify for a discount, as you could be entitled to apply for between 25% and 100% off your bill. </p> <p>Council tax is usually billed over 10 months rather than 12. “If money is tight, why not ask the council to spread the money over 12 months instead?” says the consumer expert Martyn James.</p> <h2><strong>Energy bills</strong></h2> <p>If you’re on a variable tariff linked to the energy price cap, your costs will increase on 1 April.</p>    <p>The cap on gas and electricity charges, set by the energy regulator Ofgem, is going up by £111, taking the average annual bill <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/feb/25/average-annual-energy-bill-great-britain-energy-price-cap-gas-electricity-charges">to £1,849 a year for a typical household</a>. It follows a rise in energy market prices. In April 2024, the average annual energy cost was £1,690.</p> <p><strong>What can I do about it?</strong> Read your meter as soon as possible, so you’re not paying at the higher price. Send your energy provider monthly meter readings for accurate bills.</p> <p>You could swap over to a fixed tariff, which protects you from price rises and unpredictability. However, if energy prices fall later in the year you won’t benefit from those savings as your energy costs will remain the same.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/JmLef/1/" data-alt="Energy price cap chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/JmLef/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Water</strong></h2> <p>Water bills for households in England and Wales are rising by an average of £10 a month on 1 April. However, the increase will vary significantly depending on the water company.</p> <p>For example, the average annual Thames Water bill is going up by about 31%, from £488 to £639, while Yorkshire Water customers will pay 28% more than in 2024-25, with their bills going from £467 to £602.</p>    <p>In Scotland, water and sewerage prices depend on your council tax band and are generally paid alongside your council tax. The average bill is going up by 9.9%, or about £44 a year.</p> <p><strong>What can I do about it?</strong> Your first step should be to see if you can cut back on water consumption.</p> <p>If you live in England or Wales and your home has more bedrooms than people, switching to a water meter could save you hundreds of pounds each year, as you’ll pay only for what you use. It’s free to have one installed but you have to apply through your provider’s website or give it a call. In Scotland, you will be charged the labour costs for installing a water meter, so staying with estimated payments might be the better option. If you don’t have a meter, you’ll probably pay for your water with your council tax. A council tax reduction could mean you also get up to 35% off water and waste.</p> <p>If you can’t get a meter in England or Wales, you may be eligible for an assessed charge, which is based on factors such as the number of people in your home. You can also apply for a social tariff.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Dxahe/1/" data-alt="Increases in average annual water bills"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Dxahe/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2><strong>Car tax</strong></h2> <p>Petrol and diesel car owners will pay £5 more a year in vehicle tax, taking the standard rate cost on post-2017 vehicles to £195. Cars registered before 2017 and after 2001 pay a rate of vehicle tax based on fuel type and CO2 emissions – most of these are going up.</p> <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) will no longer be tax exempt and will cost £10 in the first year before moving to the standard rate. This new vehicle excise duty for EVs will affect new and existing vehicles, but drivers of new electric cars worth more than £40,000 could pay as much as £620 a year from the second year of registration onwards. </p> <p>The tax for new cars depends on emissions, and at some levels owners will pay double the rate previously charged in the first year.</p> <p><strong>What can I do about it?</strong> Some cars are still exempt from vehicle tax. For instance, vehicles used by a disabled person and historic vehicles built more than 40 years before 1 January of the current year do not pay vehicle tax, but you need to apply for it through the DVLA.</p> <p>You could also check whether it is worth selling up and buying a smaller (in most cases) pre-2017 model that qualifies for lower VED. The <a href="https://www.rac.co.uk/drive/advice/buying-and-selling-guides/car-tax-bands-explained/">RAC has a guide on its website</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Stamp prices</strong></h2> <p>First- and second-class stamps will increase on 7 April. The price of a first-class stamp will increase by 5p, or 3%, to £1.70, while the second-class service will increase by 2p, or 2.4%, to 87p.</p> <p><strong>What can you do about it?</strong> You could save some cash further down the line by stockpiling before the increase comes in.</p> <h2><strong>TV licence</strong></h2>    <p>The annual cost of a colour TV licence will increase by £5 on 1 April to £174.50. A black and white licence will increase by £1.50, to £58.50. </p> <p><strong>What can I do about it?</strong> About 90% of households need a TV licence, according to the BBC – the rules apply if you watch or record live TV or anything on iPlayer, livestream using ITVX, Sky Go, Amazon Prime, YouTube live, Freely, or watch live events on Netflix. However, if you’re watching on demand – a show or programme that is not live TV – you don’t need a TV licence, unless it is on iPlayer.</p> <h2><strong>Broadband and mobile phones</strong></h2> <p>Mid-contract price rises are on the way for the customers of a number of broadband and mobile companies, totalling £74m a month from 1 April, according to Uswitch.</p> <p>New rules introduced by Ofcom, the telecoms regulator, in January mean that mobile and broadband providers must now tell customers “in pounds and pence” about any price rises upfront.</p>    <p>Uswitch estimates that the increases will add an average of £21.99 annually for those on inflation-linked contracts, and up to £42 a year for those on newer “pounds and pence” plans.</p> <p><strong>What can I do about it?</strong> Most contracts won’t allow you to cancel penalty-free mid-contract, but if your contract has come to an end, it is worth calling up to haggle, or switching providers. </p> <h2><strong>And some good news …</strong></h2> <p><strong>National </strong><strong>minimum </strong><strong>wage</strong></p> <p>For those aged 21 and over, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/29/national-minimum-wage-to-rise-by-67-from-april-reeves-confirms">national minimum wage</a> will increase by 77p, to £12.21 an hour, on 1 April. For 18- to 20-year-olds, the rate has gone up to £10 – an increase of £1.40 an hour. Apprentices and those under 18 will now be paid a minimum of £7.55 an hour, which is a £1.15 increase.</p> <p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong> Nothing: you will see the increase in your wages automatically. </p> <p><strong>State pension</strong></p> <p>Under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/sep/10/what-is-the-state-pension-triple-lock-rise-april-2025">the triple lock</a>, the state pension will rise by 4.1%, in line with earnings growth. Those eligible for the full new state pension will see their weekly payment increase from £221.20 to £230.25, and those on the older basic state pension will see their weekly payment increase from £169.50 to £176.45.</p> <p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong> You don’t need to take any action for the increase to come into effect.</p> <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p> <p>Benefits such as universal credit and child benefit will increase by 1.7% in April. The standard allowance for universal credit is poised to rise from £393.45 a month to £400.14 a month for those 25 and over and single. The carer’s allowance, given to people who look after someone for 35 hours or more a week, will increase to £83.30 a week.</p> <p><strong>What do I need to do?</strong> Inflationary rises are usually implemented automatically by the Department for Work and Pensions, but it is important to report any changes in your circumstances to ensure you continue receiving the correct amount of benefits.</p>
