<p>Children in England will be taught how to spot extremist content and misinformation online under planned changes to the school curriculum, the education secretary has said.</p> <p>Bridget Phillipson said she was launching a review of the curriculum in primary and secondary schools to embed critical thinking across multiple subjects and arm children against “putrid conspiracy theories”.</p> <p>One example may include pupils analysing newspaper articles in English lessons in a way that would help differentiate fabricated stories from true reporting.</p> <p>In computer lessons, they could be taught how to spot fake news websites by their design, and maths lessons may include analysing statistics in context.</p> <p>Phillipson, the Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, told the Sunday Telegraph: “It’s more important than ever that we give young people the knowledge and skills to be able to challenge what they see online.</p> <p>“That’s why our curriculum review will develop plans to embed critical skills in lessons to arm our children against the disinformation, fake news and putrid conspiracy theories awash on social media. Our renewed curriculum will always put high and rising standards in core subjects – that’s non-negotiable.</p> <p>“But alongside this we will create a broad, knowledge-rich curriculum that widens access to cultural subjects and gives pupils the knowledge and skills they need to thrive at work and throughout life.”</p> <p>Misinformation spread on social media about the background and religion of the suspect in the stabbing of three young girls in Southport on 29 July has been blamed for the rioting led by the far right across the UK.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/article/2024/aug/08/online-safety-act-not-fit-for-purpose-far-right-riots-sadiq-khan">Online Safety Act not fit for purpose after far-right riots, says Sadiq Khan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Specialist officers are pursuing suspected online offenders and influencers responsible for “spreading hate and inciting violence on a large scale”.</p> <p>Teams are investigating hundreds of leads, the National Police Chiefs’ Council said.</p> <p>The moderation and regulation of social media has also come under scrutiny after the disorder.</p> <p>New regulation of social media platforms – the Online Safety Act – became law in the UK last year but has not yet fully come into effect.</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="12122339-6fb0-4b58-8471-c3c59de58128" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p>Keir Starmer suggested on Friday that he would look at strengthening social media regulations further, after London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said the legislation was “not fit for purpose”.</p> <p>• This article and headline were amended on 11 August 2024.
