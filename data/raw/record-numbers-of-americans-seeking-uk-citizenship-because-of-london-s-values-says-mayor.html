<p>The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said a record number of Americans have applied for British citizenship following the election of Donald Trump, which he attributed to the city’s “liberal values”.</p> <p>In an opening salvo ahead of the US president’s state visit, Khan said he wanted to challenge the idea that London was in turmoil and said that more Americans than ever were seeking to make it their home.</p> <p>He said liberal US citizens identified with London because of the city’s “fundamental values, like adhering to the rule of law, being proud of our diversity and championing the rights of minority communities”.</p> <p>New figures from the Home Office show a rise of 50% in citizenship applications from Americans – putting it at the highest since records began. Between April and June, there were a record 2,194 applications, compared with 1,465 the previous year.</p> <p>Khan and Trump have clashed publicly, including over the president’s “Muslim ban” in his first term. Trump has called Khan <strong>“</strong>a nasty person” who has “done a terrible job” and rightwing commentators in the US have routinely attacked crime rates in London and the diversity of the capital’s population.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian, Khan said there were many Americans who took the opposite view of London.</p> <p>“Prominent figures in the US and UK deliberately talk down our country, and in particular our capital city. Yet the latest evidence is clear – a record number of US citizens are now applying for citizenship here in the UK,” he said.</p> <p>“For many Americans I speak with, it’s because of our values,” he said. “As well as being the UK’s financial, legal and governmental centre, in London we offer an ecosystem that is unparalleled around the world, from our brilliant universities to our culture and our creative industries.</p> <p>“But it’s also our liberal values that make us stand out – celebrating our diversity in London as a strength, not as a threat to society.”</p> <p>Since the start of 2025, the Home Office has received citizenship applications from 4,125 US citizens, a rise of 40% compared with 2024.</p> <p>The prime minister, Keir Starmer, intervened to defend Khan when Trump mentioned him during their meeting at the White House, saying: “He’s a friend of mine, actually.”</p> <p>Trump has frequently made social media posts about Khan, calling him a “stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London”.</p> <p>A mass demonstration is planned in London by the Stop Trump Coalition for Wednesday, the first day of the president’s state visit, when he will spend time with King Charles and Starmer.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the demonstration has condemned the British government for offering the president a second state visit – the first time in history such an honour has been extended. </p> <p>The visit will take place over parliamentary recess, meaning that the government swerves the question over whether he should address parliament.</p> <p>“We know that Trump is deeply unpopular with the public,” the spokesperson said. </p> <p>“We mobilised hundreds of thousands of people against Trump during his first term, and he has only got worse since then. </p> <p>“We are working at speed to bring together all the movements – for democracy, for equality, against climate change, for a free Palestine – to show our unity against Trump.”</p> <p>The march will come less than a week after a mass far-right rally in London, which was addressed by former Trump adviser Elon Musk, who warned of a potential violent uprising. His remarks have been condemned by the prime minister.</p>
