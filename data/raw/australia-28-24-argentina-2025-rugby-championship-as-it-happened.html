He’s given his immediate reaction to the host broadcaster.</strong></p> <p>On the dramatic conclusion to the match and his decision to repeatedly decline the penalties on offer.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There was obviously a lot happening there and I guess full credit to the team. We could have gone for goal there and taken the draw. It was a tough game, but everyone believed that we could finish the job and the boys wanted to win a game as well, as a group on the field, everyone sort of feeling the moment. And the crowd was 25,000 people pleading for us to tap it and try and win the game. And that really probably was the difference in the choice at the end.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the game of two halves:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Probably our discipline in the first half, it really did hurt us there and we just wanted to hold onto the ball for a few more phases, not give them easy outs with penalties. And I thought we did that and I’m very proud of the boys. </p> <p>We weren’t at our best today, but to find a way to get a win against such high quality opposition, it’s a real credit to them. They’re such a world class forward pack and we knew that coming into it. So we knew we had to be ready for it up front. And then obviously we’ve got some backs with a lot of speed. And if we get them a bit of front foot ball, they’re great to watch.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68bbd7d08f085f50533e8c73" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-06T06:42:59.214Z">7.42am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>That was a desperate, breathless, final few minutes of time added on.

Kick-off at North Queensland Stadium in Townsville is 2:30pm (AEST).</strong></p> <p>The Wallabies are back – literally, and, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/aug/17/wallabies-break-south-africas-aura-of-invincibility-in-win-that-asks-is-australian-rugby-back">it would appear, metaphorically</a>. Following a historic trip to South Africa, Australia welcome Argentina for a double-header with expectations higher than at any point in almost a decade.</p> <p>The 22-38 triumph over the World Cup holders at Ellis Park three weeks ago follows on from a deserved final Test victory over the British and Irish Lions, concluding a three-match series that contained plenty of reasons to be cheerful.</p> <p>Joe Schmidt’s work behind the scenes is clearly paying off, while access to the best Australians playing overseas has elevated a willing mob into one sprinkled with stardust. As Daniel Gallan wrote following the comeback over the Springboks: “Maybe a team with a solid set-piece, a totem in the lineout, berserkers at the breakdown, ballers in the midfield and dazzlers in the backfield are simply a formidable outfit that deserve more respect than they’ve been shown.”</p> <p>The challenge now is to embrace that expectation and deliver as favourites, an unfamiliar sensation after five consecutive matches grinding as underdogs.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/aug/18/ellis-park-epic-delivers-a-powerful-adrenaline-shot-to-australian-rugby">Ellis Park epic delivers a powerful adrenaline shot to Australian rugby | Angus Fontaine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Doing so without Will Skelton increases the degree of difficulty. The man mountain has been key to Australia’s resurgence but with his bulk back in La Rochelle the Wallaby pack is less potent. And there remains the challenge of establishing a long-term partnership in the halves. 35-year-old Nic White retains the No 9 jersey despite announcing his international retirement in August, and he will partner 22-year-old Tom Lynagh in Townsville, after spending the South African tour alongside fellow veteran James O’Connor.</p> <p>White and Lynagh will have their hands full against an Argentina side relishing their own historic success after they defeated New Zealand on home soil for the first time a fortnight ago.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/24/rugby-championship-argentina-make-history-first-home-win-against-new-zealand">Argentina make history with first home win against New Zealand in Rugby Championship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Los Pumas boast a fearsome experienced pack, and the Wallabies will be all too aware of the try-scoring potential outside after Argentina ran in nine this time last year when the fixture was played in Santa Fe.</p> <p>Australia appear to have come on in leaps and bounds since that record defeat. The next couple of hours will begin to reveal if there is substance behind that assumption, or whether Australian rugby is again tormented by another false dawn.</p> <p>If you want to get in touch this afternoon, the address is <a href="mailto:jonathan.howcroft.casual@guardian.co.uk">jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com</a>.</p>   </div>   </div>
