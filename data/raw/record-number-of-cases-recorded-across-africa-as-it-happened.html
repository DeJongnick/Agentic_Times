  <p><strong>Jane Halton</strong>, former head of the federal Department of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/health">Health</a> in <strong>Australia</strong>, said the country’s government needs to be doing more to ensure it’s easy for aged care workers to vaccinated.</p> 
  <p>She says this could include sending in teams to homes, rather than just relying on workers to get the jab in their own time.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That would be our preference.</p> 
   <p>Our preference would be that this is made as easy as possible for workers. We’ve done this for the aged care residents themselvess, our preference would be that this made is made as easy as possible.</p> 
   <p>Now the good news is, some providers are actually arranging this as we speak. Some providers are making sure either they bus their workers to centres to have them vaccinated, or they bring that capability on site.</p> 
   <p>So we believe this is an immediate priority waiting until the first of September, for the first dose, our strong preference would be to have that achieved well before that date.”</p>

  <p>For the rest of the world, here’s a summary of what we’ve covered today. </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Indonesia is calling for oxygen to be redirected to its hospitals</strong>, where there are major shortages. During an oxygen outage at a hospital in Yogyakarta city on Saturday 33 people died. Indonesia reported on Monday a record 29,745 new coronavirus infections and 558 deaths, health ministry data showed.</li> 
   <li>Save the Children said more vaccines need to reach Indonesia to stop the spread of the virus. <strong>The charity said children are suffering from the current outbreak in Indonesia</strong>, with almost 600 killed. </li> 
   <li><strong>Bangladesh has suffered its worst day, with 164 deaths</strong> and 9,964 new infections. The government has extended the current lockdown into next week as hospitals on border areas struggle with the Delta variant, which was first identified across those borders in India.</li> 
   <li><strong>Africa recorded its record number of cases over the past week</strong>, according to a count by AFP. There were 36,000 new infection reported per day, driven by a surge in South Africa. </li> 
   <li><strong>England will lift regulations on wearing face masks and social distancing in public spaces.</strong> There has been strong opposition however to the idea of allowing people to ride public transport without face coverings, especially as infections are currently rising. </li> 
   <li><strong>Spain recorded more than 30,000 new infections since Friday</strong>, an 85% increase on the previous weekend. The Delta variant has spread among mostly unvaccinated young people. </li> 
   <li>The UN’s refugee agency UNHCR said <strong>the pandemic has made displaced women and girls more vulnerable</strong> to domestic violence, sexual violence and early marriages. </li> 
   <li><strong>Sri Lanka received its first delivery of Pfizer vaccines</strong> bought through the World Bank’s financing for developing countries who have not been able to purchase vaccines in the way richer nations have, forcing them to wait on donations. </li> 
   <li>Egypt’s statistics agency noted that <strong>deaths were almost 15% higher during the first of this year</strong> compared to the same period in 2019. It did not say what the underlying causes were. </li> 
   <li>There’s a growing controversy in <strong>Thailand</strong> after a leaked health ministry document has prompted calls for medical staff inoculated against Covid to be given a booster of an mRNA vaccine, because it included a comment that such a move could dent public confidence in Sinovac Biotech’s vaccine. Thailand reported 6,166 new Covid infections today, and 50 new fatalities.<br></li> 
   <li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/jul/05/duchess-of-cambridge-self-isolating-at-home-after-covid-contact">The Duchess of Cambridge is having to self-isolate</a> after coming into contact with someone who later tested positive for coronavirus</strong>, Kensington palace said. Kate was due to spend the day with William celebrating the 73rd anniversary of the NHS at two major events but will now have a self-isolation period at home.</li> 
   <li>Infectious disease expert <strong>Dr Anthony Fauci</strong> says about 99.2% of recent Covid deaths in the US involved unvaccinated people.<br></li> 
   <li>In <strong>China</strong> the city of Ruili, home to more than 210,000 people, has been locked down again after the discovery of cases imported from neighbouring <strong>Myanmar</strong>.</li>

  <p>Ivory Coast has sent mobile clinics into busy areas like markets in the main city Abidjan to speed up vaccinations, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>After administering fewer than 800,000 doses since vaccinations began in March - enough for a single dose for just 3% of the population - Ivorian health authorities are now aiming to inoculate a million people in Abidjan over the next 10 days.</p> 
   <p>While acknowledging that will be a tall order, they hope to pick up the pace by targeting some of Abidjan’s most frequented places, especially its vast open-air markets where most of its 5 million residents shop for food and clothing.</p> 
   <p>At the market in the district of Adjame, which municipal officials say is visited by more than one million people a day, mostly female vendors and customers lined up to be vaccinated in an air-conditioned truck.</p> 
   <p>“We are very happy about the convenience of the vaccines. It suits everyone,” said Minigna Keita, who promotes cosmetic products at the market.</p> 
   <p>In the Treichville district, health workers roamed the market with megaphones, encouraging people to get vaccinated.</p> 
   <p>“This morning it was a little slow, but people have started to show up in large numbers after seeing that the first people vaccinated did not have any problems,” said Sylvie Sie, who coordinates vaccinations in the district.</p>

  <p>Egypt has officially recorded more than 16,000 deaths and 280,000 cases but the real number of infection is thought to be higher because of low testing rates and the exclusion of data from private testing. </p>

  <p>As England prepares to ease coronavirus restrictions further, the messaging from ministers has changed. We have reached, it seems, a tipping point in the pandemic where rules <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jul/04/pm-confirm-19-july-end-covid-restrictions-scientists-warnings-england">will be replaced by personal decisions</a>. The mantra now is about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/17/how-do-we-learn-to-live-with-covid">living with coronavirus</a>, much as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/04/uk-scientists-caution-that-lifting-of-covid-rules-is-like-building-variant-factories">we do with seasonal flu</a>.</p> 
  <p>The pandemic has invited countless comparisons between coronavirus and influenza and the diseases do have some features in common. Both are contagious, potentially lethal respiratory viruses. They can spread through aerosols, droplets and contaminated surfaces. And they share some of the same symptoms in the form of fever, cough, headaches and fatigue. In the winter ahead, one challenge the NHS faces is separating the Covid patients from the flu cases.</p> 
  <p>But there are striking differences between coronavirus and flu that matter for public health. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Coronavirus</a> spreads faster than influenza and can cause far more serious illness. The symptoms of coronavirus can take longer to show, and people tend to be contagious for longer, making them more prone to passing it on.</p>

  <p>Greece could lower the age for vaccinations to 15 after it was recommended by the country’s vaccination committee, Reuters reports. </p> 
  <p>Government approval is still required to turn the recommendation, which notes parental consent would be necessary, into policy. Currently the lower age for vaccinations is 18. </p> 
  <p>“This summer is being overshadowed by the Delta variant, which can be highly contagious in a very short exposure time,” Theodoridou said. “We believe (vaccinating teenagers) is a safe step towards normality,” said the committee’s head Maria Theodoridou. <br></p> 
  <p>On Monday, health authorities reported 801 cases and six deaths, bringing total infections to 426,963.</p> 
  <p>As of Monday, 38.2% of Greece’s eligible population was fully vaccinated while 47.7% had had one dose, officials said.<br></p>

  <p>It represents a huge step forward to something like normality in the film industry: the Cannes international film festival is reopening for business on Tuesday after cancellation of its physical edition last year. The ebb and flow of the coronavirus pandemic forced the festival, and its thousands of attendees from both the film business and the media, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jan/27/cannes-film-festival-officially-delayed-from-may-until-july">change its plans on multiple occasions</a>, and it will finally achieve lift-off with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/apr/19/annette-sparks-musical-film-adam-driver-marion-cotillard-cannes-film-festival">world premiere of the Sparks musical Annette</a>, Cannes’ first in-person screening since May 2019.</p> 
  <p>Eve Gabereau, managing director of UK distributor Modern Films, says it is “surreal, crazy and daunting” to return to Cannes, but that “it is important and great to be going – for the industry at large, professionally for my company, and for me personally”.</p> 
  <p>She adds: “Cannes is so important because of the buzz created around new films and talent, that allows us as an industry to come together and to build the year ahead, both for local markets and on a global scale. There are of course other great festivals that fulfil a similar role but there is something about Cannes – it feels like the starting point of it all.”</p> 
  <p>Traditionally, with its competition, special screenings and associated events, Cannes has provided a platform for independent and non-English language films, and its awards – led by the Palme d’Or – can propel even the most obscure product of world cinema to international acclaim. At the same time, its high-profile red-carpet premieres provide a dose of paparazzi glamour that rivals the Academy Awards. And operating concurrently to the festival is the perennially busy Cannes Marché du Film, where producers sell their films to distributors all over the world in what amounts to a giant industry trade fair.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told the public in England that from 19 July they must use their own judgment to mitigate the risk of Covid-19 infections, wiping hundreds of regulations on mask-wearing, social distancing, gatherings and home working and heralding a return to normality.</p> 
  <p>The prime minister will also announce plans for those who have been double vaccinated to avoid quarantine rules on return from amber-list countries or when contacted by test and trace, with more details later in the week.</p>

  <p>There will be no requirement to wear a mask in any setting in England and businesses who chose to enforce mask-wearing would need to take legal advice on their responsibilities under the Equality Act, Downing Street said.</p> 
  <p>Instead, people will be merely advised to consider wearing a mask in crowded spaces where they mingle with people they would not ordinarily meet. The change has prompted a significant backlash from regional mayors, who have called for their wearing to be retained on transport and retail.</p>

  <p>Staying in the UK, Downing Street has described a claim by the prime minister’s former chief adviser that <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> is ignoring scientific advisers over the final stage of the road map out of Covid restrictions as “not accurate”.</p> 
  <p>Asked if lifting measures on 19 July was the right approach in a question and answer session on his blog, <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong> wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Obviously not, and No10 has been told by scientific advisers not to do what they’re doing.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>However, when asked about the former adviser’s comments, the prime minister’s official spokesman told reporters:</p>

   <p>That’s not accurate. Obviously the chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer will be alongside the prime minister later.</p>

  <p>In the UK, the assistant general secretary of the the Unison trade union has warned against lifting too many restrictions too quickly. PA Media quotes <strong>Jon Richards</strong> as saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Now isn’t the time to throw caution to the wind, especially with infections on the rise. The economy is important, but so is public confidence.</p> 
   <p>People want clarity from the government as restrictions are eased. They don’t need a confusing free-for-all, with ministers absolving themselves of any responsibility for public health.</p> 
   <p>Face coverings and well-ventilated workspaces provide a level of reassurance and security to staff who deal with the public. Safety laws also require their employers to keep these workers safe.</p> 
   <p>Many other employees, who’ve spent the past 16 months working from home, will be more reluctant to step on to crowded buses, trains, trams and tubes if masks are no longer compulsory.</p> 
   <p>Having two vaccine jabs protects individuals and the wider community. Wearing masks is all about protecting others too. The prime minister should be wary about being too hasty with their scrapping.</p>

  <p>The charity said more than 600 children have died, despite the belief that Covid-19 did not severely affect children. </p> 
  <p>“The recent spike in cases of Covid-19 among children in Indonesia is extremely concerning, and there’s no sign that rates will go down anytime soon without urgently speeding up Covid-19 -vaccine programme,” said Dino Satria, chief of humanitarian and resilience at Save the Children in Indonesia. </p> 
  <p>Indonesia is experiencing its worst wave of infections, with hospitals overwhelmed and running out of oxygen. Save the Children said 260,000 cases of coronavirus have been identified in under-18s. </p> 
  <p>“We desperately need more vaccines – that’s the bottom line. Without help from the international community through Covax, the Covid crisis in Indonesia will quickly spiral out of control,” said Satria. </p> 
  <p>The charity said the pandemic also affects children by forcing them out of school, which makes them more vulnerable to child labour, early marriage and domestic violence. </p>

  <p>Kate was due to spend the day with William celebrating the 73rd anniversary of the NHS at two major events but will now have a self-isolation period at home.</p> 
  <p>Kensington palace said in a statement: “Last week, the Duchess of Cambridge came into contact with someone who has subsequently tested positive for Covid-19.</p> 
  <p>“Her Royal Highness is not experiencing any symptoms, but is following all relevant government guidelines and is self-isolating at home.”</p> 
  <p>Kate’s last public event was a visit to Wimbledon on Friday, when she toured the SW19 sporting venue, meeting staff in the museum and Centre Court kitchen and sitting with the former tennis star Tim Henman to watch Jamie Murray play in the doubles.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Row in Thailand over booster shots after leaked health ministry document</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>There’s a growing controversy in Thailand after a leaked health ministry document has prompted calls for medical staff inoculated against Covid to be given a booster of an mRNA vaccine, because it included a comment that such a move could dent public confidence in Sinovac Biotech’s vaccine.</strong><br></p> 
  <p>The internal memo, which included various opinions, was reported by local media and shared widely on social media. Reuters report it was confirmed by Thai health minister Anutin Charnvirakul as being authentic.<br tabindex="-1"></p> 
  <p>It included a comment from an unnamed official who recommended authorities do not give a booster shot of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine to frontline health workers, because such a move would be “admitting that the Sinovac vaccine is not effective”.<br></p> 
  <p>Thailand has administered Sinovac’s inactivated virus vaccine to most health workers and its real-world study showed two doses were 95% effective in reducing mortality and severe symptoms. The study showed it was 71% to 91% effective in stopping infection with the Alpha variant.<br></p> 
  <p>The comment in the leaked document prompted calls from prominent Thai health experts, including a top medical council official, to give health workers a Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot. The hashtag “Give Pfizer to medical personnel” was trending on Thai Twitter with more than 624,000 tweets on Monday.</p> 
  <p>Senior health official Opas Karnkawinpong told reporters the document was not real, however, contradicting health minister Anutin.<br></p> 
  <p>Anutin had said the comment on the booster shot was “just an opinion” and there was an expert panel to set vaccine policy. He said two doses of Sinovac’s vaccine were effective and “deliver results beyond the standard”.</p>

   <p>Meanwhile, the south, southwest and parts of the midwest are starting to see surges. Florida, in particular, is being hit hard, Reiner noted, with about 17% of all new US cases being reported in the state.</p> 
   <p>“People will continue to die until we vaccinate everybody,” Reiner said.</p>

   <p>In September last year, announcing his winter economy plan, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gave a speech saying the country had to start getting back to normal because it could not live with restrictions forever. “We must learn to live with it [coronavirus] and live without fear,” he said. With its implied refusal to defer to the ‘health and safety’ science lobby, its worldly realism about risk and its focus on the interests of the economy, the speech delighted Conservative MPs.</p> 
   <p>Unfortunately, it turned out to be premature. There were two more lockdowns to come.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The race to obtain Covid-19 vaccine supplies has been likened to the Hunger Games as Australia’s rollout continues to lag behind similar nations, with only 7.2% of the population fully vaccinated.</strong></p> 
  <p>As New South Wales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/jul/05/australia-covid-update-new-cases-jump-to-35-in-nsw-as-government-weighs-extending-sydney-lockdown">confirmed 35 new coronavirus cases on Monday</a>, the state’s health minister offered a frank assessment of the sluggish dynamics of the national rollout. “Until we get enough vaccine and enough GPs actually at the frontline able to provide that vaccine into arms, we will continue to have effectively the Hunger Games going on here in NSW,” Brad Hazzard said.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland">Queensland</a> premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, also expressed frustration as she confirmed four new locally acquired cases of the virus, telling reporters on Monday that <a draggable="true" href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/queensland">Queensland</a> would only be getting about 65,000 doses of Pfizer a week, with the bulk of the supply not due until October.</p> 
  <p>Palaszczuk sheeted home the blame to the Morrison government and urged Queenslanders to be patient. “We’re waiting on the commonwealth supply so we can make sure that you get your dosage,” she said.</p> 
  <p>The federal health minister, Greg Hunt – who once declared Australia was at “the front of the queue” when it came to Covid-19 vaccination supplies – acknowledged the environment was difficult.</p> 
  <p>“Look, in relation to vaccines, it is the most competitive global environment imaginable,” Hunt told reporters in Melbourne.</p> 
  <p>But the federal minister said last week was the biggest week of the Australian vaccination rollout, with 8.25m jabs administered. He said the government continued to “work very constructively with all the states and territories” and the daily inoculation statistics indicated the programme was continuing to ramp up.</p>

  <p>The complexity of New York’s economic recovery from Covid will take years to unpick. Before the pandemic Americans spent 5% of their working time at home. By spring 2020 the figure was 60%. It’s a seismic shift that has hit office-laden Manhattan particularly hard. The Partnership for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> City predicts that only 62% of office workers will return, mostly three days a week, by September.</p> 
  <p>Banks, which have mostly ordered a full return to the office, are facing pushback from workers, who point to higher levels of happiness and productivity from working at home. But it is also a way to return production overheads to the labor force. The conflict will take time to resolve and could trigger a crisis in commercial property values if the workers win. </p> 
  <p>Tourism, which contributes $60bn to the city’s economy annually, remains anemic. The hit to the city’s leisure and hospitality sector, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SMU36935617072200001SA">which peaked at 300,000 jobs in December 2019</a>, is severe. A <a href="https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/new-yorks-economy-and-finances-covid-19-era-july-1-2021">statewide report issued on Friday</a> found that New York had lost 2m jobs during the pandemic and unemployment in May stood at 8.2%, far above the pre-pandemic level and well above the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/02/us-jobs-rebound-accelerates-june">national average of 5.9%.</a></p> 
  <p>But others have prospered. The report found personal income in New York had risen 12.8%, hitting $1.6tn in the first quarter of 2021, surpassing pre-pandemic levels and seeing a more than 50% increase from the final quarter of 2020. <br></p> 
  <p>At the same time, the movement of people in the city has been profoundly altered. As public transport use dropped, road traffic surged. The New York City area now officially has the worst traffic in the country, according to survey for Texas A&amp;M’s Transportation Institute.</p>

  <p>By the way, worth a reminder that Boris Johnson might be the prime minister of the UK, but that his move today will only apply to England. <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/">Politico’s London playbook</a> had a quick round-up of the state of play elsewhere in the UK:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The government in <strong>Scotland </strong>will carry on urging Scots to wear face masks in shops and on public transport after their own freedom day on 9 August, when all other legal restrictions are set to be dropped. On 19 July, Scotland is currently set to move to level zero in its tiering system, the lowest level where some freedoms are still curbed.</p> 
   <p>In <strong>Wales</strong> there is no freedom day date set — much to the Welsh Tories’ displeasure — but another review of the data is set for 15 July where the thinking on masks should become clear. Welsh Counsel General Mick Antoniw <a href="https://politico.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e26c1a1c392386a968d02fdbc&amp;id=0d308b71dc&amp;e=9683f93d15">signaled yesterday</a> that the country could move to “increased normality” over the next few weeks.</p> 
   <p>There’s no unlock date set in <strong>Northern Ireland </strong>either, though <a href="https://politico.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=e26c1a1c392386a968d02fdbc&amp;id=1e7ec98eab&amp;e=9683f93d15">the BBC reports</a> the Stormont executive is set to meet this week to discuss further relaxation of the rules as live music resumes today.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Of course, you’ll note that this is all framed very differently when you write “where some freedoms are still curbed” as opposed to “where some pandemic precautions are still in place.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">UK minister: vaccination has 'really weakened the link' between people catching Covid and hospitalisation</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Here’s the key quote from social care minister Helen Whatley from her Sky News appearance this morning. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Later today the prime minister and health secretary are going to be setting out our plans for the next stage of the roadmap. We’re on track to take that final fourth step of the roadmap on 19 July giving people back far more of their freedoms, much more back to normal. And this is thanks to both the sacrifices that people have made, and the huge success of the vaccination programme. What we’re seeing is the vaccination programme has really weakened the link between people catching Covid and ending up in the hospital, and then, very sadly, the risk of dying. What we’re seeing is the vaccination really making a difference there. So that’s why the prime minister will be able to set up these plans with the health secretary later today.</p>

  <p>It is one of the UK’s health ministers Helen Whately who is doing the media round this morning. She’ll be out and about attempting to justify why it seems the hawks on reopening have the upper hand in the wake of Matt Hancock’s departure.</p> 
  <p>As a reminder, we are expecting a press conference from Boris Johnson in Downing Street today where he is expected to announce the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England from 19 July, and also the dropping of any mandatory face mask or social distancing measures.</p> 
  <p>It has been teased out to PA Media and other media outlets that Johnson is expected to say:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Thanks to the successful rollout of our vaccination programme, we are progressing cautiously through our road map. Today we will set out how we can restore people’s freedoms when we reach step 4.</p> 
   <p>But I must stress that the pandemic is not over and that cases will continue to rise over the coming weeks. As we begin to learn to live with this virus, we must all continue to carefully manage the risks from Covid and exercise judgment when going about our lives.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It still remains unclear in the coming weeks how you are meant to manage your own risks and exercise a judgment to maintain social distancing from people if they are determined not to socially distance themselves from you.</p> 
  <p>The latest data on the government’s own dashboard suggests case numbers have risen by nearly 70,000 or 67% in the last seven days. Hospitalisations however, remain at a much lower rate of increase – nevertheless showing a 24% rise in a week.</p> 
  <p>Alongside the press conference, the government will publish the results of its reviews into the use of so-called vaccine passports and the future of social distancing guidance, Downing Street confirmed. Health secretary Sajid Javid will also address the Commons later to update MPs on any changes.</p>

  <p>Good morning, it is Martin Belam here in London. Indonesia will provide free telemedicine services to coronavirus patients with mild symptoms, its health minister said today, in an effort to reduce pressure on a healthcare sector inundated by record numbers of Covid cases.</p>

  <p>Reuters reports that remote services will be provided from Tuesday by telehealth firms such as Alodokter and Halodoc and will include free consultations and medication delivery, health minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin told a news conference.<br></p> 
  <p>“Positive Covid-19 patients can get medical services on time without waiting in line at hospitals, so that hospitals can be prioritised for patients with medium, heavy, and critical symptoms,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Hospital bed occupancy was at 75% nationwide as of 2 July, the health ministry said, but some hospitals on the most populous island of Java have reported over 90% capacity, including in the capital, Jakarta.</p>

  <p>The Guardian understands that more than 500 staff at Royal North Shore hospital and more than 120 staff at Fairfield hospital are now isolating and unable to work after being identified as a close contact of the 24-year-old student nurse who worked from 24-28 June across the two hospitals while infectious. </p> 
  <p>Nurses, as well as administration staff and other healthcare workers, are among the isolating workers. </p> 
  <p>The situation is so severe at Royal North Shore hospital, where five wards are affected, that health authorities are understood to be trying to move nursing staff from nearby hospitals to help fill the shortfall in services. </p> 
  <p>The number of isolating close contacts related to the student nurse has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/30/alice-springs-joins-parts-of-nsw-queensland-and-perth-in-lockdown-after-covid-case-visited-airport">swelled since Wednesday</a>, when about 100 initial staff and patients were sent into isolation following a positive result being returned late on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>Brett Holmes, general secretary of the NSW Nurses and Midwives Association, said the isolation orders have had “a large burden” on an “already strained” workforce. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>America’s top infectious disease expert says about 99.2% of recent Covid deaths in the United States involved unvaccinated people. And Dr. Anthony Fauci says “it’s really sad and tragic that most all of these are avoidable and preventable.”<br><br>He told NBC’s “Meet the Press” it’s frustrating “where you have a formidable enemy” in the coronavirus and “yet we do have a countermeasure that’s highly, highly effective. And that’s the reason why it’s all the more sad and all the more tragic why it isn’t being completely implemented in this country.”</p> 
  <p>Fauci cited the reasons for opposition to the vaccine by some Americans, whether it’s “ideological” or whether some “are just fundamentally anti-vax or anti-science.”</p> 
  <p>He said the country does “have the tools to counter” the pandemic and he’s asking people to “put aside all of those differences and realise that the common enemy is the virus.”<br><br>Fauci noted the United States is “very fortunate” that it has “enough vaccines to vaccinate essentially everybody in the country. And there are people throughout the world who would do anything to get vaccines.”<br><br>The United States has registered over 605,000 deaths in the pandemic, the highest national toll in the world.</p>
