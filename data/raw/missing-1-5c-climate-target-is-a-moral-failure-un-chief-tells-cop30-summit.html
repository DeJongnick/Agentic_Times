<p>The failure to limit global heating to 1.5C is a “moral failure and deadly negligence”, the UN secretary general has said at the opening session of the Cop30 climate summit in the Brazilian city of Belém.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/antonio-guterres">António Guterres</a> said even a temporary overshoot would have “dramatic consequences. It could push ecosystems past catastrophic tipping points, expose billions to unliveable conditions and amplify threats to peace and security.”</p> <p>Speaking to heads of state from more than 30 countries, Guterres called the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels a “red line” for a habitable planet and urged his audience to bring about a “paradigm shift” so that the effects of the overshoot could be minimised.</p> <p>“Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement and loss – especially for those least responsible. This is moral failure – and deadly negligence,” he said.</p> <p>On Thursday, the World Meteorological Organization confirmed that greenhouse gas emissions, which are heating the planet, had risen to a record high. It said 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. All of the 10 hottest years in measured history have been in the past decade.</p> <p>Guterres said there had been some progress but it was not fast enough. Many countries had put forward more ambitious plans to cut emissions. If they were fully implemented, he said, the world would be on a pathway to about 2.3C of global warming.</p>    <p>This forecast leaves the planet in dangerous territory but is considerably better than seemed possible 20 years ago. This is largely thanks to international support for the 2015 Paris agreement and a clean energy revolution that is gathering pace. But several powerful countries are stepping away from climate action as far-right nationalism takes hold, particularly the US.</p> <p>Guterres said the oil, gas and coal industries were holding back change. In his fiercest criticism yet, he said these companies commanded vast subsidies and political support and used them to the detriment of everyone else.</p> <p>He said: “Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation, with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress.”</p> <p>The summit – and next week’s Cop30 – takes place in turbulent times. Much of the world is distracted by war, and the US is leading an attack on efforts to build international collaboration to deal with shared global problems.</p> <p>Ding Xuexiang, a vice-premier of China, made a thinly veiled reference to Trump’s tariffs, saying the green energy transition depended on a free flow of green technology and the removal of trade barriers. “China is a country that honours its commitments,” he said, noting that his country, which is the world’s biggest carbon emitter, has set a goal for the next five years to peak its carbon use and reinforce ecological security goals.</p> <p>Gustavo Petro, the president of Colombia, had particularly harsh words for the absent, science-denying US president. “Mr Trump is literally against humankind,” he said. “We can see the collapse that will happen if US does not decarbonise its economy. It is 100% wrong.”</p> <p>“This is a real apocalypse,” he said. In addition to Trump, he laid much of the blame at the feet of petroleum industry lobbyists in the Cop system. “They are going against life. This is immoral. This is not human.” As a result, he said, the world had lurched from climate change to climate crisis and now faced climate collapse.</p> <p>Many countries have already been hit by climate disasters. The UK’s Prince William noted the world was moving perilously close to tipping points in the natural systems – ocean currents, rainforest and ice caps – that all life depends on. Among the solutions, he said, was the need to acknowledge that Indigenous people were climate leaders and to give them legal recognition to their land.</p>    <p>Countries in the global south want the industrialised global north to provide support to adapt to ever more extreme weather and help them with energy transition, but financial commitments have so far fallen far short of the $1.3tn a year that was agreed at Cop29 in Baku. Guterres said developed countries must lay out a clear path to that goal.</p> <p>Keir Starmer told the summit that the UK was “all in” on tackling the climate crisis because it was a “win-win” for people and the economy that would reduce bills, create jobs and could be worth £1tn to the UK in five years.</p> <p>He said: “Ten years ago the world came together in Paris, united in our determination to tackle the climate crisis. A consensus that was based on science that is unequivocal. And this unity was not just international, it was there within most of our countries. There was a cross-party consensus in the United Kingdom. The only question was how fast could we go. Today, sadly, that consensus is gone.”</p> <p>The prime minister took veiled aim at prominent figures, including Bill Gates and Tony Blair, who have urged a slowdown on climate action. In a robust rebuff to that attitude, he said: “With some arguing this isn’t the time to act, and saying tackling climate change can wait, my question is this: can energy security wait too? Can billpayers wait? Can we win the race for green jobs and investment by going slow? Of course not.”</p> <p>The Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said Belém should be the Cop of truth. “Now is the time to take seriously the warnings of science,” he said, praising the Paris climate agreement for helping to nudge the world away from its previous doomsday path of 5C of warming, but warning that the planet was still heading towards 2.5C of warming, which would kill 250,000 people each year and shrink GDP by 30%.</p> <p>He told leaders there could be no solution for the climate crisis without tackling inequality within and between countries, and said they should be inspired by Indigenous people who live more sustainably with nature.</p> <p>He finished with a reference to <a href="https://sumauma.com/en/e-se-o-ceu-cair/">the Yanomami Indigenous belief that the people of the forest are helping to hold up the sky</a> and said he hoped this summit would help with that task of climate stabilisation.</p> <p>The first day of the summit saw two other major announcements. Brazil formally unveiled its flagship Cop30 initiative, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/06/tropical-forest-forever-fund-proposed-cop30-tackle-climate-change">the Tropical Forest Forever Facility</a> with new investment commitments of $3bn from Norway over 10 years and unquantified promises of support from China. The facility aims to attract $25bn of investment from governments and another $100bn from financial markets to pay for the preservation of standing forests.</p> <p>Another breakthrough was a first global agreement to recognise and strengthen land tenure for Indigenous peoples and other traditional communities. More than 160m hectares (395m acres) will be covered by the commitment up to 2030. </p>
