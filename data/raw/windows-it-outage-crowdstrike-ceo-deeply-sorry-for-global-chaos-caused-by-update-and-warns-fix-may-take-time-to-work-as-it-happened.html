 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Here is a wrap-up of the day’s key events:</strong></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>George Kurtz, the founder and chief executive of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, has said the company is “deeply sorry for impact that we’ve caused to customers” after a flawed software update prompted a global IT outage.</strong> Kurtz told NBC’s Today Show in the US that the problem was down to a bug in a single update. “We identified this very quickly and remediated the issue,” he said, adding that CrowdStrike was now “working with each and every customer to make sure that we can bring them back online”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Businesses including banks, airlines, railways, telecommunications companies, TV and radio broadcasters, and supermarkets have been taken offline after blue screen of death error screens were seen on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/windows">Windows</a> workstations across the globe.</strong> Users on the subreddit for the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike reported issues in India, the United States and New Zealand.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>GP surgeries across England hit by the outage have said the issue “will have a big effect”. </strong>GP practices said they are unable to access patient records or book appointments due to the major global IT outage. Surgeries took to social media to report they cannot access the EMIS Web system. It is understood that NHS hospitals are currently unaffected by the outage.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Airports in Germany have also been hit by the outages, causing major delays at the start of school holidays for many regions.</strong> Air traffic at Berlin’s BER came to a complete halt in the early morning hours of Friday, according to public broadcaster RBB due to a server breakdown that triggered several emergency systems to kick in.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The dollar rose and stock markets fell in jittery trading today, as the global IT outage unnerved investors.</strong> The group that runs the <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong> suffered an outage that affected user access to some of its products, and Refinitiv was down earlier. By around midday in Europe, the company said its services had been restored.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>China’s flag carrier Air China and other major airlines have not been affected by the global tech outage that disrupted operations in multiple industries on Friday due to the use of different systems, according to state media CGTN. </strong>Meanwhile, Wizz Air said it has suspended its fees for airport check-in as its online systems are unavailable due to the IT outage.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>New York City’s subway system agency, the MTA, <a href="https://x.com/MTA/status/1814221462552584222">said</a> that “some MTA customer information systems are temporarily offline</strong> due to a worldwide technical outage”. It added that train and bus service is unaffected.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The White House<a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk#h_f60e4b01b24b5d6fdf0eb82a24eef8de"> said </a>that it </strong><strong>was “looking into” the outage</strong>, according to a spokesperson speaking to CNN. “We’re aware of the incident and are looking into the issue and impacts,” the full statement said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The outage also disrupted the European energy market’s liquidity and affected hedge funds and other traders. </strong>Traders were unable to access their computers and contact brokers, although the issues are gradually being resolved.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Customers across the UK have faced issues with trying to pay using their cards, with some shops putting up “cash only” signs on their doors.</strong> A spokesman for the supermarket <strong>Morrisons</strong> said there were some “isolated incidents” with payment systems this morning, which have now been resolved. <strong>Waitrose</strong> said it was taking contactless payments largely as normal, as well as still processing payments by chip and pin and cash.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Elon Musk claimed in a post on X that he had “deleted Crowdstrike from all our systems”. </strong>He did not offer any proof for this claim or specify what it entailed.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russian officials said that their country’s vital systems had not suffered outages anywhere near as bad as those in the UK, US, and much of the rest of the world.</strong> Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in early 2022, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft">Microsoft</a> and other software providers have drawn down their operations in the country.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>CrowdStrike saw it share value fall precipitously after disclosing that its software update was the source of the debilitating global outage.</strong> At midday, CRWD had dropped by 12%. The company’s update interacted negatively with computers running <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft">Microsoft</a> Windows.</p></li>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>CrowdStrike’s CEO, George Kurtz, <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/our-statement-on-todays-outage/">issued a statement</a> on the company’s website late on Friday afternoon, in which he apologized once again for the outage and said that CrowdStrike was working to help restore systems.</p>

  <p><strong>The outage also disrupted the European energy market’s liquidity and affected hedge funds and other traders.</strong></p> 
  <p>Traders were unable to access their computers and contact brokers, although the issues are gradually being resolved.</p> 
  <p>The outage, which has affected Microsoft Windows devices, meant traders to experienced difficulties logging into their computers, using messenger apps, and sourcing critical data, according to reports from Montel News. Even so, energy companies across Europe say that their operations remain largely unaffected.</p> 
  <p>A representative from the <strong>London Stock Exchange Group</strong> indicated that the outage temporarily disrupted access to the company’s data and messenger systems, which are widely used by energy market participants. Many LSEG employees were unable to log into their computers, significantly affecting market liquidity.</p> 
  <p>A Netherlands-based trader said that access to brokers was the primary issue, with only one broker operating initially. Futures exchanges EEX and ICE continued to function normally, minimising the overall impact, although EEX warned clients about potential login and trading issues.</p> 
  <p>Among energy brokers, only Tradition was operational during early trading, while others, including GFI, Griffin Markets, Spectron, and BGC, were unavailable. </p> 
  <p>Traded volumes for German power and Dutch TTF gas on ICE Endex and EEX remained stable, though Italian power volumes saw a decline of approximately 15%.

 <h2 class="block-title">CrowdStrike chief executive 'deeply sorry' for global impact of flawed software update</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>George Kurtz, the founder and chief executive of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, has said the company is “deeply sorry for impact that we’ve caused to customers” after a flawed software update prompted a global IT outage.</p> 
  <p>Kurtz told NBC’s Today Show in the US that the problem was down to a bug in a single update. “We identified this very quickly and remediated the issue,” he said, adding that CrowdStrike was now “working with each and every customer to make sure that we can bring them back online”.</p> 
  <p>Kurtz said there had been a “negative interaction” between the update and Microsoft’s operating system, which had then caused computers to crash, sparking the global outage, which remains ongoing.</p> 
  <p>Asked how one faulty update could cause such global chaose, he said: “We have to go back and see what happened here, our systems are always looking for the latest attacks from adversaries that that are out there.”</p> 
  <p>He made clear that there was no possibilty it was a cyber-attack. However, although the problem had been identified and a fix issued, Kurtz said “it could be some time for some systems” to return to normal, stressing that they would not “just automatically recover”.</p>

  <p><strong>Today’s global Microsoft IT outage could impact company payroll and the ability for businesses across the nation to pay their employees.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Melanie Pizzey</strong>, CEO and gounder of the Global Payroll Association, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve been contacted by numerous clients already today who have been unable to access their payroll software due to the Microsoft outage and others who have been urged to log out with immediate effect.</p> 
   <p>Depending on the length of this outage, it could have very serious implications for businesses across the nation, particularly those who process payroll on a weekly basis. Furthermore, we could see a backlog with regard to processing payrolls for the coming month end which may delay employees from receiving their monthly wage.</p> 
   <p>At best, it will require those managing payroll to work overtime to rectify the issue, but the good news is that it doesn’t seem to be a cyber attack. This means that the sensitive employee details held within payroll should be safe, although we’re seeing many companies understandably take action to minimise such a threat as a precaution.</p>

  <p><strong>Guardian readers have been getting in touch to tell us how their travel plans have been affected by this morning’s outage.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Saffy Saleem</strong>, 29, a doctor travelling to Mallorca on holiday, is waiting for her flight from Stansted Airport, where she describes the scene as “chaotic”. “We’re stuck at Ryanair check-in. There are queues everywhere,” she says.</p> 
  <p>She has been waiting at the gate for nearly an hour.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We only managed to get our boarding passes about an hour before the flight, but once they checked in then we made it through security. But there were loads of people who’d already missed their flights.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She has been given a handwritten boarding pass and luggage tags.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They’re manually checking people in by crossing out who’s in what seat, and then working out where the free seats are, because no one has seat allocations. It’s very old-school and slow.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In Budapest, <strong>George Burr</strong>, 71, who is returning from a holiday with his wife, is currently waiting on a Ryanair plane to Bristol. He says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We didn’t find out about the outage by anybody telling us, but by looking at the Guardian newspaper online.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Similarly to Stansted, Burr says that airline staff had adapted check-in procedures on Friday morning:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>At the check-in, they just had a single sheet of A4 paper, and were just making a note of people’s check-in numbers. It was all done manually.</p> 
   <p>We’ve been sitting on the plane for nearly two hours. The cabin crew have had to manually count everybody. Obviously they’re not used to counting us, so they had to do it three times.</p> 
   <p>We’ve been told we’re waiting for a slot to take off, but nothing’s happened yet. I don’t know what the position is at Bristol airport, whether there’d be issues about us landing or not. There’s no certainty, I guess.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Meanwhile in Verona, <strong>Emma O’Hara</strong>, 30, from Dublin has encountered long queues and delays on her return from holiday in Italy with her friend Aisling.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A man [member of airport staff] came and kind of explained the situation, said that it was a European-wide outage, and he was quick to say that it wasn’t just Verona airport.”</p> 
   <p>We’ve been waiting an hour, which I suppose it’s not horrendous in the grand scheme of things, but we don’t know when we’ll board. People are a bit fed up, but no one’s in terrible humour yet.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>China’s flag carrier Air China and other major airlines have not been affected by the global tech outage that disrupted operations in multiple industries on Friday due to the use of different systems, according to state media CGTN.</strong></p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Wizz Air said it has suspended its fees for airport check-in</strong> as its online systems are unavailable due to the IT outage. It said in a statement: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>During the outage, free airport check-in is available. Therefore, we advise passengers to arrive at the airport at least three hours before their scheduled departure time to allow sufficient time for check-in, security control and airport-specific health and safety procedures.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>UK and EU holidaymakers who have their flights delayed because of the IT outage are likely to find that they cannot claim compensation from their airline because the problem is out of its control, <em>writes our consumer &amp; Money editor Hilary Osborne</em>.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/sep/09/uk-travel-chaos-how-to-claim-compensation-for-cancelled-or-delayed-flights">EU rules, adopted by the UK</a>, say that passengers can get compensation of up to £520 if their flight is cancelled or delayed by more than three hours - but not when the cause is an “extraordinary circumstance.”</p> 
  <p>Airlines are likely to argue that the outage counts as such - and some are already stressing in communications that the problems are not their fault.</p> 
  <p>Passengers who have travel insurance might be able to make a claim on their policy - but it will depend on the terms and conditions of the policy they have bought.</p>

  <p><strong>Prof John McDermid </strong>of the Institute for Safe Autonomy at the University of York said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Security software is intended to protect computers from attack, e.g. by malware. and to provide this protection it has a lot of power to control the host PC. Such software is pervasive – on many if not all machines of a particular type – so a fault in the security software can bring down many computers at once. This appears to be what is behind the widespread outage of Windows-10 based PCs around the world, with knock-on effects on air travel, banking, etc. </p> 
   <p>We need to be aware that such software can be a common cause of failure for multiple systems at the same time, and we need to design infrastructure to be resilient against such common cause problems, e.g. through use of diversity, that is not relying on a single make of computer system and/or software.</p>

  <p><strong>Dr Harjinder Lallie, </strong>cyber security expert at the University of Warwick, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The worldwide IT outage experienced this morning is unprecedented in the range and scale of systems it has impacted. Although we cannot speculate on the cause of this outage just yet, it appears that this might be a server error emanating from one server supplier.</p> 
   <p>This IT ‘catastrophe’ highlights the need for greater resilience, a greater focus on backup systems, and possibly even a need to rethink whether we are using the most resilient operating systems for such critical systems.</p>

  <p><strong>Ilkka Turunen</strong>, of the software supply chain management firm Sonatype, explains what’s going on with the Microsoft Windows outage.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The widespread outages across the world affecting Microsoft Windows are due to a botched update to a piece of software called CrowdStrike, a well-regarded malware and endpoint protection tool often used by enterprises and many companies across the world.</p> 
   <p>In terms of technical details, the update causes a BSOD loop on any Windows machine essentially making it boot and crash on an infinite loop. Making it worse is the fact that there are a significant number of Windows machines that the update was auto-installed on overnight. There are workarounds that customers of theirs will apply, but it seems to be very manual.</p> 
   <p>It’s definitely a supply chain style incident - what it shows is that one popular vendor botching an update can have a huge impact on its customers and how far a single well-orchestrated update can spread in a single night. It’s not yet clear if the contents were due to malicious reasons, but it shows how quickly targeted attacks on popular vendors could spread.</p>

  <p>Air traffic at Berlin’s BER came to a complete halt in the early morning hours of Friday, according to public broadcaster RBB due to a server breakdown that triggered several emergency systems to kick in. </p> 
  <p>The daily Tagesspiegel said several in-bound flights could not land in Berlin and had to return to the airport of origin or be redirected.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>“The world grinding to a halt because of a global IT meltdown shows the dark side to technology and that relying on computers doesn’t always make life easier,” says <strong>Dan Coatsworth</strong>, investment analyst at the stockbroker AJ Bell.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Countless industries, from airlines and trains to banks and media, face disruption to earnings if they cannot do their job. Workers cannot get from A to B and that will have a knock-on effect for industries across the board if staff aren’t there to perform important functions or systems are offline.</p> 
   <p>The severity of the problem boils down to how long it lasts. A few hours’ disruption is unhelpful but not a catastrophe. Prolonged disruption is another matter, potentially causing damage to companies and economies.</p> 
   <p>There is chatter that cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike ran an update which didn’t work on Microsoft’s operating system and that caused systems to fall over. Given we don’t know the full details, it’s too early for investors to work out the financial or reputational impact to these businesses.</p> 
   <p>Stock markets continued to function as normal despite corporate news feeds and information terminals being impacted by the tech outage. Futures prices imply a small pullback when Wall Street opens later today, but so far investors have not shown any panic. Whether that remains the case as the day goes on is another matter.</p>

  <p><strong>The government’s borrowing was just over £3bn above the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) forecast across the first three months of the financial year, totalling nearly £50bn. </strong></p> 
  <p>Receipts are running slightly behind expectations, while spending has been higher.</p> 
  <p><strong>The EY Item Club forecasting group, which uses the Treasury’s model, thinks higher debt servicing costs means there’s a good chance this underperformance will persist for the rest of the year. Further ahead, the outlook for the public finances depends on how the new government approaches fiscal policy.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Peter Arnold</strong>, EY UK chief economist, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The public finances data tends to be prone to revision, so the picture for the start of fiscal year 2024-2025 could look different in a few months’ time. But as things stand, the EY Item Club thinks this underperformance is likely to persist. The OBR’s assumptions for gilt yields and Bank Rate look too low, and this suggests debt servicing costs will prove to be higher than they expect. This is likely to mitigate the reduction in borrowing caused by a significant tightening in fiscal policy.</p> 
   <p>Looking further ahead, the EY Item Club awaits the new chancellor’s first budget with interest. Maintaining the net debt rule will mean that, in the absence of forecast revisions from the OBR, the new government will face a similar need to consolidate to their predecessors. It looks likely that the freeze on most tax allowances will be maintained for at least the next three fiscal years. However, it may prove challenging to turn existing spending totals into department-by-department plans, both in terms of current and capital spending.</p>

  <p><strong>Retail sales fell by 0.1% in the second quarter from the first, contributing little to GDGP growth. </strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Rob Wood</strong>, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said this keeps his forecast for GDP growth in the second quarter at 0.6%, while the Bank of England has forecast 0.5%, “as consumer spending on services fares better while output is supported by business-to-business spending too”. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As the weather took a turn for the worse in June so did consumers’ spending. Rainfall was 24% below average in June, compared to 19.7% above in May, but June was much cooler than May relative to the seasonal average. The temperature in June averaged 0.2 degrees below the norm, whereas May was the warmest since at least 1884. That probably explained the drop in sales in June. </p> 
   <p>Retail sales have been enormously volatile this year, as they are bounced around by the weather and measurement problems. That enormous volatility can disguise the underlying trend. Retail volumes were not booming in May and neither are they collapsing now. Year-over-year retail sales volumes growth is steadily, if unspectacularly, trending up as consumers’ real income growth improves, they have to replace items like televisions and clothes, and goods inflation slows relative to services.</p>

  <p><strong>Charlie Huggins</strong>, of the investment firm Wealth Club, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Retail sales volumes came in weaker than expected in June, following a stronger-than-expected May. This continues the volatility in monthly sales patterns seen since the turn of the year, with strange weather and economic caution playing a role.</p> 
   <p>Consumers weren’t exactly splashing the cash in June - sales in every category, excluding fuel, declined. But we should remember that May sales were especially strong. Sales volumes over the last 3 and 6 months are broadly flat and suggest the consumer is in reasonable health, but not exactly feeling flush.</p> 
   <p>The volatility in monthly retail sales is making it even more difficult than usual to read the economic tea leaves. June was not a great month for the sector. But inflation is moderating, wages are rising and the election is now done and dusted, providing much needed certainty. This means sales could easily bounce back over summer, especially if the weather Gods start being a little more kind.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Introduction: Retail sales in Great Britain slump by 1.2%; government borrowing figure for June is lowest since 2019</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.</strong></p> 
  <p>Retail sales in Great Britain slumped by 1.2% last month, with retailers blaming poor weather and cost of living pressures.</p> 
  <p>Retail sales volumes fell by 1.2% in June from May, following an increase of 2.9% in May, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected a smaller fall of 0.4%.</p> 
  <p>Sales fell across most sectors, and were down by 2.1% at non-food stores (department, clothing, household, and other non-food stores) while supermarkets and other food stores posted a 1.1% decline.</p> 
  <p><strong>Grant Fitzner</strong>, the ONS chief economist, said department stores, clothing shops and furniture stores were the biggest contributors to the fall.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Retail sales fell back from May’s recent high point with falls across all main shop types, with the exception of petrol stations.</p> 
   <p>Retailer commentary suggested that both poor weather and economic conditions had an effect, as consumers showed caution with their spending.</p>

  <p><strong>Separate figures from the ONS showed the government borrowed £14.5bn in June, £3.2bn less than in June last year. It was the lowest June borrowing – the difference between public sector spending and income – since 2019.</strong></p> 
  <p>Analysts had pencilled in borrowing of £12bn.</p> 
  <p>The interest payable on central government debt fell by £5.5bn to £7.4bn, largely because the interest payable on index-linked gilts (government bonds) rises and falls with the retail prices index, which has reduced sharply.</p>
