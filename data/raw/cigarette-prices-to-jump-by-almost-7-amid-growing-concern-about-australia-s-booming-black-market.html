<p>A scheduled rise in the tobacco excise means cigarette prices in Australia, already the highest in the developed world, will jump by nearly 7% on Monday.</p> <p>The increase comes amid growing criticisms of the price-led anti-smoking policy, which has triggered an explosion in black market tobacco sales and an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/02/burning-out-how-australias-bid-to-cut-smoking-rates-exploded-into-suburban-tobacco-wars">associated jump in violent crime</a>.</p> <p>With the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) estimating that one-fifth of tobacco sales are now illegal, some experts warn Australia has adopted a “prohibition-style” approach to tobacco control that is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/23/australia-tobacco-excise-vape-regulation-war-on-nicotine">doomed to fail</a>, and that the excise should be slashed to erode the incentives for illegal trade.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js"

will rise by 6.8% on 1 September: for a pack of 20 cigarettes it will rise from $28.06 to $29.97, or about $1.50 per cigarette.</p> <p>The increase is a mix of a standard twice-yearly indexation that matches growth in earnings, alongside the third of three special annual 5% rises.</p> <p>Becky Freeman, a health professor at the University of Sydney and a leading expert of smoking control, said while there could be a case for freezing the excise, the focus should be on cracking down on illegal sales.</p> <p><a

introducing tough new laws to combat the widespread sale of illegal smokes and vapes, but said more needed to be done and quickly to address what she called a “public health emergency”.</p> <p>The South Australian government has created a special tobacco enforcement squad with powers to search premises without a warrant, seize illegal tobacco or vapes and shut the store for three months.</p> <p>The Australian Border Force recently boasted it had intercepted a near-record haul of 2,091 tonnes of illicit tobacco products in the year to 30 June – more than three times the volume in 2019-20 and before the black market took off.</p> <p>The ABF also seized 6m illicit vapes.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive"

bad policy worse sounds very much like the definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,” Richardson said.</p> <aside class="element
