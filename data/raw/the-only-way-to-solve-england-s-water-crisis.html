<p>The behaviour of private water companies is widely recognised as unacceptable: they flout regulations, cause significant environmental harm, neglect their responsibilities, and still pay enormous sums to directors and shareholders. Ofwat’s rulings and fines appear ineffective, often penalising consumers (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/18/ofwat-what-are-they-thinking-of">Letters, 18 August</a>), while renationalisation is dismissed as prohibitively&nbsp;expensive. </p> <p>We propose an alternative means of controlling private-sector companies – replace Ofwat’s monetary fines with state-owned voting shares of equivalent value. This approach would have several immediate benefits. By exercising shareholder rights, the state – on behalf of the public – could directly influence company policies; the public purse would gain revenue from dividends; and over time, as the state’s shareholding increased,&nbsp;full nationalisation would become&nbsp;financially feasible.<br><strong>Dr Ruth Sinclair and Dr Jill Vincent</strong><br><em>Loughborough, Leicestershire</em></p> <p>• Your article says that not a single reservoir has been built since water privatisation (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/17/how-can-england-possibly-be-running-out-of-water">How can England possibly be running out of water?, 17 August</a>). But close to 100 were built in the 35 years prior to privatisation. The plundering of our public services and natural resources is a national disgrace. Public ownership is the only way to end this grisly affair.<br><strong>John Lockwood</strong><br><em>Carshalton, London</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
