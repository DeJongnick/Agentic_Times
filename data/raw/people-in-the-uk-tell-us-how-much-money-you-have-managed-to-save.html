<p>The personal savings rate of UK households <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/personal-savings">reached a record high in 2020</a>, during the first coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>Since then, consumers have battled high interest rates and a persistent cost of living crisis, which has meant many householders have had to tap into savings to cope with rising costs. The number of individuals, for instance, who made an unauthorised withdrawal from a Lifetime ISA, and therefore paid a penalty fee, increased by 139% between 2020/21 and 2023/24.</p> <p>According to Finder, the average person in the UK has £16,067 in savings in 2025. However, 2 in 5 Britons (39%) have £1,000 or less in savings, and a quarter of Britons (23%) have £200 or less.</p> <p>1 in 6 UK adults (16%) have no savings at all, equating to around 8.4 million people. 18% of millennials and people in generation X have no savings at all.</p> <p>We’d like to hear from people in Britain how much they have managed to put aside for personal savings. Are you happy with your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/sep/27/seven-ways-to-start-or-build-up-your-savings">emergency fund</a>, or do you believe it is too small? Have you got no savings at all, forcing you to rely on debt? Have you had to stop adding money to your savings account, or had to access it to pay for things? Or have you prioritised saving over spending on non-essentials? How have your savings, or the lack therof, shaped your lifestyle and plans? Tell us.</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="6e9e9c61-9101-4b95-824b-399bb6e7e174" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>
