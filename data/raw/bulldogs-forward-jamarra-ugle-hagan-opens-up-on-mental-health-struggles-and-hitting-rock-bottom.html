<p><br>The Western Bulldogs forward Jamarra Ugle-Hagan has opened up about his mental health struggles for the first time since taking a leave of absence, saying there were times he “didn’t want to leave the house”.</p> <p>The former No 1 draft pick is hoping to make his AFL comeback after recently visiting a health retreat in northern New South Wales.</p> <p>Ugle-Hagan has not played this season but rejoined Bulldogs teammates earlier this week for the first time since April.</p> <p>He revealed the extent of his struggles while speaking with former AFL players Mitch Robinson and Rhys Mathieson on their Rip Through It podcast, saying he had battled with suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>“All the noises actually sent me to a rehab facility for my mental health,” Ugle-Hagan said.</p> <p>“It got to a point where I had to give my car to a mate, so I couldn’t drive – I just didn’t trust myself driving.</p> <p>“There were times when I would think about, to be honest with you, [it is] just not even worth living.</p> <p>“I went through a struggle where I didn’t want to leave the house. I hit rock bottom and found basement … suicidal thoughts would come pretty frequently.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/jun/02/afl-gws-giants-callan-ward-heartbreak-inspiration-knee-injury">Callan Ward turning heartbreak into inspiration sums up all that is wonderful about AFL | Jonathan Horn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ugle-Hagan said he turned to alcohol at the height of his struggles before spending time at the health retreat.</p> <p>“When you are down, you want to keep finding an upper,” Ugle-Hagan said.</p> <p>“My upper was probably staying and hanging out with my mates and getting on the piss, and training with them as well.</p> <p>“But it just had no end goal. I didn’t have a game. I didn’t have anything.</p> <p>“My mental health wasn’t in the right space, so I was struggling, and I found it really tough to even enjoy football.”</p> <p>Ugle-Hagan had been unable to regularly train with the Dogs since late last year. He took part in a light training session at Whitten Oval, but could still be weeks away from a possible comeback at VFL level.</p> <p>The AFL would need to approve Ugle-Hagan’s comeback because he has been under the league’s mental health plan since taking leave.</p> <p>But Ugle-Hagan, who is contracted to the Bulldogs until the end of next season, said he was focused on resuming his 67-game AFL career.</p> <p>The Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge last week raised that same prospect.</p> <p>“I want to play footy. I can’t wait to play footy,” Ugle-Hagan said.</p> <p>“I have been watching every single Bulldogs game. I have been supporting them.</p> <p>“I will go to games at the end of the year. I genuinely want to play one more (game), I want to play some games.</p> <p>“It’s going to be grouse.”</p> <p>Ugle-Hagan maintained his commitment to the Bulldogs after trade speculation linked him with a possible trade to the Sydney Swans, given his time spent in NSW.</p> <p>He led the Bulldogs with a career-best 43 goals in 22 appearances last year, but has not featured at any level since the elimination final defeat to Hawthorn.</p> <p>Beveridge has also swatted away suggestions Ugle-Hagan could be on the move, declaring him “our player”.</p> <p>“I’m obviously still contracted with the Doggies and I still want to play for them and I want to win a flag,” Ugle-Hagan said.</p> <p>“It’s the Bulldogs until my contract runs out and then hopefully they offer me ­another one, but we will see how we go.</p> <p>“They have given me opportunities since day dot, so why can’t I get back?”</p> <p>– with Australian Associated Press</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.
