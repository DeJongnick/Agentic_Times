<p>Russia’s reaction to Donald Trump’s summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska has been nothing short of jubilant, with Moscow celebrating the fact that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/16/no-ukraine-ceasefire-but-a-pr-victory-for-putin-key-takeaways-from-trumps-alaska-summit-with-russian-president">the Russian leader met his US counterpart without making concessions</a> and now faces no sanctions despite rejecting Trump’s ceasefire demands.</p> <p>“The meeting proved that negotiations are possible without preconditions,” wrote the former president Dmitry Medvedev on Telegram. He added that the summit showed that talks could continue as Russia wages war in Ukraine.</p> <p>Trump entered the high-stakes summit warning “I won’t be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire,” and threatening “severe consequences” if Moscow refused to cooperate.</p> <p>But after a three-hour meeting with the Russian side that yielded no tangible results, Trump shelved his threats and instead said the meeting was “extremely productive”, even as Putin clung to his maximalist demands for ending the war and announced no concessions on the battlefield, where Russian forces are consolidating key gains in eastern Ukraine.</p> <p><strong> </strong>Putin on Friday demanded Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk as a condition for ending the war, but offered Trump a freeze along the remaining frontline, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks said.</p> <p>Although Luhansk is almost entirely under Russian control, Ukraine still holds key parts of Donetsk, including the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk and heavily fortified positions whose defence has cost tens of thousands of lives.</p> <p>Putin told Trump that in exchange for Donetsk and Luhansk, he would halt further advances and freeze the frontline in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where Russian forces occupy significant areas.</p> <p>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has consistently rejected giving up territory and on Saturday European allies reaffirmed that Ukraine’s borders must not be altered through force. </p> <p>On Saturday morning, Trump also publicly dropped plans for an immediate ceasefire he had himself championed for months, instead embracing Putin’s preferred path to ending the war: pushing through a far-reaching agreement before halting any fighting.</p> <p>“It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.</p> <p>All in all, the view from Moscow is that Putin appears to have gained the upper hand.</p> <p>“Putin gave Trump nothing, but still got everything he wanted. Trump finally listened to his demands,” said a member of the Russian foreign policy establishment, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>In his remarks after the meeting in Alaska, Putin gave little indication of softening his stance, repeating that Moscow wanted the “root causes” of the conflict addressed – Kremlin shorthand for demands to demilitarise Ukraine, restrict its domestic politics and block its path to Nato.</p> <p>No economic incentives offered by Trump’s team seemed to sway Putin – the economic delegations meeting was even scrapped – with observers stressing he would always prioritise the war in Ukraine over whatever financial gains peace might unlock.</p> <p>Trump admitted there were still “one or two pretty significant items” left to resolve with Putin, but most worryingly for Kyiv, he ramped up pressure on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling Fox News host Sean Hannity: “Now, it’s really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done.”</p> <p>These comments were quickly seized upon in Moscow.</p> <p>“Both sides directly placed responsibility for achieving future results in negotiations on ending military actions on Kyiv and Europe,” Medvedev, now the deputy chair of Russia’s security council, wrote.</p> <p>Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, said: “Trump now appears to be shifting much of the responsibility on to Kyiv and Europe. Ukraine is likely to face increased pressure from the US to begin substantive discussions of Putin’s conditions.”</p> <p>She added that Trump was “once again clearly charmed and impressed by his interlocutor”, referring to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/love-in-a-cold-climate-putin-romances-trump-in-alaska-with-talk-of-rigged-elections-and-a-trip-to-moscow">warm body language and effusive compliments the US president directed at Putin</a>.</p> <p>The key question is how far Trump will press Zelenskyy, who is due to meet him in Washington on Monday, to accept a deal on Putin’s terms and whether European allies can once again steer Trump on to a different course.</p> <p>“Trump clearly did not fully accept the settlement plan that Putin is promoting,” cautioned Stanovaya.</p> <p>For now, though, confidence runs high in Moscow.</p> <p>“The tasks of the special military operation will be accomplished either by military or diplomatic means,” wrote a senior Russian lawmaker, Andrei Klishas, on Telegram.</p> <p>Officials close to Putin felt free to contradict Trump outright. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide who attended the Alaska meeting, said no talks had taken place about a three-way summit between Putin, Zelenskyy and Trump, directly rebutting Trump’s claim to reporters that a meeting was in the works.</p> <p>Russian state media and the Kremlin elite were already in high spirits as Trump rolled out the red carpet and treated Putin as an equal, despite the Russian leader being wanted by The Hague court for war crimes.</p> <p>“Western media are on the verge of completely losing it,” wrote the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, as Putin landed in Alaska.</p> <p>“For three years they told everyone Russia was isolated and today they saw a beautiful red carpet laid out for the Russian president in the US,” she added.</p> <p>On Saturday morning, Russia’s Channel One morning news bulletin highlighted the pomp of the summit, its international visibility, and the warm welcome for Putin, a striking contrast to his isolation by western leaders since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>“The red carpet and handshakes … are in all global publications and TV channels,” a presenter cheered, noting it was the first time Trump had met a visiting leader at the airport.</p>
