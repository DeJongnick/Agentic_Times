<p>Donald Trump’s Hollywood ambassadors, including the actor Jon Voight, joined labor unions and major studios in asking the US president to expand and extend tax incentives for film and television productions.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/r7d2BUM_Ka9A/v0">letter addressed to Trump</a> on Sunday, the studios and unions did not mention his threat to introduce 100% tariffs on films made abroad, but instead thanked him for supporting the industry through their “shared goal” of domestic production.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/12/trump-tariffs-hollywood-movie-industry">‘Would do more harm than good’: what will Trump’s tariffs really mean for Hollywood?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We appreciate and thank you for the support you have shown our industry.
