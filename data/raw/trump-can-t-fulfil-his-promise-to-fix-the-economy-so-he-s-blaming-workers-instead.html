<p>During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump never missed an opportunity to harp on inflation, promising that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFVvZdhef3k">“on day one”</a> he would “end inflation” and lower the costs of groceries, cars and other common goods.</p> <p>Well, it’s day 40, and inflation saw its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-increase-more-than-expected-january-2025-02-12/#:~:text=In%20the%2012%20months%20through,%25%20year%2Don%2Dyear.">largest increase</a> in over a year. Blink and you might have missed that Trump and his fellow Republicans have largely abandoned their concerns about inflation to focus on government “waste”.</p> <p>While Trump hasn’t fulfilled his campaign promise, he is living up to his usual brand of politics: the blame game. And this blame, as usual, is rooted in generating anger against “undeserving” Americans.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/25/trump-pits-immigrants-against-other-working-people-but-we-have-a-common-enemy">Trump pits immigrants against other working people. But we have a common enemy |  Alejandra Gomez and Greisa Martínez Rosas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This time, the undeserving are federal workers and poor people who get nominal benefits from the federal government – like Snap, which administers food stamps, and Medicaid. To fix so-called waste, the president apparently has no choice but to crack down on spending (and enlist help from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309992/trump-doge-workers-cabinet-meeting">Elon Musk</a>), an issue that barely registered in the public consciousness in the <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=government%20waste&amp;hl=en">past 10 years</a> but is somehow now a rampant problem, according to Trump.</p> <p>There are policy frameworks backing Trump and the GOP’s divisiveness, including the well-known Project 2025 and a lesser-known House proposal published in 2024, <a href="https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_word_doc-final_as_of_march_25.pdf">Fiscal Sanity to Save America,</a> that centers government “waste” instead of corporate greed. And now, with Republicans controlling the House, Senate and presidency, Republicans have the power to act on cuts that will harm millions of Americans.</p> <p>Musk and Trump, of course, have already worked to cut thousands of federal workers’ jobs. And with the Trump-backed budget bill the House passed on Wednesday, including $800bn in likely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/25/republicans-spending-deal-medicaid-cuts">cuts from Medicaid</a>, Republicans are one step closer to bulldozing America’s already paltry social safety net.</p> <p>This isn’t just at the federal level. Republicans have been floating proposals in state governments that would restrict healthcare, housing and food benefits instead of making it easier to afford things.</p> <p>The party of “freedom” is endorsing government home visits to surveil “fraud” in all US states (according to page 43 of the GOP’s “Fiscal Sanity” plan). The party of “family values” is also turning its attention to school lunch and breakfast programs, which it claims are subject to “widespread” fraud and abuse (page 46). The party that wants to “make America healthy again” is floating restrictions to Medicaid that would make recipients work at least 80 hours a month, a proposal that wastes government time and money to verify work requirements and which would probably just <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/medicaid-work-requirements-could-put-36-million-people-at-risk-of-losing-health">deter</a> people from getting healthcare, as a flailing GOP work requirement experiment in <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/02/trump-targeted-medicaid-cancer-work-requirements/">Georgia</a> has shown.</p> <p>And as Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/13/donald-trump-administration-foreign-policy">touts himself</a> as an anti-war president, his proposals belie the fact that much of these spending cuts will now be diverted to defense contracts and other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/25/republicans-spending-deal-medicaid-cuts">military and border spending</a>, not on improving the economic lives of everyday workers to whom he made sweeping campaign promises.</p> <p>Meanwhile, straightforward proposals to simply give people more money (which <em>does</em> have <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/study-guaranteed-income-program-results/">evidence</a> of working), such as universal basic income, would be outright banned at the federal level under the GOP plan. So as the cost of living is primed to increase, Republicans have ready-made excuses to justify cutting billions of dollars from these programs, an exceptional sort of cruelty.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>Focusing on extreme examples animates America’s propensity for divisiveness, giving Republicans wide latitude to wreck the lives of millions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, no one wants to see public money being spent wastefully or fraudulently. But incessant focus on “waste” stems from faulty, selective evidence. According to reports from Musk’s own so-called “department of government efficiency”, nearly 40% of cancelled contracts to cut costs are expected to yield <a href="https://time.com/7261360/us-doge-musk-canceled-contracts-no-government-savings/?amp=true">no savings.</a> It also stems from something else that does have proven results: the utility of public outrage.</p> <p>Focusing on extreme examples and “undeserving” government beneficiaries animates America’s existing propensity for divisiveness, giving Trump and his party wide latitude to wreck the lives of millions of people who don’t engage in fraud, waste or abuse. When Reagan wanted tax cuts for the rich, we saw the “welfare queen” trope. When neoliberal Democrats and Republicans wanted to cut public housing at the federal and local level, we saw extreme stories about the <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/myths-and-realities-about-public-housing#:~:text=Myth%20%232:%20Public%20housing%20is,which%20the%20housing%20is%20built.">criminality</a> of people who lived there. We cannot waste the money of hard-working Americans on these “others”. It’s a narrative – often hinging on racism and sexism – that has great outcomes for America’s capitalist class and the politicians who support them.</p> <p>So instead of protesting against the rising cost of living or making demands for universal healthcare, federal job guarantees, increased labor rights, or Snap benefits for all, or cutting the bloated defense budget and increasing taxes on the super-rich to pay for the nominal social welfare benefits that other industrial countries have normalized, working-class Americans are engaging in petty <a href="https://x.com/SaycheeseDGTL/status/1891528603935846653">debates</a> about what kinds of groceries other working-class Americans should buy and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@briannnna14/video/7455823647815568686?lang=en">deputizing</a> themselves to root out “abuse” among other workers.</p> <p>Republicans redirecting blame towards people who are suffering in this economy under the guise of “waste” is a distraction. As inflation is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico">poised</a> to worsen under Trump, Americans would be wise to focus their anger more on the elected officials and billionaires who profit from their pain than on each other.</p> <ul> <li><p>Malaika Jabali is a 2024 New America fellow, journalist and author of It’s Not You, It’s Capitalism: Why It’s Time to Break Up and How to Move On</p></li> </ul>
