<p>My father, Nick Heather, who has died aged 86, was a clinical psychologist with an international reputation in alcohol and addiction research, and published more than 500 articles and more than 20 books. He was tireless and uncompromising in his efforts to advance the understanding and treatment of alcohol problems, especially in challenging the disease model of addiction.</p> <p>Perhaps his most significant contribution was pioneering <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alcohol-misuse/treatment/">“brief interventions”</a> (short counselling sessions), now a key component of efforts used by medical professionals to reduce alcohol problems worldwide. He conducted the first randomised controlled trial, in 1985, and continued to advance their theoretical understanding and practical application for many years.</p> <p>Born in north London, he was christened Brian, but was always called Nick by his parents, Edward Heather, the manager of a Wood Green off-licence, and Marie (nee McDermott). Nick’s working-class upbringing led him to leave Latymer grammar school in Edmonton aged 16, and find clerical work in the City of London. In 1957 he did national service with the RAF, spending time in Germany as a signals operator, and on return did a series of jobs while studying for his A-levels by correspondence.</p> <p>He was accepted by University College London on to a psychology course, graduating in 1965. After working briefly as a lecturer at West Ham College of Advanced Technology (now University of East London), he gained an MSc in clinical psychology at Leeds University (1971).</p> <p>His first clinical psychologist position was at the University Hospital of South Manchester for two years. He then took up a clinical post in Dundee, where he also worked in prisons and young offender institutions. This was where his interest in addictions, especially alcohol abuse, began, and he undertook a PhD, completing it in 1979. His first book, Radical Perspectives in Psychology, was published in 1976. In 1981 he co-wrote, with Ian Robertson, the highly regarded Controlled Drinking. </p> <p>In 1987, he was appointed founding director of the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, and was key in establishing its world-leading status. He returned to the UK in 1994 to set up the Centre for Alcohol and Drug Studies in Newcastle. </p> <p>On “retirement”, in 2003, he was given an emeritus chair at Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, and continued to publish papers and books. He was awarded the Jellinek memorial prize in 2017, the same year as his book Addiction and Choice came out. He published his last book, Evaluating the Brain Disease Model of Addiction, in 2022, aged 84.</p> <p>Outside work, Nick had many passions including music, football, cricket and chess. He had a steadfast commitment to doing the Guardian crossword every Saturday morning.</p> <p>Nick’s first marriage in 1970, to Megan Jones, ended in divorce after five years. They had two sons, Rupert and Adam. He married Jean Forsyth, a maths teacher, with whom he had two sons, Stuart and me, in 1984. Their first son, Nicholas, died as an infant.</p> <p>Jean, four sons, and six grandchildren survive him.</p>
