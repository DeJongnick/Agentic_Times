<p>Anthony Albanese is caught in a pincer movement over a pre-election pledge that he will protect salmon farming in Tasmania’s Macquarie Harbour, with conservationists and industry leaders both urging him to rethink the commitment.</p> <p>The future of salmon farming in the harbour on the state’s west coast has become a sharp political issue centred on whether it can coexist with the endangered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/14/tasmania-maugean-skate-salmon-industry">Maugean skate</a>, an endemic ray-like species that has survived since the age of the dinosaurs.</p> <p>After months of lobbying by industry leaders and Tasmanian Labor MPs, the prime minister last week wrote to salmon companies saying the government would change the law to ensure there were “appropriate environmental laws” to “continue sustainable salmon farming”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/22/eight-labor-climate-champions-to-get-election-help-from-partys-grassroots-environment-action-group">Eight Labor ‘climate champions’ to get election help from party’s grassroots environment action group</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Guardian Australia last year revealed a government scientific committee found that aquaculture in the harbour had substantially reduced dissolved oxygen levels and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/15/tasmania-salmon-industry-macquarie-harbour-maugean-skate">should be scaled back or removed to save the skate from extinction</a>. The industry group Salmon Tasmania, backed by Liberal and Labor MPs, has argued the threat can be managed and called on Albanese to guarantee workers’ jobs.</p> <p>The prime minister’s letter cited <a href="https://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/1795799/2014-2024-Macquarie-Harbour-Maugean-skate-population-status-and-monitoring-report.pdf/_nocache">a new scientific report by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies</a> that said recent surveys suggested skate numbers – which crashed last decade – were likely to have significantly increased over the past two years, returning to about 2014 levels. The report stressed the need for continued monitoring.</p> <p>Eight conservation councils led by Environment Tasmania have written to Albanese expressing “grave concern” about his commitment to introduce salmon-specific legislation. They said it would effectively override national law, undermine an ongoing review by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, and disregard Australia’s international obligations under the world heritage convention. About a third of Macquarie Harbour is included in the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage area.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The letter, seen by Guardian Australia, said the prime minister’s decision could lead to the skate being wiped out – at odds with a Plibersek promise that there would be “no new extinctions” – and that the new report showed skate numbers remained critically low and “extremely vulnerable” to an extreme weather event, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/16/scientists-warn-maugean-skate-tasmanias-thylacine-of-the-sea-one-extreme-weather-event-from-extinction">such as the “inversion” event that led to mass deaths during a storm in 2019</a>.</p> <p>The conservationists also argued Albanese’s plan would have ramifications beyond Tasmania. “If you introduce special legislation for Macquarie Harbour it sets a dangerous precedent that could be replicated across the country,” they said. “The last remaining refuges for many of Australia’s threatened species could be opened up for industrial interests.”</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/02/example-2-zip/giv-3902GWQCe1verNkp/" > <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2018/02/example-2-zip/giv-3902GWQCe1verNkp/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Salmon company bosses also wrote to the prime minister, thanking him for his support but expressing frustration about uncertainty over when Albanese would deliver on his promise. The prime minister has said legislation would be introduced when parliament next sits, which most political observers believe is likely to mean after an upcoming federal election.</p> <p>The chief executives of the three companies operating in Tasmania – Tassal Group, Huon Aquaculture and Petuna Seafood – said Plibersek should immediately end a long-running reconsideration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/nov/07/tasmanian-salmon-farms-could-face-restrictions-to-save-endangered-fish">of whether a decision 13 years ago that allowed salmon farms to expand operations in the harbour was legally sound</a>. Failing that, they called on Albanese to put his promised “special legislation” to parliament before the election to give the industry certainty about its future.</p> <p>“We are ready, willing and able to lend any support necessary for the bill to be put before parliament and request this occurs urgently, prior to calling the federal election,” the chief executives said in the letter. “We also request to be consulted on the proposed content and wording of the bill as part of the drafting process.”</p> <p>Albanese’s office was asked for his response.</p>    <p>Both major parties believe the salmon industry may be a crucial election issue in the seat of Braddon, which takes in Tasmania’s north-west. While the Liberal party holds the seat with an 8% margin, the sitting MP, Gavin Pearce, is retiring. Labor has preselected Anne Urquhart – currently a senator – to take on the Liberal candidate Mal Hingston – a defence contractor.</p> <p>The Coalition’s environment and fisheries spokesperson, Jonno Duniam, said Albanese’s pledge was “nothing more than a hollow commitment” unless it was implemented before the parliament changed.</p> <p>The fight over Macquarie Harbour has coincided with thousands of salmon dying at farms in the D’Entrecasteaux Channel, south of Hobart.</p> <p>The Bob Brown Foundation published photos that showed loads of dead salmon being dumped in skip bins. The state’s Environment Protection Authority said congealed salmon remains – chunks which it described as “fish oil” – had washed up on beaches on Bruny Island and Verona Sands in the Huon Valley over the past week.</p> <p>Salmon Tasmania’s chief executive, Luke Martin, told the ABC that there had been a bacteria outbreak in some salmon leases. He said it was a “really unique and really difficult set of circumstances” that the industry was working to address.</p> <p>The Bob Brown Foundation marine campaigner, Alistair Allan, said the skip bin images showed “just how cruel and disgusting factory-farmed salmon is”.</p> <p>“This is a huge biosecurity breach and disaster,” he said. “The EPA should shut down all these farms and investigate immediately.”</p> <p>The EPA said it had opened an investigation.</p>
