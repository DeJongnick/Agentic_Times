<p>Global stock markets have edged higher and cryptocurrencies rebounded amid signs that a new front in the US-China trade war may not be as severe as first feared.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/trump-china-tariffs">Tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated again on Friday and over the weekend</a>, as Donald Trump threatened to impose additional US tariffs of 100% on China starting next month.</p> <p>The US president accused the country of “very hostile” moves to restrict exports of rare-earth minerals needed for American industry. Beijing said it would retaliate if Trump did not back down.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/12/the-imf-boss-is-right-to-say-buckle-up-the-global-economy-is-facing-multiple-menaces">The IMF boss is right to say ‘buckle up’ – the global economy is facing multiple menaces</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Trump and senior US officials opened a door to a possible deal with China on Sunday. The president wrote on Truth Social: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. He doesn’t want Depression for his country, and neither do I. The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”</p> <p>The comments have offered some comfort for investors in the US and Europe, with stocks opening mostly higher on Monday.</p> <p>In the US, the S&amp;P 500 blue-chip index rose by 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index rose by 1.7%. The UK’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index rose by 0.2% in early trading, before falling slightly by 0.1% in the afternoon.</p> <p>Markets in much of the rest of Europe were muted, with the French Cac 40 index broadly flat, Spain’s Ibex 35 up 0.2% and Germany’s Dax up 0.3%. </p> <p>Most big cryptocurrencies rebounded after a deep sell-off over the weekend. Bitcoin edged up by 0.3% to more than $115,000, after falling below $105,000 on Friday. Ether had dropped to less than $3,500 but rebounded to about $4,100.</p> <p>Richard Hunter, of the broker Interactive Investor, said investors were hoping for a “Taco trade”, which is the idea that markets rally because “Trump Always Chickens Out” (Taco) of aggressive tariff decisions.</p> <p>“The president’s propensity to shoot from the hip unsettles the investment environment, even though some are already speculating that the Taco trade is alive and well,” he said.</p> <p>However, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/28/bullion-bonanza-why-is-gold-hitting-record-highs">heightened sense of uncertainty is pushing investors to gold,</a> which is considered a safe haven asset. Its spot price hit another new high on Monday, rising to as high as $4,078.5 an ounce.</p> <p>Derren Nathan, of the broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “Traders may be banking on a similar pattern where American indexes entered a six-month period of almost unbroken growth helped by a string of trade deals, and growing hopes of a soft landing for the US economy.”</p> <p>Shares in the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca – which made a deal with Trump to lower drug prices and avoid tariffs over the weekend – initially rose on Monday morning, before falling back by 0.5%.</p> <p>Investors were still nervous in Asia, with main markets wobbling on Monday. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped by 1.5%, while the Taiwanese market fell by 1.4%. In mainland <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a>, the Shenzhen exchange fell by 0.9% and the Shanghai market slipped 0.2%.</p> <p>On Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian urged the US to promptly correct its “wrong practices” and said it would act to safeguard its interests.</p> <p>Despite the trade tensions, Chinese exports bounced back in September, topping forecasts as it diversified its markets.</p> <p>Chinese exports rose by 8.3% year on year last month, according to official customs data. This was the fastest growth since March, and beat a 6% increase forecast by economists polled by Reuters. It comes after a 4.4% increase in August.</p>
