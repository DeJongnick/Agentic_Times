<p>We are hoping to facilitate conversations between people of different generations talking about certain topics. We would love to speak to a gen Z and baby boomer art teacher. If you’re an art teacher from these generations and you’d like to speak to us about your experience, we’d like to hear from you.</p> <p>What has it been like working as an art teacher? What do you like about your job? What challenges have there been in your work?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="606fe86f-6cff-47dd-8322-4c94009180aa" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>
