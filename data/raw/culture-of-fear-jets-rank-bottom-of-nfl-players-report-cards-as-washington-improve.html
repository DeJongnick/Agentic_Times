<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/new-york-jets">New York Jets</a> have been graded the worst team in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/nfl">NFL</a> for ownership in this year’s <a href="https://nflpa.com/report-cards/2025">NFL Players Association workplace survey</a>, with players describing a “culture of fear” under owner Woody Johnson. The Jets ranked 29th out of 32 teams in the overall report card, falling eight spots from last year’s rankings.</p> <p>“They talked about the culture – it’s a problem, top down,” NFLPA chief strategy officer JC Tretter said of Jets players’ responses to the survey. “[They said,] ‘It’s a culture of fear here.’ And I think that stood out in those grades.”</p> <p>Players cited concerns that Johnson was not willing to invest in improvements, did not contribute to a positive workplace culture, and did not commit to building a competitive team. He ranked dead last among owners in the survey. The Jets slumped to a 5-12 record in the 2024 season, fired their head coach, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/19/jets-owner-madden-rating-woody-johnson-jeudy-trade">were dogged by reports</a> that Johnson’s teenage son Brick had a say in team decisions and missed the playoffs for a 14th successive season.</p> <p>While the Jets’ workplace situation worsened, the Washington Commanders saw a drastic turnaround following the forced sale of the franchise by Daniel Snyder in 2023. New owner Josh Harris vowed to change the team’s reputation after last year’s NFLPA report graded the Commanders as the league’s worst workplace.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/17/the-nfls-next-dynasty-from-the-bills-to-the-eagles-to-post-imperial-chaos">The NFL’s next dynasty: from the Bills to the Eagles to post-imperial chaos</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’m not an F-minus guy,” Harris said after acquiring the team.</p> <p>He delivered on that promise, as Washington jumped from 32nd to 11th in the overall rankings. First-year head coach Dan Quinn received an A+ grade from his players after leading the team to a surprising 12-5 record and an NFC Championship Game appearance. The Commanders also significantly improved their food services, travel accommodations, and family support, earning a B grade this year. Players for the Atlanta Falcons, Minnesota Vikings, Kansas City Chiefs, Detroit Lions and Miami Dolphins also gave their head coaches an A+.</p> <p>The Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles saw an improvement in their workplace standing as well. After finishing 14th last year, they climbed into the top 10, benefiting from continued investment in their facilities and staff. Players praised the team’s commitment to performance and player well-being, reflecting the organization’s winning culture on and off the field.</p>    <p>For the second straight year, the Dolphins were ranked the NFL’s best workplace. They were followed by the Vikings, Falcons, Las Vegas Raiders and Los Angeles Chargers. The Falcons made the biggest leap, jumping from 25th to third, thanks to major facility upgrades, a new strength staff, and first-year head coach Raheem Morris’s A+ grade. The Houston Texans, Green Bay Packers, and San Francisco 49ers rounded out the top eight.</p> <p>At the bottom of the rankings, the Arizona Cardinals were rated as the worst team for workplace conditions, followed by the New England Patriots, Cleveland Browns, Jets, and Pittsburgh Steelers.</p> <p>While the league saw overall improvements in working conditions – including the resolution of past issues like dirty shower water, rats, and unstable weight room floors – the Falcons reported a ventilation issue in their locker room that caused “major complaints” about odor.</p> <p>Now in its third year, the NFLPA’s report card survey gathered responses from 1,695 players – 77% of the union’s active and practice squad members. Players awarded their teams 41% more A-minus or better grades than last year, while D-plus ratings fell by 51%.</p> <p>“What initially seemed a shame campaign is really, ‘How do we improve working conditions for our guys?’” NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell said. “It doesn’t mean you have to build a new building, but we’re saying, ‘Be responsible.’ And I’m seeing they are.”</p>
