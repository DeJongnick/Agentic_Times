The San Francisco-based company will pay 180p a share in cash for the London-listed Deliveroo.<br><br>The takeover will create a combined firm with a presence across 40 countries and handling about $90bn of orders each year.</p> <p>At a hearing today, <strong>Sir Alastair Norris</strong> said the takeover was “entirely straightforward” and that he was “happy to sanction” the move.</p> <p>Deliveroo, which was founded in 2013 by <strong>Will Shu</strong> and <strong>Greg Orlowski</strong>, made sales of around £2bn last year.<br><br>DoorDash was also set up in 2013, co-founded by chief executive <strong>Tony Xu</strong>, who has led the company ever since. It operates in more than 30 countries and delivers over 2.5bn orders a year, resulting in revenues of $10.7bn in 2024. It does not operate in the same countries as Deliveroo.</p> <p>Xu said in May that he “could not be more excited” about the merger, while Shu said that the move marked a “transformative new chapter”.</p> <p>In written submissions for the hearing on Tuesday, <strong>Andrew Thornton</strong> KC, for Deliveroo, said the takeover “will not have any adverse impact” on the company’s creditors and was unanimously recommended by its independent directors. He added that the scheme was also approved by Deliveroo’s shareholders at a meeting in June.</p> <p>In court, Thornton said that two shareholders had been identified as being sanctioned by the government over their ties to Russia. The barrister said that the transfer of their shares would be “delayed” until “they cease to be sanctioned”, while the judge stated that their shares would be “excluded from the scheme”.</p> <p>DoorDash is now expected to start a review of the merged group, with a potential reduction of around 1% to 3% of the combined workforce, largely affecting general administrative and business support roles.</p> <p>It said in May that some of Deliveroo’s offices and support functions would also no longer be needed, because it will not be listed after the deal, which would result in a “small number” of job cuts.</p> <p>But it also confirmed it would honour the agreement between Deliveroo’s riders and the GMB trade union, while Deliveroo said that DoorDash does not plan to make major changes to its London headquarters.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Shu announced that he would leave his role as Deliveroo’s chief executive, claiming he wanted to “contemplate his next challenge”.</p> <p>Deliveroo’s non-executive directors, who include <strong>Cafe Rouge</strong> founder <strong>Dame Karen Jones</strong> and <strong>Flutter</strong> boss <strong>Peter Jackson</strong>, are also due to step down following the approval of the takeover.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68dbe0818f0896412d7c0b0a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-30T13:59:28.892Z">2.59pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Goldman Sachs sees lower risks of US recession as economy holds up</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Strategists at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> are fairly relaxed about the US econmy, saying signals that is sliding into recession have yet to emerge as tariff effects peak.</p> <p>Despite a sharp slowdown in the labour market, strategists led by <strong>Kamakshya Trivedi</strong> said the US economy is holding up.</p> <p>They noted that the overall data picture does suggest an imminent risk of recession, with signs of improvement in better-than-expected consumer data and an uptick in the housing sector.

A further 255 employees will remain at the site. </p> <p>“This decision was not taken lightly and follows a thorough review of all aspects of the business, following its insolvency. </p> <p>We understand that this a very difficult time for all those affected by this decision, and the Insolvency Service will fully support employees subject to redundancy via the redundancy payments service.</p> <p>The site remains safe, and the official receiver continues to prioritise health and safety at the site alongside the ongoing process to secure the sale of the refinery.</p> <p>The conduct of the company and its directors, following the liquidation of Prax Oil Refinery, remains the subject of an ongoing Insolvency Service investigation.</p> </blockquote> <p>Unite said the government is responsible for the redundancies going ahead as it could provide support to ensure the refinery is kept operational. There are a further 500 contract jobs and potentially thousands in the supply chain depend on the refinery, it said.</p> <p>The union believes that the insolvency firm FTI’s preferred bidder wishes to mothball the site and use it as a storage terminal for oil tankers. It would be the easiest way to satisfy creditors but would “gut jobs, harm the regional economy and compromise the UK’s ability to produce its own fuel”.</p> <p>Unite general secretary <strong>Sharon Graham</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The government has been tin eared to the plight of workers at the second oil refinery facing closure in less than a year. This makes a mockery of government promises to protect workers and its plan for net zero.</p> <p>The government had promised to ensure that job focused bids would be the priority at Lindsey, yet prior to bids even being considered, they are already issuing redundancy notices.</p> </blockquote> <p>The refinery’s biggest creditor is HMRC, alongside oil company <strong>Glencore</strong>. Both can wait for the more complicated but far less damaging process of maintaining the site as an oil refinery, with government support, Unite said.</p> <p>Without the refinery, which supplied 25% of the UK diesel market, the country is more reliant on imported fuel. This impacts the UK’s energy security and leaves consumers more exposed to price rises at the pump. A substantial amount of diesel is imported from Turkey and India and made from Russian crude.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-30T10:50:01.247Z">at 11.50am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68db90918f08206a90f095f9" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-30T08:33:36.848Z">9.33am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Asos shares slump as it warns on outlook amid 'soft consumer backdrop'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Shares in <strong>Asos</strong> fell more than 11% to a near-six month low, after the British online fashion retailer said full-year revenues will miss forecasts and fall more steeply amid weak consumer spending.</p> <p>The shares fell to 260p in early trading, the lowest since 9 April, making them the biggest loser on the FTSE Smallcap Index, and are now trading 9% down at 267p.</p> <p>The company said revenues for the year to 26 September will come in slightly below market expectations, as it focuses on higher quality sales against a “soft consumer backdrop”.

The OBR will take these revisions into account ahead of the Budget, but they are very unlikely to prevent the downgrade to the OBR’s productivity growth forecasts that will contribute to the Chancellor having to raise some money, most likely via higher taxes.</p> <p>The quarterly rate of GDP growth in Q2 2025 was left unrevised at 0.3% q/q, although the annual growth rate was revised up from 1.2% to 1.4%. And in Q2 itself, the shape of growth was a little more encouraging. Most striking was that the change in business investment was revised from -4.0% q/q to -1.1% q/q. This was offset by smaller contributions to GDP growth from net trade, inventories and the alignment adjustment.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Matt Swannell, </strong>chief economic advisor to the <strong>EY ITEM Club</strong>, points out that growth has been “very sluggish” since Covid-19:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“GDP growth was confirmed to have slowed to 0.3% in Q2, down from 0.7% at the start of the year. Some of the strength at the start of the year was the result of ongoing issues with residual seasonality, but below the surface, the data paints a weaker picture, with Q2 growth heavily reliant on government spending. Consumption was little more than flat on the quarter, while business investment fell 1.1% as some temporary strength from Q1 unwound.</p> <p>Today’s release incorporated additional survey and administrative data, and methodological improvements that caused revisions as far back as 1997. The new data leaves the level of GDP a little higher, but it doesn’t change the broader picture that the UK economy has been very sluggish since the pandemic.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Richard Flax, </strong>chief investment officer at<strong> <a href="https://www.moneyfarm.com/">Moneyfarm</a></strong>, suggests the economy is “navigating headwinds” better than thought:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“The final estimate of UK GDP for Q2 confirmed growth of <strong>0.3% quarter-on-quarter</strong>, in line with expectations, but showed a <strong>stronger-than-anticipated 1.4% increase year-on-year</strong>. This marks an upward revision from the previous estimate of 1.2% YoY, suggesting that the economy performed better over the past year than initially thought.</p> <p>The firmer annual growth points to a more resilient backdrop, supported by sustained strength in services and consumer spending, even as higher interest rates continued to weigh on activity. This resilience suggests that the UK economy is navigating headwinds more effectively than feared.</p> <p>Looking ahead, momentum in the second half of the year remains uncertain. Weak global demand and persistent cost pressures may continue to act as a drag, even as households and businesses begin to benefit from disinflation and a stabilising rate environment. In terms of fiscal policy, a slightly better performance on economic growth may not do much to help the Chancellor as she tries to balance the books ahead of the November budget. We’re still likely to see a range of tax increases in the budget announcement.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-30T07:58:38.926Z">at 8.58am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68db82d98f080edbe266416c" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-30T07:17:47.727Z">8.17am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Gambling company shares drop as Reeves hints at higher taxes</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Shares in gambling companies are dipping at the start of trading, after chancellor Rachel Reeves hinted that they could face higher taxes.</strong></p> <p><strong>Evoke</strong> (which owns 888poker and William Hill) has dropped by 1.5%, with <strong>Rank</strong> <strong>Group</strong> down 1%.</p> <p><strong>Entain</strong> (the firm behind Ladbrokes, Coral and BetMGM) fell 1.7% at the open in London, before recovering.</p> <p>Yesterday, <strong>Reeves</strong> signaled she could be open to raising taxes on the UK’s gambling industry, which could raise funds to fund services or benefits.</p> <p>She told ITV News:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“I do think there’s a case for gambling firms paying more.</p> <p>They make an important contribution to the economy but they should pay their fair share of taxes and we’ll make sure that that happens.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68db7fc18f08206a90f09593" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-30T07:06:07.624Z">8.06am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK GDP per capita stats</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>You get a better picture of a country’s living standards if you look at GDP per capita (the calculation that divides GDP by population).</strong></p> <p>And again, we can see that the picture was less grim than first thought in the first six months of the Labour government (and in the last quarter of the Conservatives, before last July’s election).</p> <p>GDP per capita in July-September 2024 rose by 0.1%, rather than shrinking by 0.1% as first thought.</p> <p>In October-December, GDP per capita also rose by 0.1%, having previously been estimated as 0%.</p> <p>However, GDP per capita in January-March this year has been revised down to 0.5% from 0.6%, even though the estimte for GDP is unchanged.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68db7f168f08206a90f09591" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-30T06:57:49.029Z">7.57am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Estimates for UK business investment in the last quarter have also been revised higher.</strong></p> <p>Business investment is estimated to have fallen by 1.1% in Quarter 2 2025, revised up from the first estimate fall of 4.0%.
