<p>In the last few years we’ve witnessed a dramatic shift away from the progress we need to avert climate disaster. A growing lobby of economic and political denial has been empowered by the Trump administration, which has declared war on climate progress, launching more dramatic anti-green moves in its first 100 days than in his entire first term. Around the world, a growing number of lawsuits are being used against governments over environmental laws and other regulations, while groups such as Greenpeace are being targeted too.</p> <p>On Tuesday 16 September, a Guardian<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events/2025/jun/24/the-rise-of-climate-denialism-with-george-monbiot-and-special-guests"> panel of experts will be looking to answer</a> questions about the forces driving the pushback against a greener world.</p> <p>The live event in London will start with a special welcome address from the <strong>Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner</strong>. We’ll then be joined by the <strong>Guardian columnist George Monbiot</strong>; <strong>Mikaela Loach, the climate justice activist and author</strong>; and <strong>Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the Climate Change Committee</strong> and with other special guests to discuss the factors driving the big green pushback, and answer your questions followed by a special address by <strong>singer and environmentalist Feargal Sharkey</strong>. This panel discussion will also be livestreamed globally.</p> <p>Ahead of the event, we’d like to hear from you. What questions would you like us to put to the panel? </p> <h2>This Community callout closed on 17 September 2025.</h2> <p>• You can contribute to open Community callouts <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong><br></p>
