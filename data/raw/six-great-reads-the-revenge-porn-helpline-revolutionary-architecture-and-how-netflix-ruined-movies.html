To what extent are algorithms and data driving film production – and, if they aren’t, where are all the so-called algorithm movies coming from, asked Phil Hoad. </p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/28/bland-easy-to-follow-for-fans-of-everything-what-has-the-netflix-algorithm-done-to-our-films"><sub>Read more</sub></a></p> <h2>A day with the Revenge Porn Helpline: ‘You can sense the callers’ desperation’</h2>    <p><em>“By midday, Jessica has dealt with five calls from highly distressed young women in their 20s, all close to tears or crying at the start of the conversations.

Asher’s story is one of New Zealand’s most enduring mysteries and has left a deep wound in Piha, but it is not the only one haunting the community. Five others have disappeared in the region over the past three decades. Now a true-crime documentary is asking questions – and ruffling feathers, as Eva Corlett, the Guardian’s New Zealand correspondent, reported. </p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/25/what-connects-six-disappearances-in-a-picturesque-new-zealand-town-everyone-has-a-theory-ntwnfb"><sub>Read more</sub></a></p> <h2>Arundhati Roy on her fugitive childhood: ‘My knees were full of scars and cuts – a sign of my wild, imperfect, fatherless life’</h2>      <p>When war broke out between India and China, the author and her brother were taken by their mother on a chaotic journey from hill station squat to an eccentric household in Kerala.
