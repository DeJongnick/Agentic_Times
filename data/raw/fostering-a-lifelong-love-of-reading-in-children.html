<p>You report that an increasing proportion of young parents say children’s reading is “more a subject to learn than a fun thing to do” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/30/most-parents-dont-enjoy-reading-to-their-children-survey-suggests">Most parents don’t enjoy reading to their children, survey suggests, 30 April</a>). This is hardly surprising, as the early reading strategy required by the Department for Education and Ofsted places an exclusive emphasis on learning phonics rules. Required reading schemes&nbsp;must focus on decoding words at the expense of context, a&nbsp;lively story or anything that looks&nbsp;a bit like fun.</p> <p>Next month, in primary schools, five- and six-year-olds will undertake the statutory “phonics check”, which asks them to decode single words and nonsense words according to the rules they have been taught. Those who do not meet the standard must repeat the test next year. Intensive drills will be&nbsp;the order of the day. No, it is not “a fun thing to do”.</p> <p>It is claimed that standards in early reading are rising. In fact, <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/phonics-screening-check-attainment/2023-24">scores on the phonics check are improving</a> as schools teach to the test, but this is valueless if children do not enjoy reading. The ability to “sound out words” is one skill to support reading, but there are many others, including whole-word recognition, appreciation of sentence structure and use of context. Children become fluent readers by being drawn into the enjoyment of books.</p> <p>The exclusive emphasis on synthetic phonics teaching was ramped up under the Cameron government and became progressively more strictly imposed through the years of Tory government. It is disappointing that the curriculum review set up by Labour under Prof Becky Francis does not recognise the need for change. Her <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67e6b43596745eff958ca022/Curriculum_and_Assessment_Review_interim_report.pdf">interim report</a>, published in March, recommended retaining the phonics check. Children deserve better.<br><strong>Ruth Allen</strong><br><em>Kinoulton, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>• I am delighted that Julia Donaldson is working on another of her wonderful books (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/01/the-guardian-view-on-the-gruffalo-a-well-timed-comeback-wart-and-all">The Guardian view on the Gruffalo: a well-timed comeback, wart and all, 1 May</a>). Her stories are a joy to read aloud and share with children because adults enjoy them too. There is nothing that will encourage young children to read more than sharing excitement and delight in a story with a grownup who clearly enjoys reading. As public libraries close nationwide and school libraries are sidelined, the joy of reading is lost and it simply becomes another subject in the curriculum. </p> <p>This leads to a lack of fluent literacy that affects children’s ability to understand words and to evaluate what they see written in whatever format or media. Story time with teachers and librarians, cuddling up with a parent and a good book, time to read just for fun – these are some of the best things we can give children, so that&nbsp;reading for pleasure becomes&nbsp;a&nbsp;lifelong joy.<br><strong>Carol Elliott</strong><br><em>Morpeth, Northumberland</em></p> <p>• Your article underlines the need for school libraries. The decline in the “happy reading culture” that comes from being read to, and the growing perception of reading as schoolwork, is a challenge. We need to maximise access to reading for pleasure, and offer choice, encouragement and guidance. Every school needs a library, and someone responsible for curating and promoting a diverse and current collection, relevant to children’s lives. This is particularly important where home circumstances limit opportunities.</p> <p>We owe it to children to be relentlessly positive about books and reading, and to press those in power for a library in every school.<br><strong>Henrietta Englefield</strong> <br><em>London</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
