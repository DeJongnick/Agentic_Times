<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is reviewing the records of more than 55 million US visa holders for potential revocation or deportable violations of immigration rules, in a significant expansion of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s immigration crackdown.</p> <p>The state department said that all of the foreigners who now hold valid US visas are subject to “continuous vetting” for any indication that they could be ineligible for the document, including those already admitted into the country. Should such evidence come to light, the visa would be revoked and, if the visa holder were in the United States, they would be subject to deportation.</p> <p>Here are the key stories at a glance.</p>  <h2>Trump administration to review 55m US visa holders for potential rule violations</h2>  <p>Trump officials will review records of more than 55 million US visa holders in the latest expansion on the US president’s immigration crackdown. </p> <p>It follows an announcement by the Trump administration on Tuesday that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/19/immigration-social-media">it will look for “anti-American” views</a>, including on social media, when assessing the applications of people wanting to live in the United States.</p> <p>“The state department revokes visas any time there are indications of a potential ineligibility, which includes things like any indicators of overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organization,” a department spokesperson said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/trump-administration-visa-vetting"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Court throws out $500m civil fraud penalty against Donald Trump</h2>  <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> appeals court has thrown out the massive civil fraud penalty against <a href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>, ruling on Thursday in the state’s lawsuit accusing him of exaggerating his wealth.</p> <p>The decision, which was not unanimous, came seven months after the Republican returned to the White House.
