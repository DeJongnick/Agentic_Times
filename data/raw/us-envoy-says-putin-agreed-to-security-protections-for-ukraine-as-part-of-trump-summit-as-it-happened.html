 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Here’s a wrap-up of the day’s key events:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has released a series of statements on X after his meeting with European leaders ahead of Monday’s peace talks with Donald Trump in the US. </strong>In his statements, Zelenskyy said: “Ukraine’s constitution makes it impossible to give up or trade land. Since the territorial issue is so important, it should be discussed only by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at the trilateral—Ukraine, the U.S., Russia. So far, Russia gives no sign this will happen, and if Russia refuses, new sanctions must follow.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ahead of Monday’s peace talks in the US, French president Emmanuel Macron said that in order to have a “lasting peace deal for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, Ukraine needs a strong army”. </strong>He added that European allies want “Ukraine’s territorial integrity to be respected” and that “Ukraine must be represented in any talks on Ukraine’s future.” Macron also said that “our goal for tomorrow’s talks is to present a united front between Ukraine and its European allies”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European Union council president Antonio Costa added that he “welcomed the United States’ willingness to participate in providing security guarantees to Ukraine”. </strong>Costa said: “Transatlantic unity is paramount at this moment to achieve a sustainable peace in Ukraine.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has published a letter Melania Trump addressed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> during his visit to Alaska on Friday. </strong>In the letter, the first lady urges the Russian president to “restore the melodic laughter” of children, saying: “In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone – you serve humanity itself. Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Steve Witkoff added that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> had agreed to unspecified concessions on five Ukrainian regions central to the war, particularly the eastern Donetsk province.</strong> “We agreed to robust security guarantees that I would describe as gamechanging,” Witkoff said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European leaders who are set to join Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a show of solidarity at the White House on Monday include:</strong> German chancellor Friedrich Merz, British prime minister Keir Starmer, French president Emmanuel Macron, Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, Finland’s president Alexander Stubb, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Asked behind the scenes at June’s G7 summit if he could explain why <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> seemed to like him so much, Keir Starmer admitted he did not really know. Whatever the reason, when it comes to Ukraine, the UK prime minister is once again hoping to exploit this somewhat curious relationship.</strong></p> 
  <p>As soon as it was announced that a string of European leaders planned to join Volodymyr Zelenskyy to back the Ukrainian president in crucial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/european-leaders-to-join-zelenskyy-washington-meeting-trump-ukraine-russia">talks with Trump at the White House</a> on Monday, it was obvious Starmer would be joining them.</p> 
  <p>The idea of Britain being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/16/uk-hopes-bridge-europe-trump-us-minister-says">some sort of bridge</a> between US and European interests is something of a longstanding UK diplomatic cliche, and not one that always necessarily carries much meaning.</p> 
  <p>But in the case of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, Starmer has very deliberately sought to position himself as a leader who can get along with Trump while consistently stressing to him Europe’s red lines over any peace plan, and trying to sweet talk the president into offering US security guarantees.</p>

  <p><strong>In a combative series of interviews on Sunday, the US secretary of state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, said that “both sides are going to have to make concessions” for there to be a peaceful resolution to the war that erupted when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.</strong></p> 
  <p>“You can’t have a peace agreement unless both sides make concessions – that’s a fact,” the Trump administration’s top diplomat said Sunday on ABC’s This Week. “That’s true in virtually any negotiation. If not, it’s just called surrender. And neither side is going to surrender. So both sides are going to have to make concessions.”</p> 
  <p>Rubio said the recent talks in Alaska between Russian president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> and his US counterpart <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> toward ending the war had “made progress in the sense that we identified potential areas of agreement – but there remains some big areas of disagreement”.</p> 
  <p>“We’re still a long ways off,” Rubio added. “We’re not at the precipice of a peace agreement. We’re not at the edge of one. But I do think progress was made and towards one.”</p>

  <p><strong>Reporters from Associated Press have done a little round up of the reactions of Republican and Democrat senators to Donald Trump’s meeting with Vladimir Putin.</strong></p> 
  <p>Among the Republicans:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Senator <strong>Lisa Murkowski</strong>, an Alaska Republican, wrote on social media after the summit that “while the press conference offered few details about their meeting,” she was “cautiously optimistic about the signals that some level of progress was made.” She said it “was also encouraging to hear both presidents reference future meetings” but that <strong>Ukraine</strong> “must be part of any negotiated settlement and must freely agree to its terms.”</p></li> 
   <li><p>Senator <strong>Lindsey Graham</strong>, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally, said he was “very proud” of the president for having the face-to-face meeting and was “cautiously optimistic” that the war might end “well before Christmas” if a trilateral meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy and Putin transpires.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Former vice-president <strong>Mike Pence</strong> commended his former boss for seeking peace. “I think he deserves credit as leader of the free world for not giving up on <strong>Ukraine</strong>,” he said on CNN’s State of the Union.<br></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>However, Democrat senators have been expressed alarm:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>“President Trump appears to have been played yet again by Vladimir Putin,” said Democratic senator <strong>Jeanne Shaheen</strong> of New Hampshire, ranking member of the Senate foreign relations committee. “The president rolled out a red carpet and warmly greeted a murderous dictator on American soil and reports indicate he got nothing concrete in return.” She added: “If President Trump won’t act, Congress must do so decisively by passing crushing sanctions when we return in the coming weeks.”</p></li> 
   <li><p>Connecticut senator <strong>Chris Murphy</strong> said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Putin “got everything he wanted”, including a photo op with Trump. “He is intentionally murdering civilians, he’s kidnapping children, and now he got to stand next to the President of the United States — legitimized in the view of the world,” the Democrat said.<br></p></li>

  <p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy faces a daunting trip to the White House – but this time he won’t be alone.</strong></p> 
  <p>The Guardian’s Julian Borger writes:</p> 
  <p><em>Volodymyr Zelenskyy will make his second visit to the White House on Monday with the daunting task of reversing the damage done to Ukraine’s security prospects by Friday’s Trump-Putin summit in Alaska.</em></p> 
  <p><em>Zelenskyy will not, however, be alone as he was on his first trip to the White House in February when he was ambushed and humiliated by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and the vice-president, JD Vance, who sought to bully him into capitulation to Moscow’s demands.</em></p> 
  <p><em>This time the Ukrainian leader comes to Washington <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/17/european-leaders-to-join-zelenskyy-washington-meeting-trump-ukraine-russia">flanked by a dream team of European leaders</a>, including Britain’s Keir Starmer, Germany’s Friedrich Merz and France’s Emmanuel Macron, who combine economic and military clout with proven rapport with Trump.</em></p> 
  <p><em>Their mission will be to try to use their individual and combined influence to coax the president out of the pro-Russian positions he adopted after just a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/love-in-a-cold-climate-putin-romances-trump-in-alaska-with-talk-of-rigged-elections-and-a-trip-to-moscow">couple of hours under Putin’s sway</a> in the sub-Arctic on Friday.</em></p> 
  <p><em>To do that, they will have to project a more convincing sense of resolve and common purpose than they have managed hitherto, argued Ben Rhodes, a former adviser to Barack Obama.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has released a series of statements on X </strong><strong> after his meeting with European leaders ahead of Monday’s peace talks with Donald Trump in the US.</strong></p> 
  <p>In his statements, Zelenskyy said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We have to stop the killings. Putin has many demands but we do not know all of them. If there are really as many as we heard, then it will take time to go through them all. It is impossible to do this under the pressure of weapons …</em></p> 
   <p><em>We need real negotiations, which means they can start where the front line is now. The contact line is the best line for talking. Europeans support this, and we thank everyone. Russia is still unsuccessful in the Donetsk region, Putin has been unable to take it for 12 years …</em></p> 
   <p><em>Ukraine’s Constitution makes it impossible to give up or trade land. Since the territorial issue is so important, it should be discussed only by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at the trilateral—Ukraine, the U.S., Russia. So far, Russia gives no sign this will happen, and if Russia refuses, new sanctions must follow.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It’s important that America agrees to work with Europe to provide security guarantees for Ukraine, and therefore for all of Europe. This is a significant change, but there are no details how it will work—what America’s role will be, what Europe’s role will be, what the EU can do. We need security to work in practice, like Article 5 of NATO.”</em></p>

  <p>The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh and Artem Mazhulin report: </p> 
  <p><em>The hardening of the mood comes at the end of a weekend where there was first ridicule and disgust in Ukraine at the red carpet treatment of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> by Donald Trump at their summit in Alaska – followed by frustration as it appeared that Trump was siding with the Russian leader.</em></p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“Dear President Putin,</p> 
   <p>Every child shares the same quiet dreams in their heart, whether born randomly into a nation’s rustic countryside or a magnificent city-center. They dream of love, possibility, and safety from danger.</p> 
   <p>As parents, it is our duty to nurture the next generation’s hope. As leaders, the responsibility to sustain our children extends beyond the comfort of a few.</p> 
   <p>Undeniably, we must strive to paint a dignity-filled world for all - so that every soul may wake to peace, and so that the future itself is perfectly guarded.</p> 
   <p>A simple yet profound concept, Mr. Putin, as I am sure you agree, is that each generation’s descendants begin their lives with a purity - an innocence which stands above geography, government, and ideology.</p> 
   <p>Yet in today’s world, some children are forced to carry a quiet laughter, untouched by the darkness around them — a silent defiance against the forces that can potentially claim their future. Mr. Putin, you can singlehandedly restore their melodic laughter.</p> 
   <p>In protecting the innocence of these children, you will do more than serve Russia alone — you serve humanity itself. Such a bold idea transcends all human division, and you, Mr. Putin, are fit to implement this vision with a stroke of the pen today.</p> 
   <p>It is time.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Steve Witkoff</strong> added that Russia had agreed to unspecified concessions on five Ukrainian regions central to the war, particularly the eastern Donetsk province.</p> 
  <p>“We agreed to robust security guarantees that I would describe as gamechanging,” Witkoff said.</p> 
  <p>He told CNN:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The Russians made some concessions at the table with regard to all five of those regions. There is an important discussion with regard to Donetsk and what would happen there. And that discussion is going to specifically be detailed on Monday.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>As a reminder, Vladimir Putin has reportedly demanded Ukraine withdraw from the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as a condition for ending the war and in exchange would freeze the frontline in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">US envoy says Putin agreed to security protections for Ukraine as part of Trump summit</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Special US envoy <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong> has also been speaking to the media. He said on Sunday that Vladimir Putin agreed at the Alaska summit with Donald Trump to allow the US and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling Nato’s collective defence mandate (article 5: an attack on one member is an attack on all) as part of an eventual deal to end the war.</p> 
  <p>Speaking with Jake Tapper, Witkoff told CNN’s State of the Union programme:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We got to an agreement that the United States and other European nations could effectively offer article five like language to cover a security guarantee. So Putin has said that a red flag is Nato admission.</em></p> 
   <p><em>And so what we were discussing was assuming that that held, assuming that the Ukrainians could agree to that, and could live with that, and everything is going to be about what the Ukrainians can live with.</em></p> 
   <p><em>But assuming they could, we were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer article five, like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato, we sort of were able to bypass that and get an agreement that the United States could offer article five protection, which was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that.</em></p>

  <p>“If peace is not going to be possible here and this is just going to continue on as a war, people will continue to die by the thousands … we may unfortunately wind up there, but we don’t want to wind up there,” Rubio said.</p> 
  <p>“There are things that were discussed as part of this meeting that are potentials for breakthroughs, that are potential for progress,” he said, adding that topics for discussion would include security guarantees for Ukraine. </p>

  <p>Von der Leyon responds first by saying what is most important is to “stop the killing”, rather than the term that is used (whether it as a “ceasefire” or a “peace deal”).</p> 
  <p>She says it’s important to have a “trilateral meeting” between Ukraine, Russia and the US, adding that it is “very important” for “clear timelines to be kept”. Zelenskyy says he totally agrees with von der Leyen, adding that Kyiv needs the US on its side to guarantee a lasting peace.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>These are the main highlights from what Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>It is important for Europe to remain as “united” as it was in February 2022 when Moscow launched its full-scale invasion, in order to “stop the killings”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>It is necessary to agree a ceasefire before working quickly on a “final deal”, something that will be discussed with Donald Trump in Washington tomorrow.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Ukraine’s constitution makes it impossible to give up territory or to trade land.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The “territorial issue” should only be discussed between the Ukraine and Russia (with the US as a mediator).</p></li> 
   <li><p>Zelenskyy says that “Putin has many demands but we do not know all of them”. He says it will take time to go through them, but that it is “impossible to do this under that pressure of weapons”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Russia’s “strategic direction” is “anti-European” so we have to limit Russia’s “potential”, Zelesnkyy said.</p></li> 
   <li><p>There can be no division between Moldova and Ukraine.</p></li>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, the European Commission president, began speaking first. Here are the main takeaways of what she said:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>The EU will support Ukraine for a “just” and “lasting” peace for as long as it takes.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Ukraine is a sovereign country and it must be able to uphold its territorial integrity.</p></li> 
   <li><p>There cannot be any limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Ukraine must be a “steel porcupine” indigestible to ‘“potential invaders”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The EU has been working hard to scale up and increase Europe’s defence capability, and Ukraine’s industrial defence base (particularly around drones).</p></li> 
   <li><p>The EU continues to support Ukraine’s path to its membership to the EU, which in itself is a type of security guarantee.</p></li> 
   <li><p>She hails Donald Trump’s willingness to offer Ukraine Nato-style security guarantees and says that borders cannot be changed by force. “These are decisions to be made by Ukraine and Ukraine alone,” von der Leyen said. “These decisions must not be taken without Ukraine in the table.”</p></li> 
   <li><p>As long as the bloodshed in Ukraine continues, the EU will continue with economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Russia (the bloc’s 19th economic sanctions package is being prepared).</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">European leaders to join Zelenskyy at White House meeting, von der Leyen says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>European Commission President <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> has just confirmed <a href="https://x.com/vonderleyen/status/1957015978383999422">in a post on X </a>that she will be meeting Donald Trump along with other European leaders in the White House on Monday at the request of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p> 
  <p>She also said that she will welcome Zelenskyy in Brussels later today and together will participate in a meeting of European leaders part of the “coalition of the willing”.</p> 
  <p>French President <strong>Emmanuel Macron, </strong>German chancellor <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong>, Finnish President <strong>Alexander Stubb </strong>and Nato secretary general Mark Rutte will also go to Washington DC with Zelesnkyy tomorrow.</p> 
  <p>The coalition of the willing, set up by the UK and France as the Trump administration threatened to withdraw security support for Europe, is made up of more than 30 countries working together to support Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Its aim is to provide security guarantees to Ukraine in the event of a deal being reached between Kyiv and Moscow, with several countries, including France and the UK, having pledged to send troops on the ground to enforce a potential agreement.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Who might accompany Zelenskyy on his Washington trip?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>European officials will decide this weekend whether Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be accompanied on the visit to Washington tomorrow.</p> 
  <p>They are keen to avoid the chaotic scenes played out in front of the world’s press in the White House in February, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war">Donald Trump got into a shouting match with the Ukrainian leader</a>, telling him to make a deal with Russia “or we’re out” and warning that Zelenskyy was “gambling with world war three”.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy left the White House early after Trump gave him a dressing-down that followed an ambush led by vice-president JD Vance, a skeptic of US support for Ukraine.</p>

  <p>Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/16/trump-putin-meeting-europe-fallout-00512724">is reporting</a> that, in order to prevent another potential flare up and to try to ensure greater European involvement in negotiations, Finnish President <strong>Alexander Stubb</strong> – and possibly Nato secretary general <strong>Mark Rutte</strong> – may accompany Zelenskyy for his Washington trip tomorrow.</p> 
  <p>European Commission President <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> may also join, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-17/von-der-leyen-rutte-and-stubb-may-join-trump-zelenskiy-meeting?embedded-checkout=true">according to Bloomberg</a>, but these plans are not finalised. All three senior European figures have a seemingly good relationship with the US president.</p>

  <p>There was no immediate comment from Russia, which controls a little over 200 sq km in the region, according to Ukraine’s battlefield mapping project DeepState.</p>

  <p>US President Donald Trump said after Friday’s meeting with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, that he wants to bypass a ceasefire and move straight to a permanent peace deal.</p> 
  <p>This is a major shift in policy. Before the summit, Trump demanded Putin agree to an immediate ceasefire or face heavy US sanctions on oil exports.</p> 
  <p>Ukrainian and European leaders fear that a straight-to-peace deal, skipping over a preliminary ceasefire, gives Moscow an upper hand in talks.</p> 
  <p>After calls with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, Trump wrote on social media on Saturday that “it was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.”</p> 
  <p>With <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/whats-at-stake-at-the-trump-putin-ukraine-peace-summit">Russia and Ukraine far apart in their demands</a>, it is not clear how easily that could be achieved.</p> 
  <p>We are likely to be issued with a joint statement from the leaders of the “coalition of the willing” on the call later – it is not clear if they will use the word ceasefire or adopt more vague language to align themselves more with the new American position.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump reportedly to back ceding of Ukrainian territory to Russia as part of peace deal</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Here is some more detail from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/ukraine-russia-peace-deal-donbas-region">the report</a> from my colleagues <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/edwardhelmore">Edward Helmore</a> and<em><strong> </strong></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pjotr-sauer">Pjotr Sauer</a> about Trump backing a plan to cede unoccupied Ukrainian territory to Russia to secure an end to the war, with Putin demanding Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk as a condition for peace:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Although Luhansk is almost entirely under Russian control, Ukraine still holds key parts of Donetsk, including the cities of <strong>Kramatorsk</strong> and <strong>Sloviansk</strong> and heavily fortified positions whose defence has cost tens of thousands of lives.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Putin told Trump that in exchange for <strong>Donetsk</strong> and <strong>Luhansk</strong>, he would halt further advances and freeze the frontline in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where Russian forces occupy significant areas.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Trump’s support for ceding Ukraine’s <strong>Donbas</strong> region (composed of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions), which is rich in mineral resources, including coal and iron ore, to Russia comes as he voiced support for moving straight to a peace deal and not via a ceasefire, which, Trump said <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115037569702889410">in a social media post</a> on Saturday, “often times do not hold up.”</em></p> 
   <p><em>US support for ceding the Donbas to Russia represents a breach with Ukraine and European allies that oppose such a deal.</em></p> 
   <p><em>As part of a deal, the US is ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine, the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said on Saturday. Trump has threatened economic penalties on countries that buy Russian oil if Moscow refuses a deal and flew US bombers over the Russian leader as he arrived in Alaska.</em></p> 
   <p><em>But Ukrainian and European leaders fear that a straight-to-peace deal, skipping over a preliminary ceasefire, gives Moscow an upper hand in talks.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">European leaders from 'coalition of the willing' to hold conference call ahead of Zelenskyy's talks with Trump</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p> 
  <p>While Washington prepares to welcome <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> for crunch talks with Donald Trump on Monday, European leaders who make up the so-called “coalition of the willing”, a loose partnership of western countries pledging support for Ukraine, are set to hold a conference call on Sunday to try to protect a peace deal that does not reward Russia for its aggression.</p> 
  <p>The virtual call is being co-chaired by the UK’s prime minister <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>, French President <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> and the German chancellor, <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong>.</p> 
  <p>At the Alaska summit on Friday, Russian President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> demanded Ukraine withdraw from <strong>Donetsk</strong> and <strong>Luhansk</strong> as a condition for ending the war, but offered Trump a freeze along the remaining frontline, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/16/ukraine-russia-peace-deal-donbas-region">told the Guardian</a>. </p> 
  <p>Trump reportedly backed the plan to cede unoccupied Ukrainian territory to Russia to secure an end to the war, telling European leaders that he believed a peace deal could be negotiated if Zelenskyy agreed to give up the Donbas region (which is composed of Donetsk and Luhansk). </p> 
  <p>European leaders have repeatedly said that Zelenskyy, who has been sidelined in much of the US-Russian diplomacy to date, must play a greater role in future talks as a lasting peace cannot be achieved without his input.</p> 
  <p>In a statement released on Saturday after the Alaska talks between Trump and Putin ended without any breakthrough, <a href="https://x.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1956692156099244329">Starmer said in a statement posted to X</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>President Trump’s efforts have brought us closer than ever before to ending Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. His leadership in pursuit of an end to the killing should be commended.</em></p> 
   <p><em>While progress has been made, the next steps must be further talks involving President Zelenskyy. The path to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without him.</em></p>
