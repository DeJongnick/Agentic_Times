Though Wilson pleaded guilty to joining Rhodes’ seditious conspiracy, he cooperated with the government and provided information about Rhodes’ alleged efforts to contact the Trump White House on the evening of Jan 6, 2021.</p> <p>Mehta is preparing to hand down a series of sentences to Rhodes’ convicted co-conspirators over the next few days, including several who later cooperated with the government.

If members of Congress heed their words, it will greatly increase the likelihood of the federal government shutting down at midnight on Friday, and spark a political crisis right as the Capitol is emptying out for the holidays.</p> <p>Trump has named Musk and Ramaswamy as co-chairs of the “Department of Government Efficiency”, a quasi-governmental organ that is expected to recommend ways to downsize the federal government. <a href="https://x.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1869407887983821089">Writing on X</a>, Ramaswamy criticized the funding bill as excessive:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I wanted to read the full 1,500+ page bill &amp; speak with key leaders before forming an opinion.

Here’s more on that, from the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/callum-jones">Callum Jones</a>:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> cuts<strong> </strong>interest rates on Wednesday amid questions over its fight to bring down inflation across the world’s largest economy.</p> <p>Policymakers at the central bank lowered the benchmark federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a range of between 4.25% and 4.5% in its last rate decision before Donald Trump assumes the presidency in January.</p> <p>The central bank also suggested that it would make fewer rate cuts than expected in 2025.</p> <p>While inflation has fallen dramatically since peaking at its highest rate in a generation two summers ago, it remains higher than the Fed would like – and has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/11/november-inflation-interest-rates">increased in recent months</a>.</p> <p>The wider US economy remains robust, with employers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/06/us-jobs-report-november">adding an estimated 227,000 jobs</a> in November. But the stickiness of price growth has raised concern over the progress of efforts to bring it down to normal, pre-pandemic levels.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the Fed chair, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/jerome-powell">Jerome Powell</a>, is optimistic that things are ticking along nicely. “I feel very good about where the economy is and where monetary policy is,” he said earlier this month.</p> <p>Americans’ frustration over a surge in prices in recent years has been cited as a key factor behind the election victory of Donald Trump, who repeatedly pledged on the campaign trail to bring them down.</p> <p>But even the president-elect has since conceded that this pledge – which drew skepticism from many economists – will be no mean feat.</p> <p>Asked by Time magazine if his presidency would be a failure if prices do not fall, Trump <a href="https://time.com/7201565/person-of-the-year-2024-donald-trump-transcript/">replied</a>: “I don’t think so.

Based on the evidence obtained by this Subcommittee, Hutchinson committed perjury when she lied under oath to the Select Committee.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6762cea68f081f8d963d5095" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-12-18T14:09:37.071Z">2.09pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump warns Liz Cheney 'could be in a lot of trouble' after House GOP says FBI should investigate former congresswoman</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Good morning, US politics blog readers. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> stayed up late (or woke up early?) to threaten <strong>Liz Cheney</strong>, the Republican former congresswoman who lost her seat two years ago after breaking with the president-elect. In <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113672813493636573">a post</a> written shortly after three in the morning, Trump said that Cheney “could be in a lot of trouble” over the findings of a Republican controlled House subcommittee that investigated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/23/the-17-findings-in-the-january-6-committees-final-report">the now-concluded bipartisan panel</a> that held public hearings into the insurrection two years ago. The Republican subcommittee’s report accuses Cheney of witness tampering, saying, “numerous federal laws were likely broken by” the former congresswoman, and “these violations should be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.” Those aren’t just empty words, considering Trump has nominated loyalist <strong>Kash Patel</strong> to lead the FBI, and, based on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/13/fbi-kash-patel-senate-support">what Republican senators have said</a> publicly so far, he may get confirmed.</p> <p>Here’s what else is happening today:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Congress</strong>, and particularly House Republicans, are scrambling to pass a short-term government funding bill to ward off a shutdown that will otherwise begin Friday. As usual, many lawmakers do not like the compromises struck in the draft legislation released by Republican House speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong>, and will no doubt pipe up about it throughout today.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The New York Times</strong>, which has had a fraught relationship with <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/17/us/politics/biden-final-days-in-office.html">has published</a> a comprehensive look at what the president has been up to since Trump won re-election. You will learn that he appears older than ever, and even less willing than usual to entertain reporters.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Biden</strong> has nothing public on his scheduled today, but is in Delaware to mark the anniversary of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/18/joe-biden-anniversary-car-crash-first-wife-daughter">the car crash</a> that killed his first wife and daughter.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div>
