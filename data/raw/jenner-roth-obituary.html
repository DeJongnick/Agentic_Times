<p>In 1975, Jenner Roth, who has died aged 84 of heart failure, founded the Spectrum Centre for Humanistic and Integrative Psychotherapy, in Finsbury Park, north London, with Terry Cooper, her husband from 1978. They co-directed the centre for half a century, for much of which it was the largest training centre of its kind in the UK. In 2021 they scaled it down, continuing their work at <a href="https://spectrumstudiohighgate.co.uk/">Spectrum Studio Highgate</a>. </p> <p>The <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/about-therapy/types-of-therapy/humanistic-therapy/">humanistic approach to psychotherapy</a> addresses issues such as depression, anxiety, addiction or trauma, and life events such as childbirth, relationship difficulties, loss and bereavement. It does so not by diagnosis or pathologising, but by increasing self-awareness through dialogue with a therapist, and learning how to shape one’s own experience, and to outgrow and transcend one’s difficulties. </p> <p>The range of approaches that Jenner’s work encompassed grew out of more traditional forms of psychoanalysis and behaviour therapy, and as a reaction to their limitations, from the 1960s onwards. Its emphasis lay on healthy personal development rather than trying to fix emotional pathology, with the client being an active participant in a collaborative process. It recognised the importance of the body in psychological processes and the primacy of lived experience over theory. This was a huge shift in the culture of psychotherapy – from a medical model to a personal growth model.</p> <p>Jenner and Terry added to the toolbox of methods available to therapists in the UK, through the techniques of <a href="https://gestaltcentre.org.uk/what-is-gestalt/">gestalt therapy</a> – focusing on the moment; <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/about-therapy/types-of-therapy/person-centred-counselling/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=8787735359&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADfU3czf3YkzGti3LVhJpWR8sp6yb&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5JXFBhCrARIsAL1ckPsPMDWYrMsoLa6XmK8B9H180PFQubaMTA8RzmEhoxdiq5K1ePdWapMaAhqMEALw_wcB">person-centred therapy</a> – emphasising self-discovery; <a href="https://www.harvardtherapy.co.uk/person-centred-encounter-groups/">encounter therapy</a> – learning through interactions in a safe group setting; <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/transactional-analysis-eric-berne.html">transactional analysis</a> – investigating patterns of communication; and <a href="https://www.stanleykeleman.com/">formative psychology</a> – exploring growth, resilience and transformation. They integrated these techniques and much else into everyday practice. </p> <p>They created entirely new and original therapeutic programmes, for example their sexuality programmes, anger workshops and programmes for survivors of childhood sexual abuse. They introduced from the US the innovative Pairs (Practical Application of Intimate Relationship Skills), which supported couples in improving their communication skills.</p> <p>Over the course of 38 years from 1986, Jenner and Terry were responsible for training hundreds of psychotherapists and counsellors, many of whom went on to set up their own individual practices, as well as eight new therapy centres around the UK. Through their therapeutic work and the many courses they ran, they substantially influenced the practice of counselling and coaching, and even the practice of CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy, favoured by the NHS), psychoanalysis and Jungian therapy. Much of their teaching also filtered into non-clinical disciplines such as social work, education, business, management and the arts. </p>    <p>The attitudes of mutual respect, positivity, collaboration; the orientation towards growth and development; and certain techniques – including role-play – found a place in many different settings. Jenner herself ran personal growth workshops for large companies and banks, and others followed her lead. Much life-coaching grew out of humanistic therapy.</p> <p>In 1986 she and Terry created the charitable Spectrum Incest Intervention Project (SIIP) to work at low cost with survivors of sexual abuse, as well as some perpetrators referred by the courts and the police. Ten years later she ran an independent research project into the work of the SIIP. The research was requested by the Standing Committee on Sexually Abused Children (SCOSAC) to assess the effectiveness of time-limited therapy for women survivors of childhood sexual abuse. The success of the project was demonstrated by the responses of the clients themselves, and this was seen to validate the humanistic approach.</p> <p>While Terry pioneered men’s groups in the late 70s, Jenner did the same for women, culminating in a programme called Women in the World in 1985, which ran until shortly before she died. A powerful feminist, Jenner was also deeply supportive of men and their own vulnerabilities. Some of her many workshops were residential, taking place over a number of days, usually outside London.</p> <p>Jenner was warm, compassionate, endlessly creative in her work and committed to liberal progressive values. She never shrank from challenging when this was appropriate, whether with clients, colleagues, trainees or friends.</p> <p>Born and raised in St Paul, Minnesota, Jenner was the second daughter of Kathryn (nee Carson) and Gordon Roth, a farming consultant for the government. She grew up surrounded by books and went to University of Minnesota high school. Inspired by her father’s work with Russian farming collectives, she pursued Russian Studies at the university for two years, but rather than taking a degree, moved to New York and worked for Time magazine around 1960-61.<strong> </strong></p> <p>She then moved to Paris, where she studied psychoanalysis and went through her own analysis. This led next to her working in management consultancy, which took her to Amsterdam, where she soon engaged with the explosion of discovery within the so-called Human Potential movement. This brought together different strands of humanistic psychology, all embracing the idea that humans have a vast, untapped potential for growth, creativity and wellbeing. Jenner learned from several of its leading figures, in particular Stanley Keleman (a pioneer in formative psychology) and Marty Fromm (gestalt therapy), both from the US. </p> <p>This marked her transition to humanistic psychotherapy, and she rose quickly to become director of a thriving hub in Amsterdam called Center. It was there in 1974 that she began developing the sexuality programme that became so influential later on.</p> <p>She met Terry for the first time in Southampton in 1973 at a conference of the Group Relations Training Association, and they were soon running groups together. They became a couple, founded Spectrum and had a son, Jodie, who went on to become a sculptor in metal in Denver, Colorado.</p> <p>Keleman and Fromm continued to be mentors, as did the British group and family therapist Robin Skynner. Jenner and Terry were recognised as practitioners of formative psychology by the International Formative Psychology Institute.</p> <p>When the United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) was established in 1993 to promote and maintain professional standards, Spectrum became a member, and the training programmes became UKCP-accredited. Graduate therapists and counsellors were then able to register with the UKCP. Many also registered with the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP). Spectrum’s training programmes were wound down in 2024.</p> <p>Beset but undeterred by increasing ill-health in the last two years of her life, Jenner continued to work as much as she could, endlessly supportive of her clients, and questioning and curious about everything and everyone. She enjoyed a wide range of interests outside work and read avidly. </p> <p>Jenner’s elder sister, Rodris, died in 2000. She is survived by Terry, Jodie and her younger sister, Quilla. </p> <p><em>• </em>Jenner Carson Roth, psychotherapist, born 29 July 1940; died 31 May 2025</p> <p>• This article was amended on 2 September 2025.
