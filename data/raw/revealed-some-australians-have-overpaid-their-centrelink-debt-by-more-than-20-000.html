They said they would be in touch with everyone affected to refund the overpayments.</p> <p>“There’s nothing people need to do right now. From late October 2025, we’re contacting impacted people,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>Allingham said the government needs to “take responsibility” for the overpayment, and not blame welfare recipients.</p> <p>“This is the government’s administrative error,” Allingham said.</p> <p>“And so what we want to see is that they’re taking a really proactive approach in terms of fixing that error, and that the onus is not on the social security recipient or the person that has been repaying the debt to do all the work to recover that money.”</p> <p>The acting chief executive of the Australian Council of Social Services, Edwina MacDonald, said this was “the latest of several breaches of the Social Security Act” by successive governments.</p> <p>“We are deeply concerned about the number of systemic failures in implementing social security law,” MacDonald said. “People have had their payments unlawfully cancelled; people have paid too much in debts, and people’s entitlements have been incorrectly calculated.”</p> <p>She called on the government to improve the system so it did not “entrench poverty” and subject people to “harmful compliance”.</p> <p>“If governments are to learn anything from robodebt, it must be to treat people with respect and dignity, which means lifting social security payments so they cover basic costs and redesigning our social security system so it is fair and humane.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
