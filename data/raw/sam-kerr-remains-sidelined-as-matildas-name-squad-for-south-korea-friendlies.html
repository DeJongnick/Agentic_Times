<p>The upcoming international friendlies against South Korea have come too soon for the rehabilitating Sam Kerr, with the Matildas captain still not yet ready to return to action as she continues to recover from knee surgery.</p> <p>Kerr appeared poised to make a return to Tom Sermanni’s squad for the games in Sydney and Newcastle after her club Chelsea <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/14/sam-kerr-injury-recovery-named-in-chelsea-squad-champions-league">added her to their squad</a> for last week’s Women’s Champions League quarter-final against Manchester City.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/18/matildas-sam-kerr-injury-return">Matildas ‘can’t wait’ to see Sam Kerr back on pitch following court case and injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Kerr did not feature in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/19/champions-league-quarter-final-manchester-city-chelsea-match-report">the Blues’ 2-0 defeat</a>, nor did she play in a Women’s Super League fixture (also against City) on the weekend – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/23/manchester-city-chelsea-womens-super-league-match-report">won by 2-1 by Chelsea</a>. On Monday the 31-year-old was again absent from Sermanni’s latest 23-player list for the two-game series with their Asian rivals in early April.</p> <p>“Sam’s still making a comeback from her her knee operation a year and a bit ago,” Sermanni said. “She’s not been fully cleared yet by Chelsea. She’s on the mend and she’s not too far off, so her first priority is to get her on the field with Chelsea and then hopefully she’ll be available for selection for the Matildas.”</p> <p>Kerr has not played a competitive match since rupturing her anterior cruciate ligament in January last year and her continued absence means she is unlikely to feature in a Matildas shirt for another few months.</p> <p>Further friendlies are yet to be announced by Football Australia after the mini-series against Korea, with less than a year to go before the Women’s Asian Cup is hosted on home soil.</p> <p>In Kerr’s continued absence, veteran Michelle Heyman retains her place in the squad, with other attacking options offered in the form of Caitlin Foord, Mary Fowler and Holly McNamara, who has scored eight times in her last five appearances for Melbourne City.</p> <p>Midfielder Clare Wheeler makes a return to the squad after missing the last two international windows, while young defenders Courtney Nevin and Jamilla Rankin have earned recalls off the back of their recent club form.</p> <p>The Matildas have struggled of late and left the USA in February without a single point after an underwhelming SheBelieves Cup campaign. They have lost eight of their past 13 matches but, as tournament hosts, have qualified automatically for the Asian Cup.</p> <p>“The key thing for us is to get the confidence back in the team and get a bit of the swagger back,” Sermanni said. “The Matildas have got a style of play and we need to get back to that style of play. And that’s a really positive approach to the game, going out there to really put the opposition under the pressure, and to start the game in the front foot.”</p> <p>Sermanni said his latest selections were made to address a number of problems highlighted in recent fixtures.</p> <p>“This squad selection is about achieving the right balance – reintegrating players returning from injury and rewarding those who have been playing consistently well in clubland. It’s important to create continuity while also bringing in players who have earned their place through strong performances,” Sermanni said.</p> <p>“Every match leading into the Asian Cup is an opportunity to fine-tune our approach, build cohesion, and ensure we are performing at the level required to take on Asia’s best during next year’s tournament.”</p> <p>The Asian Cup kicks off on 1 March.</p> <h2>Matildas squad</h2> <p>Mackenzie Arnold, Chloe Lincoln, Teagan Micah; Ellie Carpenter, Steph Catley, Charlotte Grant, Winonah Heatley, Clare Hunt, Alanna Kennedy, Courtney Nevin, Natasha Prior, Jamilla Rankin; Kyra Cooney-Cross, Katrina Gorry, Emily Van Egmond, Clare Wheeler, Tameka Yallop; Caitlin Foord, Mary Fowler, Michelle Heyman, Holly McNamara, Hayley Raso, Kaitlyn Torpey.</p>
