<p>Chelsea FC would be unaffected by any financial penalty for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/11/chelsea-74-charges-alleged-breaches-fa-agent-regulations">alleged breaches of Football Association (FA) rules</a> during the Roman Abramovich era, football finance experts have said, after corporate filings revealed its owners have a £150m cushion against the cost.</p> <p>Clearlake, a consortium led by the US investor Todd Boehly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/25/chelsea-todd-boehly-takeover-425bn-roman-abramovich-russia-ukraine">agreed to pay Abramovich £2.5bn for Chelsea in 2022</a>, shortly after the Russian oligarch was sanctioned by the UK government over his links to Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>The FA has since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/11/chelsea-74-charges-alleged-breaches-fa-agent-regulations">charged the club with 74 rule breaches</a> related to payments to agents during Abramovich’s tenure. Deals under the spotlight, highlighted in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/15/chelsea-fc-face-new-questions-over-how-roman-abramovich-funded-success">2023 investigation by the Guardian and international media partners</a>, include the transfers of star players Eden ­Hazard, Willian and Samuel Eto’o.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Fordstam Limited, the corporate vehicle that housed Chelsea FC during Abramovich’s tenure, revealed that it does not expect to receive £150m of the proceeds from the sale of the club.</p> <p>It said this was owing to a “holdback amount”, a clause inserted into the takeover deal by BlueCo 22, the subsidiary through which Clearlake bought the club.</p> <p>As a result of the clause, a portion of the total payment is withheld for five years, to cover the cost of “any proceeding in relation to events which took place before the acquisition date, up to a value of £150m”, accounts for 2022 show. The figure is higher than the £100m buffer that had previously been reported.</p>    <p>Fordstam’s accounts reveal for the first time that it has written off the prospect of receiving the sum from Chelsea’s new owners, owing to “doubts about its recoverability”.</p> <p>Sources close to Chelsea said such a clause was not unusual in buyouts of companies and that it also covered costs such as lost revenues during a period when sanctions against Abramovich meant Chelsea could not sell tickets or merchandise.</p> <p>But football finance experts said Fordstam’s admission that it does not expect to receive the holdback amount could indicate that a sporting sanction on Chelsea – such as a points deduction or suspension from competition – is more likely than previously thought.</p> <p>“There’s a question mark there as to why the size of the provision is so big,” said the football finance expert and lawyer Stefan Borson.</p> <p>“The holdback amount will not just indemnify any financial penalty from a fine. It may also cover claims for consequential losses from any sporting sanctions, such as a loss of a European place or [Premier League] merit payments.”</p> <p>Borson added that the scale of the holdback amount meant that Chelsea and Clearlake would feel limited impact from a fine. </p> <p>“There’s no penalty for the football club at all if the sanctions are purely financial and all are effectively recovered from the sale proceeds to Fordstam,” he said.</p> <p>Kieran Maguire, an associate professor in football finance at the University of Liverpool and the co-host of <a href="https://priceoffootball.com/">The Price of Football podcast</a>, said: “It [any fine] has effectively been taken into consideration in the offer price for the club.</p> <p>“The club will physically have to pay the penalty, so there would be a financial consequence, but the owners can in theory put an extra £150m into the club and be no worse off than if they’d paid the full agreed sum of £2.5bn.”</p> <p>Chelsea FC has previously raised funds by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/31/premier-league-psr-chelsea-sell-women-team-loophole">selling its women’s team to BlueCo 22</a>.</p> <p>The club has indicated that it expects to receive a financial penalty from the FA, if found to have breached the rules. Spokespeople for Chelsea have highlighted the fact that it self-reported some transactions to the FA, Premier League and Uefa, after analysing Abramovich-era data.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/19/chelsea-74-charges-roman-abramovich-fa-premier-league-comment">If Chelsea are guilty over Abramovich payments a fine would make a mockery of the rules | Rob Davies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fordstam’s results, filed at Companies House, also reveal the huge fees banked by executives and lawyers involved in the sale.</p> <p>Eugene Tenenbaum, a longtime associate of Abramovich, received a £4.8m bonus from Chelsea FC for his role in the takeover, the accounts show. BlueCo 22 covered the cost of £41.6m in legal fees incurred by Fordstam, according to the documents.</p> <p>The accounts also confirm that the £2.35bn proceeds of the deal are still frozen in a bank account, three years after Abramovich pledged to donate the sums to people affected by the conflict in Ukraine.</p> <p>The UK has said it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/02/uk-government-roman-abramovich-court-over-frozen-money">prepared to sue Abramovich</a> to release the money. Fordstam’s accounts state that discussions with the Treasury “continue … in this regard”.</p> <p>In theory, the sum could be reduced by £1.5bn, the value of an interest-free loan that Fordstam owes to Camberley International Investments, an offshore financing entity that was used by Abramovich to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/17/roman-abramovich-chelsea-world-beaters">channel funds from multibillion pound oil deals into Chelsea</a>.</p> <p>However, repayment of the loan could only be approved by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, a division of the Treasury. The oligarch has also pledged to write off the loan.</p> <p>The Guardian has approached Roman Abramovich and Chelsea FC for comment.</p>
