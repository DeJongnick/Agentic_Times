<p>Another MasterChef contestant has been edited out of the latest series after the controversy over the conduct of its sacked presenters, raising further questions about the BBC’s decision to broadcast the show.</p> <p>Banijay, the production company behind the cooking contest, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62n985gp3go">confirmed to the BBC</a> that a second contestant had asked to be edited out of the programme.</p> <p>It comes two weeks after the Guardian revealed that Sarah Shafi had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/31/masterchef-contestant-edited-out-after-asking-for-new-series-not-to-be-broadcast">agreed to be removed from the show</a>, having said that it should not be aired. She said that after allegations were made against Gregg Wallace and John Torode its broadcast would send the wrong message about the treatment of women and inappropriate behaviour by prominent figures.</p> <p>Wallace was dropped by the BBC after an independent report <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/14/report-gregg-wallace-behaviour-claims-ex-bbc-presenter">substantiated 45 allegations made against him</a>, including claims of inappropriate sexual language and one incident of unwelcome physical contact. He has apologised “for any distress caused” but said the report cleared him of “the most serious and sensational accusations”.</p> <p>Torode was also dropped as a presenter after he said he was the subject of a substantiated complaint over the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/15/john-torode-bbc-masterchef-contract-racist-language-allegation"> use of racist language</a>, which he believes never happened.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Banijay said: “One other contributor decided that given recent events they would like not to be included. We have of course accepted their wishes and edited them out of the show.”</p> <p>The series, which began airing last week, was filmed before Wallace and Torode were sacked. The BBC claimed it was “the right thing” to broadcast it, for the amateur chefs that took part.</p>    <p>It had already been forced to edit the programme to reduce the prominence of Wallace and Torode and remove Shafi’s appearance. It has now been edited further to remove another contestant, who has asked not to be identified, according to the BBC.</p> <p>The BBC is facing fresh criticism on social media about its decision to broadcast the series amid speculation about whether it would continue if more contestants asked to be removed.</p> <p>In a statement last month, the BBC said: “This has not been an easy decision in the circumstances and we appreciate not everyone will agree with it. In showing the series, which was filmed last year, it in no way diminishes our view of the seriousness of the upheld findings against both presenters. We have been very clear on the standards of behaviour that we expect of those who work at the BBC or on shows made for the BBC.</p> <p>“However, we believe that broadcasting this series is the right thing to do for these cooks who have given so much to the process. We want them to be properly recognised and give the audience the choice to watch the series.”</p>
