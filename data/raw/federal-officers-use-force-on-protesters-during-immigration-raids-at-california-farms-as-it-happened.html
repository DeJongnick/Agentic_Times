In 2018, Grenell immediately got to work as Trump’s representative by <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/05/09/twitter-troll-takes-post-u-s-ambassador-germany-immediately-offends-germans/">offending the German people</a> with a tweet.</p> <p>Following the news of Trump’s decision, first <a href="https://x.com/NickAdamsinUSA/status/1943268508630184088">revealed on X</a> by Adams himself, examples of his more extreme posts began to circulate on the platform.</p> <p>“Unfortunately today it’s more important to be a minority than it is to be a qualified person,” Adams said <a href="https://x.com/RpsAgainstTrump/status/1943450568170836009">in one clip</a>. “The most persecuted group in the United States of America are straight, white, Christian men.”</p> <p>In another, he made a show of boycotting the supposedly woke business of Pizza Hut, which he accused of spreading “drag queen propaganda” by screaming at the camera and then driving a golf cart over a pizza box.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/NickAdamsinUSA/status/1632879652724264967">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT:<br><br>I don&#39;t care how many pizzas you send me!<br><br>Pizza Hut&#39;s woke sausage stuffed cheesy crust pizza will NEVER pass my lips again.<br><br>The boycott stands!

In June, he announced a 50% tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum imports. The new rates apply to all other goods.</p> <p>Trump’s letter repeats his mistaken but frequently reiterated belief that tariffs are paid by foreign countries or businesses. In fact, tariffs are an import tax, paid by US importers, and often passed on to US consumers.</p> <p>The new tariff rates set by Trump this week could all be reduced to zero if the administration loses its appeal later this month of an adverse ruling by the US court of international trade, which found in May that the president had acted beyond his legal authority by using emergency powers to impose tariffs in the absence of an actual emergency.</p> <p>That hearing at the US court of appeals for the federal circuit in Washington is <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105/gov.uscourts.cafc.23105.56.0.pdf">scheduled for</a> 10 am on 31 July.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-11T01:13:33.572Z">at 2.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6870505e8f0818300cb0bc4b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-11T00:19:33.997Z">1.19am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump threatens to oppose any Republican who votes against defunding NPR and PBS</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114831435031070955">a post</a> on his social media platform, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> threatened to withhold his support from any Republican in Congress who does not vote to strip away previously appropriated funds to support non-partisan public broadcasting.</p> <p>Clearly laying out his vision that it is the role of the legislative branch to obey his orders, Trump wrote that it is very important for Republicans to “adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (PBS and NPR)”.</p> <p>“Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement,” the president of the United States instructed members of the co-equal branch he regards as subordinates.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/BILLS-119hr4ih/pdf/BILLS-119hr4ih.pdf">legislation</a> is the first request by the Trump administration for Congress to claw back money it already has approved through annual spending bills. The bill reflects a list of cuts totaling $9.4bn that were requested by the office of management and budget. The bulk of the cuts – $8.3bn billion – are to foreign aid programs addressing global public health, international disaster assistance and hunger relief. The package also strips away all the funds for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 for public broadcasting, totaling $1.1bn.</p> <p>The Senate is expected to vote on the rescission legislation, which passed the House by two votes, by next week. </p> <p>Republican senators Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, and Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, have both expressed qualms about eliminating public broadcasting from rural communities in their states.</p> <p>Rounds, who is up for re-election in 2026, told CNN on Tuesday yesterday that he wants to protect “the radio stations in some of the rural areas that provide emergency services”.</p> <p>Murkowski told reporters on Wednesday: “I don’t like the rescissions package as it is currently drafted. I’m a strong supporter of Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and I think our global health programs are important.” At an appropriations committee hearing on Thursday, in which she voted with Democrats to stop the White House from using money budgeted for a new FBI headquarters in Maryland to move the agency somewhere else, Murkowski said she was opposed to rescissions in general.</p> <p>In May, Trump issued an executive order claiming that PBS and NPR “spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as ‘news’”.</p> <p>Together the two broadcasters reach tens of millions of Americans, providing them with fact-based news and educational information at a time when the administration favors partisan outlets and produces deeply political, and often misleading or false, social media content.</p> <p>Although NPR’s political reporting is rigorously non-partisan, its adherence to factual accuracy apparently alienated the Trump campaign last year to such an extent that its correspondent, Franco Ordoñez, was <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5077658">denied credentials</a> to at least one Trump news conference.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-11T00:37:06.450Z">at 1.37am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-687043428f08087814a71091" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-10T23:20:01.107Z">12.20am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Federal officers use force on protesters during immigration raids at California farms</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Federal immigration officers, supported by national guard troops, used force against protesters, firing chemical munitions, during raids on two cannabis farms in California’s central coast area on Thursday, according to <a href="https://www.independent.com/2025/07/10/federal-raids-hit-glass-house-farms-locations-on-central-coast/">local news outlets</a> and video <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vcdefensa/">posted on Instagram</a> by immigrant-rights activists.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKFgeDkUnoY"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tKFgeDkUnoY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>As a TV news helicopter hovered overhead, federal agents fired chemical agents at protesters during an immigration raid in Camarillo, California, on Thursday.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>At a farm in Carpinteria, <strong>Salud Carbajal</strong>, a Democratic representative, was denied entry to the area by federal agents, a scene <a href="https://x.com/JohnPalminteri/status/1943416317207548356">captured on video</a> by the Santa Barbara Independent.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/JohnPalminteri/status/1943416317207548356">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congressman Salud Carbajal was  denied access during a Homeland Security operation in Carpinteria.

money,” she wrote.</p> <p>The FTC, Khan explained, “began writing a ‘click-to-cancel’ rule promoting efficient cancellation, a rulemaking process that took 3+ years and required reviewing 16k comments &amp; giving industry a chance to present their views at an FTC hearing”.</p> <p>“Big business interests sued to block the ‘click-to-cancel’ rule – and Republican-appointed judges tossed it out, concluding that industry needed MORE time and process to explain why they opposed the rule,” Khan added.</p> <p>“Too many companies are relying on shady fine print and confusing cancellation processes to lock customers into charges they never agreed to. They’re counting on customers to forget, give up, or get stuck in the fine print so they can keep charging their card every month,” Gallego said in <a href="https://www.gallego.senate.gov/press-releases/gallego-introduces-bill-to-make-subscription-cancellations-easier-after-ftc-rule-halted/">a statement</a> on his proposed legislation.</p> <p>“This bill puts an end to that scam by giving the FTC’s Click-to-Cancel rule the full force of law so that people can cancel subscriptions just as easily as they sign up for them. It’s a commonsense fix that will save families money and stop businesses from trapping customers in subscriptions they don’t want, can’t use, or never meant to keep,” the senator added.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-10T22:33:43.093Z">at 11.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-687035cc8f08087814a71032" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/roth-andrew"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-10T22:02:37.236Z">11.02pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">State department plans mass layoffs with cuts to nearly 1,800 staff</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The US state department has announced that it plans to move forward with mass layoffs as part of the most significant restructuring of the country’s diplomatic corps in decades. Officials say the cuts will align their mission with <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s vision of America first.</p> <p>The layoffs, which are commonly called reductions in force (or RIFs), along with voluntary redundancies, will affect nearly 15% of the state department’s domestic staff. A senior state department official said that was close to 1,800 people. The restructuring will also see several hundred bureaus merged or eliminated entirely. The department advises the president and leads the US in foreign policy issues.</p> <p>The state department went forward with the layoffs, which were long expected, after the supreme court sided this week with the Trump administration against a federal judge’s hold on plans for mass government firings that could affect hundreds of thousands of federal employees.</p> <p>“In the coming days, the department will be communicating to individuals affected by the reduction in force. First and foremost, we want to thank them for their dedication and service to the United States,” read a memo attributed to <strong>Michael Rigas</strong>, the deputy secretary for management and resources, announcing the layoffs.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/state-department-layoffs-rif-trump">US state department announces plan to lay off nearly 15% of its domestic workforce</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-10T22:24:59.019Z">at 11.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68702fa18f0818300cb0bb72" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-10T21:37:10.978Z">10.37pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Murkowski sides with Democrats to block Trump from changing site of new FBI headquarters</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Senate appropriations committee narrowly voted to adopt an amendment on Thursday that blocks the Trump administration from changing the site of a new FBI headquarters building.</p> <p><strong>Lisa Murkowski</strong>, an Alaska Republican, cast the deciding vote on the amendment introduced by <strong>Chris Van Hollen</strong>, a Maryland Democrat, which bars the Trump administration from spending any of the previously appropriated $1.4bn in funds to move the FBI anywhere but the site in Greenbelt, Maryland, which was chosen in a competitive process.</p> <p>Last week, the administration notified Congress that it intended to permanently relocate the FBI to the Ronald Reagan building in Washington DC instead of proceeding with the planned building in suburban Maryland.</p> <p>Such an “unauthorized use of funds”, Van Hollen said in a statement, would have been “directly at odds with what has been passed by the Congress on a bipartisan basis” and would have set “a dangerous precedent for executive overreach into Congress’s power of the purse”.</p> <p>The measure passed 15-14.</p> <p>In her comments before the vote, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/qzp_3zw-uIo?si=NFlnaTOQfjNH2ZZ2&amp;t=3753">Murkowski said</a> that she had no information on how the administration had determined that the Reagan building was a secure enough location.</p> <p>“I, for one, would like to know,” Murkowski said, “this is the right place and it’s the right place, not for a Trump administration, not for a Biden administration, not for a Jon Ossoff administration, but this is the right place for the FBI.”</p> <p>Murkowski paused after her reference to the possibility that the Democratic senator from Georgia could be the next president.</p> <p>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to start any rumors,” she added to laughter from her colleagues.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-10T22:09:13.422Z">at 11.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-687024818f08ed9c6fb4bf12" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-10T20:58:55.091Z">9.58pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Scotland braces for protests against Trump before rumored visit</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong>, the UK’s prime minister, has reportedly accepted an invitation to visit <strong>Donald Trump</strong> during the US president’s expected trip to Scotland this month, a source familiar with the plans told Reuters on Thursday.</p> <p>There is, as yet, no word on the details of the rumored visit to the homeland of Trump’s mother, but <strong>Severin Carrell</strong>, the Guardian’s Scotland editor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/09/police-scotland-braced-protests-donald-trump-visits-new-golf-course">reports</a> that police in Scotland are gearing up for a possible visit to his golf resort in Aberdeenshire:</p> <p>“It is thought Trump will officially open a new 18-hole golf course at his resort on the North Sea coast at Menie, north of Aberdeen, being named in honour of his mother, Mary Anne MacLeod Trump,” Severin reported on Wednesday.</p> <p>“Planning is under way for a potential visit to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a> later this month by the president of the United States,” assistant chief constable Emma Bond said.

The suit was filed on behalf of non-US citizens living in the US whose babies might be affected.</p> <p>Under the supreme court’s decision, Trump’s executive order would take effect on 27 July.</p> <p>Looking to seize upon an exception in the supreme court’s ruling, the lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the decision allows judges to continue to block Trump policies on a nationwide basis in class action lawsuits.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> released an intemperate letter to Brazil’s president imposing a 50% tariff and complaining about the prosecution of his friend, former president Jair Bolsonaro, for the crime of trying to stay in office despite losing an election and then inciting a riot by his supporters to derail the transfer of power.</p></li> <li><p>Brazil’s current president, <strong>Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva</strong>, rejected Trump’s demand that the charges against Bolsonaro be dropped, and pointed out that Brazil has an independent judiciary and does not, in fact, have a trade imbalance with the US.</p></li> <li><p>Brazilians mocked Bolsonaro’s potential successor for supporting Trump, by remixing video of him in a Maga hat on social media.</p></li> <li><p>Amid concerns that a wave of staff reductions threaten the core missions of Nasa, Trump announced that he is asking the transportation secretary, <strong>Sean Duffy</strong>, to also serve as interim administrator of the space agency.</p></li> <li><p>Trump complimented the president of Liberia on his excellent English, revealing that he is unaware of that nation’s close ties to the US, as a colony founded in 1822 for free Black Americans.</p></li> <li><p>The US supreme court maintained a judicial block on a Republican-crafted Florida law that makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants to enter the state.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-10T13:13:37.520Z">at 2.13pm BST</time></p>  </div>
