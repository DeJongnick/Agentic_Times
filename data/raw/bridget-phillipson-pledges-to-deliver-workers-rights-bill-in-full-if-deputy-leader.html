<p>Bridget Phillipson has vowed to protect the government’s employment rights bill from being watered down if elected deputy Labour leader.</p> <p>The education secretary, who is widely seen as Downing Street’s pick for the role, said she would pick up the mantle Angela Rayner held as the “unions’ champion” of workers’ rights in Keir Starmer’s cabinet, and “personally grab the employment rights Angela long pushed for”.</p> <p>Phillipson is facing her former cabinet colleague Lucy Powell in the contest to replace Rayner as deputy leader.</p> <p>The biggest unions – Unison, GMB and Unite – are yet to publicly announce which candidate they will throw their weight behind but Phillipson’s campaign has been endorsed by the Musicians’ Union, the Community union and the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).</p> <p>It is understood the Communication Workers Union is to back Powell, who has already secured the backing of the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, a longtime ally, ministers including Ed Miliband and Lisa Nandy, and the affiliates group Disability Labour.</p> <p>Phillipson’s pledge to ensure Labour’s workers’ rights package remains strong – “no ifs or buts” – came after several union figures expressed concerns over the appointment of Peter Kyle as business secretary and the sacking of Justin Madders as a business minister in the reshuffle after Rayner’s departure.</p> <p>Some Downing Street strategists are said to have been cautious about the employment rights bill (ERB) after facing a backlash from business. But Kyle has since promised there will be no backsliding on the legislation.</p> <p>Phillipson said: “As deputy leader I would personally grab the employment rights reform that Angela long pushed for to ensure it is enacted in full and not watered down. No ifs or buts. I will work with every single trade union rep in our country to ensure this crucial legislation sees the light of day to deliver change for working people. From no more exploitative zero-hours contracts to securing day one rights and fair pay for a fair day’s work.</p> <p>“I’m used to standing up to vested interests. I took on the private school lobby to end their tax breaks and deliver an education system that works for everyone. I’ll be as strong a champion for working people. I will be the unions’ champion for employment rights reform at the cabinet table, like Angela was. We simply cannot let it fall down the agenda. I want a strong mandate from members and unions to push every day to secure this vital reform for workers.”</p> <p>Chris Kitchen, the NUM general secretary, backed her pledge and said: “Bridget stands with workers. Her pledge today to drive forward the employment rights bill and be a voice for unions at the cabinet table further underlines why we believe she is the right choice for deputy leader. As a united Labour party, governing and campaigning with Labour values, we can transform workers’ rights in this country.”</p> <p>The bill includes a ban on “exploitative” zero-hours contracts, ending most instances of fire-and-rehire, day one protection from unfair dismissal, and protection for workers from harassment.</p> <p>Joanne Thomas, the general secretary of the Usdaw union, said: “We need a strong voice around the cabinet table with their own personal mandate from unions and workers to deliver this legislation. We are reassured that Bridget has said she will personally grab the mantle from Angela Rayner to drive greater fairness and security into workplaces across this country.”</p> <p>Alasdair McDiarmid, the Community assistant general secretary, said: “Bridget has shown time and time again as education secretary that she respects and values trade unions, working closely and constructively with union partners in that role. This is a clear and unwavering commitment to delivering the ERB in full. We need a champion who will push for these changes at the heart of government.”</p>
