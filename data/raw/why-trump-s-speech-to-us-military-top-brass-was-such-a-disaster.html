<h1>Why Trump’s speech to US military top brass was such a disaster</h1>

<p>No dictator or would-be dictator on day one has ever assembled before him in one room the entire senior officer corps of his armed forces in order to have them belittled as failures and humiliated for their slovenly personal appearance, while degrading whole classes serving in the army, navy and air force as inferior and unworthy. No dictator has ever pleaded for generals and admirals to applaud his remarks, followed by deafening silence.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is used to entering to the din of a mob jazzed up with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jan/26/ymca-trump-village-people">YMCA</a>. “I’ve never walked into a room so silent before,” the US president said when he addressed the country’s highest-ranking military leaders at the Marine Corps Base Quantico on Tuesday. “Don’t laugh. Don’t know if you’re allowed to do that.” He was trying to force some tittering, an old lounge act gag to rouse a dead audience. “You know what? Just have a good time.” The comedian who felt his routine was bombing before he even began sought to relax the room. Then Trump instinctively replaced the ingratiating gestures with threats. “If you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room. Of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.”</p> <p>Trump’s syllogism perfectly encapsulated his psychology of victimhood and politics of retribution. If you do not bend the knee to him, he is personally wounded. Your failure to worship him must be punished. Your slight of his majesty condemns you to ruin.</p> <p>Trump cannot grasp that the silence of the commanders during his unprecedented address to them demonstrated their highest duty. Their discipline showed fidelity to uphold their oath to the constitution. By their stillness they presented themselves as models for the rest of the officer corps and the troops. They are not loyal to Trump or any cult of personality, but to his constitutional role. They were being used as a backdrop for a campaign-like rally, but they were resistant to serving as partisan players.</p> <p>Trump’s inability to understand their stolidity in the face of his provocations showed his incomprehension not only of the military but the presidency under the law. When he took offense at their stoney silence his rebuke disclosed that he saw them merely as his pawns. They were to his mind no different from his personal attorneys he had installed at the Department of Justice to do his bidding, including the suppression of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/what-are-jeffrey-epstein-documents-trump">Epstein files</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/03/when-will-us-generals-stand-up-to-trump">When will US generals stand-up to Trump? | Moustafa Bayoumi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump had come on an urgent mission for them to carry out. He was there to tell the military chiefs they were to be his unquestioning agents for the greatest reversal of military strategy since the “war on terror” – a new war to be waged against his perceived political opponents at home in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the domestic deployment of the US military as a police force.</p> <p>All the senior generals in all the world had been gathered for the unprecedented event at the Marine Corps Base Quantico on the order of the secretary of defense, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>. They had no inkling for what momentous occasion they were being summoned. They dared not speculate that Hegseth brought them to be his captive audience for his self-referential vanity Ted talk attempting to rehabilitate his image and assert his authority. That would have seemed too stupid for words.</p> <p>But the commanders could have gotten more than a hint that they were being rounded up for the latest episode of It Can’t Happen Here, by reading Trump’s executive order of 22 September, Designating Antifa as a Domestic Terrorist Organization, an “organization” that does not exist. This was followed by a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/countering-domestic-terrorism-and-organized-political-violence/">National Security Presidential Memorandum No 7</a> on 25 September citing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">murder of Charlie Kirk</a> and a series of disparate events as pretexts: “This political violence is not a series of isolated incidents and does not emerge organically. Instead, it is a culmination of sophisticated, organized campaigns … ”</p> <p>According to NSPM-7, a new “national strategy” would be implemented against an ideology of “anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity; support for the overthrow of the United States Government; extremism on migration, race, and gender; and hostility towards those who hold traditional American views on family, religion, and morality.” Jimmy Kimmel was not mentioned.</p> <p>These vapors were not a description of an ideology so much as a hodgepodge of Maga shibboleths. If there were any ideology expressed it was an inchoate fascism based on a repressive impulse that conjured up an all-purpose enemy called “Antifa”. Any sense of irony, of course, was completely missing. In fact, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-capitol-breach">January 6</a> was the last attempt to overthrow the US government, incited by Trump. The leadership of Trump as a paragon of “traditional American views on family, religion, and morality” defies satire and only underscores the recurrent demand for the release of the Epstein files.</p> <p>The theatrical presentation at Quantico began with Hegseth darting back and forth on the stage. He was a motivational speaker as a drill sergeant with a book to hawk – and a warm-up act for the headliner. Observing him was like seeing the negative of a photograph. The darkest parts were reflections of his own grievances at the criticism and censure provoked by his past behavior.</p> <p>The former national guard major said he had been been “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/14/nx-s1-5191941/pete-hegseth-defense-department-dei">deemed an extremist</a>”; he was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/15/pete-hegseth-flagged-insider-threat-00189991">flagged</a> as a possible “insider threat” by fellow officers. (Hegseth has denied that he is an extremist). Despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/03/pete-hegseth-defense-department-alcohol-use">numerous accounts of his alcoholism</a>, he told Megyn Kelly in an interview: “I never had a drinking problem,” but then reportedly <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pete-hegseth-back-scrutiny-grows-misconduct-allegations/story?id=116444894">promised a senator</a> that he would “not touch alcohol while I have this position”. Hegseth was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/pete-hegseth-sexual-assault-allegations">accused of sexual assault in 2017</a>, and <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/01/pete-hegseth-settlement-amount/">settled a lawsuit</a> brought by the woman who had accused him. (The settlement terms were confidential. Hegseth has said the allegations were false).</p> <p>As a Fox News host, Hegseth had been a prominent advocate for pardoning or granting clemency to service members accused or convicted of war crimes. Hegseth described them as “warriors” rather than “war criminals”. “If he committed premeditated murder, then I did as well ... Put us all in jail,” he said about one of them. Hegseth voiced support for members of his own unit in Iraq killing three <a href="https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/pete-hegseth-nomination-as-defence-secretary-rekindles-scrutiny-of-2006-killings-in-iraq-7092770#:~:text=Pete%20Hegseth%2C%20then%20a%2026,aggressiveness%2C%20given%20the%20insurgency's%20intensity.">unarmed detainees</a> who were told to run and then shot. Once Hegseth was confirmed, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/22/us/politics/hegseth-firings-military-lawyers-jag.html">purged the top-rank judge advocate general</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/02/hegseth-600-jag-immigration-judges/">pushing a plan</a> to send many of the rest to work in immigration courts.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/05/blue-states-democrats-trump">Blue states should come together to declare an emergency. Here’s how | Thomas Geoghegan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hegseth said that the military should not “fight with stupid rules of engagement”, his longtime complaint against rules designed to protect civilians and enforce military law against war crimes.</p> <p>Now, in his speech, Hegseth declared he was clearing away “the debris”. He encouraged loosening regulations aimed at preventing forbidden violence within the armed forces. He announced the “overhauling” of the inspector general and whistleblower complaint process, which would undermine legal protections and shield violent or reckless offenders from accountability. He would, he said, impose discriminatory measures of “gender-neutral” or “male level” physical standards for combat roles, stating: “If that means no women qualify for some combat jobs, so be it.” (In 2023, more than 17% of the military force was composed of women, with thousands in combat roles.)</p> <p>Hegseth swaggered in front of the commanders, barking obscenities – “Fafo”, or “Fuck around and find out”. “No more identity months, DEI offices, dudes in dresses. No more climate change worship. No more division, distraction or gender delusions. No more debris. As I’ve said before and will say again, we are done with that shit.”</p> <p>The generals sat expressionless at his vulgarity that could be charged under the Uniform Military Code of Justice as a violation against indecent language that “neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline”.</p> <p>According to Pete, it was the flabby generals who needed to work out like Pete. “It’s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon and leading commands around the country and the world. It’s a bad look,” he said. “No more beardos.” That means you, Gen Grant.</p> <p>Hegseth, at last, was seemingly getting his revenge for being tagged as an “insider threat”. He shouted: “No more side-tracking careers, no more walking on eggshells.” He accused the brass of harming the military by evaluating the mental stability of officers: “We’ve weeded out so-called toxic leaders under the guise of double-blind psychology assessments, promoting risk-averse, go-along-to-get-along conformists instead.” Then he plugged his book: “You might say we’re ending the war on warriors. I heard someone wrote a book about that.” The title of his book was The War on Warriors.</p> <p>Not once did Hegseth mention “Russia” or “Ukraine”. He made not the slightest reference to Russia’s huge missile attacks bombarding Ukraine, Russia’s drones over Romania, Estonia and Denmark, the tensions over US wavering within the western alliance, or utter anything that might be construed as a strategic thought.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/01/trump-hegseth-speeches-military-generals">What do Trump and Hegseth’s inflammatory speeches to military generals signal? | Moira Donegan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After his menacing speech, Hegseth made way for Trump. Trump displayed his usual contempt for the military by baiting them with an array of partisan barbs to which they remained rigidly motionless. He slipped into a whirlpool of self-celebration followed by anxiety. There were bits about the “Gulf of America”, calling Joe “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/trump-hangs-autopen-photo-instead-of-biden-portrait-in-new-presidential-gallery">the autopen</a>” and watching the 1950s TV series Victory At Sea, before Trump came to his worry of falling down stairs. “Every day, the guy is falling downstairs,” Trump said about Biden. “We can’t have it. I’m very careful. You know, when I walk downstairs,like, I’m on stairs, like these stairs, I’m very – I walk very slowly.” He could not contain his envy of Barack Obama. “So one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs. I’ve never seen it. Da-da, da-da, da-da, bop, bop, bop. He’d go down the stairs. Wouldn’t hold on. I said, it’s great. I don’t want to do it.”</p> <p>In the middle of his stream of consciousness, he dropped his new mission for the military against the “enemy from within”, with major American cities as the “training grounds … the ones that are run by the radical-left Democrats … And this is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room. That’s a war, too. It’s a war from within.” Silence.</p> <p>The next day, 1 October, in Memphis, Hegseth appeared as a member of a posse with attorney general <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a> and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller to speak before a rally of Ice agents and federal marshals in anticipation of the arrival of a contingent of national guard troops. Miller delivered his imitation of Patton. “The gangbangers that you deal with – they think they’re ruthless? They have no idea how ruthless we are. They think they’re tough? They have no idea how tough we are. They think they’re hardcore? We are so much more hardcore than they are.” Miller, not any mere general, gave the order. “You are unleashed.”</p> <p>You could tell Stephen Miller embodied the new “warrior ethos”. No beard. Shaved head, too.
