That is a 29.4 percentage point difference, marginally higher than the 28.9 points difference recorded in the pre-pandemic year of 2019.</p> <p>But as in previous years, grammar schools do best, with almost two-thirds (63.2%) of the students achieving a top grade.</p> <p><em>Carmen Aguilar García is a data journalist on the Guardian data projects team</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68a705578f088233182d348a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/pamela-duncan"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-21T11:41:03.916Z">12.41pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Statistics the fastest growing GCSE subject in England year-on-year</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>What is the statistical likelihood of statistics becoming the fastest growing GCSE subject in England year-on-year.
