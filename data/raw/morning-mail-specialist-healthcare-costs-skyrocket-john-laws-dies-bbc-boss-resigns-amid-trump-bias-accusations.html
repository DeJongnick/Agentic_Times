<p>Good morning. With some one-hour appointments now costing $1,000, today we’re taking a deep look at why out-of-pocket fees for specialist doctors are skyrocketing across Australia – and what you can do about it.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, consumer advocates argue that the Australian Taxation Office’s contracts with private call centre operators, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, are leaving vulnerable taxpayers exposed.</p> 
<p>Plus: talkback radio veteran John Laws has died and a native title claim is being lodged over Melbourne by the Wurundjeri Woi-wurrung people. Meanwhile in the UK, senior BBC bosses have resigned amid claims of bias in its news coverage of Donald Trump.</p>
