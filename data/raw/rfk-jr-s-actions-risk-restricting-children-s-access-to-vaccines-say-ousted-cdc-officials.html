<p>Top former officials at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) accused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a> of hobbling the country’s ability to respond to outbreaks and disease threats.</p> <p>The two officials testified at a hearing on Wednesday before the Senate Help (Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) committee. Susan Monarez, the CDC director chosen by Kennedy, was fired after less than a month. Debra Houry, chief medical officer at the CDC, resigned after serving under six CDC directors during both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p> <p>On the morning of 25 August, Kennedy demanded that Monarez “commit in advance to approving every ACIP recommendation, regardless of the scientific evidence”, she testified. He also directed her to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy without cause, she said.</p> <p>“He said if I was unwilling to do both, I should resign. I responded that I could not pre-approve recommendations without reviewing the evidence, and I had no basis to fire scientific experts.” Monarez believes that was the true reason she was fired.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/16/vaccine-recommendations-anti-vax-data">US health officials to revisit vaccine policies using anti-vax tactics, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kennedy was “very upset” and “tense” in their meeting. He spoke of the CDC and its employees in a “hurtful and disparaging” manner, Monarez said.</p> <p>“He called, in that context, CDC the most corrupt federal agency in the world. He emphasized that CDC employees were horrible people,” she said. “He said that CDC employees were killing children, and they don’t care.”</p> <p>Monarez went on to say that based on what she observed during her tenure, “there is a real risk that recommendations could be made restricting access to vaccines for children and others in need, without rigorous scientific review. With no permanent CDC director in place, those recommendations could be adopted.”</p> <p>She continued: “The stakes are not theoretical. We already have seen the largest measles outbreak in more than 30 years, which claimed the lives of two children. If vaccine protections are weakened, preventable diseases will return.”</p> <p>Also on 25 August, Monarez said Kennedy told her “the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing starting in September, and I needed to be on board with it”. She said Kennedy had the support of the Trump White House, with Kennedy claiming to her that “he spoke to the President every day about changing the childhood vaccine schedule”.</p> <p>The CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, ACIP, which has been replaced with Kennedy’s handpicked advisers, will meet on Thursday and Friday. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana who chairs the committee, recently called for an indefinite postponement of the ACIP meeting.</p> <p>“If the meeting proceeds, any recommendations made should be rejected as lacking legitimacy given the seriousness of the allegations and the current turmoil in CDC leadership,” Cassidy, who is a physician, <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/rep/newsroom/press/cassidy-calls-for-vaccine-committee-meeting-to-be-postponed-following-cdc-departures">said</a> on 28 August.</p> <p>ACIP will reportedly take up a vote on the current recommendation that the hepatitis B vaccine be given at birth.</p> <p>“Folks know I’m a physician – as it turns out I am a hepatologist, which is a liver specialist,” Cassidy said. “I have seen people die from hepatitis.”</p> <p>More than 90% of children infected at birth develop chronic, lifelong infections and risk liver cancer, he said.</p> <p>“Now that we’ve controlled it, do we let the genie out of the bottle if the recommendation goes away?” Cassidy asked.</p> <p>Debra Houry also testified to seeing political interference and said she “resigned because CDC leaders were reduced to rubber stamps, supporting policies not based in science, and putting American lives at risk”. She said Kennedy “censored CDC science, politicized its processes and stripped leaders of independence.”</p> <p>Approximately 80% of center directors were now in an acting capacity because career officials had been fired, resigned or retired, Houry said.</p> <p>These unprecedented changes come as the CDC and its employees face violence and threats. On 8 August, a shooter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/atlanta-cdc-shooting">fired more than 500 rounds</a> at the CDC headquarters, with 180 bullets hitting the building. Houry said her staff was “traumatized”.</p> <p>Kennedy did not call Monarez following the shooting, Monarez testified. Such violence following decades of misinformation and harassment of scientific officials has sweeping repercussions. Some CDC staff will now not put their names on scientific reports on vaccines to protect themselves and their families.</p> <p>Houry first learned that Kennedy had changed the CDC’s Covid vaccine guidance in a Twitter/X post.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/cdc-leadership-loss-experts-alarmed">‘Americans should be alarmed’: Experts say loss of expertise at CDC will harm US health</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“CDC scientists have still not seen the scientific data or justification for this change,” she said.</p> <p>Houry testified that she has never briefed the secretary, nor have her center directors – even as the worst measles outbreak in decades unfolded. She also contested misinformation from the secretary: “He said things like vaccines had fetal parts, and I had to send a note to our leadership team to correct that misinformation. We were also asked to include things like budesonide and clarithromycin in our toolkits for physicians, and I couldn’t allow that, as there wasn’t evidence for that and would result in harm.”</p> <p>The new restrictions on Covid vaccines have led to chaos and confusion with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/11/covid-vaccine-boosters-rfk">updated vaccine rollout</a>, though Kennedy testified before the finance committee on 4 September that “anybody can get the booster.”</p> <p>“My mom lives in Virginia, and she was unable to get it,” Houry said.</p> <p>The HHS also interfered with information about thimerosal (also known as thiomersal), a preservative demonstrated to be safe, and allowed an “unvetted presentation” on thimerosal to occur in the June ACIP meeting, she said.</p> <p>“That kind of last-minute alteration undermines confidence and the deliberations that follow,” Houry said.</p> <p>The vaccine advisers ultimately voted to ban thimerosal, which is used in about 4% of flu vaccines in the US. If vaccine-preventable diseases are allowed to continue rising, “it’s going to be heartbreaking,” Houry said.</p> <p>Houry added that she was “concerned about the future of CDC and public health in our country.</p> <p>“We are not prepared, not just for pandemics, but for preventing chronic health disease, and we’re going to see kids dying of vaccine-preventable diseases,” she continued.</p> <p>Kennedy said in the finance committee hearing a few weeks ago that Monarez told him she was untrustworthy. Monarez then said in Wednesday’s hearing: “He told me he could not trust me because I had shared information related to our conversation beyond his staff. I told him, if you cannot trust me, then you can fire me.”</p> <p>The issue under debate on Wednesday went beyond the circumstances of Monarez’s and Houry’s departure, said Senator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/berniesanders">Bernie Sanders</a>.</p> <p>“It is about Secretary Kennedy’s dangerous war on science, public health and the truth itself. It is absurd to have to say this in the year 2025, but vaccines are safe and effective.”</p>
