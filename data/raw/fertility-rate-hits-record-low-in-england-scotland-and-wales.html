<p>The fertility rate for England and Wales has fallen for the third year in a row to reach a record low, figures show.</p> <p>The total fertility rate across both countries, meaning the average number of live children women can expect to have across their child-bearing life, stood at 1.41 in 2024, down from 1.42 in 2023, the lowest since comparable data was first collected in 1938, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p> <p>This is despite a 0.6% increase in live births last year, with a 14% <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/births-england-and-wales-increase">increase</a> in the number of babies born to fathers over 60, according to figures <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/births-england-and-wales-increase">published</a> last month.</p> <p>The disparity is down to the fact the adult population rose in 2024, which outweighed the increase in births. Since 1938, an increase in births at the same time as a decrease in the fertility rate has been observed only six times, with four occurring since 2011.</p> <p>For a country’s population to remain stable over time – discounting any impact from migration – the total fertility rate needs to be about 2.1.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/zEuZN/1/" data-alt="Graph showing the changing fertility rate since 1938"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/zEuZN/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Greg Ceely, the head of population health monitoring at the ONS, said: “Fertility rates in England and Wales have been in overall decline since 2010. The total number of births increased last year, for the first time since 2021; but this was offset by population growth. As a result, fertility rates fell overall, and are now at the lowest rates on record.”</p> <p>The stats also showed that the long-term trend of the average age of parents rising steadily over the past 50 years is continuing: the average age of mothers and fathers both increased by 0.1 years in 2024, with mothers aged 31 and fathers 33.9, according to the ONS’s annual <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/livebirths/bulletins/birthsummarytablesenglandandwales/2024refreshedpopulations">Births in England and Wales</a> publication.</p> <p>Over the last two decades, the average age of mothers and fathers has increased by two years for mothers, and just under two years for fathers. Mothers living in London had the highest mean age across all English regions and Wales at 32.5 years in 2024. The lowest was in north-east England, where it was 30.</p> <p>In 2024, the average age of mothers in England and Wales having their first-born (29.4) was noticeably lower than those having later-born children (31.8 for second, 32.9 for third, and 33.9 for fourth). The ONS said that this suggested, when looked at with historical data, that mothers tend to leave larger gaps between their first and second children than for subsequent children.</p> <p>When broken down by age group, the fertility rate for the age group 25 to 29 has decreased the most for both mothers and fathers, although there were falls for all under-30s. Conversely, it increased for mothers between 30 and 39, and for fathers it increased between 35 and 39 and decreased between 30 and 34.</p> <p>There were also notable increases for older fathers, with the fertility rate increasing for those over 60 and those aged 50-54, although it fell slightly for fathers in their 40s.</p> <p>The stats also shed light on regional disparities. Two regions experienced an increase in the fertility rate, representing the first regional increases since 2021: the West Midlands increased from 1.56 in 2023 to 1.59 in 2024, and London increased from 1.33 in 2023 to 1.35 in 2024. The north-west experienced no change and all other regions recorded declines.</p> <p>Luton was the area with the highest fertility rate at 2, while the City of London’s was the lowest at 0.32.<br><br>In Scotland, official data published on 26 August showed the country had the lowest number of births and the lowest birthrate since records began in 1855.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/publications/vital-events-reference-tables-2024/">National Records of Scotland data</a>, there were 45,763 live births last year, the lowest recorded. The overall fertility rate fell to 1.25 – below the rate for England and Wales – while the death rate also fell to the lowest on record, raising further fears about the widening age gap in Scotland.<br><br>Bernice Kuang, a demography researcher at the University of Southampton, said the fall in fertility rates could be a temporary result of people postponing having children.</p> <p>Her team’s research has found that the proportion of people reaching the end of their childbearing years without children has not yet increased markedly. Instead, most follow the UK’s “persistently strong two-child norm”, in contrast with other countries, where one-child families are more common.</p> <p>She said: “We might see fertility continue to decline and then rebound once the age at first birth stops climbing. But if it turns out that today’s young people postpone childbearing and then ultimately end up not having children, fertility rates may further decrease.”</p> <p>Kuang added that a larger share of young people said they did not intend to have children compared with earlier cohorts.</p> <p>She said there was a “dire need” for more housing and childcare support, which remained “extremely unaffordable for many people”. Her research has found that young people are reluctant to start families “when there is economic uncertainty and apprehension about the future”.</p> <p>“Policies that support families in the long term tend to be more effective in encouraging people to have children, versus one-off support, like cash transfers or parental leave at the time of birth,” she noted.</p> <p>Ian Pearson, the author of Society Tomorrow: Growing Older in 21st Century Britain, said the disparity between live births and fertility rates could be explained by larger families in some groups, especially younger migrants, while the wider population is ageing and increasingly reluctant to have children.</p> <p>He said: “Internationally, the UK is following the same trajectory as most wealthy countries: fertility peaks at lower levels of development, then declines as education, prosperity and women’s autonomy rise. Unless childcare, housing and long-term stability are addressed, we should expect the fertility rate to remain low or even fall further, rather than bounce back.”</p> <p>Politicians have been voicing concerns about the falling birthrate, in particular over the question of how a decreasing number of people of working age can support an ever increasing number of pensioners. In July, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the falling birthrate had “worrying repercussions” and that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/30/falling-birthrate-bridget-phillipson-education-secretary-labour">she hoped to</a> be able to make it easier for women to have children.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 3 September 2025 to clarify that the suggestion that mothers tend to leave larger gaps between their first and second children than for subsequent children came from the ONS’s analysis of these statistics along with historical data.</p>
