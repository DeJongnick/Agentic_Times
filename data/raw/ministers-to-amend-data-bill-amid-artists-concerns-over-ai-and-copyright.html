<p>Ministers have drawn up concessions on copyright changes in an attempt to appease artists and creators before a crucial vote in parliament next week, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The government will promise to carry out an economic impact assessment of its proposed copyright changes and to publish reports on issues including transparency, licensing and access to data for AI developers.</p> <p>The concessions are designed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/25/why-are-creatives-fighting-uk-government-ai-proposals-on-copyright">mollify concerns in parliament and in creative industries</a> about the government’s proposed shake-up of copyright rules.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/25/paul-mccartney-says-change-in-law-over-ai-could-rip-off-artists">Artists including Paul McCartney</a> and Tom Stoppard have thrown their weight behind a campaign against the changes in a series of high-level interventions. Elton John said the reforms rode “roughshod over the traditional copyright laws that protect artists’ livelihoods”.</p> <p>Ministers want to allow AI companies to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/17/uk-proposes-letting-tech-firms-use-copyrighted-work-to-train-ai">use copyrighted works to train their models without permission</a>, unless the copyright holder opts out of the process. Creatives say that this favours AI companies and want them to follow current copyright laws.</p> <p>The government’s commitments will be made in amendments to the data bill, which has become a vehicle for campaigners against the changes and is due to return to the Commons on Wednesday next week.</p> <p>The move has already been dismissed by critics. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/11/uk-copyright-law-consultation-fixed-favour-ai-firms-peer-says">Beeban Kidron, the cross-bench peer and campaigner</a>, said ministers’ amendments did not “meet the moment” and the Liberal Democrats said they would table their own changes forcing AI companies to follow existing copyright law.</p> <p>Ed Newton-Rex, a British composer and prominent campaigner against the government proposals, said there was a “ton of evidence” showing the mooted changes were “terrible for creators”. He added: “We don’t need an impact assessment to tell us this.”</p> <p>Ahead of next week’s vote Peter Kyle, the science and technology secretary, has sought to build bridges with the creative industry.</p> <p>At a meeting with music industry figures this week, Kyle acknowledged that his focus on meeting the tech industry had angered creatives. Kyle has come under fire for holding more than two dozen meetings with the tech sector during his first months in office but none with the creative sector.</p> <p>Kyle has also aggravated critics by arguing in meetings that unless the UK reforms its copyright system, AI companies will base themselves in other countries such as Saudi Arabia. No 10 aides made the argument at a meeting with MPs in Downing Street this week.</p> <p>Government sources argue that AI companies are already basing themselves elsewhere and that unless the UK changes its laws, creatives could end up in a position where they have no way to challenge the use of their material by companies abroad.</p> <p>A government source said ministers were not set on the opt-out system and were “looking much more broadly and are more open-minded”.</p> <p>But a Labour MP said ministers were “giving in to US tech with no credible substantive proven job numbers in return. At best it’s substitution and outsourcing, at worst it’s total cannibalisation.”</p> <p>Lady Kidron, who has successfully passed amendments to the data bill in the Lords battling the government’s reforms, said that “pushing the issue into the long grass with reports and reviews does not meet the moment”.</p> <p>“The question I would ask government is: why it is not protecting UK property rights, why it is not recognising the growth potential of UK creative and innovative business, and why it has not heeded UK AI companies who say the government is privileging US and Chinese-based companies at the expense of our own?”</p> <p>James Frith, a Labour member of the culture, media and sport select committee who sponsored a debate on the changes this month, said: “The mission for creative industries cannot mean creative industry submission. Creative industries must not be expected to forfeit legal rights for uncertainty.”</p> <p>Kidron’s amendments, which sought to subject AI companies to UK copyright law wherever they are based, were taken out in the Commons but the Liberal Democrats are planning to reintroduce them next week.</p> <p>The Lib Dem amendments include requiring developers of AI models – the technology underpinning AI systems such as chatbots – to comply with UK copyright law and to make clear what copyrighted material has been ingested by those models while they were being developed.</p> <p>The Lib Dem changes also call for transparency on what web crawlers have been used by AI companies, referring to the technology that hoovers up data from the internet to be used by AI models.</p> <p>Victoria Collins, the Lib Dem technology spokesperson, said: “An economic impact assessment should be the bare minimum creatives can expect.</p> <p>“We’ll be pushing to stop AI copyright law from being watered down in the Commons next week, and urge MPs to stand with us and back British creators.”</p>
