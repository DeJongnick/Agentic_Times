<h2>London City show progress in defeat</h2> 
<p>If Jocelyn Prêcheur needed an example of how far his London City Lionesses team have come in a few weeks, it was Saturday’s encounter against Chelsea. It ended in a 2-0 defeat to the champions but his side impressed at Stamford Bridge and asked several questions of their opponents. London City controlled 43% of possession – perhaps more than expected – and managed the same number of shots on target (three), with Isobel Goodwin providing a particular threat running in behind. “When we compare it to September when we played other top-four opposition, it was really good,” Prêcheur said. “What I like is that we start to see a team – [that] was my biggest challenge. We saw a team that defended and attacked together. We still need to improve.” <strong>SD</strong></p>

</ul> 
<h2>Liverpool ‘will keep fighting’</h2> 
<p>Liverpool’s head coach, Gareth Taylor, issued a rallying call to his side as the wait for their first points continues. After another defeat, this time 2-1 at the hands of Tottenham, he said: “We have to battle through it. The message is clear. We’re working so hard to turn this into a better situation but it takes a bit of time and a bit of support. Unfortunately, at the moment, we’re getting knocked with it, but we will keep fighting.” On the face of it, it was an even encounter at Brisbane Road – similar possession, expected goals and chances created – but after taking an early lead, the visitors played without any real bite as Spurs mounted a comeback. It was another concerning example of the Reds’ tendency to fall away in matches, surely the priority for Taylor to fix if he is to turn their fortunes around. <strong>SD</strong></p>

<h2>Kirby and Seike plug Agyemang gap</h2> 
<p>Brighton proved they can cope without their on-loan striker Michelle Agyemang, despite losing to Manchester United. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/30/michelle-agyemang-injury-acl-rupture-england-arsenal-brighton">Agyemang was ruled out for the season</a> last week after sustaining a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament playing for England. There was some concern about how Brighton would cope but Fran Kirby and Kiko Seike proved they are more than capable of making up the goals by scoring in the 3-2 defeat. “We responded quite well to start,” Brighton’s head coach, Dario Vidosic, said. “[We] got better into the game, we got our pressure better. More positive, again. We could have scored a couple more goals in the second half. Against a very good defensive team, to have all the opportunities we did today was good, but we need to be much better.” <strong>EH</strong></p>

    <p><b>Manchester United</b> remain unbeaten in the Women’s Super League this season after a 3-2 win over <b>Brighton</b>.&nbsp;Elisabeth Terland found the bottom corner to fire United ahead and Jess Park doubled their advantage after the break, but the Seagulls threatened a comeback when Fran Kirby struck.&nbsp;Park then provided the assist for Lisa Naalsund in the 89th minute and United held on after Kiko Seike scored in stoppage time.&nbsp;Marc Skinner’s side are now third in the table, two points behind the leaders, Chelsea, and have won five out of seven league games this season, while Brighton slipped to a third straight WSL defeat.</p>
    <p>Stina Blackstenius scored twice as <b>Arsenal</b> secured a 4-1 victory over <b>Leicester</b>. The England striker Alessia Russo opened the scoring with a low strike in the seventh minute before two goals in quick succession wrapped the game up, with Sari Kees turning the ball into her own net and Blackstenius scored four minutes later. Noémie Mouchon pulled one back for Leicester in the 83rd minute, but 60 seconds later Blackstenius scored her second for Arsenal to record a third straight win in all competitions.</p>
    <p>Kelly Gago scored a last-gasp stoppage-time equaliser for <b>Everton</b> in a 3-3 draw with <b>Aston Villa</b>. Gago had put the visitors ahead at Villa Park before Georgia Mullett levelled with her first Villa goal and Kirsty Hanson put them in front in the 59th minute. Hikaru Kitagawa levelled for Everton, but Villa quickly retook the lead from a Ruby Mace own goal. The hosts looked set for the win until Gago snatched a point with her second of the game in the fourth added minute. <b>PA Media</b></p>

<h2>Skinner takes positives after loss at City</h2> 
<p>Rehanne Skinner could take positives from West Ham’s performance against Manchester City, despite a 1-0 defeat. Although her team, bottom on goal difference, have yet to earn a point, they took a positive approach and did not shy away from attacking City. A lack of ruthlessness proved to be West Ham’s downfall at the Joie Stadium but it is a matter of time before they get a positive result. “We’re disappointed we’ve not taken something out of it, and after all the minutes the players have had over the international break the attitude and desire from the players [was great], and the resilience as well,” Skinner said. “We’ve got to turn things around.” <strong>EH</strong></p> 
<h2>Everton avoid self-sabotage with Gago double</h2> 
<p>A 94th-minute leveller by Kelly Gago saved Everton’s blushes as they shared the points in a six-goal thriller at Aston Villa. The French forward opened the scoring with her first goal of the season after a strong Everton start. Villa equalised just before half-time. The second half was end-to-end, as each side took advantage of the other’s porous defence. An unfortunate own goal by Ruby Mace swung the pendulum Villa’s way, putting them 3-2 up, but Gago came to Everton’s rescue after Brian Sørenson’s side had failed to capitalise on several chances. Everton’s run without a WSL win now stands at six matches. <strong>RO</strong></p> 
<h2>Duo’s magic helps Arsenal find spark</h2> 
<p>Arsenal recorded their third consecutive win in all competitions as Stina Blackstenius scored twice and Alessia Russo added another in a 4-1 thumping of Leicester. It was a second start of the season for Blackstenius, who set up Russo to put Arsenal ahead, then, after a Sari Kees own goal, ended her five-game drought with two goals of her own. Arsenal have looked far from title contenders but a first-half rampage by Russo and Blackstenius caused havoc and unleashed the slick and audacious Arsenal that most people expect given the team’s calibre. “We had some new partnerships on the pitch today as well, so that needs to click,” said head coach, Renée Slegers, “but I think it did really well, especially in the first half.” <strong>RO</strong></p>
