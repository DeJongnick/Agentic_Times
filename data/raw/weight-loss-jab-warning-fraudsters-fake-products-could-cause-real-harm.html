<p>You have heard and read so much about people using weight loss injections to get slim, you feel it is time to give it a go in the run-up to the festive season. The problem is cost.</p> <p>But it seems there are other options rather than getting a prescription from a doctor and going to the pharmacy. A text message arrives giving a link to a site with much cheaper medication – and with no need to go through official channels. And you saw a similar ad on social media the other day, so you decide to go for it.</p> <p>The problem is these ads are almost certainly scams. In the best-case scenario, you will be sent nothing and lose whatever money you paid. In the worst, you receive a fake version, with unknown ingredients that could lead to severe health problems.</p> <p>The popularity of legitimate weight loss medications has led to a rise in fake goods hitting the market and scams set up to simply take people’s money.</p> <p>The UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has warned against buying these illegal weight loss medicines without a prescription from beauty salons, fake pharmacy websites or via social media, saying they could contain “toxins and other ingredients that could cause real harm”.</p> <p>New figures from the high street bank Santander show a sharp rise in the number of customers who have been affected by the fraud. The bank says the amount of money lost to scams involving weight loss injections, pens, tablets and fat-dissolving products between July and September this year, was more than double the total sum stolen in the previous three months. The average scam costs victims £120, it says.</p> <p>“Fraudsters are actively exploiting people’s insecurities and health concerns, with these scams soaring in recent months,” says Michelle Pilsworth, the bank’s head of fraud.</p> <h2><strong>What it looks like</strong></h2> <p>Most take place on messaging apps and social media. On socials, an account may mimic the brand that you are looking for, but there will typically be subtle differences in spelling or logos.</p> <p>The messages or posts will often use urgency-laden phrases such as “limited-time offer”, “exclusive deal” or “free giveaway”.</p> <p>As the price of some legitimate weight loss jabs, such as Mounjaro, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/gutted-uk-users-of-weight-loss-jab-mounjaro-devastated-by-planned-price-hike">has increased</a> recently, the fraudsters will price their “product” lower.</p> <p>“Buying from unverified sellers online can come at a serious financial, health-related and emotional cost,” says Pilsworth.</p> <h2><strong>What to do</strong></h2> <p>As with all scams, the old adage applies: if it appears too good to be true, then it probably is.</p> <p>The MHRA has warned people to be extremely cautious when buying medicines online. They should only be obtained from a registered pharmacy using a prescription issued by a healthcare professional, it says. If sourced elsewhere, they may pose serious risks to health.</p> <p>Criminals can go to great lengths to make their site or social media page look as authentic as possible. If they <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-medicines-regulator-warns-against-buying-weight-loss-medicines-without-a-prescription-this-new-year">claim to be an online pharmacy</a> based in Great Britain, you can check the website of the <a href="https://www.pharmacyregulation.org/">General Pharmaceutical Council</a> (GPhC) to ensure this is properly registered.</p>
