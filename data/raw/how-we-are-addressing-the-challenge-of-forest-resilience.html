<p>Alastair Collier is right to point out that to build forests that can withstand future conditions, we must invest in resilience from the outset (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/17/britains-forests-need-help-to-adapt-to-the-changing-climate">Letters, 17 July</a>). At Forestry England, forest resilience is our most critical challenge. We must ensure the nation’s 1,500 forests in our care can withstand and adapt to the threats facing them, including climate change, biodiversity loss, extreme weather, and pests and diseases.</p> <p>We are doing this by planning 100 years ahead in the way we manage these beautiful places, which are home to some of the UK’s rarest wildlife. For example, based on rigorous scientific analysis, we have identified the top 30 tree species that will thrive in future environments. This is guiding our investment in our tree nursery and is helping us to ensure that the right tree is in the right place, both today and in the future.</p> <p>The benefits of the nation’s forests are enormous, from storing carbon and mitigating floods to supporting our health and wellbeing. They are an unsurpassed national asset. As their custodians, we are putting forest resilience at the heart of everything we do. The future will look and feel very different to today. Building forest resilience is our opportunity to make sure the nation’s forests continue to evolve, adapt, welcome people and contribute to a sustainable economy.<br><strong>Mike Seddon<br></strong><em>Chief executive, Forestry England</em></p>
