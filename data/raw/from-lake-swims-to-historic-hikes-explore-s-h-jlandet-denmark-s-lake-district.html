<p>If being near water is your idea of heaven, Denmark’s very own Lake District, Søhøjlandet, is the ultimate jewel-green retreat. This region of immense natural beauty provides an idyllic backdrop to all kinds of outdoor adventures, from kayaking and paddleboarding to swimming and fishing. What’s more, it’s one of Denmark’s most elevated geographical areas, with much of it covered by natural woodland – perfect for mountain biking or hiking through undulating forest trails.</p> <h2>Discover Denmark’s ‘outdoor capital’</h2> <p>Located in Jutland, in the middle of Denmark, the Lake District Søhøjlandet is easily reached from the nearby city of Aarhus, yet a world away from the bustle of everyday life. Make <a href="https://www.visitaarhus.com/areas-and-cities/silkeborg?utm_campaign=uk_645_outdoor_2025&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_content=silkeborg" rel="nofollow">Silkeborg</a> your hub – the picturesque town sits in the centre of the region and is Denmark’s official “outdoor capital”. Here you can combine culture, shopping and Danish hospitality alongside forays into the hinterland for more energetic pursuits.</p> <p>And if you’re not inclined towards an awfully big adventure, Silkeborg itself has its own “<a href="https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus-region/plan-your-trip/silk-route-through-silkeborg-gdk1122987?utm_campaign=uk_645_outdoor_2025&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_content=silk_route" rel="nofollow">Silk Route</a>”, taking visitors past the colourful buildings of the old town to forest paths and lakeside beaches on a 7.5-mile circular trail. Tackle it all at once or in sections, stopping off at key attractions, such as the <a href="https://visitaqua.dk/?utm_campaign=uk_645_outdoor_2025&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_content=aqua_aquarium_wildlifepark" rel="nofollow">Aqua Aquarium and Wildlife Park</a> or <a href="https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus-region/plan-your-trip/paper-museum-museum-silkeborg-gdk604627?utm_campaign=uk_645_outdoor_2025&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_content=the_paper_museum" rel="nofollow">The Paper Museum</a>, where you can discover the history of the old mill that helped establish Silkeborg in the 19th century.</p>    <p>Of course, it’s the surrounding waterways that are Silkeborg’s main attraction, with the abundant lakes connected by <a href="https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus-region/see-and-do/gudena-river?utm_campaign=uk_645_outdoor_2025&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_content=gudenaen" rel="nofollow">the Gudenåen</a> – at 100 miles it’s Denmark’s longest river. <a href="https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus-region/plan-your-trip/lyngso-city-lake-heart-silkeborg-gdk1140957?utm_campaign=uk_645_outdoor_2025&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_content=lyngso" rel="nofollow">Lyngsø</a>, an urban lake formed by an ice age depression, is a top spot for freshwater swimming and fishing, and covers an impressive 9.7 hectares, meaning you’ll always find a tranquil spot to call your own. At nearby <a href="https://www.visitaarhus.com/aarhus-region/plan-your-trip/almindso-paradise-water-lovers-lake-district-gdk604822?utm_campaign=uk_645_outdoor_2025&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_source=guardian&amp;utm_content=almindso" rel="nofollow">Almindsø</a>, you can enjoy one of two main bathing pools, each encircled by wooden platforms – just perfect for jumping in and making a splash.
