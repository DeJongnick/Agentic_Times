<p>If a driver makes an illegal U-turn, but no one is behind the wheel, does the car still get a ticket? A police department in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> grappled with this existential question last week.</p> <p>During a DUI enforcement operation, officers in San Bruno pulled over a car without anyone behind the wheel after the autonomous vehicle made an illegal U-turn at a light. A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sanbrunopolice/posts/pfbid02bxuVSm8Wjr8tzpGf8916Y6Auxaq3q4CMDHkfeBdHbcMDUx9oEQKPQWJ6FdrQiTuNl">post</a> by the San Bruno police department on Saturday shows an officer looking into a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/waymo">Waymo</a> – the leading autonomous ride-hailing vehicle in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> Bay Area – after stopping the signature white car.</p> <p>“Since there was no human driver, a ticket couldn’t be issued (our citation books don’t have a box for “robot”),” reads the post.</p> <p>The department said that it had alerted Waymo of the glitch, and that “hopefully the reprogramming will keep it from making any more illegal moves”.</p> <p>In a statement, Waymo said that the company’s autonomous driving system, the Waymo Driver, “is designed to respect the rules of the road.</p> <p>“We are looking into this situation and are committed to improving road safety through our ongoing learnings and experience,” reads a statement sent to the Guardian.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/06/man-trapped-waymo-los-angeles">LA tech entrepreneur nearly misses flight after getting trapped in robotaxi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year, California governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1777">signed into law a bill</a> that allows police officers to issue a “notice of noncompliance” if a driverless car breaks traffic laws. The law goes into effect in July 2026. The law also requires companies to set up an emergency phone line for first responders.</p> <p>The bill was introduced by assemblymember Phil Ting of San Francisco amid several incidents in the city, including driverless cars blocking traffic, dragging a pedestrian, interfering with firetrucks, and entering active crime scenes.</p> <p>With the new law, first responders can order a company to move autonomous vehicles out of an area, and the company has two minutes to direct its cars to leave or avoid that area.</p> <p>The San Bruno police department, in response to people who believed officers were being lenient, reaffirmed: “There is legislation in the works that will allow officers to issue the company notices.”</p> <p>Waymo cars, which launched as a project under Google’s X research lab in 2009, operate through external cameras and sensors. The company has had its share of problems in the past, including a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/alphabets-waymo-recalls-over-1200-vehicles-after-collisions-with-roadway-2025-05-14/">recall of more</a> than 1,200 of its vehicles earlier this year over a software issue that was causing collisions with chains, gates and other stationary roadway barriers. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-safety-probe-into-waymo-self-driving-vehicles-finds-more-incidents-2024-05-24/">launched an investigation</a> into the company last year after the agency received 22 reports of Waymo vehicles acting erratically or potentially violating traffic safety laws.</p>
