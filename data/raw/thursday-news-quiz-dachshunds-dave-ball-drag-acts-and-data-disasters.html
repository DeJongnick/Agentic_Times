<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-10-30T11:00:54Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p>Once upon a time the Thursday quiz got into a spat online with someone complaining that featuring the official dog of the quiz was irksome and twee. Look away now, sir – because it’s one of everybody’s favourite weeks of the year: Willow week! Our adorable but very naughty miniature dachshund has 15 vaguely topical and general knowledge questions in store, each accompanied by a cute picture of herself. There are no prizes, but you can let us know how you got on in the comments. <em>Allons-y!</em></p>

    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:C - The independent pledged to be ‘president for all’ after taking 63% of vote, 2:B - The cameo will be on-screen in a drag production of Wicked Witches, 3:A - The ad boasted the lift could carry 'up to 400kg of treasures at 42m per minute – as quiet as a whisper'. That mirror in the photo could do with a clean, eh?, 4:B - 🎶 Standing in the door of the Pink Flamingo, crying in the rain 🎶 – the Thursday quiz thanks you, Dave, for all the great music and concerts over the years, 5:C - The statue will be unveiled on 17 November and joins a number of others portraying icons of cinema in Leicester Square, none of which are a very naughty miniature dachshund, 6:A - It appeared to be a DF-61, a new Chinese-made land-based ICBM capable of carrying nuclear weapons, which was unveiled at a military parade last month, and maybe not suited to the so-called 'kiss and cry' area where skaters sit waiting for their marks, 7:A - Officials have claimed it is essential to protect the state’s already diminished wetlands and native waterfowl, but the swans disagree. The English sparrow and the starling are also on the state's kill list of invasive species, 8:B - The affected pupils instead learned about his nephew Augustus, or Brian Blessed as British television viewers of a certain age will always picture him, 9:C - The poet and ardent Pink Floyd fan was approached by the group to write a new piece about the record and has produced a sprawling piece with no punctuation which sounds exactly like the kind of thing the Thursday quiz does not enjoy. A bit like Pink Floyd, 10:D - Mr Poirot and Little Miss Marple, themed on Christie's characters, will feature in the books for some reason. Presumably money, 11:D - The patrol was not impressed, 12:D - The show ran from 1965 to 1968, well before Willow was born, 13:B - Teenagers, eh?, 14:B - No, the Thursday quiz doesn't know what that means either, and couldn't be bothered to look it up, 15:C - It has been going slightly longer than the revival of Doctor Who</p>
