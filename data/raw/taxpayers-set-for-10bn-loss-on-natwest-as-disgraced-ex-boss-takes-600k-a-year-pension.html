<p>Fred “the Shred” Goodwin, the disgraced ex-boss of Royal Bank of Scotland, is estimated to be receiving an annual pension worth nearly £600,000, as the government prepares to declare a £10bn loss after selling its final stake in the bank as early as this week.</p> <p>The banking group, now known as NatWest, is expected to return to full private ownership within days, drawing a line under a £45bn state bailout that saved the bank from the brink of collapse at the height of the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>The 17-year effort to off-load the government’s 84% stake in the lender has come at a substantial cost to the public purse, with the government expected to fall short of recouping its financial support.</p> <p>Shares have only recently pushed past their pre-financial crisis levels – closing at 524p on Friday – but the bulk of the government’s shares have been below the 502p at which they were bought. It means the government could end up recovering roughly £35bn of the original £45bn spent on the rescue package in 2008, marking a near-£10bn loss.</p> <p>Meanwhile, yearly payouts have soared for Goodwin, the boss blamed for helping push the bank to its near-collapse.</p> <p>The former RBS chief executive, who was sacked as part of a non-negotiable condition of the state rescue, originally walked away with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/26/sir-fred-goodwin-pension">£16m pension pot that paid out about £700,000 a year</a>. But public outrage forced Goodwin and the bank to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/jun/18/rbs-sir-fred-goodwin-pension">halve those payouts to £342,500 a year</a>.</p> <p>However, after nearly two decades, an agreement that linked his payouts to the rate of inflation has pushed that figure ever-closer to the original sum. The bank is now spending about £598,000 a year on Goodwin’s pension nearly 17 years after the bailout, according to estimates by wealth manager Quilter shared with the Guardian.</p> <p>NatWest Group declined to comment. The Guardian was not able to reach Goodwin for comment.</p> <p>Goodwin’s excessive spending on a string of acquisitions, private jets, and a sprawling £350m campus in Edinburgh, were criticised for leaving RBS without sufficient financial buffers that could have helped the bank to ride out the credit crunch hit in 2008.</p> <p>Goodwin was widely known to be a ruthless boss, earning his nickname “Fred the Shred” for making harsh cuts to his workforce amid his expansion efforts. That included a decision to slash 18,000 jobs after RBS’ flashy £21bn takeover of NatWest in 2000, one of the largest cost-cutting exercises in banking at the time.</p> <p>By the time of the bailout, Goodwin had expanded RBS into 50 countries and grown its assets to £2.2tn – more than double the size of the UK economy that year. Had the government failed to step in, shock waves from the bank’s implosion in 2008 could have led to a systemic collapse in the wider economy.</p> <p>The government was concerned that its failure could wipe out the savings of everyday customers, and prompt panic about the health of other lenders across the UK, creating a domino effect of failures across the industry.</p> <p>The bank’s eventual emergency rescue made Goodwin – now 66 years old – a lightning rod for public anger over the cost of bank bailouts, which led to years of government austerity that many blame for hollowing out public services across the country.</p> <p>Goodwin was also slow to say sorry for the record-breaking losses that he left behind at the centuries-old bank. He was later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/31/fred-goodwin-stripped-of-knighthood">stripped of his knighthood in 2012</a>, amid concerns that he had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jan/31/fred-goodwin-stripped-of-knighthood">“had brought the honours system in to disrepute”.</a></p> <p>The government has spent nearly two decades trying to take the bank off the public books, through a combination of sales to institutional investors and a drip-feeding of shares into the open market. NatWest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/28/natwest-buys-back-shares-uk-government-rbs">fast-tracked the process</a> through multibillion-pound share buy-backs, helping the stake drop from 38% in December 2023 to 0.9% earlier this month.</p> <p>NatWest’s current chair, Rick Haythornthwaite, said last month the bank was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/23/natwest-chair-thanks-uk-taxpayers-for-bailout-ahead-of-return-to-private-ownership">indebted to the public for keeping the lender afloat</a>.</p> <p>“We remain incredibly grateful to the government, and to UK taxpayers, for their intervention and support, which protected millions of savers, homeowners and businesses at a time of global crisis,” he said at the bank’s AGM in Edinburgh.</p> <p>He added the government was always expected to lose money on the bailout. “I don’t think they ever went into this is an investment … This was a rescue of a sector, and they did well as a result.”</p>
