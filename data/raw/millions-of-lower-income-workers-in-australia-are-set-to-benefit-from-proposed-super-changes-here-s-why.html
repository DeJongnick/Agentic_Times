<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/13/superannuation-tax-rules-albanese-treasurer-chalmers-labor-announces-surprise-backdown">big news</a> this week has been around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/14/keating-praises-super-backdown-but-with-such-a-feeble-opposition-labor-should-spend-more-political-capital">Labor’s capitulation</a> on key aspects of its proposed extra tax on the tens of thousands of Australians with massive super balances.</p> <p>That’s meant another policy announcement has flown more under the radar, despite the fact that it will affect millions more workers.</p> <p>That announcement was the change to the low-income super tax offset.</p>  <h2>What is Listo?</h2>  <p>The low-income super tax offset, or Listo, as it’s known, is designed to boost the super balances of workers on low incomes.</p> <p>It’s also there to make sure that Australians don’t pay more tax on their super contributions than they do on their wages.</p> <p>The deal is people get a 15% concessional tax rate on the money they put into their retirement savings, in return for not being able to touch it until they reach retirement age.</p> <p>At the moment, if you earn $37,000 or less a year and you or your employer pay super on your behalf, then the tax office refunds up to $500 to your super account.</p> <aside class="element

– but with such a feeble opposition, Labor should spend more political capital</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Without the Listo, somebody earning $15,000 a year would not pay income tax on their wages, but would pay 15% on their super contributions. </p> <p>With Listo, that $270 in super contributions tax is refunded to your super account.</p> <h2>Will the super changes affect me?</h2>  <p>Under the updated better targeted super concessions bill, the $37,000 Listo threshold will be increased to $45,000 to match the second income tax bracket.</p> <p>The refund will also be increased to up to $810.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The introduction of the updated Listo is timed to coincide with the reduction in the lowest tax rate to 14% in mid-2027.</p> <p>Treasury estimates that in 2027-28 an extra 770,000 people will be eligible for Listo, and 490,000 will get a higher payment.</p> <p>Treasury also estimates 1.3 million Australians will benefit from changes, bringing the total number of people eligible for the low-income super tax offset to 3.1 million.</p> <p>That’s compared to just 90,000 affected by the proposed extra tax on earnings from balances over $3m.</p> <h2>So why are they increasing the Listo?</h2>  <p>The problem is that the low-income super tax offset hasn’t changed in eight years.</p> <p>That’s led to millions of people missing out on the tax benefits they deserve, according to the Super Members Council (SMC, the lobby group for industry super funds).</p> <p>The payment cap of $500 is based on a 9% super guarantee rate, against the current rate of 12%. </p> <p>Similarly, the eligibility threshold of $37,000 has not been increased since the second income tax bracket was lifted to $45,000 in 2020-21.</p> <p>No wonder, then, that the super industry has long lobbied for a change to Listo.</p> <aside class="element

superannuation tax plan as Greens call move ‘gift to the super-rich’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They have pointed out that a cleaner earning $42,000 a year only gets a 1% concession on their super contributions, while a boss on $220,000 gets a 30% concession.</p> <p>The situation was about to get worse when Labor’s next income tax cut starts in mid-2027, when the lowest tax rate would drop to 14% (so below the 15% super rate).</p> <p>The SMC has calculated that would have meant one in four workers would be paying a higher tax rate on their super than on their wages.</p> <p>“Workers will be financially penalised for putting aside savings for their future – the opposite of what was intended,” the Super Members Council said.</p> <h2>Why haven’t we been talking about Listo before now?</h2>  <p>Treasury estimates that those affected by the boosted Listo will get an average extra $410, and could end up retiring with an extra $15,000 in the super accounts (that’s after accounting for inflation).</p> <p>It will cost the budget $430m in its first full year, compared to about $2bn raised from lifting the tax rate on earnings on balances over $3m.</p> <p>Xavier O’Halloran, the chief executive of Super Consumers Australia, says the super system <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/13/jim-chalmers-labor-superannuation-tax-policy-fairer-system-not-enough">needs more than tweaks</a>.</p> <p>“These changes nudge the system in a fairer direction. But they don’t address the root problem,” O’Halloran says.</p> <p>“The system still gives too big a leg-up in the form of tax concessions to people who don’t need it to live a comfortable retirement.”</p> <p>Ben Phillips, an associate professor at the Australian National University, agrees.</p> <p>The Listo changes “might mean a few extra thousand dollars in retirement, which is not to be sneezed at,” Philips says.</p> <p>“It’s a good thing to do as it tidies up an issue with the tax system.</p> <p>“But I would also argue we could do more with super taxation. If we want better age pensions in the future, better services and a better NDIS, then it’s disappointing we haven’t done better to increase tax on super.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
