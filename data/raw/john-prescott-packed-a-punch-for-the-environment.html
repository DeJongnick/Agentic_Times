<p>John Prescott (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/21/lord-prescott-john-prescott-obituary">Obituary, 21 November</a>) punched above his weight in more ways than one. In the outdoor movement we owe him for at least three major victories. The first is the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. John, as environment secretary, pushed through Labour’s manifesto promise, giving us a vital measure of freedom to roam.</p> <p>The second and third were two new national parks, the New Forest and the South Downs, which John, bursting through official sloth, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1999/sep/29/labourconference.labour9">announced at the Labour party conference</a> on 29 September 1999. This marked the 50th anniversary of Labour’s great National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act: John knew that designating these parks was a fitting way to keep the postwar ideal alive.</p> <p>This year, on 16 December, it will be the 75th anniversary of the 1949 act, and we have a Labour government once more. How will it mark the occasion? We wait to hear. It’s not too late to follow up John Prescott’s punch with a new deal for our splendid landscapes and people’s ability to enjoy them.<br><strong>Kate Ashbrook</strong><br><em>The Open Spaces Society</em></p> <p>• Among John Prescott’s many achievements was his role in convening the water summit on 19 May 1997. This was only a few weeks after the Labour party’s victory in the general election. His&nbsp;initiative should not be forgotten, especially at a time when the privatised water companies are yet again in the spotlight. Hansard records that Prescott gave the companies three weeks to reply to 10 points about how water could be used more efficiently and how leakages could be reduced. Can we expect this government and the regulators to act with such urgency?<br><strong>Ben Piper</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>• I appreciated the coverage of John Prescott’s life and career, but why was there no mention of his <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/tv/watch-john-prescott-makes-cameo-appearance-in-gavin-and-stacey-as-nessa%E2%80%99s-ex-lover/vi-AA1uutkU#details">guest appearance</a> at Nessa’s wedding in Gavin and Stacey? His&nbsp;“Hi, Dave. Congratulations” was perfectly pitched.<br><strong>Ruth Blunt</strong><br><em>Northolt, </em><em>London</em></p> <p>• Seldom has a British political figure left such an indelible impression on me as the indomitable John Prescott. Looking at his many wonderful and humorous dispatches from Westminster, you could only feel connected and inspired. Larger than life and never short of words or wit, he will be remembered fondly as a politician who made a difference to many. The world of politics could do with more of his kind.<br><strong>Aidan Roddy</strong><br><em>Dublin</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
