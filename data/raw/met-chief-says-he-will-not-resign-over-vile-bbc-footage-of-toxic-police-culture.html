<p>The Metropolitan police commissioner has said he will not resign after secretly filmed footage revealed racist, misogynistic and violent behaviour and views at a police station known for its toxic culture for more than three years.</p> 
<p>Sir Mark Rowley said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/01/met-plunged-into-crisis-amid-fresh-claims-of-bigotry-and-excessive-force">BBC Panorama</a> footage was “vile to watch” and that it showed “incontrovertible evidence” to support fast-track dismissal for the officers involved.</p> 
<p>Keir Starmer called on Rowley to demonstrate a “very robust” response to what he described as “shocking” footage.</p> 
<p>Rowley said the behaviour and views filmed at Charing Cross police station were “ghastly”. Speaking to LBC radio, he said: “Clearly there is racism, there’s misogyny. There’s relishing in using excess force. Some of the content from last night on its own would be enough to move officers to a fast-track misconduct hearing.”</p> 
<p>Later he told BBC Radio London that the Met was “on top” of the problem. He said: “We are doing everything we can to make the Met as strong and noble an organisation as it can be, and dealing with these toxic individuals who undermine us.”</p> 
<p>He refused to accept that the BBC’s undercover filming showed that the Met was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/21/metropolitan-police-institutionally-racist-misogynistic-homophobic-louise-casey-report">institutionally racist and misogynist</a>, as a review by Louise Casey found in 2023 after the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by one of its officers.</p> 
<p>He said: “The thing that’s going to make a difference is not words. The thing that makes a difference is the action.”</p> 
<p>A previous scandal at Charing Cross police station after officers shared racist, sexist, misogynistic and Islamophobic messages <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/10/dame-cressida-dick-to-stand-down-as-met-police-commissioner">contributed to the resignation of Rowley’s predecessor Cressida Dick</a>. When Rowley was appointed in July 2022 he promised to clean up the force.</p> 
<p>Challenged on how he could claim to be on top of the problem when a toxic culture at the station had again been exposed, Rowley said: “I’m on top of things because of all the people we have removed.” He said almost 1,500 officers had been expelled from the force in the last three years.</p> 
<p>He said: “We’re diving deep into the organisation to find these corrupt and toxic networks and cliques. We’re using counter-terrorism tactics and specialist data and an intelligence tool to identify and find them.”</p>

<p>Rowley added: “I’m not resigning. We’re partway through a determined effort. I’m proud of what our teams have done in terms of taking on these cancers within the organisation.”</p> 
<p>He said it was the toxic officers who wanted him to resign. Rowley said: “I’ve heard in the last few days … rumours the commissioner going. Those are the misogynist and racist [officers], frankly, who want me out because it’s them who we are taking on.</p> 
<p>“We are doing everything we can to make the Met as strong and noble an organisation as it can be and dealing with these toxic individuals who undermine us.”</p> 
<p>Nine serving officers, one former officer and one designated detention officer who is a civilian member of staff are all under investigation for gross misconduct by the Independent Office for Police Conduct.</p> 
<p>Allegations include excessive use of force, making discriminatory and misogynistic comments and failing to report or challenge inappropriate behaviour. One constable is facing a criminal investigation for allegedly perverting the course of justice.</p> 
<p>The BBC footage shows one officer, PC Phil Neilson, referring while off-duty to an immigrant who had overstayed his visa, saying: “Either put a bullet through his head or deport him. And the ones that shag women, rape women, you do the cock and let them bleed out.”</p> 
<p>While drinking at a pub, he also told the undercover reporter Rory Bibb that Algerians and Somalians were “scum” and made reference to there being an invasion of the UK by migrants.</p> 
<p>Another officer, PC Martin Borg, bragged about a colleague stamping on a detainee’s leg and laughed about the suspect screaming. He also appeared to say he had offered to fill in a false witness statement about the incident.</p>
