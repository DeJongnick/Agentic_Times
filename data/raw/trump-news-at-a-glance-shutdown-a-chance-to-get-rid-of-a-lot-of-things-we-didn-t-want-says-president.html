<p>Donald Trump has blamed Democrats for stalled talks that have made a US government shut down all but certain, and has threatened to punish the party and its voters during any stoppage by targeting progressive priorities and forcing mass public sector job cuts.</p> <p>Late on Tuesday Senate Democrats voted down a Republican bill to keep funding the government, putting it on a near certain path to a shutdown after midnight Wednesday for the first time in almost seven years. Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/28/democrats-government-shutdown-republican-healthcare-cuts">refused to vote for</a> the bill unless it included a series of concessions centred on healthcare.</p> <p>After the vote, the White House’s Office of Management and Budget issued a memo saying that “affected agencies should now execute their plans for an orderly shutdown.”</p> <p>“So we’d be laying off a lot of people that are going to be very affected. And they’re Democrats, they’re going to be Democrats,” Trump said at an earlier White House event. The president added that a “lot of good can come down from shutdowns” and suggested he would use the pause to “get rid of a lot of things we didn’t want, and they’d be Democrat things”.</p>  <h2>US heads toward first government shutdown in nearly seven years</h2>  <p>Trump on Tuesday said a government shutdown was “probably likely” after talks among congressional leaders on continuing funding appeared to yield little progress before a midnight deadline.</p> <p>Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/30/government-shutdown-healthcare-medicaid">are demanding an extension of premium tax credits</a> for Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans, which expire at the end of the year.
