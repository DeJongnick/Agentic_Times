<p>The family of Lindsay and Craig Foreman, a British couple <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/04/british-couple-held-in-iran-moved-to-separate-prisons-heightening-welfare-concerns">detained in Iran</a> on espionage charges, have said their health is deteriorating in prison.</p> <p>The pair, both 52 and who previously split their time between Spain and England, were seized in Kerman, central Iran, and taken into custody in January while on an around-the-world motorcycle tour.</p> <p>Iran said in February the Foremans were accused of entering the country “posing as tourists” to gather information. The couple, from East Sussex, deny the allegations.</p> <p>Lindsay’s son, Joe Bennett, said that the family have “real concerns” about the pair’s health, and that his mother has been on a drip in prison and Craig has had several illnesses including stomach bugs and the flu.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/05/son-of-british-woman-lindsay-foreman-held-in-iran-speaks-to-her-for-first-time-in-213-days">Son of British woman held in Iran speaks to her for first time in 213 days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking to BBC News, Bennett said: There are real concerns around my mum and Craig’s health.</p> <p>“Craig is constantly ill, multiple rounds of stomach bugs, flu, dental problems, without the correct medical care.</p> <p>“It’s to my understanding that my mum was on a drip last week. Unsure as to why, but obviously very, very concerning for us as a family.”</p> <p>This comes as the couple face court today in Iran, and the family said it is “deeply worrying” that the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) appears not to have been kept informed.</p> <p>Bennett told Sky News that the family was “anticipating to hear” any news after a court appearance, and “it might be seven to 10 days after today’s hearing” before they get an update.</p> <p>The family have known little about the couple’s whereabouts or condition throughout their detention, but last month learned through the Foreign Office that Lindsay has been transferred to Qarchak women’s prison near the capital.</p> <p>Human rights groups have repeatedly criticised the dire conditions reported at Qarchak prison.</p> <p>Craig was believed to have been moved to Tehran’s infamous central prison, also known as Fashafouyeh, which is about 30km (18 miles) south of the capital and has a similar reputation.</p> <p>The FCDO warns all British and British-Iranian nationals not to travel to Iran because of a “significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention”.</p> <p>A spokesperson said previously: “We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran. We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.</p> <p>“We are providing them with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members.”</p>
