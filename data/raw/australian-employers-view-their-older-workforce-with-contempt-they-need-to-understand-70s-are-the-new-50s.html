All this could mitigate ageing’s drag on growth.”</p> <p>Treasury’s intergenerational reports have increasingly focused the minds of Australians on the budget implications of an ageing population.</p> <p>As useful as these reports have been to inform the current debate around taxation reform, they may also have fed a narrative of drooling oldies who need to be propped through their autumn years by vibrant and athletic under-50s.</p> <p>If the IMF is right, that trite adage that “demography is destiny” is, to a large degree, wrong.</p> <p>As ever, our destiny is what we make of it.</p>
