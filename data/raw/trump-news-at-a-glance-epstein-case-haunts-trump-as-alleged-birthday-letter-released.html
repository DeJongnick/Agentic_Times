<p>Questions over his friendship with convicted sex offender, Jeffery Epstein, continue to haunt Donald Trump, this time with the release of a birthday letter that Trump had previously denied writing.</p> <p>An image of the birthday letter, the existence of which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal in July, was released by House Democrats after the House oversight committee received the 2003 “birthday book” from Epstein’s lawyers. It is dated three years before allegations of sex abuse by Epstein became public in 2006.</p> <p>The letter contains text of a purported dialogue between Trump and Epstein in which Trump calls him a “pal” and says, “May every day be another wonderful secret.” The text sits within a crude sketch of a silhouette of a naked woman.</p> <p>Trump has previously vehemently denied having written or illustrated the note, dismissing it as “a fake thing” and insisting “these are not my words, not the way I talk”.</p> <p>White House deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich denounced the release, saying the signature on the letter is not Trump’s while alluding to a <a
