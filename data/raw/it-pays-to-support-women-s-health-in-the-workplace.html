<p>The Keep Britain Working review has shed valuable light on the number of working-age adults in the UK falling out of work due to ill health (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/05/fixing-britains-worklessness-crisis-will-cost-employers-6bn-a-year-report-says">Fixing Britain’s worklessness crisis will cost employers £6bn a year, report says, 5 November</a>). As part of this, we should also specifically acknowledge the impact of women’s health issues and the role of employers in addressing these.</p> <p>In a report by the NHS Confederation in partnership with our foundation, we found that an estimated <a href="https://www.nhsconfed.org/publications/womens-health-economics">£11bn is lost annually</a> due to absenteeism for gynaecological conditions alone. And earlier this year, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T7CGizkqhPPSXX_lXpWP83vYjO5ITe86/view?pli=1">our research</a> found that 15% of women report having to change to part-time work and 14% have had to quit work due to women’s health conditions. Furthermore, 32% of women reported that they aren’t receiving enough support for their health issues from their employers.</p> <p>It is therefore essential that employers take action as a matter of urgency. For too long, women have faced persistent inequalities in their career aspirations, and a lack of support for reproductive health issues is one such barrier.</p> <p>It is positive to see that the review has highlighted the impact of ill health of the UK’s workforce, and its recommended investment from employers could prove transformational. We also welcome the government’s plans to renew the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-announces-womens-health-strategy-to-be-renewed">women’s health strategy</a>, which could provide employers with the guidelines they need to better support women’s health in the workplace. These two commitments together could truly boost the UK’s economy.<br><strong>Prof Geeta Nargund</strong><br><em>Founder, Create Health Foundation</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
