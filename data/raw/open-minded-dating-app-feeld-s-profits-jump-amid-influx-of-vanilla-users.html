<p>An influx of “vanilla” users helped the unconventional dating app Feeld post a jump in profits, as the company expanded its customer base beyond its original target market of people in open relationships and kink enthusiasts.</p> <p>Growth outside the UK, where Feeld was founded, helped increase sales by 26% to £48.9m in 2024, according to accounts filed at Companies House.</p> <p>The increase was slower than the previous year, when Feeld <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/08/throuples-dating-app-feeld-nearly-doubles-turnover-to-395m">doubled its revenues inside 12 months</a>.</p> <p>Despite rising costs from a ramp-up in marketing activity, the increase in revenues helped the business report pre-tax profit of £9.3m compared with £6m in 2023.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/06/nearly-a-third-of-bosses-report-increase-in-cyber-attacks-on-their-supply-chains">Nearly a third of bosses report increase in cyber-attacks on their supply chains </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Feeld was founded by the Bulgarian-born Dimo Trifonov in 2014 after he and his partner, Ana Kirova, both of whom were living in London, discussed opening up their relationship.</p> <p>The app aimed to serve people in a similar situation by offering a more open-minded alternative to established dating apps. One of them, Tinder, took umbrage at the app’s original name, 3nder (pronounced Thrinder) and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/23/tinder-sues-threesome-app-rival-3nder">deployed legal threats to force the company to change it</a>.</p> <p>Rebranded as Feeld, the company has catered for people looking for relationships or hookups with more than one person, as well as fetishists and people with alternative gender identities.</p> <p>As traditional apps have suffered a fall-off in users, Feeld has continued to grow, attracting people outside its original target market seduced by its racier image.</p> <p>Earlier this year Kirova <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/01/unconventional-dating-app-feeld-reports-surge-in-vanilla-tourists">acknowledged the challenge</a> of integrating new users with more conventional tastes – referred to as “vanilla” in the sex industry and kink community – with Feeld’s longstanding users.</p> <p>“I do think it’s a challenge that it’s becoming more mainstream in some ways,” she said.</p> <p>“How do we welcome people who’ve never heard of Feeld, who don’t understand the list of sexualities and genders [or] who don’t understand what ethical non-monogamy is?”</p> <p>However, the app’s rising popularity with monogamous singles seeking steady relationships has proved lucrative for Kirova and Trifonov.</p> <p>The accounts show that Feeld paid a dividend of £600,000 last year, the majority of which was paid to the pair, who own more than 50% of the company between them.</p> <p>Kirova, who became Feeld’s chief executive in April 2021, has led a rebranding exercise, as well as a technology upgrade that was initially beset with glitches.</p> <p>Last year, the Guardian reported that users of the app <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/17/dating-app-feeld-personal-data-cybersecurity">could have had sensitive data including messages, private photos and details of their sexuality accessed</a> or even edited, after cybersecurity experts exposed a string of security “vulnerabilities”.</p>
