<p>Former military leaders rightly point out that climate change is a matter of national security (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/29/national-security-definition-food-climate">UK must consider food and climate part of national security, say top ex-military figures, 29 May</a>). What is required in response is a thoughtful, strategic approach that focuses in on actions that are practical and effective in these difficult times and will help build the UK government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/missions/strong-foundations">“strong foundations” of national security and secure borders</a>.</p> <p>For example, arguably the biggest near-term threat to UK security is the “mass population displacement” that Lt Gen Richard Nugee refers to. About 3.5 billion people live in an arc around Europe, across Africa, the Middle East and Asian countries such as Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. People in these regions are already confronting floods and heatwaves of up to 50C that are making large areas uninhabitable. Rural communities are being forced into conflict and migration, while food production and supplies to cities are being affected.</p> <p>Russia has already identified this as a strategic way to undermine European democracies. It stokes conflict and weaponises people – for example, pushing a wave of 4&nbsp;million Syrian war refugees into Europe and Turkey. The payoff has been the rise of pro-Russian rightwing parties across Europe. With temperatures rising much faster than expected, this problem will accelerate during the present parliament. It requires immediate action as there’s no way to contain it.</p> <p>What can we do? The UK has a strong track record of using international aid to promote farming in these vulnerable communities. The best approach is regenerative farming, which produces food, builds resilience to extreme weather and draws carbon out of the atmosphere as it rebuilds soil health. It is a strategy for mitigating, and adapting to, climate change. We must salvage and expand this programme within the remaining aid and climate finance budget.</p> <p>It is essential to our national security that we fight climate change at home, through decarbonisation, and that we promote regenerative agriculture at home and in frontline countries around Europe.<br><strong>Dr Adam Parr</strong><br><em>Hertford College, University of Oxford</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
