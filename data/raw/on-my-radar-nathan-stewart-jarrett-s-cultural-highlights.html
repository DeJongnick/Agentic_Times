<p>Born in London in 1987, the actor Nathan Stewart-Jarrett studied at the Brit school and the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama. After early stage roles including <em>The History Boys</em> at the National Theatre, he was cast in E4’s <em>Misfits</em> and Channel 4’s <em>Utopia</em>. He starred in the 2017 National Theatre production of Tony Kushner’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/07/angels-in-america-review-nathan-lane-andrew-garfield-denise-gough">Angels in America</a></em>, as well as its Broadway transfer. He has appeared in films <em>Dom Hemingway</em>, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/aug/25/candyman-review-nia-dacosta-jordan-peele-horror">Candyman</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/dec/03/femme-review-unbearably-tense-queer-london-revenge-thriller">Femme</a></em>, for which he and George MacKay won a 2023 Bifa award for best joint lead performance. His TV roles include <em>Doctor Who</em> and <em>The Trial of Christine Keeler</em>. He stars in heist thriller <em>Culprits</em>, on ITVX from 19 December. </p> <h2><strong>1. </strong><strong>Film</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/sep/16/10">The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</a> (dir</strong><strong> Jacques Demy, 1964)</strong></p>    <p>When I first saw this, not long ago, it kind of broke me. I thought it was the most amazing, colourful thing in the world – it is a classic for a reason. It’s about two young people who fall in love: Catherine Deneuve works at an umbrella store, and Nino Castelnuovo is a mechanic. Then he goes off to war, and he doesn’t die, but something bad happens. It’s the most heartbreaking story for Christmas, but doesn’t everyone love a bit of a Christmas cry?</p> <h2><strong>2. </strong><strong>Art</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/mike-kelley-ghost-and-spirit?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=CAMP_mike_kelley&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgJa6BhCOARIsAMiL7V-Rzdcp5odNqigs-pwawWrTJjIKwrj1RFU0ys2GJTHvgjzCvk8iYAEaAuPmEALw_wcB">Mike Kelley: Ghost and Spirit, Tate Modern, until 9 March</a></strong></p>    <p>I didn’t really know anything about the artist but I thought this exhibition was really exciting – very political, very rebellious. He did a lot of performance art in New York, these crazy installations, but also monkeys with big butts and genitalia-like fruit. He had this idea that adolescence is like a poltergeist taking over your body, which I thought was a cool conceit. I liked the sense of humour and his grungy take on things, the way he stuck it to the man: it made me think that maybe now art and commerce are too closely aligned.</p>    <h2><strong>3. </strong><strong>Book</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-racket-9781844886401/">The Racket by Conor Niland</a></strong></p> <p>I’m obsessed with tennis. [Former player] Conor Niland has written a book about the highs and lows of failure – I’m not saying he’s a failure, but I think it is somewhat a study in failure. He got to 129th in the world, but he wanted to be the best Irish player in the Open era, and he was. I thought it was really interesting to write a book about missing the moment, not being the person you know you can be, and sometimes just having a string of bad luck. I’m an actor, so this was overly familiar at points.</p> <h2><strong>4. </strong><strong>TV</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81222923">The Empress</a></strong><strong> (Netflix)</strong></p>    <p>There were these [1950s] movies with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2008/sep/29/romy.schneider">Romy Schneider</a>, the Sissi series, about Elisabeth, the Empress of Austria. This is a Netflix series about her young days and I’m really looking forward to watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KMmZc49lXE">the new season</a>. It’s a German-language period drama about her life in the palace; the Emperor’s mother doesn’t approve of her, so there’s a power struggle, but eventually the country falls in love with her. It looks amazing and it’s got this Visconti-esque thing going on that I really like.</p> <h2><strong>5. </strong><strong>Restaurant</strong></h2> <p><strong><a href="https://www.strakers.london/">Straker’s, London W10</a></strong></p>    <p>I love this restaurant. They’ve got two little tables in the windows, and it’s perfect for a little chat or gossip. It just feels wholly intimate. It’s modern Italian cuisine – I had the flatbread with chilli and mussel butter, which I don’t think I’ve ever had before. At one point, the sommelier sat down and had a drink with us. It’s everything one would want in a restaurant: very relaxed, the food is spectacular, great drinks and great staff. It makes me want to live on Golborne Road.</p>
