<p>Morning, everyone. To cheers from a large crowd of supporters, Gisèle Pelicot emerged from seeing her husband found guilty of drugging her and inviting dozens of men to rape her to say she hoped the case could change society. After the verdict was handed down, with crowds of supporters in the French city of Avignon cheering her on, Pelicot said: “I now have confidence in our capacity to find a better future where everyone, women and men alike, can live in harmony with respect and mutual understanding.”</p> 
<p>We have full reports and analysis of the extraordinary case, plus warnings in Australia about the dangers of bird flu for pregnant women, the hard road to withdrawing from antidepressants and reasons to be cheerful about 2025.</p>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>Cait Kelly has been talking to members of Australia’s LGBTQ+ community after data released yesterday revealed that almost one in 10 young people aged 16 to 24 are LGBTQ+ – while it’s more like one in 20 (4.5% of people) aged 16 and over. For some, like Shayne Wilde, 67, it’s proof of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/20/australia-abs-first-lgbtq-gay-and-lesbian-population-data">society’s wider acceptance</a> compared with her youth, while for Damien Nguyen, 22, the figures provide a basis to keep pushing for more rights.</p>
