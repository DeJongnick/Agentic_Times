<p>The privately educated are tightening their “vice-like grip” on some of the most powerful and influential roles in British society, such as FTSE 100 chairs, newspaper columnists and BBC executives, a report has found.</p> <p>Those in the most important positions are five times as likely to have attended private school than the general population, showing it is still possible to “buy advantage”, <a href="https://www.suttontrust.com/our-research/elitist-britain-2025/">according to the Sutton Trust</a>.</p> <p>Since 2019, the number of privately educated elites has barely changed and in some fields is growing, the report found. The social mobility charity said it was a “disgrace” that most of the country’s top jobs were still dominated by privileged people.</p> <p>Overall, senior armed forces personnel were the most likely to be privately educated, with 63% of officers of two-star rank (major generals and equivalents in other services) and above attending a fee-paying school, a rise of 14% compared with six years ago.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/UDJSi/4/" data-alt="Graph shows proportion of privately educated people in top roles by profession."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/UDJSi/4/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>This was true of a similar proportion of judges, at 62%, followed by male cricketers at 59%, despite independent school attendance being 7% across the population.</p> <p>In business, of the FTSE 100 chief executives who were educated in the UK, 37% attended private school, while this was true of 68% of their chairs after those who were educated abroad were stripped out, making it the most privately educated profession in the report. This represented a 15% rise in six years.</p> <p>Nearly a quarter of MPs and half of the House of Lords were privately educated, and that was also true of half of newspaper columnists – up 7 percentage points since 2019 – 47% of political commentators and 45% of podcasters.</p> <p>Only three categories were below the national average – male professional footballers at 5%, female professional footballers at 4% and the Northern Ireland assembly, where nobody attended a fee-paying school.</p> <p>The report also revealed stark figures on the proportion of the elite who attended Oxbridge, with three-quarters of senior judges attending either Oxford or Cambridge, compared with only 1% of the population.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/17/third-of-uk-parents-have-sought-special-needs-assessment-for-their-child-survey-finds">Third of UK parents have sought special needs assessment for their child, survey finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those institutions were also dominant among senior civil servants, with 66% of permanent secretaries being Oxbridge graduates.</p> <p>About a third of charity chief executives were privately educated and a fifth attended Oxbridge, showing that even the third sector is not immune to elitism.</p> <p>Nick Harrison, the chief executive of the Sutton Trust, said: “It’s a disgrace that most of the top jobs in Britain are still dominated by those from privileged education backgrounds, representing a small fraction of the wider population.</p> <p>“Little progress has been made in opening up positions of power, with those from private schools maintaining a vice-like grip on the most important roles.</p> <p>“In 2025 you can still buy advantage, massively increasing your chance of getting into the most powerful roles in the country. This is grossly unfair, and a waste of talent on a huge scale. If we want a fairer country and a stronger economy, employers and policymakers must take responsibility for levelling the playing field, where privilege is no longer a passport to power.”</p> <p>The charity is calling on the government to make it compulsory for organisations with more than 250 employees to report their class pay gaps to tackle access and progression problems.</p> <p>The Sutton Trust said in order to find talented individuals and “build a better pipeline of leaders”, employers should also look at education achievements in the context of disadvantage, including attending underperforming schools and less advantaged neighbourhoods, as well as looking beyond a narrow range of universities.</p> <p>Carl Cullinane, the director of research and policy at the Sutton Trust, said “too often, social class is not included” in the diversity conversation.</p> <p>He added: “Making the most of talent, wherever it comes from, means employers can move beyond a narrow cohort of candidates from the most advantaged backgrounds. This can be a win-win for employers, society, and the economy.”</p>
