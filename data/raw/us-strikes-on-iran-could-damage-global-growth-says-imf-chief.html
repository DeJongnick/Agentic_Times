<p>US strikes on Iran could damage global economic growth, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned.</p> <p>Director Kristalina Georgieva told Bloomberg TV that the IMF was watching energy prices closely, warning a rise in oil prices could have a ripple effect throughout the global economy.</p> <p>“There could be secondary and tertiary impacts,” she said. “Let’s say there is more turbulence that goes into hitting growth prospects in large economies – then you have a trigger impact of downward revisions in prospects for global growth.”</p> <p>The Iranian parliament voted to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/22/oil-prices-expected-to-rise-after-us-attack-on-iran">shut down the vital shipping channel through the strait of Hormuz</a> over the weekend, in a retaliation against Donald Trump’s attack on the country. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/what-is-the-strait-of-hormuz-iran-threat-close-global-trade-oil-shipping">A fifth of the world’s oil consumption flows through Hormuz</a>, which links the Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea beyond.</p> <p>If the strait is shut, it could create an oil supply shock that drives up energy prices, pushing up inflation and hitting economic growth.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/strait_hormuz/giv-32554NfQDaLsdvTcy/" data-alt="Strait of Hormuz map"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/strait_hormuz/giv-32554NfQDaLsdvTcy/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The price of oil initially jumped by more than 5% late on Sunday to a five-month high of $81.40 (£60.58), but later fell back. On Monday, Brent crude fell nearly 1%, to just over $76 a barrel.</p> <p>The price could hit $110 a barrel if oil flows through the critical waterway were halved for a month and then remained down 10% for the following 11 months, according to new estimates from the investment bank Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, has warned it would be “economic suicide” for Iran to close the strait and pushed for China to influence Tehran on the issue.</p> <p>He told Fox News: “I encourage the Chinese government in Beijing to call them about that, because they heavily depend on the strait of Hormuz for their oil.”</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/hormuz_oil_daily/giv-32554k53vktsBa2u4" data-alt="Oil flows chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/hormuz_oil_daily/giv-32554k53vktsBa2u4">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Holger Schmieding, the chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said the strait of Hormuz was “the key economic risk to watch”, but argued that a disruption to energy flows in the Gulf region “seems unlikely”, as trying to limit energy exports would be a high-risk strategy for Tehran.</p> <p>Analysts at the broker RBC Capital Markets said there was a “clear and present risk of energy attacks”, which could come from Iranian-backed militias in Iraq that operate near the Basra energy facilities. However, they added it could take days or weeks before the Iranian response became clear.</p> <p>“Above all, we would caution against the kneejerk ‘the worst is behind us’ hot take at this stage,” they said. “President Trump may indeed have successfully executed an ‘escalate to de-escalate’ move, but a wider expansion cannot still be ruled out at this juncture. We may be in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/10/midterms2006.iraq1">Rumsfeld ‘unknown knowns</a>’ matrix in this nine-day Middle East military conflict.”</p> <p>Two supertankers, each able to move about 2m barrels of crude oil, U-turned in the strait of Hormuz over the weekend after the US airstrikes, according to vessel data tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. It reported that the tankers, the Coswisdom Lake and South Loyalty, entered the strait but changed course on Sunday, sailing south away from the Gulf.</p> <p>Global stocks were subdued on Monday. In the UK, the FTSE 100 blue chip index slipped 0.2%, and the oil companies BP and Shell were among the few risers.</p> <p>In Asia, stocks were mixed, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 index down 0.1%, and Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 index down 0.4%. However, China’s CSI 300 rose 0.3% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.5%.</p>
