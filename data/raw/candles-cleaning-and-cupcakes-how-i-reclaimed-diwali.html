<h1>Candles, cleaning and cupcakes: how I reclaimed Diwali</h1>

<p>As a kid, Diwali was five days of sensory overload: flickering lamps, friends and relatives you hadn’t seen since last Diwali, and mithai served on repeat until joy curdled into sugar-induced despair.</p> <p>Growing up in Wales in the 90s, I rejected almost all of it. Being Asian felt like a marker of otherness, and when your teenage mission is fitting in, a celebration of being Indian wasn’t all that appealing. So I joined in half-heartedly, but longed for the escape hatch of a sweaty metal gig with my friends where identity didn’t feel quite so loaded.</p> <p>It’s only now, as an adult, that I’ve reclaimed Diwali. I still light candles, phone family, and do the ritual house clean, but I’ve also developed my own hybrid: a Diwali meets Halloween brunch with friends (Indian food with gruesome-looking cupcakes on the same table is a questionable vibe, but somehow it works).</p> <p>The overlap isn’t as odd as it sounds: both festivals are obsessed with light triumphing over dark. Diwali looks ahead to prosperity; Halloween, via its pagan ancestor Samhain, is a reminder that the harvest is over and winter is about to ruin everyone’s mood.</p> <h2><strong>Beyond sweets</strong></h2> <p>Traditionally, Diwali gifting involves sweets – glorious, jewel-bright boxes of ladoos, barfi, jalebi. But these days, it has shifted to the personal; things you’ll actually use, wear, or remember. Putting together <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/oct/08/best-diwali-gift-ideas">a Diwali gift guide</a> for the Filter was a joy, because it meant spotlighting south Asian brands that don’t get enough love.</p> <p>Take <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spacenk.com%2Fuk%2Fbrands%2Fr%2Franavat&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Foct%2F16%2Fhow-i-reclaimed-diwali">Ranavat</a>, a beauty line that fuses Ayurvedic rituals with modern formulations. The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spacenk.com%2Fuk%2Fskincare%2Ftreatment%2Fserums%2Froyal-trio-bestsellers-set-MUK200058693.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Foct%2F16%2Fhow-i-reclaimed-diwali">Royal Trio bestsellers kit</a> is an elegant way into the range, and I’ve used it since its launch. Then there’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapsleyandheron.com%2Fcollections%2Fpersonalised-name-necklaces&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Foct%2F16%2Fhow-i-reclaimed-diwali">Apsley &amp; Heron’s name necklaces</a>, which means you can wear your name in scripts from Hindi and Punjabi to my own language, Tamil. It’s a small thing, but quietly radical: finally seeing your name rendered as it should be.</p> <p>Increasingly I’ve seen more and more brands offer Diwali-themed gifts, a nice idea, but one that raises the question: when does celebration tip into commercialism? The answer usually lies in intent. The best versions give back: donating to south Asian charities, spotlighting south Asian creatives, or, at the very least, producing something that feels rooted in the culture rather than a cynical cash-grab.</p> <p>For me, Diwali will always be about positivity and connection.
