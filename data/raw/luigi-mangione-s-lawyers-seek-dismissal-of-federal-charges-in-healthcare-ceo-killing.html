<p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, accused of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brian-thompson-shooting">killing UnitedHealthcare CEO</a> Brian Thompson last December, asked a federal judge on Saturday to dismiss some criminal charges, including the only count on he could be eligible for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/luigi-mangione-lawyers-death-penalty">death penalty</a>.</p> <p>In a court filing, attorneys for Mangione said the death penalty must be dismissed because it does not meet the legal threshold.</p> <p>Mangione’s legal team is also arguing that evidence, including a gun and ammunition, allegedly found in a backpack Mangione was carrying when he was arrested at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s should be suppressed at trial because the search occurred without a warrant.</p> <p>They further claim that Mangione, 27, was not read his rights before he was questioned by law enforcement officers.</p> <p>The suspected gunman has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/25/luigi-mangione-federal-court-hearing">pleaded not guilty</a> to state and federal charges in the fatal shooting of Thompson on 4 December last year as he arrived at midtown Manhattan hotel.</p> <p>The killing set off a multi-state manhunt for the shooter. Mangione allegedly rode a bike to Central Park before taking a taxi to a bus depot. He was picked up by police five days later at a McDonald’s more than 200 miles (320km) away in Altoona, Pennsylvania, following a tip.</p> <p>Attorneys for Mangione last month asked that federal charges be dismissed because attorney general <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a> had publicly called on federal prosecutors in New York to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/01/luigi-mangione-death-penalty-united-healthcare-brian-thompson-killing">seek the death penalty</a>, calling the killing of Thompson a “premeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/luigi-mangione-lawyers-death-penalty">Luigi Mangione’s lawyers seek to bar possibility of death penalty in federal case</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Federal prosecutors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/17/unitedhealthcare-ceo-killing-luigi-mangione-charges">charged</a> Mangione under a federal law on murders committed with firearms as part of other “crimes of violence”, but his defense lawyers claim that stalking – the only other crime charged – is not a crime of violence.</p> <p>Last month, Judge Gregory Carro <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/luigi-mangione-terrorism-charges-dropped">dismissed</a> state terrorism charges against Mangione, saying that prosecutors had failed to provide evidence of intent to “intimidate and coerce a civilian population”.</p> <p>The case has divided public opinion, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/11/us-healthcare-brian-thompson-death">some</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/21/luigi-mangione-racism-media">seeing</a> Thompson’s assassination as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/dec/15/luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-shooting">justified act</a> against an official representing and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/05/heatlhcare-insurance-challenges">unjust healthcare system</a>, and others seeing it as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/16/unitedhealthcare-suspect-political-beliefs">cold-blooded murder</a> by a suspect seeking public fame.</p> <p>Examples of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/heart-shaped-note-found-in-socks-bound-for-luigi-mangione-prosecutors-say">support</a> for Mangione has led some to suggest it is in fact a manifestation of mass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/22/how-dowomen-fall-in-love-with-killers-like-ian-brady-and-charles-manson">hybristophilia</a>, or the romanticization of criminals.</p> <p>Mangione is currently being held in Brooklyn’s Metropolitan detention center, reportedly in the same cell as convicted crypto-currency fraudster <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/brian-thompson-shooting-accused-donations">public defense fund</a> for Mangione has so far raised more than $1.3m. Sam Beard, spokesperson for Mangione’s <a href="https://www.givesendgo.com/luigi-defense-fund">December 4th Legal Committee</a>, posted online that the legal authorities are attempting to make an example of Mangione in order “to intimidate and coerce the population into submitting to an unjustifiable system”. </p>
