<p>The house Alexander Isak has been living in just outside Newcastle is back on the rental market. The striker is trying to secure a move to Liverpool and it emerged on Tuesday that new tenants are being sought.</p> <p>Removal vans have been sighted at Isak’s Ponteland home, which is understood to have been put on the market some weeks ago. The Sweden international started renting the property after he joined Newcastle from Real Sociedad in 2022.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/transfer-latest-manchester-united-eye-brightons-baleba-while-liverpool-track-giovanni-leoni">Transfer latest: Liverpool advance Guéhi talks as Manchester United eye Baleba</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Burglars raided the house in April 2024, stealing jewellery and money and taking Isak’s car. The player’s victim impact statement, read in court this year, said the attack had left him “with a sense of unease and I fear it could reoccur”.</p> <p>Isak signalled his determination to force a transfer by not going on Newcastle’s pre-season tour to Singapore and South Korea last month and he has been ordered by Eddie Howe to train alone. The manager also banned the Sweden international <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/alexander-isak-miss-newcastle-barbecue-train-alone-eddie-howe">from a training‑ground barbecue</a> last week.</p> <p>Liverpool have had a £110m bid for Isak turned down but remain determined to sign the 25‑year‑old striker, who has scored 54 goals in 86 Premier League appearances. He is valued by Newcastle at £150m but it would be a surprise if a compromise were not found for the move to go ahead.</p> <p>That is contingent on Newcastle buying at least one striker. A deal for the Brentford centre-forward Yoane Wissa is expected to be concluded this week and Porto’s Samu Aghehowa is among other targets.</p> <p>Isak was handed a shirt number on Tuesday when Newcastle published their squad list, retaining the No 14 he has worn since he joined. Howe has no intention of using Isak on Saturday in the opening game at Aston Villa – the manager has said he only wants players who “really want to play for this football club”.</p> <p>Newcastle, meanwhile, completed the signing of the Milan defender Malick Thiaw on Tuesday night. The Germany international joins Howe’s side for a reported £34.6m, including add‑ons. He is the club’s third significant summer signing, after the forward Anthony Elanga and the goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.</p> <p>Liverpool are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/transfer-latest-manchester-united-eye-brightons-baleba-while-liverpool-track-giovanni-leoni">advancing in talks with Crystal Palace</a> over a previous Newcastle target, Marc Guéhi. They start their season on Friday at home to Bournemouth. A moment’s silence will be observed at all top-flight matches in the opening round in memory of the Liverpool forward Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva, who died last month.</p>
