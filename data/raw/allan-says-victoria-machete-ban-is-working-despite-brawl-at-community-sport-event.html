<p>The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, has said the state’s machete ban is working, despite reports of a brawl on Saturday night in Melbourne’s north and the discovery of a teenager with serious injuries nearby.</p> <p>Police were called to respond to a large group of males, aged in their late teens, fighting with machetes on Saturday evening, Det Sgt Matthew Feben told reporters on Sunday morning.</p> <p>Feben said a group of more than 1,000 people were leaving the area after a community rugby event when a brawl broke out.</p> <p>“It was quite heavily populated, the area, at the time,” he said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>They found a 19-year-old male with serious stab wounds in his torso. He has been uncooperative with investigators, Feben said, and was in a stable condition in hospital on Sunday morning.</p> <p>No arrests were made, as alleged suspects fled in vehicles before police arrived.</p> <p>Detectives were investigating whether the fight was linked to another incident on Friday night when youths armed with machetes were spotted running through the three-day Harmony Cup event.</p> <p>The Harmony Cup is a nine-a-side competition that gives players and volunteers a chance to represent their country of origin or local community.</p> <p>Allan on Sunday said the state’s recent machete ban was working, with more than 5,000 weapons handed in at disposal bins and thousands more taken off shelves.</p> <p>“We are getting more of these dangerous weapons off our streets than any other state,” she said.</p> <p>“The machete ban is here and it’s staying. When the amnesty concludes, in a few weeks’ time, there will be severe penalties for anyone found carrying a machete.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/13/victoria-police-restructure-overhaul-crime-trust">Victoria’s ‘major crime problem’ and ‘lack of trust’ in police sparks force’s biggest overhaul in years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The statewide ban on machetes came into effect on 1 September. An amnesty allowing people to surrender the weapons <a href="https://www.vic.gov.au/machete-amnesty">at 45 disposal bins located in police stations</a> is in place until 30 November.</p> <p>After the amnesty window ends, those who carry machetes will face up to $47,000 in fines or up to two years’ imprisonment.</p> <p>Allan said machetes and other dangerous weapons were “causing so much grief and concern in Victoria” but were being removed from the streets.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Brad Battin, said it was “simply not good enough” that young offenders had allegedly ran through a sporting event, creating fear in the community.</p> <p>Feben said the vision of Friday’s incident was “appalling” and police were very concerned.</p> <p>“People that are just trying to go about an event in their community, who want to feel safe. They don’t want to experience this,” he said.</p> <p>“It’s completely unacceptable in any location for youths or anyone to be armed with a machete, especially … in relation to a peaceful community event.</p> <p>“Police are putting lots of time and energy into getting these weapons off the street.”</p> <p>Feben said over the past 12 months, police had seized 13,000 edged weapons.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer ">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
