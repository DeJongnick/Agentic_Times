The gallery later proposed an accompanying video of people discussing both the painting and transgender issues at large. She said this decision would have “opened up for debate the value of trans visibility” which she rejected. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/24/amy-sherald-cancels-smithsonian-show">Read the full story.</a></p> <h2>What we learned</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/21/norfolk-woman-16th-century-painting-stolen-50-years-ago">A Norfolk woman handed over a 16th-century painting that was on Interpol’s most-wanted list</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/23/arles-photo-festival-kikuji-kawada-nan-goldin">The Guardian’s head of photography had her favourites at Arles photo festival</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/jul/22/russell-newell-images-of-his-peckham-estate-in-pictures">Many of Russell Newell’s photographs of Peckham, south-east London, have not been seen for the past 40 years</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/18/folkestone-triennial-review-arm">The salty nooks of Folkestone were the setting for a bleakly brilliant coastal festival</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/21/sofonisbas-chess-game-review-anguissola-the-game-of-chess-renaissance-art-documentary">A pioneering female Renaissance artist got her due</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/19/australian-artist-janet-dawson-retrospective-art-gallery-nsw">A visionary Australian artist got her first retrospective aged 90</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/22/art-black-women-bgias-events">In the US, Black Girls in Art Spaces is bridging the cultural gaps</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/jul/24/who-needs-a-car-los-angeles-by-foot-in-pictures">You don’t need a car in Los Angeles</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/23/stephanie-dinkins-ai-race-black-white-technology">An exhibition is interrogating white-dominated AI</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2> <p><strong>Stormy Landscape With Ruins on a Plain </strong><strong>by </strong><strong>Georges Michel</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>c</strong><strong> 1830s</strong></p>    <p>Nature is an unforgiving, awe-inspiring power in this French Romantic painting. Just like his British contemporaries Constable and Turner, Georges Michel worked in the open air. He mostly painted landscapes near Paris. He had a lot of imitators, hence the uncertainty about his attribution. You can see why this approach was popular. Even though the countryside spread out under those massive clouds is ordinary, even a bit nondescript, the artist finds sublimity in two archetypally Romantic themes: ruins and storms. The raised hill in the foreground is bleak and barren, and it’s crowned with the shattered, eroded shell of a great house that time has reduced to little more than a fireplace and stumps of walls. Above it, low, dark storm clouds whip up to unleash brutal rain. It’s an exciting blast of bleakness to hang in a cosy room.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-georges-michel-stormy-landscape-with-ruins-on-a-plain">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in </strong><strong>touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
