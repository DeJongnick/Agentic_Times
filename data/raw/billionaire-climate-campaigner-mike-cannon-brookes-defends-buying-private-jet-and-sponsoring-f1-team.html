<p>The Australian billionaire and outspoken climate advocate Mike Cannon-Brookes has defended buying a private jet and his company’s new sponsorship of the Williams Formula One racing team.</p> <p>Cannon-Brookes admitted to “deep internal conflict” over the purchase of the jet, reportedly a Bombardier 7500, but claimed that technology to directly capture CO2 from the atmosphere, and the use of sustainable jet fuel, would cancel emissions from his flights.</p> <p>Cannon-Brookes sought to explain the reasons why he bought the jet and Atlassian’s F1 sponsorship in an almost-500 word post to LinkedIn, hours after the <a href="https://www.afr.com/rear-window/cannon-brookes-now-travels-by-private-jet-20250313-p5ljbf">Australian Financial Review</a> had written about the billionaire’s new jet.</p> <p>Estimated to be worth US$13bn by Forbes, Cannon-Brookes said he bought a private jet “so I can run a global business from Australia, and still be a constantly present dad” which was a “hard, continual tradeoff I’ve decided to make”.</p> <p>On the sponsorship of the Williams F1 team, Cannon-Brookes said he appreciated “the double take” on the deal because “cars=fuel”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/dont-f-the-planet-atlassian-issues-net-zero-guide-for-companies-cutting-climate-impact">‘Don’t F&amp;*! The Planet’: Atlassian issues net zero guide for companies cutting climate impact</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cannon-Brookes has gained a reputation for being outspoken on climate issues, but has faced strong criticism of the F1 sponsorship and the jet.</p> <p>“It probably comes as no surprise, I have an extremely rigorous carbon regime for all my flying – including using direct air capture and sustainable fuels for the carbon and contrails, to far exceed my flight footprint,” he wrote.</p> <p>“These options aren’t practical for commercial flights – but are viable privately. This means my flights actually have a net negative carbon footprint.”</p> <p>In 2023 Atlassian, the software company he co-founded, issued a guide titled “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/24/dont-f-the-planet-atlassian-issues-net-zero-guide-for-companies-cutting-climate-impact">Don’t F&amp;*! The Planet</a>” to help other companies cut their emissions.</p> <p>In his LinkedIn post, Cannon-Brookes says he had conversations with Formula One’s governing body, the FIA, and was “impressed with their plans to get to net zero”.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKXgddDoqEs"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKXgddDoqEs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>A promotional video announcing Atlassian’s sponsorship of F1 team Williams.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>According to F1’s latest report on sustainability, the sport was responsible for 223,031 tonnes of CO2 in 2023. While the fuel burned by the racing cars was less than 1% of the sport’s footprint, the vehicles would shift to 100% sustainable fuel derived from waste and sources of non-food biomass by 2026.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Cannon-Brookes said the Williams team’s moves to cut emissions “mirrors Atlassian’s own journey”.</p> <p>“F1 can set a global example for sustainability in sports – and I believe it will,” he said. “I believe in a sustainable future. I believe in constant, practical forward motion. I well understand that takes hard, continual tradeoffs (which aren’t the same as denying or delaying).</p> <p>“My commitment to climate is as strong as ever. I’m still pretty damn focused on making an impact at a large scale, removing huge volumes of emissions through active investments and philanthropy … and have the proud scars to prove it.”</p> <p>Cannon-Brookes said he remained determined to help transform Australia into a “renewable energy superpower”.</p> <p>“I am still a deep believer that decarbonisation is the single greatest economic opportunity for Australia.”</p>
