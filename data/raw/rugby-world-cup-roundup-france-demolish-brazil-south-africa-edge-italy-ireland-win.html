<p>France crushed Brazil 84-5 to seal their quarter-final spot but history was made by the tournament debutants as they collected their first World Cup try.</p> <p>This was just the 18th Test in which Brazil have played and they scored their first World Cup points against South Africa last week through a penalty, but failed to cross the whitewash. That changed against the French as Bianca Silva carved her name into history.</p> <p>It was a try of beauty, too, with a superb break from the replacement. The scenes in the stands were jubilant as supporters jumped wildly, with the coaching staff joining in with the celebrations and the head coach, Emiliano Caffera, looked emotional as he watched on.</p> <p>It will be a moment Brazilian rugby always remembers but the result will be a tough one to take. The task for Brazil was made even more difficult by the return of the France scrum-half Pauline Bourdon Sansus after she missed the team’s opener because of a ban.</p> <p>It was a relentless first half from France with nine tries, including two from Marine Ménager, to reach the break 53-0 up. The barrage continued with Séraphine Okemba, Émilie Boulard and Nassira Konde scoring. Brazil then had their euphoric moment before France racked up more through Lina Tuy and Kelly Arbey.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong>South Africa</strong> defeated <strong>Italy</strong> for the first time with a 29-24 victory in York to seal a maiden quarter-final. South Africa raced into a 17-5 lead in their Pool D clash, but Italy fought back to 24-24 heading into the final five minutes. South Africa’s powerful forwards had the upper hand all game and Sinazo Mcatshulwa burrowed over from close range for the winning score to spark wild scenes of celebration.</p> <p><strong>Ireland</strong> held off a spirited <strong>Spain</strong> to win their Pool C clash 43-27 as they ran in seven tries in an entertaining game. Their 43 points is a record at the World Cup for the side. </p>
