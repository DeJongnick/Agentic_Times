<p>Green olives, which are picked when they’re under-ripe, tend to be more bitter than black ones, but that bitterness also brings with it depth and complexity. Many of the cheaper olives I tasted have a strong, wine-vinegar acidity that I don’t really enjoy straight from the jar. I do, however, appreciate that punch when they’re paired with other ingredients: sliced on pizza, tossed into salads or, my favourite, skewered with an anchovy and a pickled guindilla pepper to make that classic Basque <em>pintxo</em>, the gilda. Salty olives are also brilliant for seasoning dishes such as tagines or in a tapenade crust for roast chicken – just remember to season <em>after</em> they’ve imparted their salty flavour.</p> <p>This tasting led me to reconsider what makes a green olive excellent. The test group were all completely different, ranging from ones with rich olive oil and woody herb tones and a great meaty texture to others with strong acidic tones balanced by sweet apple notes. All are delicious in their own way, and considering that I’m not usually a fan of pitted green olives, I was impressed by the overall quality.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best supermarket pitted green olives</h2> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best </em><em>overall</em><em>:</em><em><br></em>Realfoods by Organico organic green pitted olives</h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.ocado.com/products/realfoods-by-organico-organic-green-pitted-olives/609904011" > £3.80 for 230g at Ocado (£1.65/100g) </a>  <p>★★★★☆</p> <p>A large Greek olive with a speckled skin and fresh aroma.
