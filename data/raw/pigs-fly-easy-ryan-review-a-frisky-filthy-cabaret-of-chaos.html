<p>It is probably best not to ask too many questions. I mean, you could imagine Lou Doyle and Trevor White wanted their show to be about achieving the impossible and alighted on the phrase “pigs might fly” to encapsulate their vision. That would explain a scenario in which two animals leave their pigsty, disguise themselves as human beings, get past the check-in desks and gain employment as part of the cabin crew on a budget airline. These pigs really do fly.</p> <p>But that would be to seek a rationale for a show that does everything it can to defy logic. The pair may equally be the “flamin’ hot crash fetishists” described in the fringe programme. They certainly have a perverse interest in high-altitude accidents and emergency landings, even if they also have snouts and tails.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/aug/13/ways-of-knowing-review-underbelly-cowgate-edinburgh">Ways of Knowing review – foggy forecast from weather pioneers, mystics and scientists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No, it is more fruitful to take Pigs Fly Easy Ryan as you find it: messy, exuberant and daft, complete with cabaret aesthetics, shoogly acrobatics and feverish monologues, not to mention cross-dressing and undressing.
