<p>Ruben Amorim believes ­Manchester United employees made ­redundant are “paying the price” for poor on‑field performance and that recruitment has to improve to address the problem.</p> <p>Omar Berrada, United’s chief ­exe­cutive, confirmed on Monday that&nbsp;Sir Jim Ratcliffe is to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/24/let-them-eat-fruit-manchester-united-close-staff-canteen-in-latest-cost-cutting-sir-jim-ratcliffe-football">cut up to another 200 jobs</a> after 250 people were&nbsp;made unemployed last year. Amorim was&nbsp;asked how the ­remaining staff and fans could be confident this&nbsp;will help the club to prosper.</p> <p>“It’s easy for me to say all the pretty stuff,” the head coach said. “We have&nbsp;to improve recruitment, that is crucial, and we need to improve the team. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/24/never-mind-the-quality-feel-the-money-central-flaw-of-footballs-greatest-show-on-earth">Never mind the quality, feel the money: central flaw of football’s ‘greatest show on earth’ | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“They are paying the price for our lack of success and I can’t say ­anything now that is going to ­convince the fans and all the staff that we’re going to do it. We have an idea but we need to be a better team and recruit better and not make a lot of mistakes in that department.”</p> <p>United are 15th, 13 points above Ipswich, who are third ­bottom and visit Old Trafford on Wednesday. Amorim does not believe the low morale caused by the ­redundancies will affect the players.</p> <p>“I’m not saying it’s a bad thing but the players don’t feel it too much, they have one life, they live in a ­bubble,” he said. </p> <p>“It’s completely different for them than it is for me, Andrew [Ward, the press officer], for everybody in the club. They feel the pressure that they&nbsp;need to win at ­Manchester United and every time we lose and&nbsp;every time they don’t perform there are a lot of people on social media and&nbsp;in the newspapers ­putting on a lot of pressure.</p> <p>“Then they go to the pitch and try to fix things but not in a good way: thinking too much, not playing the way they’re supposed to play. They don’t feel that pressure of people losing their job – they are young kids [some of them] that live in a dif­ferent world – but they suffer a different pressure and sometimes it’s harder.”</p> <p>Amorim said he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/08/luke-shaw-manchester-united-england-euro-2024">did not know when Luke Shaw would return</a> from his ­latest injury – “He’s doing rehab&nbsp;but we don’t have a date for him” – and that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/20/mason-mount-manchester-united-football-ruben-amorim">Mason Mount, who has a thigh problem</a>, was closer to being available.</p>
