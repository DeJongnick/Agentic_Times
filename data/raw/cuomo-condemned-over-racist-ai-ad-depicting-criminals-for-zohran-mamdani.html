<p>New York City mayoral hopeful Andrew Cuomo has been widely labeled as racist after his official X account posted – and then deleted – an AI-generated ad depicting “criminals for Zohran Mamdani”.</p> <p>Not even 20 minutes into the second mayoral debate, Cuomo’s official account, @andrewcuomo, tweeted the video. It was reshared by many before being deleted.</p> <p>The Cuomo and Mamdani campaigns did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for comment.</p> <p>The video, which has been saved and reshared by various people, runs a little over two minutes and opens with an AI iteration of Mamdani, first running through the streets of New York and then eating rice with his hands.</p> <p>It goes on to show a Black man in a keffiyeh shoplifting, a man abusing a woman, a sex trafficker, a drug dealer, and others, all showing their support for Mamdani.</p> <p>Reaction to the video, which was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/premthakker.bsky.social/post/3m3t2yfppjk2f">re-uploaded</a> by journalist Prem Thakker, was fast and negative.</p> <p>Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a grassroots organization that advocates for gun violence prevention, <a href="https://x.com/shannonrwatts/status/1981162731610001765">called</a> it “so gross and full of racist stereotypes, including a Black man dressed like a pimp trafficking a car full of white women. Cuomo needs to be thrown in the ash heap of history.”</p>    <p>Laila Al-Arian, executive producer of Al Jazeera’s Fault Lines, pointed to the imagery of the keffiyeh and <a href="https://x.com/LailaAlarian/status/1981162350842695775">asked</a> on X: “How are Palestinian New Yorkers supposed to feel about this, or do they not matter?”</p> <p>Benjamín Schultz-Figueroa, associate professor of film and media studies at Seattle University, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminschultzfig.bsky.social">wrote</a> on Bluesky: “This is next level fascist AI slop. It’s also such a weird ‘greatest hits’ of scary stereotypes from NYC history.”</p> <p>Antonia Hylton, co-anchor of MSNBC’s The Weekend: Primetime, <a href="https://x.com/ahylton26/status/1981160442321055842">said</a>: “Well this is sad. And pretty racist.”</p> <p>This video follows a trend from the Cuomo campaign, who have published a handful of AI-generated videos in the lead up to 4 November. In one early October video, Cuomo was seen performing various jobs around New York City including driving a subway car, trading on the New York stock exchange and washing high-rise windows.</p> <p>In response, Mamdani <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPUKNRODpLX/?hl=en">posted</a> on Instagram: “In a city of world-class artists and production crew hunting for the next gig, Andrew Cuomo made a TV ad the same way he wrote his housing policy: with AI. Then again, maybe a fake Cuomo is better than the real one?”</p> <p>Just this week, Cuomo shared a video featuring an AI-generated Bill de Blasio and, again, Mamdani. That video attempted to paint Mamdani as a “mini” De Blasio and emphasize a moment from the first debate where Cuomo compared the former mayor to the mayoral hopeful.</p>
