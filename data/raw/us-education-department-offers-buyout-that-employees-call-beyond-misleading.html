<p>The US Department of Education sent an email to employees department-wide on Friday offering up to $25,000 to voluntarily resign or retire, or take severance, whichever is less.</p> <p>The email, obtained by the Guardian, states “this is a one-time offer in advance of a very significant Reduction In Force for the US Department of Education” and gives employees until the end of day Monday to accept.</p> <p>According to a Department of Education employee, the email was sent, retracted, then sent back out to employees.</p> <p>“This is beyond manipulative and misleading,” claimed the worker, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. “Also, if you leave voluntarily, you are not eligible for unemployment.”</p> <p>They noted their severance and unused leave compensation that they would receive through a reduction in force order would be several times more than the buyout offer. But with the buyout offer, they would only receive the lesser amount. They provided the Guardian a copy of their benefits, which notes their current severance amount and eligibility.</p> <p>Another Department of Education employee confirmed this claim, adding “if you take it thinking you’ll get $25,000 but your severance is $15,000, you’ll get the $15,000”.</p> <p>The agreement also includes a stipulation that the employee would have to pay back the buyout if they are employed or contracted with the federal government in the next five years, according to a copy of the voluntary separation incentive payment.</p> <p>“Under a reduction in force, you have more rights to re-employment and unemployment,” the second employee noted.</p> <p>The application also affirms “My decision is entirely voluntary. I have not been coerced.”</p> <p>The Department of Education and White House were contacted for comment.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/trump-education-department">Reports</a> surfaced earlier this month that the White House had been preparing an executive order to abolish the US Department of Education.</p> <p>Dozens of employees at the Department of Education were <a href="https://apnews.com/article/education-department-paid-leave-dei-ad8ab48fabba227316e394dc5ad32770">placed</a> on administrative leave in response to Donald Trump’s anti-DEI orders earlier this month.
