<p>A pregnant physician who was denied a Covid-19 vaccine is suing the Trump administration alongside a group of leading doctors associations, charging that the administration sought to “desensitize the public to anti-vaccine and anti-science rhetoric”, according to their attorney.</p> <p>The lawsuit specifically takes aim at health secretary Robert F Kennedy’s unilateral decision to recommend against Covid-19 vaccines for pregnant women and healthy children.</p> <p>Kennedy’s announcement circumvented expert scientific review panels and flouted studies showing pregnant women are at heightened risk from the virus, and made it more difficult for some to get the vaccine.</p> <p>“This administration is an existential threat to vaccination in America, and those in charge are only just getting started,” said Richard H Hughes IV, partner at Epstein Becker Green and lead counsel for the plaintiffs in a statement.</p> <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians and American Public Health Association are among a list of leading physicians associations named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/05/vicky-pebsworth-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr">Nurse on new CDC vaccine panel said to have been ‘anti-vax longer than RFK’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“If left unchecked, secretary Kennedy will accomplish his goal of ridding the United States of vaccines, which would unleash a wave of preventable harm on our nation’s children,” said Hughes. “The professional associations for pediatricians, internal medicine physicians, infectious disease physicians, high-risk pregnancy physicians, and public health professionals will not stand idly by as our system of prevention is dismantled. This ends now.”</p> <p>In late May, Kennedy announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/27/rfk-jr-covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women">no longer recommend</a> Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children or pregnant women. The announcement, made on social media, contradicted a raft of evidence showing <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929">pregnant women</a> and infants are at especially high-risk from the disease, including from the administration’s own scientific leaders.</p> <p>In June, Kennedy went further by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-panel">firing</a> all 17 sitting members of a key vaccine advisory panel to the CDC. The advisory panel is a key link in the vaccine distribution pipeline, helping to develop recommendations insurers use when determining which vaccines to cover.</p> <p>That panel met for the first time in late June. Members <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk-acip">announced they would review</a> both the childhood vaccine schedule and any vaccines that had not been formally reviewed in seven years. They also recommended against a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/rfk-flu-shot-vaccines-panel">long-vilified</a> vaccine preservative, in spite of a lack of evidence of harm.</p> <p>The news comes amid the largest annual measles case count in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/annual-measles-cases-record">33 years</a>, and amid reports of more parents <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-07/rfk-jr-is-scaring-parents-into-asking-doctors-for-early-shots?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTg5ODI0MiwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNTAzMDQyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjBaV0xEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGNUIxMTZFRjBGMDQ0QkEyOUZFMUVDQzRFMThBNkI4MiJ9.XWICDOOm2s07eLr7aypiL6q3iAoWxsGeXP3JJrxjN78">seeking early vaccination</a> for their children, fearing vaccines will go into shortage or no longer be covered by insurance.</p>
