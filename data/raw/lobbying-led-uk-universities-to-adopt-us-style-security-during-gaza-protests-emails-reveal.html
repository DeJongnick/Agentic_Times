<p>University leaders reassured campus security officials amid pro-Palestine protests in the UK that they would back them if “things got tough” after their US counterparts were disciplined for their approach, according to internal emails.</p> <p>Reports subsequently emerged of students on British campuses facing disciplinary measures and tough bail conditions after police were called on largely non-violent demonstrations, raising claims of a heavy-handed strategy.</p> <p>Evidence of a successful lobbying campaign by campus security officials emerged in an email written last August by Oliver Curran, the chair of the Association of University Chief Security Officers (Aucso), a professional body with members at more than 140 UK universities.</p> <p>In the note to Aucso members, obtained by <a href="https://libertyinvestigates.org.uk/">Liberty Investigates</a> and shared with the Guardian, Curran wrote that he had met Universities UK, the body that represents vice-chancellors, after visiting a security conference in New Orleans.</p> <p>He wrote: “I was extremely interested when I attended the [US campus law enforcement] conference on how they were handling the encampments and what lessons they had learnt.</p> <p>“Despite carrying out the instructions of their seniors, when things got tough the [campus police] chiefs weren’t supported, and in some cases were suspended/disciplined.</p> <p>“One of the first things I did when I returned to the UK was to approach [university vice-chancellors] and asked that they continually provide the UK Aucso members with the support we require. The responses were extremely reassuring.”</p> <p>A Universities UK spokesperson said: “We do not recognise that description of our meeting with Aucso. Aucso were invited to a meeting of all UK vice-chancellors to share their insights on handling protests and encampments because of their expertise in this area.”</p> <p>Curran added that campus security officials planned to do joint workshops with their US counterparts to help prepare for an anticipated second wave of protests at the start of the current academic year. In a LinkedIn post after the conference, he said he looked forward to implementing the Americans’ “innovative strategies” at home.</p> <p>Up to 113 students and staff in the UK have faced disciplinary investigations linked to pro-Palestine protest activity across at least 28 universities since the 7 October attacks, according to additional freedom of information requests by Liberty Investigates and Sky News.</p> <p>At least nine universities received briefings on protests from private intelligence and security companies including Horus Security Ltd, Mitie Intelligence Hub and the risk specialist Global Situational Awareness.</p> <p>Among those who faced disciplinary action after the handling of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/may/02/where-are-the-us-college-campus-protests-and-what-is-happening">student protests</a> on campuses across the US was the police chief at Arizona State University, where an encampment was removed and officers made more than 70 arrests.</p> <p>Gina Romero, the UN special rapporteur for freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, said it was deeply disturbing to learn that the increasingly hostile environment faced by pro-Palestinian protesters at universities was connected to “lobbying efforts” behind the scenes.</p> <p>She said: “It is as if, overnight, many universities had become an absolutely hostile space for dissent and free expression, for the exercise of rights, and for learning.”</p> <p>Kevin Blowe, a campaigns coordinator at the Network for Police Monitoring, a UK-based campaign group, said he was dismayed by the attempt to learn from the US. “Nobody needs to look to the US for examples of best practices – because there aren’t any,” he said.</p> <p>The emails uncovered by the investigation further reveal how Aucso set up a “protest and assembly special interest group” in early May, as encampments sprang up across the UK.</p> <p>In an initial meeting, the 80-plus attenders were advised to “choose wording and phrasing carefully” when recording information about student protests as “it may be subject to [FoI] requests”.</p> <p>Coventry University disclosed a follow-up email from Horus Security Ltd after the special interest group meeting, offering to provide it with daily updates on “the developing situation at those universities experiencing encampments with information … on the numbers and groups involved”.</p> <p>An Aucso spokesperson said it had no influence on the use of private intelligence firms by its members. They said: “Universities see regular protests across different issues and students have the right to protest peacefully on issues that are important to them, whilst having full confidence that they are safe.</p> <p>“Security teams need to be on hand but take a ‘softly-softly’ approach and work closely with all parties to ensure protests are safe and peaceful. The safety and security of our communities is of paramount importance to our members.</p> <p>“Our main message to universities is to be aware and conscious of what is happening and keep a watchful eye, engage with your security teams and ensure fluid and regular comms and engagement with all key parties.”</p> <p>A Universities UK spokesperson said: “Universities work hard to balance their duty to protect and promote free speech, and to allow legitimate protest, with the obligation to ensure the safety of their campuses and the ability of staff and students to go about their work and study. In any case, they are also obliged by law to prevent hate speech and racism.”</p>
