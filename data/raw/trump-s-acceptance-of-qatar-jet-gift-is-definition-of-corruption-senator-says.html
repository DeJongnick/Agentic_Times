<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s acceptance of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/13/poor-donald-trump-luxury-jet-qatar-corrupt">$400m Boeing jet</a> from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/qatar">Qatar</a> is the “definition of corruption”, a leading Democrat said on Sunday, as several senior Republicans joined in a bipartisan fusillade of criticism and concern over the luxury gift.</p> <p>Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/connecticut">Connecticut</a>, condemned the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/13/trump-quid-pro-quo-qatar-plane">flying grift</a>” on NBC’s Meet the Press as he assailed the president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/17/donald-trump-gulf-states-ai">trip to several Gulf states</a> this week that included a stop in Qatar.</p> <p>“Why did he choose these three countries for his first major foreign trip? It’s not because these are our most important allies or the most important countries in the world,” he said of Trump’s visit to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/17/trump-foreign-gifts-plane-gulf-states">‘Very disturbing’: Trump receipt of overseas gifts unprecedented, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It’s because these are the three countries willing to pay him off. Every single one of these countries is giving Trump money, the plane from Qatar, an investment in his cryptocurrency scam from the UAE, and they are asking for national security concessions in return.</p> <p>“This is the definition of corruption. Foreign governments putting money in the president’s pocket and then the US giving them national security concessions that hurt our own security.”</p> <p>Rand Paul, a Republican US senator for Kentucky, and chair of his chamber’s homeland security committee, told ABC’s This Week that the gift of the jet “at least gives the appearance of a conflict of interest”.</p> <p>And Mike Pence, Trump’s vice-president during his first Oval Office term, said it was “inconsistent with our security” during an appearance on Meet the Press in which he pointed out Qatar had been previously accused of financing international terrorism.</p> <p>Trump has insisted he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-qatar-plane-jet.html">would be “stupid”</a> to refuse Qatar’s offer of the jet, which would serve as the new Air Force One before being donated to his presidential library upon his retirement.</p> <p>But the proposal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/13/trump-qatar-plane-maga-republicans">enraged even close allies of the president</a>, some calling it the opposite of Trump’s promise to drain the swamp – and “a stain on the administration”.</p> <p>Trump lashed out at critics on his Truth Social network on Saturday, claiming the gift was to the US and not personally for him.</p> <p>Murphy told NBC that was not true. “The plane is not a gift to the American people,” he said. “It is going directly to Donald Trump.</p> <p>“That library will take a decade to build, and so once he leaves the White House, until the library is built, he gets to use that plane to fly around all of his billionaire friends while his policies result in millions of Americans losing their healthcare and having to pay higher costs.”</p> <p>Pence said Trump should turn down the offer.</p> <p>“Qatar has a long history of playing both sides. They support Hamas,” he said. “They supported Al-Qaida. Qatar has actually financed pro-Hamas protests on American campuses across the US, so the very idea that we would accept an Air Force One from Qatar I think is inconsistent with our security, with our intelligence needs.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/13/trump-quid-pro-quo-qatar-plane">Trump 2.0 takes quid pro quo fears to new heights with $400m flying grift</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There are profound issues, the potential for intelligence gathering, the need to ensure the president is safe and secure as he travels around the world, and of course there are very real constitutional issues. The constitution prohibits public officials from accepting a present from a foreign state.</p> <p>“It’s just a bad idea and my hope is the president will think better of it.”</p> <p>Paul said he could see a way in which the gift would be acceptable – but that Trump had handled the offer poorly.</p> <p>“My fear is that it detracts from a largely successful trip where the president is talking about opening up and doing more trade with the Middle East,” he said.</p> <p>“I’ve been part of vetoing or trying to veto arms [sales] to Qatar, as well as to Saudi Arabia, over human rights abuses. So could it color the perception of the administration if they have a $400m plane to be more in favor of these things. It at least gives the appearance of a conflict of interest. I don’t think it’s worth the headache.”</p>
