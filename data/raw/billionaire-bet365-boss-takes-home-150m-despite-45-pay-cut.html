<p>Britain’s highest-paid woman, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/02/the-ultimate-gambler-how-denise-coates-became-britains-richest-woman">Bet365 billionaire Denise Coates</a>, has given herself a 45% pay cut but still claimed £150m in salary and dividends last year as profits at the online gambling company soared.</p> <p>The Stoke-based business reported an increase in turnover from £3.4bn to £3.7bn last year, while also cutting costs and benefiting from a one-off gain on the value of its investments, as equity markets improved.</p> <p>These three factors catapulted the company to a £626m profit before tax in the year to the end of March 2024, compared with a £60m pre-tax loss the year before.</p> <p>Coates is known in part for her record-breaking pay packets, which have exceeded £2bn during her time at the helm of Bet365, an online gambling empire that she transformed from a chain of betting shops owned by her father, Peter.</p> <p>The family came 20th in last year’s Sunday Times Rich List, with a combined net worth of nearly £7.5bn.</p> <p>The 57-year-old Denise, who has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/02/the-ultimate-gambler-how-denise-coates-became-britains-richest-woman">described herself as the “ultimate gambler”</a>, paid herself £95m this year and is also entitled to at least half of the £110m dividend that the company paid, based on her shareholding of more than 50%.</p> <p>The total £150m payout is significantly down on the previous year, when she awarded herself £270m, and far below the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/31/bet365-boss-denise-coates-pay-may-exceed-1bn-in-four-years">record-breaking £466m she collected in 2020</a>. In 2021, Coates collected £300m.</p> <p>The company cited reduced executive pay as a factor in its rebound from last year’s losses.</p> <p>Including the company’s three other directors – two of whom are Denise Coates’s father Peter and her brother John – executive pay was down from £304m to £124m.</p> <p>The £180m pay cut accounted for approximately a quarter of the difference between Bet365’s £60m deficit in 2023 and the £626m profit it reported for the year to March 2024.</p> <p>The group also donated £120m to the Denise Coates Foundation, a charity she set up that is controlled by members of the Coates family and their employees. The sum is a fifth up on the £100m given to the foundation last year.</p> <p>In October, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/04/denise-coates-bet365-biggest-beneficiary-charity-tax">analysis by the Guardian found</a> that the donations may have saved Coates’s online gambling empire more in tax than the foundation has yet given to good causes.</p> <p>The foundation has previously said it needs to build up large reserves so that it can be self-sustaining in the long term, rather than relying on continued contributions from the company.</p> <p>Accounts for the wider Bet365 group also included those of Stoke City Football Club, for the final time.</p> <p>The club was owned by the Bet365 group until last year, when it was demerged from Bet365, with control passed to John Coates.</p> <p>The club lost £30m during the year, dragging the overall group profit down from £626m to £596m.</p> <p>Bet365 said it had not set aside any money relating to an investigation into potential breaches of anti money-laundering laws by Austrac, an Australian intelligence agency, because the investigation is ongoing.</p>
