Here’s a recap of the latest developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Benjamin Netanyahu announced a new “intensified” offensive in Gaza that will involve Israeli troops holding on to seized territory and significant displacement of the population. </strong>Israeli soldiers would not go into Gaza, launch raids and then retreat, Netanyahu said. “The intention is the opposite of that … Population will be moved, for its own protection.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israel’s security cabinet approved the plan on Sunday night for “conquering” the Gaza Strip and establishing a “sustained presence” there. </strong>The plan, which was unanimously approved, goes beyond any aims so far outlined by Israel for its offensive in the devastated Palestinian territory.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the new offensive, named Operation Gideon’s Chariots, would “include a wide-scale attack and the movement of the majority of the strip’s population</strong>. The announcement is a significant moment, at least in terms of public rhetoric, and will confirm many people’s long-held fears of Israel’s intentions in Gaza and prompt international outrage.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Israeli announcement prompted deep international concern and fierce opposition. </strong>A spokesperson for the UN secretary general, <strong>António Guterres, </strong>said the Israeli plan will “inevitably lead to countless more civilians killed and the further destruction of Gaza.” A spokesperson for the <strong>British Foreign Office</strong> said: “The UK does not support an expansion of Israel’s military operations in Gaza. Continued fighting is in nobody’s interests.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump did not offer his views on Israel’s plan but blamed Hamas for having treated the people of Gaza “very badly”. </strong>The US will “help the people of Gaza get some food,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “Hamas is making it impossible, because they’re taking everything that’s brought in.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israel sees Trump’s visit to the Middle East next week as a “window of opportunity” for a hostage deal in Gaza. </strong>Israel is reportedly trying to “leverage” the US president’s trip to push Hamas to accept a deal, with a report claiming that Israel will launch a massive ground operation if no deal is reached.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israel’s military said it carried out airstrikes against Yemen’s Hodeidah port, a day after the Houthi group fired a missile that struck near Israel’s main airport.</strong> More than 10 strikes targeted Hodeidah Port and the Al Salakhanah and Al Hawak neighbourhoods in Hodeidah City, Reuters reported. Four strikes also targeted a cement factory east of Hodeidah.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id="block-681905d38f08171b1691df04" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/jasonburke"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-05T18:41:49.010Z">7.41pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The announcement of <strong>Israel</strong>’s plan to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/05/israel-expand-military-operations-gaza">launch imminently a new, expanded offensive in </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/05/israel-expand-military-operations-gaza">Gaza</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/05/israel-expand-military-operations-gaza"> </a>and to retain the territory it seized is a significant moment, at least in terms of public rhetoric.</p> <p>Throughout the nearly 19-month war, Israeli troops have carried out large and frequently bloody operations that have covered all except central parts of Gaza, but they have largely restricted their permanent presence to a buffer zone about 1km deep along the devastated territory’s perimeter and two relatively narrow east-west corridors.</p> <p>This now seems to have changed.
