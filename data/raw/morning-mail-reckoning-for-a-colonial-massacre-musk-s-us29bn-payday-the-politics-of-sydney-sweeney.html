<p>Morning everyone. We continue our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/the-descendants">Descendants series</a> today with a report from Bootenal Springs in Western Australia about how the families of Indigenous people and white settlers came together for a reckoning about a massacre 171 years ago – and calls for the release of diaries that could shed light on colonial-era killings.</p> 
<p>Plus: we examine claims and counter-claims about the size of the Sydney pro-Palestine march, we have plenty on an extraordinary game of cricket in England – and will it all go wrong for Sydney Sweeney now that she’s been outed as a Republican?</p> 
<h2>Australia</h2> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><em><strong>Glacial change | </strong></em>Glaciers on a remote Australian sub-Antarctic island are shrinking rapidly, losing almost a quarter of their size <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/05/glacier-shrinking-australia-remote-heard-island-sounds-alarm">in just 70 years</a>, with researchers fearing glaciers on a neighbouring peninsula may have already disappeared.</p></li> 
 <li><p><em><strong>The Descendants | </strong></em>The descendants of those who committed a massacre at Bootenal Springs near Geraldton in Western Australia – the wealthy Drummond and Criddle families – and the surviving Naaguja have come together to reckon with this bloody history. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/05/families-unite-at-site-of-massacre-something-spoke-through-me-ntwnfb">Guardian Australia sat down</a> with both sides as part of The Descendants project.

A UN expert who warned of the starvation crisis last year says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/04/gaza-starvation-un-expert-michael-fakhri">“no one should act surprised”</a> about the calamity.</p></li>
