 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We’re going to close our live coverage of the historic Falcon Heavy launch with a summary of the afternoon’s events.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Through a waterfall of cascading fire and smoke, SpaceX successfully launched its first Falcon Heavy,</strong> the most powerful rocket in operation anywhere in the world, and second only in strength to the Apollo-era leviathans that took crews to the moon.</li> 
   <li><strong>The company then successfully separated its three rocket boosters, </strong><strong>and landed </strong><strong>two</strong><strong> in a ballet of controlled burns.</strong> They landed onto parallel launchpads near where they took off in Cape Canaveral, Florida.</li> 
   <li><strong>The third booster was unaccounted for by the company. </strong>It was meant to land on a droneship in the Atlantic ocean, but the company did not explain its fate after a camera feed cut out from the vibrations of the rocket. <br></li> 
   <li><strong>Billionaire founder Elon Musk successfully launched one of his Tesla Roadsters on a course toward Mars. </strong>He revealed surreal live video feeds of the car cruising around the planet, complete with a “Don’t Panic” dashboard message, a dummy astronaut in the driver’s seat, and David Bowie on the radio. </li> 
  </ul>

  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The success is a major step toward cheaper, more frequent spaceflight, </strong>making it easier for governments and businesses to lift massive projects into space or set off on deep space missions. SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy is estimated to cost $90m per launch; Nasa’s planned SLS rocket, a comparable system, is expected to cost about $1bn per flight.</li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Roadster clear, core booster unaccounted for</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The car continues its surreal path around the planet, somewhere distant above an entire continent.</p> 
  <p>Still no word from Musk or SpaceX about what happened to the core rocket booster, however. Their long silence suggests it did not land as planned on a ship in the Atlantic, but likely crashed into the sea.</p>

  <p>The projected path of the car would bring it close to Mars, but Musk has said there is only an “extremely tiny” chance that it might crash into the planet. If it stays on course, it would instead drift through space, potentially for millions of years.</p>

  <p><em>Reporting from Cape Canaveral, Richard Luscombe has spoken with fellow spectators – most in some stage of frazzled awe at the launch they just witnessed.</em></p> 
  <p>Sean Clark and his six-year-old daughter Maia watched the Falcon Heavy power into Florida’s clear blue skies, listened to the double sonic boom as the rocket’s boosters returned to Earth, and declared themselves stunned.</p> 
  <p>“It’s just wow,” said Mr Clark, who got Maia up before dawn to drive across Florida from Newport Richey to watch the launch at the space centre.</p> 
  <p>“It’s a whole new generation of kids getting excited about space. This is her third launch, she’s into space and science and I wanted to keep that interest going for the future. I came here for her future. It’s just amazing what Elon Musk has done and is doing.”</p> 
  <p>Cindy and Patrick Salkeld came from California to watch their first rocket launch. </p> 
  <p>“It was was overwhelming, better than expected, unbelievable. We couldn’t just see it, we could hear it and feel it vibrating the ground. It was emotional,” said Mrs Salkeld.</p> 
  <p>Elon Musk, her husband said, was “brilliant”.</p> 
  <p>“It’s incredible that not only did he get that rocket up there, but then he lands those two pieces right back on the ground upright, right on the circle. How on earth do you do that, it was spectacular.”</p> 
  <p><em>Nearby were other reporters, including Miriam Kramer for Mashable. She filmed the launch, capturing the liftoff’s roar. It’s palpable. </em></p>

  <p>It’s difficult to overstate what SpaceX has just accomplished: it’s successfully introduced a new heavy rocket to the world, the most powerful in operation and second only to the Apollo era, all through a private company and at a fraction of a cost of other systems currently in construction.</p> 
  <p>Nasa is working on its own heavy launch system, called the SLS, but it is estimated to cost about a billion dollars per flight. SpaceX estimates that Falcon Heavy launches will cost about $90m per flight.</p> 
  <p>What’s more, just a few years ago the notion of re-landing reusable rockets seemed like a pipe dream, and yet SpaceX has made it routine, with regular landings on land and on a drone ship floating in the Atlantic Ocean. Today it managed to land two Falcon 9 rockets simultaneously, each dropping gracefully from the sky with a controlled burn.</p>

  <p>Stage 2 Kerosene loading just finished on the rocket. The 3.45pm launch target is still on course. Elon Musk has clicked the “<a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/960949244982018049">holy mouse click</a>”. </p> 
  <p>But looming at this launch is a question: <strong>What if the rocket explodes?</strong></p> 
  <p>If the Falcon Heavy flies high enough above the Cape Canaveral so that an explosion doesn’t damage the launchpad – and then it explodes – Elon Musk has said he would call the day a success.</p> 
  <p>He estimated the chances of a fully successful launch, from takeoff through separations and landing, at somewhere around 50.50. Not only is SpaceX testing its new rocket, but also a system to separate side boosters in flight, and to simultaneously land the three main boosters after separation.</p>

  <p>The rocket will have to reach a high altitude to spare the base: its fuel has the explosive equivalent of four million pounds of TNT, Musk told reporters on Monday.</p> 
  <p>An explosion on the pad would cause massive damage. In September 2016, a smaller Falcon 9 exploded on a separate launch zone at Cape Canaveral, forcing it closed for repairs for over a year afterward. A Falcon Heavy explosion at the 39A launchpad could require closure and repairs for nine months to a year, Musk said.</p>

  <p>The boosters are fueled, less than an hour till they’re scheduled to fire, the explosive culmination of a billionaire’s ambitions years in the making.</p> 
  <p>Elon Musk’s has wanted to revolutionize spaceflight <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jan/05/spacex-mission-reusable-rockets-elon-musk">for over a decade</a>, and the Falcon Heavy is central to realizing his dreams. </p> 
  <p>If SpaceX can manage a successful launch, the Heavy will be the most powerful rocket currently in operation anywhere in the world. Its boosters – modified reusable rockets, bolted together – can provide five million pounds of thrust and move 140,000lb of cargo into low earth orbit. </p> 
  <p>The rocket could help build a new space station above the moon, carry new telecom or spy satellites, and shuttle people to deep space destinations. Last February SpaceX said it intends to send two private citizens<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/27/spacex-moon-private-mission-2018-elon-musk"> on a trip around the moon</a>, possibly as soon as this year.</p> 
  <p>Most importantly for SpaceX, the rocket would be vastly cheaper than government alternatives. Nasa is working on its own heavy rocket, called the Space Launch System, which remains untested and is projected to cost around $1bn per flight. The Falcon Heavy would cost less than a tenth of that, at $90m per flight.</p>

  <p><em>Richard Luscombe is in Cape Canaveral to watch the launch – the rocket is being fueled on schedule for a targeted 3.45pm launch, after hours of delay.</em></p> 
  <p>Hundreds of thousands of eager spectators have packed the beaches and other decent vantage points around Florida’s space coast in anticipation of what promises to be the most spectacular rocket launch since Nasa’s space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011.</p> 
  <p>At the Kennedy Space Centre, there is a party atmosphere at the Saturn V visitor centre just 3.9 miles from the Falcon Heavy launchpad, where visitors paid $195 per ticket for a prime viewing site. Spectators sheltered in the bleachers from the Florida sun under sunhats and umbrellas, drinking beer and champagne and eating sandwiches and fried chicken as they await the launch.</p> 
  <p>There are also long lines at the souvenir stand for T-shirts and mission patches, while cheers greet any announcement from launch control over the loudspeakers, even news of delays, all prolonging the party. Nobody seemed to mind that SpaceX put back the originally scheduled launch time of 1.30pm until 3.45pm because of strong winds in the upper atmosphere.</p> 
  <p>Children whose parents allowed them to miss school for the day are passing the time by building rockets from sets of Lego laid out for them on the lawn.</p> 
  <p>“Watching a rocket launch is almost a bucket-list thing for a lot of people, and the causeways are always packed for any kind of launch. But this one’s going to be big,” said Dale Ketcham, a senior manager at Space Florida, the state agency that promotes the aerospace industry.</p>

  <p>Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the first ever launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket, a gigantic new rocket from the private spaceflight company SpaceX, which hopes to use it for missions to the moon, Mars and other deep space ventures. </p> 
  <p>SpaceX has set a launch time for 3.45pm eastern – a slim 15-minute window to 4pm, at which point the company will cancel launch and try again Wednesday. The company already delayed for over three hours today, citing high winds.</p> 
  <p>The rocket’s payload is a Tesla Roadster owned by Elon Musk, the billionaire founder of both the automaker and SpaceX. The rocket will launch the car on a course to approach Mars, playing David Bowie’s Space Oddity on a loop.</p> 
  <p>Musk’s aspirations for the Falcon Heavy are less whimsical, if still ambitious. The next generation rocket, should it succeed, will be the second-most powerful ever after the Nasa’s Saturn V, which the space agency used in the Apollo moon missions. </p> 
  <p>Along with the company’s Falcon 9 rocket, which has become a reliable, reusable rocket that lands after launch, the Falcon Heavy is central to Musk’s hope of making spaceflight cheaper and easier for governments, businesses, scientists and, someday, citizens.</p> 
  <p>But the rocket has to get off the pad first. SpaceX rockets have exploded before, most destructively in September 2016, forcing extensive launchpad repairs. And it took many failed landings before SpaceX managed to stand one of its reusable rockets upright after flight.</p> 
  <p>If the launch succeeds, SpaceX will then attempt to land its three first-stage rocket boosters, which are essentially modified Falcon 9s. Two will return to landing zones at Cape Canaveral, and one would fly to a barge in the Atlantic that the company uses as an additional landing pad.</p> 
  <p>Musk has downplayed expectations for Tuesday’s launch. “There is so much that can go wrong,” he told reporters on Monday. “We don’t want to set expectations of perfection.”</p> 
  <p>“The weather’s looking good, the rocket’s looking good. It’s going to be exciting one way or the other, it’s either going to be an exciting test or an exciting failure – one big boom.”</p>
