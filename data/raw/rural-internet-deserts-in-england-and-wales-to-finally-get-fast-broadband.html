<p>The last corners of England and Wales yet to be covered by a £5bn push to widen fast broadband could finally get access to rapid downloads, streaming and video calls after the government announced £289m in new taxpayer-funded contracts enabling coverage.</p> <p>After some people in broadband blackspots were forced to turn to <a href="https://ambitionnorth.wales/media/bsihlpcv/cs-rdc-lakesidecafe.pdf">Elon Musk’s Starlink</a> satellite-enabled internet connections, the latest deals to boost connectivity should give 131,000 households and businesses in village and rural internet deserts gigabit-level fibre coverage – allowing a high-definition movie to be downloaded in around a minute.</p> <p>The announcement comes after years of frustration over a mostly rural-urban digital divide. Campaigners have said slow internet in the countryside inhibits business, restricts access to online health and education services, and can worsen social isolation.</p> <p>The new contracts to lay full-fibre connections in areas not reached by private investment would apply in north Wales, including Anglesey, south-west Wales, Shropshire, Herefordshire, Devon, Somerset, Essex and the north-east of England, the Department of Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) announced.</p> <p>Mari Rees-Stavros, who owns a cafe in Blaenau Ffestiniog, surrounded by the Eryri national park, in north Wales, told the Guardian the lack of fast broadband had been “horrendous” and that despite contracting three broadband providers she had “lost an awful lot of money” when her internet-connected payment systems failed, meaning customers couldn’t pay. Instead she decided to use Musk’s Starlink, which costs from £80 a month.</p> <p>Further publicly funded coverage contracts are expected to be awarded to bring similar gigabit broadband speeds to blackspots in Scotland and Northern Ireland later this year, as a government target for gigabit broadband to be available across the UK by 2030 comes into sight.</p> <p>The government has previously committed to tackle another serious bugbear of some urban as well as many rural lives, by getting 4G mobile phone coverage to at least 95% of the UK by the end of 2025.</p> <p>The digital inclusion charity the Good Things Foundation welcomed the further funding for what is known as Project Gigabit, but Emma Stone, its director of evidence and engagement, said: “Fixing the UK’s digital divide means addressing affordability, digital skills, and other barriers that hold people back from fully engaging with the digital world. This is where we need to see action and investment across government.”</p> <p>Peter Kyle, the technology secretary, said: “We are not only boosting connectivity, but making it easier to access remote healthcare, online education, shopping online, work, learn, shop and stay in touch with loved ones online.” DSIT said 85% of households could currently access gigabit broadband, leaving more than 4 million households still without fast connections that allow multiple devices surfing, streaming and downloading at the same time.</p> <p>Kerry Booth, the chief executive of the Rural Services Network, which represents rural councils, market towns and parishes, said: “High-speed internet is not just a utility; it’s a lifeline that enables business growth, educational advancement, and access to essential services such as healthcare. As we move towards a more connected future, it is vital that rural areas are not left behind.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 7 January 2025.
