<h2>Johnny Vegas: Art, ADHD and Me</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Johnny Vegas (and his “longsuffering personal assistant” Bev) is hugely endearing in this two-parter following his public art project. The comedian graduated from art college 25 years ago and is committed to making a sculpture that gives something back to his beloved home town of St Helens – a welcome departure from other recent celebrity art exhibitions. His journey was filmed over four years; along the way, we see him navigate a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>MasterChef</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>The BBC has made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/23/bbc-to-show-masterchef-series-already-filmed-with-gregg-wallace-and-john-torode">the surprising decision</a> to air the new series of the long-running cooking competition, despite the judges <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/10/gregg-wallace-dropped-from-bbc-over-lack-of-confidence-he-could-change-behaviour">Gregg Wallace</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/15/john-torode-bbc-masterchef-contract-racist-language-allegation">John Torode</a> having been sacked. Fans and contestants – although not Sarah Shafi, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/31/masterchef-contestant-edited-out-after-asking-for-new-series-not-to-be-broadcast">who has been edited out</a> after telling the show’s producers she did not want it to be broadcast – may argue that their enjoyment shouldn’t be ruined because of the action taken. <em>HR</em></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/31/masterchef-contestant-edited-out-after-asking-for-new-series-not-to-be-broadcast">MasterChef contestant edited out after asking for new series not to be broadcast</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Destination X</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong></p>    <p>Rob Brydon’s competition blindfolds contestants, sends them on a bus around Europe and asks them to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/25/destination-x-tv-players-dont-know-where-are-bbc-one-rob-brydon">guess where they are</a> at the end of each episode. With so many red herrings and impossibly hard clues, applying logic feels futile. Still, it’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/30/destination-x-review-rob-brydon-the-traitors-meets-race-across-the-world">weirdly addictive</a>. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>The Moors Murders: A Search for Justice</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>Nearly 60 years have passed since Ian Brady and Myra Hindley were tried and convicted, but the remains of a 12-year-old victim, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/oct/02/moors-murder-keith-bennett-brother-voices-frustration-search">Keith Bennett</a>, are yet to be found. The second episode of this documentary continues to analyse new evidence and leads in the hope of finally bringing the case to a close. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2>The Fortune Hotel</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong><strong><br></strong>If <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/19/a-pr-dream-or-disaster-jet2s-holiday-advert-finds-new-life-as-joke-meme">Jet2 holidays</a> did The Traitors … Stephen Mangan returns as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/may/13/the-fortune-hotel-review-a-fiendishly-addictive-mix-of-the-traitors-and-white-lotus">a trickster Caribbean hotel manager</a> who gives each team of two guests a suitcase – most of them empty, one with an “early checkout card” in it and another holding a £250,000 prize. Before they start guessing and swapping, they need to get into the hotel – but there isn’t room for everyone. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Air India Crash: What Went Wrong?</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>A quick turnaround enables this documentary to assess, two months on, why a London-bound Air India jet hit buildings in Ahmedabad just after takeoff, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/air-india-plane-crash-ai171-safety-record-scrutinised-ntwnfb">killing 260 people</a>.
