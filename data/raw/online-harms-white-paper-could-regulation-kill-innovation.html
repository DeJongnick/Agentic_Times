<p>It’s rare to describe a government white paper as “trendy”, but among the small community of people who think deeply about how to rein in the the power of big tech, that’s exactly how these proposals will be seen.</p> <p>The online harms white paper attempts a neat magic trick that tries to offer regulation that won’t scare away the titans of technology, while still providing enough teeth to ease the tabloid campaigns for accountability and action.</p> <p>It describes a collection of serious harms that are created or facilitated by the internet, from the widespread and rapid dissemination of terrorist propaganda to the proliferation of child sexual exploitation and abuse (CSEA) imagery, as well as other issues such as online disinformation, promotion of suicide and self-harm, and cyberbullying and harassment.</p> <p>It suggests strong enforcement powers to prevent these harms, including not only the standard fines, but also the ability to force internet service providers to block offenders, to force third parties to disrupt their activities by, for instance, removing them from search results, and even to impose fines personally on senior management.</p> <p>But then, just as companies like Facebook and Google may begin sweating uncomfortably, it provides the reassuring sense that the regulation will be as soft, fuzzy and arm’s-length as possible. Not only is the government proposing a regulator that would handle the direct enforcement action, but the regulator will then have to define a duty of care that internet companies must provide. That regulator must also define a code of best practices that internet companies can follow to show that they are fulfilling that duty of care.</p> <p>Those codes could require sweeping changes to online platforms: the best practices to prevent disinformation, for instance, by calling for fact-checking services on platforms, hindering the reach of content that has been marked as false, promoting authoritative news sources, and improving the transparency of political advertising. But these best practices are provided as examples not requirements. Companies are free to argue that they are fulfilling their duty of care in other ways, and the regulator is free to decide to focus only on the largest online platforms anyway.</p> <p>In some areas, the white paper shows lessons learned from other efforts to regulate the internet. Requirements in UK and Australian legislation to help law enforcement read encrypted messages led to such a backlash that they have never been applied in practice; the new white paper instead specifically notes that requirements to scan for harmful content don’t apply to private channels. </p> <p>But a recent proposal from the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission for an independent body to review the algorithms used by online media platforms was not only well received by analysts, it was shortly followed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/01/why-am-i-seeing-this-new-facebook-tool-to-demystify-news-feed">a new feature from Facebook allowing users to do just that</a>. So it’s not surprising to see the white paper argue that the regulator should have the power to demand information about the impact of algorithms in selecting content for users.</p> <p>The tightrope the government is walking is a narrow one. It wants the UK, the white paper says, to become safest place in the world to go online, and also the best place to start and grow a digital business.</p> <p>That may be a perfectly reasonable goal, if the UK can achieve its aim of leading the way in responsible legislation while watching others follow largely the same route. Or it could be a dangerous attempt to have its cake and eat it, creating a regulator without the power to prevent the worst abuses, but with just enough power to scare away the best innovations.</p>
