<p>Donald Trump has cancelled plans for a deployment of federal troops to the San Francisco Bay Area that had sparked widespread condemnation from California leaders and sent protesters flooding into the streets.</p> <p>The region had been on edge after reports emerged on Wednesday that the Trump administration was poised to send more than 100 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other federal agents to the US Coast Guard base in Alameda, across the Bay from San Francisco, as part of a large-scale immigration enforcement plan.</p> <p>But on Thursday, the president said he would not move forward with a “surge” of federal forces in the area after speaking with the mayor, Daniel Lurie, and Silicon Valley leaders including Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO who recently apologized for saying Trump should send national guard troops, and Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia.</p>  <h2>Trump cancels plans to send federal troops to San Francisco for immigration crackdown</h2>  <p>Lurie said he spoke with the president on Wednesday night, and that Trump told him he would call off the deployment.</p> <p>“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco.
