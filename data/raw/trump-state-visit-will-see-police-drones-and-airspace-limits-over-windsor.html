<p>Donald Trump’s second state visit to the UK will see a big policing operation led by drones in the airspace over Windsor, police have said.</p> <p>King Charles is to host the US president and his wife, Melania Trump, at Windsor Castle from 17 to 19 September, where they will be entertained with a ceremonial welcome and state banquet.</p> <p>A round-the-clock policing operation will be in place in the Berkshire town during the event, with a temporary order restricting the airspace from 16 September – when the state visit rehearsal is to take place – until 18 September.</p> <p>This means non-police drones and smaller aircraft cannot fly through the protected area, Thames Valley police officers said on Monday during a drone-flying demonstration at the force’s training centre in Sulhamstead, Berkshire.</p> <p>The Stop Trump Coalition is to stage a mass demonstration in central London on the first day of the trip, with a further protest planned near Windsor Castle.</p> <p>Each police drone can fly up to 120 metres (400ft) and is expected to stay up for 30 minutes at a time during the operation, with the replacement drone taking off shortly before the end of that period so as not to lose coverage.</p> <p>The DJI Matrice 30T model introduced during the demonstration on Monday is already used by police on a day-to-day basis, usually as part of missing persons inquiries and drug warrants, officers said.</p> <p>“It’s a significant policing operation for us,” Ch Insp Matthew Wilkinson of Thames Valley police’s joint operations unit said.</p> <p>“However, Thames Valley police is proud to host these events and we have a good history of putting on these events for both the royal family and the country.”</p> <p>Asked about the scale of the drone operation for the US president’s state visit compared with other high profile events, Wilkinson replied: “It’s one of the larger ones. It’s in line with other large-scale events we’ve put on as a force.”</p> <p>Speaking on the restricted airspace order, he said: “Obviously it’s an offence to fly a drone in a restricted airspace and we will have resources to deal with any of those incursions.</p> <p>“We will have plenty of capability in the sky when the time is appropriate,” he said, adding that the drones will act as an “eye in the sky” during the event.</p> <p>It will be Trump’s second state visit to the UK – an unprecedented gesture towards a US president – after he came in 2019.</p> <p>His first trip to the UK saw thousands of people turn out on the streets in London in opposition.</p>
