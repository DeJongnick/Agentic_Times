<p>Emma Brockes’ article threw open the door to landline memories (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/31/worried-child-screentime-landline-parents-maine-drastic-step">Worried about your child’s screentime? Get a landline, 31 July</a>). When it rang, the enthusiasm that came with the conviction “it’s for me” v the reluctance when seemingly knowing “it’s not for me”. This was undoubtedly because the phone in a cold hallway meant no one wanted to leave the warmth and TV in the sitting room. <br><strong>Virginia Ranscombe</strong><br><em>Derbyhaven, Isle of Man</em></p> <p>• I can’t believe it has taken 40&nbsp;years and a thinktank to realise the bleeding obvious about the sale of council housing (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/03/right-to-buy-england-fuelled-housing-crisis-cost-taxpayers-common-weath-report">Right to buy in England ‘fuelled housing crisis and cost taxpayers £200bn’, 3 August</a>). Wrong policy from the very beginning – and the fact it continued for so long is nothing short of scandalous.<br><strong>Margaret Vandecasteele</strong><br><em>Cupar, Fife</em></p> <p>• Moving away from cremation and biodegradable burial (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/30/green-burials-the-biodegradable-alternative">Letters, 30 July</a>), why aren’t more people donating their bodies to medical research? There is a national shortage at present. No miserable funeral, but if your nearest and dearest want to have a get together to recognise your life, they can. And that’s free.<br><strong>Dr Derek Middlemiss</strong><br><em>Collingham, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>• RIP Tom Lehrer (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/29/tom-lehrer-obituary">Obituary, 29 July</a>). Still crazily prophetic after all these years: “When the air becomes uraneous / We will all go simultaneous” (We Will All Go Together When We Go, 1958).<br><strong>Noel Hess</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• Songs by actors ranked (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jul/31/best-songs-by-actors-ranked">31 July</a>) and no Lee Marvin with&nbsp;Wand’rin’ Star.
