<p>Psychologist Cláudia Rodrigues de Oliveira Barbosa, 54, needs to be at work by 7.40am, but she wakes up at 3.40am – not because she has a lengthy commute, but to watch a “dawn prayer” livestream on YouTube.</p> <p>She is one of the millions of Brazilians who tune in to the 4am sermons of Catholic friar Gilson da Silva Pupo Azevedo, 38, known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FreiGilsonSomdoMonteOFICIAL/streams">Frei Gilson</a>, who has recently averaged an impressive 2m daily views for each video.</p> <p>“Some people find it odd that I wake up so early to pray with him, but it’s a time when the house is quiet and you’re disconnected from the world,” said Barbosa, who lives with her husband and two teenage boys.</p> <p>The habit of rising early to watch prayer livestreams is <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/noticia/2025/06/15/fe-que-nao-dorme-com-pico-de-visualizacoes-nas-madrugadas-lives-de-oracoes-viram-fenomeno-no-youtube.ghtml">growing rapidly</a> in the country, which is home to the world’s largest Catholic population.</p> <p>Frei Gilson is <a href="https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2025/03/frei-gilson-vira-coqueluche-da-direita-com-discurso-conservador-e-lives-na-madrugada.shtml">the most prominent</a> of a number of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@institutohesed/streams">religious leaders</a> who have become livestreamers, and experts say the trend suggests that Brazil may be a testing ground for religious influencers updating Catholic rituals to keep them alive.</p> <p>“The Catholic church is trying to renew itself through digital missionaries, and I would say that Brazil is a major exporter of ideas to the Catholic world,” said religion scholar Rodrigo Toniol, professor of anthropology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>The shift comes at worrying moment for the church: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/brazil-catholics-evangelicals-religion-census">census data</a> released this year showed that while three decades ago Catholics made up 82.9% of Brazilians, they now account for just over half of the population.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/brazil-catholics-evangelicals-religion-census">Catholics now make up little more than half Brazil’s population</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even so, they still comprise 56.7% of the 213 million people, with the second-largest faith group – evangelicals – accounting for 26.9%.</p> <p>“I’ve always prayed the chaplet and the rosary since I was a child; but the dawn livestreams are new,” said Danielle de Freitas Silva, 40, a dentist who recently spent 40 consecutive days waking before sunrise to pray with Frei Gilson.</p> <p>“I’m exhausted, because its tough waking up at 4am and then carrying on with a normal work routine – with a young daughter … but in that moment I truly feel close to Jesus,” she added.</p> <p>Frei Gilson did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for an interview, but recently said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGlnFTrs5lY">a podcast</a> that he began the early morning prayers in 2020, as a personal penance during Lent: “Giving up sweets and soda no longer felt like much of a sacrifice, so I thought that I could give my sleep to God,” he said.</p> <p>His broadcasts have grown year by year, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1BQ0RW1-U0">some videos</a> now surpassing 4m views. A recent 40-day rosary period dedicated to Saint Michael ended with a <a href="https://g1.globo.com/sp/vale-do-paraiba-regiao/noticia/2025/09/28/show-e-missa-de-frei-gilson-lotam-arena-da-cancao-nova-veja-fotos.ghtml">4am event</a> attended in person by 37,000 people in Cachoeira Paulista, and also livestreamed.</p> <p>YouTube did not release viewing figures but a spokesperson said that, particularly since 2024, “we have seen a real boom in live prayer broadcasts” in Brazil, which have experienced “exponential growth”.</p> <p>Evangelical leaders, such as Pastor Vinicius Iracet, 38, who has more than 11 million subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ViniciusIracet/streams">his YouTube channel</a>, have also embraced the trend</p> <p>Iracet said he has more Catholic than evangelical viewers, something relatively surprising given that some Brazilian Catholics are reluctant to consume Protestant content.</p> <p>“I don’t talk about religion, but about Christ and his word,” said Iracet, who also insisted he does not discuss politics: “I have my political views, but I don’t share them because I think it would create more problems than help those who follow me.”</p> <p>Frei Gilson was associated with the former president Jair Bolsonaro after being <a href="https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/articles/cn89295y7jzo">briefly mentioned</a> in the police inquiry into the far-right leader’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/11/brazil-supreme-court-bolsonaro-guilty-coup">attempted coup</a>. The friar was allegedly the recipient of a “coup prayer” sent by one of those under investigation, but no link between him and the case was ever established. </p> <p>For researcher Magali Cunha of the NGO <a href="https://iser.org.br/">Institute for the Study of Religion</a>, the apolitical character of most prayer livestreamers also explains their growth, after years of polarisation during which priests and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/07/god-jair-bolsonaro-brazil-evangelicals-apocalypse-in-the-tropics-christian-fundamentalists">pastors took increasingly outspoken political stances</a> – usually in support of rightwing or far-right candidates.</p> <p>“Political disputes have divided families and churches … so many of the people joining the livestreams see these digital spaces as a chance to disconnect from this polarised world,” she said.</p> <p>Both Cunha and Toniol agree that the livestream prayers phenomenon, although amplified by social media, is in many ways an update of longstanding habits such as listening to sermons on the radio or spending the night in prayer.</p> <p>“As Catholicism loses some of its appeal and people no longer practice as much as before, the logic of these influencers is to ritualise people’s daily lives with a prayer, a hymn, a devotion,” said Toniol, who recently returned from a postdoctoral fellowship in Rome, where he attended a Vatican meeting for digital missionaries.</p> <p>“The Catholic church, this powerful 2,000-year-old institution, is a master at transforming itself to overcome crises … Phenomena such as that of Frei Gilson show that Brazil remains predominantly Catholic, and that Catholicism, far from dying, is reinventing itself,” he added.</p>
