<p>The government is facing another <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/06/government-faces-battle-over-send-overhaul-as-campaigners-voice-fears">political battle</a> as backbench MPs, campaigners and parents have voiced concern at plans to overhaul support in England for children and young people with special educational needs or disabilities (Send).</p> <p>The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, aims to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/03/schools-england-complex-changes-special-needs-pupils-review-says">remodel special needs provision</a>, as the numbers of children and young people requiring Send support is reaching record levels and exhausting school and council budgets. Government proposals are expected as part of a schools white paper due in October.</p> <p>Parents, campaigners, councils and politicians are broadly in agreement that the current system is failing children and has been for years. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/07/david-blunkett-ministers-incredible-sensitivity-send-ehcps-england">many fear</a> changes will restrict or phase out the use of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/07/what-is-send-labour-backlash-overhaul-plans-england">education, health and care plans (EHCPs)</a> – potentially affecting 638,700 children and young people – which give statutory force to support for children and young people assessed as having special needs or disabilities.</p> <p>We want to hear from you. Are you a parent or teacher of a child with special educational needs or disabilities? What are your views on potential changes to the system? For parents, what impact might restricting the use of EHCPs have on your family? For parents and teachers, how would you like to see the system improved?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="5c65c8e2-5815-4499-9e32-754e3c11dadf" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <ul> <li><p><em><strong>If you’re having trouble using the form click <a href="https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/send_parents">here</a>.
