<p>A former Greens candidate has been injured after allegedly resisting police arrest while picketing a business in Sydney’s west, with friends and family warned she may lose sight in her right eye.</p> 
<p>The protest, which attracted between 50 and 60 people, sought to stop pedestrian access to a business that was accused by protesters of “supplying electroplating and surface coating services for a variety of applications including aerospace and defence technology” to Israel.</p> 
<p>The Greens alleged the company was reportedly “involved in providing plating services for various parts used in F-35 jets” used by the Israeli military.</p> 
<p>According to police, officers issued a move-on direction to the protesters at about 5.30am on Friday.</p> 
<p>The force alleged the protest was “unauthorised”, as those involved had not given advanced notice nor submitted a form that protected them from being charged under anti-protest laws.</p>

<p>Hannah Thomas, who ran against Anthony Albanese in the Sydney electorate of Grayndler, allegedly declined to comply with the order and was forcibly removed and arrested.</p> 
<p>Police said Thomas, 35, sustained facial injuries during the arrest and was taken to Bankstown hospital for treatment.</p> 
<p>Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said the police’s alleged behaviour was “atrocious” and she was “shocked” by the arrests and alleged injuries.</p> 
<p>“Hannah’s health is my top priority. Once she is able to consider next steps, she has my full support in responding to this … and seeking accountability.”</p> 
<p>Images of Thomas online showed her right eye was badly swollen and bruised. It was not known how the injury was sustained.</p> 
<p>“As police attempted to arrest the protesters who were not complying with the directions, a scuffle ensued between police and protesters, during which a police body worn camera was taken by an unknown protester,” the police statement continued.</p> 
<p>New South Wales Greens MLC Sue Higginson said the protest was peaceful and claimed Thomas was the “victim of brutal excessive force by the police”.</p> 
<p>“The last we heard, about an hour ago, was that Hannah was still in a state, the extent of her injuries was unclear,” Higginson said.</p> 
<p>“The prognosis provided to family earlier was that they could not tell the extent of her injuries until there was a full examination because the swelling was too severe and that it was possible she may lose vision in that eye.</p> 
<p>“That she may have sustained injuries to the bones of her face, but nothing has been confirmed at this point.”</p> 
<p>One of those arrested, Zack Schofield, 26, alleged the force used by police was “excessive” and “will be put into question”. Schofield was charged with allegedly failing or refusing to comply with a move-on direction.</p>

<p>Higginson said Thomas’s friends and family were “all deeply stressed and anxious about the injuries that she sustained”.</p> 
<p>The state Greens MLC said all protests were lawful and that those “reserving their right to engage in non-violent civil disobedience deserve to be treated fairly, respectfully and non-violently under the laws of NSW”.</p> 
<p>“For the police to say this was an unauthorised protest is just a nonsense narrative,” Higginson said. “All protests are lawful in terms of the gathering of people on public land.”</p> 
<p>All five people arrested were granted conditional bail to appear before Bankstown local court on 15 July.</p>
