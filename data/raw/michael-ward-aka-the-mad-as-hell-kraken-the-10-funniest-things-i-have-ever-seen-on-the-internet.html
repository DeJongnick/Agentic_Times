<p>I’ve just taken six hours to write this sentence. Yep, the damned internet got in the way. The procrastinator’s friend, I call it. There I was, writing this introduction when one innocent YouTube diversion led to another, which led to another, which led to – forget rabbit hole, I believe “rabbit warren” is the appropriate metaphor.</p> <p>I wish I had the willpower to disconnect, I really do. I’d definitely get loads more writing done. But there’s the internet, like some grinning lunatic plonked beside me, constantly elbowing me in the ribs, chortling, “Hey, check this out!”</p> <p>Anyway, below are 10 funny things I have, indeed, been checking out while (eventually) typing the paragraphs you’ve just read.</p> <h2><strong>1. The Shining as a romcom</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6QgNuZcxTw"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k6QgNuZcxTw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I remember, in 1980, being thrilled by the imminent arrival of The Shining (“<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/taglines/">The Tide of Terror that Swept America is Here</a>”). Forty-five years later, it remains an unnerving haunted house (or hotel) film. This reimagined trailer, turning Kubrick’s existential dread into shmaltzy comedy, is utterly perfect, particularly the tone of the voice over and the use (and timing) of Peter Gabriel’s Solsbury Hill.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>2. Dancing in the Street silent music video</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHkhIjG0DKc"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BHkhIjG0DKc?wmode=opaque" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Mick and Dave were already taking the piss in this 1985 music video, considered among the worst music videos ever made. But this shred – music stripped and replaced with a hotch-potch of lo-fi sound effects – renders the singers’ campy moves totally hilarious.</p> <h2><strong>3. Kreepy Spooks – The Micallef P(r)ogram(me)</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD54qVMNFTU"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fD54qVMNFTU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I was fortunate to be a contributing writer on The Micallef P(r)ogram(me)’s three series. As sketch comedy, it remains, in my opinion, the best Australia has produced. So, so smart. I’ve been quoting the line “They seem to love it!” from Kreepy Spooks (written by Shaun) for far too long.</p> <h2><strong>4. Scooby-Doo – ‘And I would have got away with it too’ supercut</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JV3tUPlYn98"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JV3tUPlYn98?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The original Scooby-Doo was a staple of the cartoon-fest that was school holidays TV during the 70s. The unmasked villain’s pissed-off reaction to being outwitted by a hippy and his dog has long since passed into pop culture vernacular.</p> <h2><strong>5. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey hosting the Golden Globes</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7ZHmrC4QwQ"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/i7ZHmrC4QwQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I’m bang up for a good awards show monologue, and as a host pairing, funny women Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are hard to beat. Great material, fantastic chemistry, amazing timing.</p> <h2><strong>6. Big Train – Jockeys in the Wild</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIIAQME1Uhg"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TIIAQME1Uhg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>For me, UK series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/25/big-train-cult-comedy">Big Train</a> is still the gold standard for all sketch comedy, particularly the first series, in 1998. Pastiche was a favourite of creators Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan, brilliantly exemplified here by this absurd – and perfectly pitched – riff on the nature doco.</p> <h2><strong>7. Tony Abbott’s 28-second silence</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wT9XS_TvzQ"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9wT9XS_TvzQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Tony Abbott was a wellspring of comic material for the writers of Mad As Hell. The then PM might have been chomping on a raw onion like it was a granny smith or winking at a radio host during a sex worker’s talkback phone-in or delivering any number of verbal gaffes. In this clip, a wire appears to have come loose in Tony’s brain machine.</p> <h2><strong>8. Family Guy – If More People Join in the Song Will Get Better</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac3_oXyLlAY"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ac3_oXyLlAY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Unlike The Simpsons, which I used to watch religiously, most of my Family Guy consumption has been via social media memes. This dig at Broadway musicals is typical of the show’s sarcastic sense of humour.</p> <h2><strong>9. Doctor Who – ‘No Complications’</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LTOpfJAcGA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4LTOpfJAcGA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I’ve loved Doctor Who since its black and white days. This clip, from the 1973 (colour) Jon Pertwee story Frontier in Space, never fails to make me laugh. The actor playing the brutish Ogron is commendably in character for his first line, before inexplicably dropping character a moment later.</p> <h2><strong>10. Peter Serafinowicz on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/Fletchy_3088/status/1615847397116227584">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’d say of all funny moments in 8 out of 10 Cats Does Countdown, this is my favourite.

Here, however, he’s playing a version of himself … who seems to genuinely surprise host Jimmy Carr with his response to Jimmy’s innocuous question.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Michael Ward’s supernatural comedy <a href="https://chapeloffchapel.com.au/show/the-haunting-of-spook-mansion-by-ghosts/">The Haunting of Spook Mansion (By Ghosts)</a> is at Chapel Off Chapel, Melbourne from 12-23 November.</em></p></li> </ul>
