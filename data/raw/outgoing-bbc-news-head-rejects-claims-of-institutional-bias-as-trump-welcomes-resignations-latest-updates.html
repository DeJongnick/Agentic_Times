We’ve all focused on the Trump interview, but there was stuff about gender issues, there was stuff about race, there was stuff about Gaza and I think when you put all those things collectively together, we understand.”</p> <p>Urban added:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>And if you have been in meetings as I have for many years, you have seen the BBC change in recent years. </em></p> <p><em>I think in common with many other news organisations and many other publicly funded organisations, but you have seen that much more for want of a better word ‘woke’ tendency among younger members of staff and the tension between young and old and of course that is what’s burst out here.</em></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6911b6858f087353b0fc6782" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-10T10:02:36.329Z">10.02am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here are some more comments from the outgoing BBC News head <strong>Deborah Turness</strong>, who answered questions on her way into BBC broadcasting house in central London this morning.</p> <p><em><strong>Journalist:</strong> Do you think that the journalists are corrupt like President Trump says?</em><br><br><em><strong>Turness:</strong></em> <em>Of course our journalists aren’t corrupt.
