Financial markets are on tenterhooks to see what executive orders newly elected US President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will enact on his first day. There’s a lot of focus on immigration controls and declaring a national energy emergency to allow more US oil and gas production. Currency markets are most interested in what he has to say about tariffs and what kind of pain the Oval Office plans to inflict on major trade partners. At last week’s nomination hearings, incoming Treasury Secretary <strong>Scott Bessent</strong> said that tariffs would be needed to address unfair trade practices, support government revenue, and to be used as a negotiating tool. </p> <p>In terms of what is currently priced for tariffs by financial markets, we find the online prediction websites quite useful, such as Polymarket and Kalshi. Polymarket is running a book on which countries will receive US tariffs in Trump’s first week. China is priced at 56%, Mexico at 54%, Canada at 45% and the European Union at just 7%. There is also the case – using Scott Bessent’s remarks about tariffs as negotiating tools – that the new administration goes in on tariffs hard at the outset. That is why after a near 10% rally from late September, the dollar today is less than one percent off its recent high.</p> <p>Of course, there will be the risk of a correction in the dollar should it look like Trump will be more selective on tariffs after all – but that should probably come at a later stage. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Thursday could also be an important day for markets this week, when Trump is due to have a digital dialogue with leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-678dff9e8f08e357fb1e29c0" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-01-20T07:48:41.833Z">7.48am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Victoria Hasler</strong>, head of fund research at Hargreaves Lansdown, has looked at what Trump’s second presidency could mean for markets:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>A new year, a new president. The lead up to Trump’s presidency has been noisy and, at times, divisive. Markets hate uncertainty though, and the simple fact of having the new president settled in the White House may prove to be a good thing for markets. Over the next few weeks and months, we (and the rest of the world) will be watching closely, listening to the speeches and analysing the policies. No doubt some will have a more positive impact on markets than others – expect some fireworks and associated volatility as we navigate the next four years.</p> <p>This notwithstanding, there are good reasons to believe that the impact on the US stock market could be positive, and particularly so for smaller companies. Because trade tariffs, Trump’s most talked-about policy, favour domestic businesses over international conglomerates, and smaller companies are usually more domestically focused. During campaigning, and since the election, we heard a lot about tariffs. We expect the reality to be a little more muted than the campaign chat, but nonetheless at least some new tariffs are likely, particularly when it comes to Chinese trade.</p> <p>At the same time, we have the supportive backdrop of monetary policy easing. While we don’t expect interest rates to fall as quickly as originally anticipated, they are almost certainly on a downward trajectory. Historically, small companies have tended to perform well relative to their larger counterparts in a falling interest rate environment, which further strengthens the outlook for smaller companies. Add to that the potential for lower personal and corporation taxes in the US and the tailwinds are building for US smaller companies.</p> <p>Looking a little further afield, Trump’s occupancy of the White House could cause some jitters in global equity markets. We have yet to see how his foreign policy will play out, but it could cause tension with certain countries, including China, and tariffs could impact growth in markets which rely on exporting goods to the US. Markets aren’t keen on geopolitical uncertainty, and if tensions escalate, we expect to see increased volatility.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-678df4d88f080f46037def80" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-01-20T07:45:36.582Z">7.45am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Introduction: Bitcoin hits new record high, dollar dips ahead of Trump inauguration</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.</strong></p> <p>Bitcoin, the world’s best-known cryptocurrency, has hit a fresh record high ahead of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s inauguration in Washington DC later today, while the dollar dipped.</p> <p>The president-elect has promised a crypto-friendly administration, pledging to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet” and to create a “strategic national bitcoin reserve” during his election campaign.</p> <p>Trump has launched his own crypto currency – which briefly tanked over the weekend when his wife <strong>Melania</strong> also launched a multi-billion dollar cryptocurrency meme coin.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>bitcoin has risen by 4% and hit a new record high of $109,071</strong> during Asian trading.

Therefore, the first week under Trump <em>may</em> not bring a lot of surprises... (but it may as well!) The WSJ writes that Donald Trump has already prepared 100 – yes 100 – executive orders to take swift action after today’s inauguration, including an order to make crypto a policy priority and giving insiders of the crypto market a good voice within his administration.</p> <p>Trump launched a cryptocurrency of his own on the Solana blockchain and the coin gained up to 600% in three days reaching a $15bn capitalization before easing – a little bit – also sending Solana to a fresh record high.</p> <p>But beyond that optimism, Trump policies are expected to be a double-edged sword. His pro-growth policies and deregulation are expected to benefit to the US economy but his tariff policies will certainly lead inflation higher and soften the Fed doves’ hands for easing policy. In addition, exploding debt levels will likely further push the borrowing costs higher.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump has promised to mark day one of his presidency with a barrage of executive orders targeting illegal immigration, transgender rights and other rightwing priorities.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/trump-pre-inaugural-rally-j6-hostages">Trump promises ‘historic’ day one with barrage of executive orders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>ING analyst <strong>Chris Turner</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Today, all eyes are on Donald Trump’s inauguration as the 47th president of the United States.
