<p>The UK operation of the Chinese online marketplace Temu doubled revenues and pre-tax profits last year, as British consumers snapped up products offered by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/06/addictive-absurdly-cheap-and-controversial-the-rise-of-chinas-temu-app">the super-budget retailer</a>.</p> <p>Temu UK reported revenues of $63.3m (£46.4m) last year, almost double the $32m in 2023, while pre-tax profits similarly surged from $2m to $3.9m, accounts show.</p> <p>However, at an operating level, the company, which files under the name Whaleco UK at Companies House, reported losses widening from $7.9m to $8.7m year-on-year. The company put most of its broadening operating loss down to “exchange losses”.</p> <p>Because of Temu’s small pre-tax profit, the company paid just $985,000 in UK corporation tax, up from $517,000 in 2023.</p> <p>The company’s UK operation reports its income as a “service fee”, similar to how Amazon UK and Google UK operate, and says it generates revenues “through the provision of corporate support services to its affiliated entities”.</p> <p>While Temu is experiencing explosive growth in the UK, it – and others such as cheap fast-fashion compatriot Shein and e-commerce company Amazon – potentially face having to implement price rises after the government announced in April a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/23/rachel-reeves-looks-at-ending-zero-tax-regime-for-low-value-imports">review of a rule that allows small parcels to enter the UK duty-free</a>.</p> <p>The current rule allows international retailers to send packages to Britain worth less than £135 without incurring import taxes. UK retailers have said this rule gives companies such as Temu and Shein an unfair advantage.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/trumps-tariffs-have-hurt-tea-exports-to-the-us-says-fortnum-mason-boss">Trump’s tariffs have hurt tea exports to the US, says Fortnum &amp; Mason boss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier this year, Theo Paphitis, the former Dragons’ Den star whose retail group includes Ryman and Robert Dyas, said the measure was devastating UK high streets.</p> <p>The US has already moved to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/30/trump-de-minimis-tariff-exemption">scrap the “de minimis” exemption for parcels</a> worth less than $800 from 29 August.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the boss of luxury retailer Fortnum &amp; Mason said this was a factor in having to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/17/trumps-tariffs-have-hurt-tea-exports-to-the-us-says-fortnum-mason-boss">significantly increase the cost of products</a> such as luxury tea bought by US customers.</p> <p>In July, Michael McGrath, the European Union justice commissioner, expressed shock at the toxicity and dangers of some goods being sold by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/shein">Shein</a> and Temu.</p> <p>With 12m low-value parcels coming into the EU each day from online retailers outside the bloc, McGrath has vowed to crack down on the sale of goods that blatantly break the law.</p> <p>The EU is also considering the abolition of the €150 (£130) duty-free threshold, and the introduction of a handling fee for each package, which may deter low-value purchases and help pay the cost of extra customs investigations.</p>
