<p>This is partially true, says Dr Thivos Sokratous, medical doctor and hair loss expert at Ouronyx. Most people have 23 pairs of chromosomes that code our genetic makeup, with one pair determining sex. Males are born with an X chromosome, with genes inherited from their mother, and a Y&nbsp;chromosome, from their father.</p> <p>Sokratous says some studies have shown a strong link between the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome (passed down from the mother) and male pattern hair loss, with some suggesting this gene may account for up to 70% of its likelihood. “But male pattern baldness is more&nbsp;complex than that,” he says. “It’s the combination of genes from your mum and your dad alongside other factors.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/21/is-it-true-that-potatoes-are-bad-for-you">Is it true that … potatoes are bad for you?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sokratous says that a predisposition to the condition is usually due to a combination of genes. He adds that your body’s hormonal processes can also cause hair loss. This is because it’s a process that happens in the scalp when the skin converts testosterone to active testosterone. Factors such as anabolic steroid use can raise testosterone levels and worsen this process. Other hormone imbalances, such as those caused by thyroid dysfunction or chronic stress, can contribute to different types of hair loss as well.</p> <p>If you’re worried about hair loss, there are blood tests you can take to see if it’s genetic or hormonal. “It could be due to a disease that can be&nbsp;managed. And, if not, it will help you gain an understanding of what you can expect over the next five, 10,&nbsp;15 years.”</p> <p>Environmental factors can also speed up or slow down the process, says Sokratous. “Are you eating a diet rich in nutrients like zinc, vitamin D, iron and B vitamins? Is your body absorbing them properly? Adjusting your diet can slow things down.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 19 May 2025.
