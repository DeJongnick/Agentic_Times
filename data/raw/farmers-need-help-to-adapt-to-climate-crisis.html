<p>With the environment secretary having recently <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-announces-reforms-to-boost-profits-for-farmers-with-a-cast-iron-commitment-to-food-production">announced</a> plans for a “new deal for farmers” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/08/labour-new-deal-for-farmers-reset-relationship-industry-oxford-conference">Report,&nbsp;8 January</a>), he must also pay close attention to the relationship between climate change and food security. Some 70% of land across the UK is farmed, and together with forestry and fishing, our industries employ 300,000 people.</p> <p>Any “new deal” must see ministers introduce measures to tackle climate change, restore nature and protect our rich farming heritage for future generations.</p> <p>Over the past three decades, agricultural emissions have reduced by 12%. Meanwhile, farmers continue to work in harmony with nature, championing conservation and putting food on our tables.</p> <p>However, our way of life is under threat. Climate change has brought rising temperatures, droughts and flooding; all within one agricultural cycle. Without action to tackle emissions and safeguard nature, these events will only multiply.</p> <p>Farmers must be properly supported to adapt and to become stewards of our land. Taking inspiration from the climate and nature bill, set to be debated on 24&nbsp;January, is a good start. With 1,700 organisations backing the proposals to boost safeguards for our planet, while reducing emissions, we urge ministers to back it, too, in order to help our farmers adapt and thrive for generations to come.<br><strong>Roger Mortlock</strong> <em>CEO, Campaign to Protect Rural England,</em> <strong>Rosie&nbsp;Brown</strong> <em>Co-CEO, Cook Trading Ltd</em>, <strong>Andy&nbsp;Goldring</strong> <em>CEO, Permaculture Association</em>, <strong>Julia&nbsp;Kirby-Smith</strong> <em>Executive director, Better Food Traders</em><em>,</em> <strong>Robert Fraser</strong> <em>Executive director, Real Farming Trust</em>, <strong>Suzy&nbsp;Russell</strong><em> Coordinator, Community Supported Agriculture</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
