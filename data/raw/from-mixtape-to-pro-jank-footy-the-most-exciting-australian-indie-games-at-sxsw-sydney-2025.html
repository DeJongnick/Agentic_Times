<p>There’s no escaping the fact that SXSW Sydney – Australia’s iteration of Austin’s tech, music and film event, now in its third year – is absolutely beset by brands. In Tumbalong park on Saturday, families who had arrived for a free concert for kids meandered around the garish yellow CommBank Tour zone, as a line wound its way into the giant L’Oréal tent. But metres away at the International Convention Centre, inside the halls dedicated to gaming, the corporate influence was more muted.</p> <p>With the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/08/why-is-the-games-industry-shedding-staff-epic-games-activision-blizzard">global gaming industry downturn</a> continuing with no end in sight, big studios are continuing to keep a wary distance from Australia, with its high cost of living – meaning that even at a conference that screams synergistic brand-o-rama from every pore, indie developers took centre stage. Larger teams were rare; most projects on show were the results of solo developers or couples. And, much like Australia’s gaming scene more broadly, many of them were punching above their weight.</p>    <p>The two Australian games with the biggest backing at the showcase still felt relatively scrappy. SXSW’s game of the year, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2582320/Mixtape/">Mixtape</a>, from veteran developers Beethoven and Dinosaur (who put out the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/oct/02/the-artful-escape-review-beethoven-dinosaur-annapurna-johnny-galvatron">enjoyable psychedelic journey</a> The Artful Escape in 2021) and mid-tier US publisher Annapurna Interactive, is a gleeful 90s coming-of-age tale that feels like an Edgar Wright-esque comedy mixed with the animation style of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TQF6eJa3Y"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Set for release later this year, the game is a nostalgic ride through all the best parts of a well-spent youth: skating downhill on a lazy afternoon as Devo blasts off a dinky cassette tape; headbanging to Silverchair on a road trip; sneaking booze into a party, and escaping the cops in a barely controllable shopping trolley. My 20-minute demo had me grinning ear to ear, with at least one absolutely incredible joke involving controllable tongues that made me burst with laughter.</p> <p><strong>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3621330/Pro_Jank_Footy/">Pro Jank Footy</a>, meanwhile, is the brainchild of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Danger+5+guardian&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=Danger+5+guardian&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORigATIGCAEQRRg80gEIMTQ0NGowajeoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Danger 5</a> co-creator David Ashby and collaborator Tyler Roach, backed by film distributor Umbrella, making their tentative foray into gaming. It’s a ridiculous, arcadey take on AFL that harkens back to SNES-era sports games; after each goal, the losing team picks one of three absurd powerups (seagull attacks, giant players, resetting the score back to nil-all, etc) before play resumes. The live demonstration in Tumbalong park – commentated by Broden Kelly of Aunty Donna, who also appears in the game – drew a small crowd of mostly families, but the brave few who risked humiliation on stage in return for a neat scarf seemed to be having a pretty good time.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nbkimUsHno"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7nbkimUsHno?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>     <p>But there were highlights to be found in games with even less-established backers. One of my favourite experiences on the floor was the hyperkinetic shooter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124360/HYPER_PRIMATE/">Hyper Primate</a>, which casts you as an ape with an assortment of cobbled-together wooden guns, blasting other animals in search of giant floating bananas. The game has an unashamedly amateur look, but the movement mechanics felt absolutely sublime as I slid, dashed and jumped around a jungle arena at dizzying speeds.</p> <p>Another gameplay triumph was solo effort <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2746120/Huedini/">Huedini</a>, a frantic top-down game where you rapidly match colours to avoid or absorb enemies and other obstacles; even after a very brief session, I could sense the game’s simple-seeming mechanics had the potential to build to a brain-melting complexity.</p> <p>The Victorian government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/aug/22/global-success-of-cult-of-the-lamb-showcases-australian-video-games-development-talent">strong support for indie developers</a> continues to pay off, with multiple projects (including Huedini) funded by VicScreen; my other picks from that cohort were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660440/Way_To_The_Woods/">Way to the Woods</a>, a gorgeous adventure game following a deer and fawn with light-related powers in an overgrown cityscape, and the charming postie puzzle game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2189310/Letters_to_Arralla/">Letters to Arralla</a>, which tasks you with deciphering picture-based addresses as you get more familiar with the gentle island community (also, everybody is a root vegetable). There was a surprisingly strong contingent from South Australia, too, from Pro Jank Footy to the intensely satisfying minimalistic cube-rolling puzzle game <a href="https://the-rnd-department.itch.io/toya">Toya</a>, which proved a calming oasis in the midst of a busy show floor.</p>    <p>Even the international guests mostly fit the showcase’s grassroots spirit (with the exception of one game, Sony’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/02/ghost-of-yotei-review-deliciously-brutal-and-stunningly-beautiful-revenge-quest">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, which wasn’t playable but did have a well-attended talk). Strong projects from small teams included <a href="https://www.asocialgiraffe.com/">A Week in the Life of Asocial Giraffe</a>, a point-and-click social anxiety puzzler out of the US; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2872300/ABYSS_X_ZERO/">Abyss X Zero</a>, a 3D Zelda-style action game from Brazil; and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2202650/Crescent_County/">Crescent County</a>, a pastel-coloured broom racing simulator from a UK-based developer.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/14/pushing-buttons-battlefield-6-single-player-campaign">Battlefield 6 is yet another cliche-ridden war game. We deserve better</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A common complaint about previous iterations of SXSW Sydney was the price tag, with even the cheapest week-long access pass for games costing more than $100. This year, entry to the games exhibition was free on the final day, which meant there were families and kids everywhere. Party games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3444110/Cow_Chess/">Cow Chess</a> (a project from a Sydney-based duo which involved neither cows nor chess and felt like a cross between Worms and Super Smash Bros by way of Terry Gilliam) and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3569420/Chained_Beasts/">Chained Beasts</a> (a co-op Roman gladiator game, except every player is bound together by chains) benefited hugely from the madcap energy of a sea of children running gleefully for any game they could get their hands on.</p> <p>There were, frankly, too many indie games to play in a day – a nice problem to have. Other parts of SXSW Sydney might be consumed by brand activations, but at least for video games, the indie spirit lives on.</p>
