<p>Turkey and other parts of the Balkan peninsula have been gripped by a heatwave this week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/24/two-more-killed-amid-raging-wildfires-in-cyprus-and-turkey">sparking wildfires</a> that have killed at least 10 people and left dozens in hospital.</p> <p>Temperatures intensified at the weekend, peaking at 43C (109F) in Volos, Greece, on Tuesday. Authorities closed tourist attractions such as the Acropolis between midday and 5pm.</p> <p>High pressure across the region brought above-average heat and minimal rainfall for much of June and July, with rainfall about 80-90% below average.</p> <p>Scorching temperatures, strong winds and lightning strikes in the region have caused widespread wildfires. Large blazes have been reported in Bilecik, Sakarya and Karabük in northern Turkey, leading to the evacuation of several villages and the deaths of 10 fire and rescue workers, with a further 14 people injured.</p> <p>Northern Scandinavia has also been experiencing intense heat, with maximum temperatures in the low- to mid-30s celsius – at least 10C above average for the time of year. The heatwave has led to an increase in hospital admissions, especially among elderly people, young children and people with chronic health conditions.</p> <p>The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute issued weather warnings throughout the week, and the heatwave is expected to subside this weekend.</p> <p>In the North Pacific, sea surface temperatures have been up to 5C higher than average for the time of year. Excess heat poses a threat to corals, which are highly sensitive to water temperature.</p> <p>The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a level 2 alert, noting the risk of reef-wide bleaching and death of some species. High sea surface temperatures are expected to continue into August, increasing pressure on one of the most important regions for fishery stock replenishment in the world.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Typhoon Wipha continued to wreak widespread damage across east Asia. The storm peaked on Sunday morning, with sustained 76mph (122km/h) winds recorded near Hong Kong, which issued its highest-level hurricane alert.</p> <p>Wipha advanced westwards along China’s south coast, hitting northern Vietnam on Tuesday, which was already grappling with an intense monsoon season, before dissipating on Wednesday morning. Thirty-four people have died, and 77 have been injured or are missing.</p>
