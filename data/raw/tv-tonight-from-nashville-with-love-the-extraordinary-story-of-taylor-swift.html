<h2>Taylor</h2> <p><strong>9.15pm, Channel 4</strong><br>It’s surprising that it has taken this long for an even-handed documentary, directed by Guy King, charting the rise and fall and rise again of the world’s biggest pop star. The two-parter starts at the beginning of Taylor Swift’s extraordinary story, in post September 11 Nashville, Tennessee,<strong> </strong>where an all-American teenager started writing and performing country music. Journalists, insiders and hardcore Swifties help to tell everything that happened next. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>True Crime Presents: Murder – Fight for the Truth</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong><strong><br></strong>Investigative journalist Satish Sekar is the hero of a miscarriage of justice story that is more enraging than most. In 1990, three men were found guilty of murdering Lynette White in Cardiff two years previously, but the evidence against them was so flimsy it led to a historic police corruption case. Sekar himself tells the tale.<em> Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Michael Palin in Venezuela</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong><strong><br></strong>The final leg of Palin’s journey exemplifies the country’s extremes: from the brutal Zulia state, one of the UK Foreign Office’s “red zones”, to a joyful carnival parade in Caracas. En route, there’s crab fishing, a beauty contest – and the best chocolate in the world. “Venezuela’s too good to be kept a secret … it should be shared with everyone!” Palin concludes. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Romesh: Can’t Knock the Hustle</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>Having laid out his stall in last week’s live standup special, Romesh Ranganathan must now test these theories against reality. In Arizona, he culture-clashes with an energy drink-guzzling motivational speaker. In South Korea, he joins some burnt-out office drones for mandatory afterwork beers. And then it’s time for the hardest hustle of all – Mumbai delivery driver. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2>Art’s Most Erotic</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Arts</strong><strong><br></strong>“All art is erotic,” said Picasso – and critic Waldemar Januszczak proves it with this eye-popping episode in a three-part series (art’s most horrific and satanic will follow). The word pornography didn’t exist until Victorians discovered endless art that showed “scenes of energetic lovers going at it like the clappers” in Pompeii. He starts his journey there before heading to Japan and India. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Storyville: Holding Liat</h2>    <p><strong>10pm, BBC Four</strong><strong><br></strong>Brandon Kramer’s intimate documentary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/10/holding-liat-review-powerful-study-of-a-family-torn-apart-by-hamas-7-october-attacks">lauded at the Berlin film festival</a> earlier this year, shadows elderly Israeli couple Yehuda and Chaya Beinin as they lobby for the release of their daughter Liat and her husband Aviv. They were among the 251 hostages taken to Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. <em>Graeme Virt</em><em>ue</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Champions League Football: Galatasaray v Liverpool, </strong><strong>6.30pm, Prime Video</strong>.
