<p>Victoria’s Country Fire Authority has issued a warning to its senior leadership about the “dangers of partisan politics” and stressed it should remain “apolitical” after Liberal party-branded corflutes were attached to a fire truck at a rally in Melbourne’s western suburbs at the weekend.</p> <p>A truck from the CFA Inverleigh brigade displayed Liberal party corflutes during a rally in Werribee on Sunday, with a photo of the vehicle shared on social media by the party’s South West Metro branch.</p> <p>At the same rally – held to protest against the government’s new emergency services levy – some members of the Pura Pura brigade wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/15/disgusting-slogan-apparently-directed-at-victorian-premier-seen-at-rally-attended-by-brad-battin-and-union-boss-ntwnfb">“ditch the bitch” and other offensive slogans</a> on their truck, in an apparent reference to the premier, Jacinta Allan, that was criticised by gender equity groups.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/15/disgusting-slogan-apparently-directed-at-victorian-premier-seen-at-rally-attended-by-brad-battin-and-union-boss-ntwnfb">‘Disgusting’ slogan apparently directed at Victorian premier seen at rally attended by Brad Battin and union boss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A CFA member in Melbourne’s western suburbs, who asked not to be named due to fear of repercussions, said the event was “blatantly aligned” with the Liberal party.</p> <p>“There were Liberal party logos everywhere, at least three of the speakers were Liberal party members,” they said.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Brad Battin, attended Sunday’s event, alongside upper house MPs Moira Deeming and Trung Luu.</p> <p>Battin said he did “not endorse offensive signs or language at the protest”, while his deputy, Sam Groth, told reporters on Tuesday he condemned the behaviour outright.</p> <p><strong>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p> <p>An opposition spokesperson said they were also “not aware of any CFA trucks carrying Liberal political advertising”.</p> <p>“It is understood some volunteers may have been carrying signs over the weekend, if concerns have been raised, that’s a matter for the CFA to manage in line with their own policies,” they said.</p> <p>The opposition spokesperson also denied the use of Liberal party signs could damage the CFA’s integrity or compromise its apolitical position.</p> <p>“Are we seriously questioning the integrity of CFA volunteers, the same men and women who drop everything to risk their lives to protect their communities … because some of them held up a sign at a protest?” they said.</p> <p>“Volunteers protesting a tax that disproportionately affects regional communities isn’t political. It’s personal. They are standing up for the people they serve, just like they always have.”</p> <p>They added the CFA was made up of Victorians from “all walks of life, including a sitting Labor MP”.</p> <p>The incidents prompted the CFA chief executive, Greg Leach, and chief officer, Jason Heffernan, to write to captains, group officers, commanders and other senior leaders on Tuesday night, urging them not to allow the “current community debate” to “undermine the trust and respect” for the volunteer-run organisation.</p> <p>“To date many of our members who have chosen to attend community rallies have done so with respect, while maintaining community safety and confidence,” the letter, seen by Guardian Australia, reads.</p> <p>“However, some recent slogans and political signage placed on our vehicles have breached community standards, CFA’s policies, and our values, placing in jeopardy the respect and trust CFA enjoys across the broader community.”</p> <p>They said the situation “served as a reminder of the dangers of partisan politics” and stressed the “CFA is, and must always remain, apolitical”.</p> <p>“It is timely to remind our members of the need to always uphold CFA’s behavioural standards, values, and community confidence, when clearly identifiable as a CFA member, in CFA vehicles or at CFA locations, even when driven by a deep concern an individual may feel about an issue,” the letter reads.</p> <p>“Communities look to us, trust and respect us. If we don’t live up to those standards, we risk losing community support and this has a potential for far reaching negative impacts both locally in communities, and organisationally, at the state level.”</p> <p>In a statement, a CFA spokesperson confirmed the letter was sent to its leaders to “reinforce our behavioural standards and policies”.</p> <p>They said “appropriate actions have been taken” against those involved in the offensive slogans, referring to a statement the CFA issued on Tuesday. In it, they said they had spoken with the Pura Pura brigade to make it clear the slogans were unacceptable.</p> <p>The emergency services levy, which replaces the fire services levy, provides funding to the CFA, SES, State Control Centre and triple-zero – agencies facing increased pressure due to more frequent and extreme weather events.</p> <p>While the new levy brings Victoria <a href="https://www.revenuesa.sa.gov.au/EmergencyServicesLevy">in line with South Australia</a>, and <a href="https://www.revenue.nsw.gov.au/taxes-duties-levies-royalties/emergency-services-levy">New South Wales has a similar scheme</a>, it has sparked backlash as it will increase annual bills by an average of $63 for homeowners and $678 for primary producers.</p> <p>The government has responded by pausing the levy for farmers in 2025–26 and introducing <a href="https://www.vic.gov.au/Eligible-Volunteers-Rebate-Scheme">a rebate for CFA and SES volunteers</a> on their primary residence.</p>
