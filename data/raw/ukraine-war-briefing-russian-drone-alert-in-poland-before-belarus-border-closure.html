<ul> <li><p><strong>Russian drones have been shot down after entering Nato-member Poland’s airspace</strong>. Poland’s armed forces operation command said: “During today’s attack by the Russian Federation carrying out strikes on targets located in the territory of Ukraine, <strong>our airspace was repeatedly violated by drone-type objects</strong> … We emphasise that the military operation is ongoing, and we urge people to stay at home. The most threatened areas are the Podlaskie, Mazowieckie, and Lubelskie <em>voivodeships</em> [provinces].”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine had earlier warned about the drones, prompting Poland to scramble its own and Nato warplanes, place air defences and radar on high alert, and temporarily close some airports.</strong> A Polish defence minister, Cezary Tomczyk, said “an operation to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/poland-shoots-down-drones-over-its-territory-amid-russian-attack-on-ukraine-says-military">neutralise objects that have violated and exceeded the border of the Republic of Poland</a> is under way”.</p></li> </ul> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/poland-shoots-down-drones-over-its-territory-amid-russian-attack-on-ukraine-says-military"> Poland shoots down drones over its territory amid Russian attack on Ukraine, says military</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><p><strong>It came after the Polish prime minister announced Poland will close its border with Belarus on Thursday as a result of the “very aggressive” Zapad military exercises being conducted by Belarus and Russia. </strong>Donald Tusk said it was also a response to a growing number of provocations from Russia and Belarus. Separately, <strong>Poland’s president, Karol Nawrocki, warned that “we do not trust Vladimir Putin’s good intentions”.</strong> Nawrocki continued: “While waiting, of course, for a long-term peace, permanent peace, which is necessary to our regions, <strong>we believe that Vladimir Putin is ready to also invade other countries</strong>.”</p></li> <li><p>The US Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal <strong>challenged Congress and Donald Trump to adopt a bipartisan bill imposing “scorching” secondary sanctions</strong> on countries buying Russian oil like China, India and Brazil. The long-proposed bill is co-sponsored by Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator. “I believe the president should be supportive,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/09/09/nx-s1-5534275/sen-richard-blumenthal-discusses-his-bill-proposing-additional-sanctions-on-russia">Blumenthal told NPR</a> on Tuesday. “The time has come for action. <strong>The president’s been mocked and played by Putin,</strong> and I think the president ought to be furious that Putin has stalled and stonewalled in this way. And about this bill, there are 85 co-sponsors, evenly divided – Democrat and Republican – which I think shows the level of support in the Congress for these kinds of sanctions.”</p></li> <li><p>Trump said on Sunday he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/08/trump-says-he-is-ready-to-impose-new-sanctions-on-russia-what-does-this-mean-for-putins-war-in-ukraine">ready to impose further sanctions targeting Russia</a>, but appears now to be stipulating that the EU must do so at the same time. <strong>The EU has already enacted 18 rounds of sanctions and is preparing a 19th round</strong>, which it has said should include more secondary sanctions targeting countries helping Moscow. A US official told Agence France-Presse that on Tuesday Trump raised with European representatives the possibility of tariffs of between 50% and 100% on Russian oil customers.</p></li> <li><p>Officials also discussed the issue of <strong>immobilised Russian government money</strong> as the EU sanctions envoy, David O’Sullivan, led a delegation to Washington. Trump dialled in for discussions on Tuesday alongside Ukraine’s prime minister, a US official said. Also involved in talks were Trump’s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, and officials from the US trade representative’s office and state department.</p></li> <li><p>A <strong>Russian strike killed 24 elderly people collecting their pensions</strong> on Tuesday, Ukrainian officials said. “A brutally savage Russian airstrike with an aerial bomb on the rural settlement of Yarova in the Donetsk region,” said the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. “Directly on people. Ordinary civilians. At the very moment when pensions were being disbursed.” Prosecutors announced a war crime investigation. The Ukrainian military said the Russians had dropped a glide bomb – a heavy bomb fitted with wings so it can fly rather than falling straight down. There was no immediate comment from Moscow or the Kremlin.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine’s air defences were responding to a <strong>Russian drone attack on Kyiv</strong> early on Wednesday, the military administration of the Ukrainian capital posted online.</p></li> <li><p>Members of the <strong>European parliament in Strasbourg have accidentally passed a motion criticising the EU for a failed “militaristic strategy” in Ukraine</strong>. The amendment from an MEP from Germany’s radical left was nodded through by <strong>party floor chiefs who later admitted making a mistake</strong> – delighting populist groupings like Italy’s Putin-friendly Five Star Movement.</p></li> </ul>
