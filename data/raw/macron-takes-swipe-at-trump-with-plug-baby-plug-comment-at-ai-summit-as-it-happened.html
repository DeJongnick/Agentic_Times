 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Finally, <strong>Macron </strong>turns to adoption and acceleration of the technology, as he promises that France will move fast with its proposals in this area.</p> 
  <p>He declares Europe is (thanks to France <em>obviously</em>) “back in the race” with the US and China with the pledges of €109bn of investment, but calls for “more Europe” and a more coordinated European approach to AI.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>It’s a wake up call for your European strategy. Tomorrow [European Commission] president Van der Leyen will announce the European AI strategy, and it will be a very important occasion.</em></p> 
   <p><em>This strategy will be a unique opportunity for Europe to accelerate, to simplify our regulations, to deepen the single market and to invest as well in computing capacities. We need more Europe, and we have to provide a bigger domestic market to all the startups when they start as Europeans.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He also calls for a more streamlined approach to “permitting, authorisation, clinical trials” to help with timing of investments.</p> 
  <p>“We will have more private investment, … more public investment, … new strategies, but most of the time we are too slow,” he says as he promises to follow “the Notre Dame de Paris strategy” with action for more permissive regulation.</p> 
  <p>“We [want to] show the rest of the world that when we commit to a clear timeline we can deliver. You decide, you streamline all the procedures, somebody is in charge, and you deliver,” he says.</p> 
  <p>“Long live the AI, long live the Republic, long live France,” he concludes the speech.</p>

  <p><strong>Macron </strong>also urges Europeans to <strong>“buy European”</strong> to support French and European companies.</p> 
  <p>Here is what he said:</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Rome correspondent</em></p> 
  <p>Some of <strong>Italy’s</strong> best-known business leaders, including the fashion designer <strong>Giorgio Armani</strong> and the Prada chair, <strong>Patrizio Bertelli</strong>, have been targeted by an artificial intelligence-based scam that involved the mimicking of the defence minister’s voice in telephone calls claiming to seek help to free Italian journalists kidnapped in the Middle East.</p> 
  <p>Prosecutors in <strong>Milan</strong> have received four legal complaints, including from <strong>Massimo Moratti</strong>, the former owner of Inter Milan, and a member of the <strong>Beretta</strong> family, the world’s oldest producer of firearms. The defence minister, <strong>Guido Crosetto,</strong> on Monday said he would submit a legal complaint after his voice was cloned and used in at least one of the calls.</p> 
  <p>At least one of the targets is known to <strong>have fallen for the scam and was duped into making two transfers totalling €1m</strong> to an account in Hong Kong after falsely believing they would be reimbursed by the Bank of Italy.</p>

  <p>The rival leaders of ethnically divided <strong>Cyprus</strong> said they’re ready to take part in a UN-led gathering next month that could pave the way to <strong>a resumption of formal talks</strong> after an eight-year hiatus to resolve one of the world’s most intractable disputes, AP reports.</p> 
  <p>Cyprus has been split along ethnic lines for more than a half century. In 1974, <strong>Turkey</strong> invaded the island in the immediate wake of an <strong>Greek</strong> junta-backed coup mounted by supporters of union with Greece.</p> 
  <p>Numerous UN-sponsored rounds of peace talks ended in failure, the most recent being in 2017. After the collapse of those talks, Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots opted out of reunifying Cyprus as a federation composed of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones — a framework that all previous negotiations had operated under.</p> 
  <p>Turkish Cypriots leader Ersin Tatar said that the meeting next month would take place on 17-18 March, but Cypriot government spokesperson Constantinos Letymbiotis said that the United Nations will confirm the exact dates in due course.</p>

Ethnicity is a circumstance that the police have taken into account since early in the investigation when assessing a possible motive.” </p>

  <p>The impact of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> on the <strong>environment</strong> and <strong>inequality</strong> has dominated the opening exchanges of a global summit in <strong>Paris</strong> attended by political leaders, tech executives and experts.</p> 
  <p><strong>Emmanuel Macron’s</strong> AI envoy, <strong>Anne Bouverot</strong>, opened the two-day gathering at the Grand Palais in the heart of the French capital with a speech referring to the environmental impact of AI, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/04/can-the-climate-survive-the-insatiable-energy-demands-of-the-ai-arms-race">requires vast amounts of energy and resource to develop and operate</a>.</p> 
  <p>“We know that AI can help mitigate climate change, but we also know that its current trajectory is unsustainable,” Bouverot said. Sustainable development of the technology would be on the agenda, she added.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Romanian president to resign after cancelled election</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Romanian</strong> president <strong>Klaus Iohannis</strong> said he would resign following pressure for him to leave the post after a court last year cancelled the country’s presidential election.</p> 
  <p>When annulling the elections, Romania’s top court said Iohannis, whose second and last term expired in December last year, should stay on until his replacement is elected, after it voided the presidential ballot on suspicion of Russian interference.</p> 
  <p>Today’s decision follows a move by opposition parties to try to force his impeachment in parliament, although <a href="https://adevarul.ro/politica/opozitia-cere-din-nou-suspendarea-lui-iohannis-2420804.html">Romanian media noted</a> that they did not have the majority required to pass their motion.</p> 
  <p>“In order to spare Romania and the Romanian citizens from crisis... I resign from the office of president of Romania,” Iohannis said, adding that he would officially stand down on Wednesday, AFP reported.</p> 
  <p>He called the motion to impeach him “unfounded” and “damaging” to Romania’s reputation, and practically irrelevant given he was set to step down within months anyway.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>An anonymous bidder has pledged to pay a Polish charity <strong>almost €120,000</strong> for <strong>a breakfast with Polish prime minister</strong> and former European Council president Donald Tusk.</p> 
  <p>The auction, supporting the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, ended earlier today with 37 bidders involved.</p> 
  <p>Tusk said last month he would host the winner at his office in Warsaw and serve a traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashubians">Kashubian</a> breakfast. The menu includes Kashubian-style herring (<em><a href="https://www.tasteatlas.com/sledzie/recipe/sledzie-po-kaszubsku-kashubian-style-herrings">śledzie po kaszubsku</a></em>), fluffy yeast-raised fritters (<em><a href="https://kuchnia.kociewie.eu/ruchanki-kociewskie-racuchy/">ruchanki</a></em>) and scrambled eggs cooked with Baltic sprats (<em><a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/rolnictwo/praznica-na-bretlingach-jajecznica-na-szprotach">prażnica na bretlingach</a></em>)</p> 
  <p>The GOCC, or WOŚP in Polish, is the organiser of one of the largest one-day charity fundraising events around the world with the money used to buy equipment for Poland’s healthcare system. During its 33rd finale last month, it collected a record-high €42.6m.</p> 
  <p>On Monday, Tusk was busy unveiling his government’s new economy plan, saying Poland planned to spend a “record” <strong>€155bn euros</strong> this year on investment to kickstart the central European country’s growth.</p> 
  <p>Tusk said that Poland would also aim to overtake the EU’s western powerhouse economies “who, until relatively recently, sometimes looked down on us a little.” </p> 
  <p>In particular, he said he wanted to attract foreign investment, adding he had held “advanced” talks with major tech companies Google, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft, AFP reported.</p>

  <p>Since last summer, passengers had to disembark and go through passport control at Brussels-Midi in Belgium, because the works meant there was no space for passport and customs controls in Amsterdam.</p> 
  <p>From today, there will be three daily services on weekdays and Sundays, with two on Saturdays.</p> 
  <p>There will be another short break in April, with full capacity expected to be introduced from September, opening the way to further expansion of the connection by 2026.</p>

  <p>A <a href="https://liveblog.zdf.de/tv-duell-scholz-gegen-merz/153698/">viewer survey for ZDF public television</a>, one of the debate’s broadcasters, found that Scholz with his feisty performance came away as the more credible (42% to 31%) and likeable (46% to 27%) candidate. “Merz managed to seem even more arrogant than Scholz,” observed Daniel Brössler in the daily Süddeutsche. The two men tied at 36% when it came to expertise on the issues, in what many commentators called a particularly wonky night. </p> 
  <p>The <strong>often ill-tempered head-to-head</strong> (“How dumb can one be?” Scholz asked Merz, attacking his plan to undermine the EU migration deal with national measures) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/08/merzs-gamble-germanys-centre-right-leader-splits-voters-by-flirting-with-hardline-afd">raises renewed doubts about how the CDU/CSU and the SPD could work together after the election</a> -- still the most likely scenario for a ruling coalition. </p> 
  <p>The most fiery clash came right at the start, when Scholz and the moderators accused Merz of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/03/friedrich-merz-doubles-down-on-gambit-with-german-far-right-in-combative-speech">breaking his word on shunning cooperation with the AfD</a>. Merz denied this and renewed his pledge never to collaborate with the far right. Scholz charged that Merz had lost credibility and some opinion polls back him up, even as t<a href="https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/">he CDU stays fixed on +/-30%</a>. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">German election debate - summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Since we mentioned last night’s German election debate between the current chancellor, SPD’s <strong>Olaf Scholz,</strong> and his most likely successor if the polls are to be believed, CDU’s <strong>Friedrich Merz,</strong> let’s take a quick look at what they talked about.</p> 
  <p><strong>1. Cooperation with the far-right</strong></p> 
  <p>SPD’s Scholz further pursued the line of attack against Merz, suggesting the CDU/CSU could be open to formally working with the far-right <strong>Alternative für Deutschland</strong> after the election.</p> 
  <p>“That is really my concern. I don’t want to pretend it isn’t,” he said, accusing the opponent of “breaking the taboo” by passing a non-binding motion on migration with AfD votes.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>“I’d explicitly state we are not going to do that. There are worlds separating us with regards to Europe, Nato, Russia, America. There is no common denominator between CDU and AFD,” Merz replied. “There will be no cooperation,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Asked if he believed that, Scholz said: “I do not,” pointing to a recent vote on a parliamentary motion. “He broke his word, he broke the taboo. I am no longer certain [about his position on AfD],” he said.</p> 
  <p><strong>2. Migration</strong></p> 
  <p>The two also clashed on migration, with Merz saying he refuses to accept the government’s view that “nothing more could be done” after a recent spate of knife attacks involving migrants. </p> 
  <p>However, Scholz defended his record and said he was already pushing the boundaries of law with his reforms, including through the reintroduction of border controls. </p> 
  <p>He also repeated his attack that Merz’s proposals would violate the EU law, at one point asking, “why should we be so stupid” to break the rules with national measures, just after the bloc agreed to reform them along the lines proposed by Berlin.</p> 
  <p>CDU’s Merz was also asked about the political price of his vote with the AfD, with thousands of Germans taking to the streets to register their protest against the far-right.</p> 
  <p>“What really pains me that we are witnessing demonstrations in this country against the on the fight against the far right, but nobody thinks of the victims of the families and would take to the streets in support of them,” Merz replied.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p><strong>3. Ukraine</strong></p> 
  <p>Merz also cautioned against rushing Ukraine into Nato, saying the alliance “does not accept member who are currently in the war,” and saying it was a “medium term” target.</p> 
  <p>Asked about whether he believes that an end to the war may be near under Trump’s renewed push for talks, he said:</p> 
  <p>“Let’s wait and see what the proposals will be during the Munich Security Conference. Without America, it won’t work, but there must be no decision made over the heads of Ukrainians.”</p> 
  <p>Scholz insisted that Ukraine needed further support to put it in the strongest possible negotiation position. “I think it remains a very dangerous war in which we have to ensure ... that it does not escalate into a war between Russia and Nato,” he said.</p> 
  <p>On Ukraine’s membership of Nato, he said, “the option is there, but it is not happening any time soon,” and the focus should be on making sure Ukraine cannot be attacked again. He also insisted Ukrainian leaders must be involved in any talks.</p> 
  <p>The two also clashed over financing German defence expansion, with Scholz calling Merz’s suggestions of changing the debt break mechanism “ridiculous.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Other topics</strong></p> 
  <p>Scholz and Merz also talked about energy (with Merz calling the closure of nuclear plants “madness”), deindustrialisation, investment, tax, social security reforms, and how to deal with the “predictable unpredictability,” as Merz put it, of Donald Trump.</p> 
  <p>On coalition prospects, Merz said that “everyone who wants to govern with us will have to move towards the political centre” to tackle the rise of the AfD.</p> 
  <p>Scholz insisted that all parties “must do everything we can to ensure that the AfD is not in a [ruling] coalition.”</p> 
  <p><strong>So, who won?</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Erm, it’s difficult to say:</strong> analysts broadly described it as <strong>a “draw”</strong> between the two candidates. <a href="https://www.welt.de/politik/bundestagswahl/article255383796/Forschungsgruppe-Wahlen-Wer-hat-das-TV-Duell-gewonnen-Zuschauer-sehen-einen-Kandidaten-haarscharf-vorne.html">A poll by Wahlen and reported by Welt</a> showed that 37% thought the incumbent came on top, with 34% pointing at Merz, and 29% saying there was no winner.</p> 
  <p>Interestingly, though, 47% of voters thought Scholz exceeded expectations in what was noticeably more aggressive and fierce outing from the chancellor. For Merz, the clear majority (61%) of voters said he performed as expected.</p> 
  <p>According to the poll, voters found Scholz more likable (46% to 27%) but judged their competence equally (36% each).</p> 
  <p>The election is on Sunday, 23 February.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">What's on the AI Action Summit's agenda in Paris</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Global technology editor</em></p> 
  <p><strong>On safety versus opportunities:</strong></p> 
  <p>I think the agenda is definitely different compared with the conference of Bletchley Park in 2023, safety isn’t at the forefront at all. The conference is split in sort of five themes, which are international governance, trust, innovation and culture, work and making AI work in the public interest. So it’s going to be, I think, a more positive summit in terms of its agenda. </p> 
  <p>I just think the issue of safety, it won’t go away, because safety in AI encapsulates a lot of things. It goes from biased outputs to it being used to create misinformation to systems evading control, which is a bit more of a medium to long term thing, I guess so it’ll still be there in the background. But I think this summit will is definitely going to focus on different issues.</p> 
  <p><strong>On China:</strong></p> 
  <p>I think the importance of China being involved in any discussions about a global effort on making sure that AI stays safe and is deployed responsibly, I think it underlines the fact that China really needs to be in those conversations. …</p> 
  <p>This is a time of geopolitical tension. We’ve seen Donald Trump has imposed tarrifs on China, and obviously there’s been retaliation from Beijing and in that sort of context, it’s difficult to imagine there being a willingness to down tools in one corner of this fight and collaborate over AI.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Ready to act within one hour,' Germany's Scholz says about US tariffs</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>German chancellor <strong>Olaf Scholz</strong> spoke about the threat of US tariffs during last night’s televised debate with his main rival <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong> ahead of the federal election on 23 February.</p> 
  <p>He said the EU was “prepared” to respond and “ready to act within one hour,” but insisted that any reaction needs to be at the EU level, noting Germany’s particular vulnerability to any US tariffs.</p> 
  <p>This is what he said in full:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We’re prepared, obviously, with all diplomatic caution, but we’re ready to act within one hour as the European Union.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It’s important to say that our trade policy is an EU competence, and it’s one of the reasons why we should insist that we stick to these common rules with the EU. </em></p> 
   <p><em>If the US have tariff policy, then there’s going to be one export nation that is very much going to suffer from that, and that is Germany. This is why we have to ensure that there is solidarity with tariff policy,</em> </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">‘Focus on China,’ Macron tells Trump in response to tariff threats</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Looking at other EU responses, French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> also hit at Trump’s plans to impose tariffs against the EU.</p> 
  <p>Speaking in English to CNN, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Is the European Union your first problem? No, I don’t think so. Your first problem is China, so you should focus on the first problem.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Europe is an ally for you. If you want Europe to be engaged on more investment, security, defence, if you want Europe to develop, which I think is in the interest of the US, you should not hurt European economies by threatening them with tariffs.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>France’s foreign minister <strong>Jean-Noël Barrot </strong>went further this morning, saying directly that the EU would counter in kind and retaliate against any tariffs imposed by the US.</p> 
  <p>“There is no hesitation when it comes to defending our interests,” he said in an interview with TF1.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">No justification for 'unlawful and economically counterproductive' US tariffs, EU says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Responding to Trump’s comments on aluminium and steel tariffs overnight, <strong>the EU</strong> has just said that it <strong>had not received any official notification yet</strong>, but insisted there was <strong>no justification of any such move</strong> and it would be ready to respond if needed.</p> 
  <p>A spokesperson for the European Commission said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We will not respond to broad announcements without details or written clarification. The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But they added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>In general: The imposition of tariffs would be unlawful and economically counterproductive, especially given the deeply integrated production chains the EU and U.S. established through transatlantic trade and investment. </em></p> 
   <p><em>Tariffs are essentially taxes. By imposing tariffs, the U.S. would be taxing its own citizens, raising costs for business, and fuelling inflation. Moreover, tariffs heighten economic uncertainty and disrupt the efficiency and integration of global markets.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: AI, trade, and Ukraine set to dominate the week</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Imagine you are a European leader. On your to-do list for this week, you have (at least) three issues:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>How to navigate an almost existential discussion on how to deal with the rapid expansion of AI</p></li> 
   <li><p>How to avoid the looming threat of global trade wars</p></li> 
   <li><p>How to influence US plans to hold secret negotiations with Russia to end the war in Ukraine</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><em>No pressure.</em></p> 
  <p>First, we are in <strong>Paris</strong> for Emmanuel Macron’s AI Action Summit.</p> 
  <p>What is at stake during the two-day meeting, starting today, is probably best captured on the front page of the French daily <strong>Libération </strong>this morning, with <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> desperately trying to catch up with the US and Chinese robots.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/09/europe/france-macron-europe-ai-race-intl/index.html">CNN last week</a>, Macron said that Europe was <strong>“not in the race today,”</strong> and warned it was seriously <strong>“lagging behind”</strong> competitors.</p> 
  <p>So the Paris summit will be an opportunity for him to show <strong>France</strong> and <strong>Europe</strong> are serious about joining the AI race, and to have discussions with investors and global leaders about what’s next for the rapidly emerging technology. With the EU’s <strong>AI Act</strong> now in implementation, lots of questions still remain about the bloc’s approach to the technology’s development and regulation.</p> 
  <p>In total, Macron and his co-host Indian prime minister <strong>Narenda Modi</strong> will welcome about 80 leaders, including US vice-president <strong>JD Vance </strong>(in his first trip to Europe since inauguration), Chinese vice premier <strong>Zhang Gouqing</strong> as well as top execs such as OpenAI’s <strong>Sam Altman</strong> and Google’s <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong>.</p> 
  <p>On Sunday, Macron announced <strong>€109bn of investment in AI in France</strong> in the coming years, expected to come from the United Arab Emirates, US and Canadian investment funds, and French companies. He said it was “the equivalent for France of what the US has announced with <strong>Stargate</strong>,” the $500-billion US scheme led by ChatGPT maker OpenAI.</p> 
  <p>Only last week, France’s Mistral AI also launched its AI assistant <strong>Le Chat</strong> – you can see the nod to its French roots there – which now tops the list of most popular apps in Europe.</p> 
  <p>Over the weekend, the president was keen <strong>to present</strong> <strong>himself as a fan of AI</strong> posting a video in which he appears, through the magic of deepfake technologies as a singer, an actor, a rapper and others. “It’s pretty well done, it made me laugh,” he said.</p> 
  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/1888589398620389708"> 
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

   </blockquote> 
  </figure> 
  <p>But it’s definitely <strong>not all laughs</strong> in Europe.</p> 
  <p>Last night, US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> once again raised the prospect of imposing tariffs on all aluminium and steel imports, which would also hit the <strong>European Union</strong>. EU leaders will be frantically making calls this morning to figure out what it all means for them and how, and when, to respond.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>Trump’s No.2 <strong>JD Vance</strong> will be in Europe most of this week, first attending the Paris summit, and later taking part in the Munich Security Conference in Germany, meaning there will be some scope for informal discussions behind the scenes.</p> 
  <p>But with their focus on putting <strong>America First</strong>, how much will Trump and Vance be willing to cut deals with the EU as they focus on their main aims of radically reshaping global trade and trying to bring to an end to the <strong>Russian</strong> invasion of <strong>Ukraine</strong>?</p> 
  <p>It’s going to be lively. <em>Buckle up.</em></p> 
  <p>It’s <strong>Monday, 10 February 2025,</strong> and this is <strong>Europe live.</strong> It’s <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> here.</p> 
  <p>Good morning.</p>
