<p>Some Democrats rallied to the defense of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a> on Sunday as the president came under increased criticism over his response to pro-Palestinian student protests and his handling of Israel’s war on Gaza.</p> <p>Republicans have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/04/us-campus-protests-trump-biden-election">seized on Biden’s response</a> to the protests, which have seen more than2,000 people arrested around the country, accusing him of a weak response. But prominent Democrats, including Biden re-election campaign co-chairperson Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans, claimed the president “has been very strong about this from the beginning”.</p> <p>Their support came as campus protests have seen an increasingly aggressive police response. An encampment at the University of Southern California was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestine-gaza-war-universities-campus-protests-3afafc2d56c6dc87635549475d94e1d6">cleared by police in riot gear on Sunday morning</a>, and a similar effort at the University of California, Los Angeles was shut down by police who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2024/05/02/police-shoot-rubber-bullets-ucla-encampment-pro-palestinian-protest-digvid.cnn">reportedly used rubber bullets</a> on Thursday. Scores of protesters were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/may/01/columbia-university-student-protesters-arrested-faculty-reacts">arrested at Columbia University</a> on Tuesday night – a move which New York City’s mayor defended in an interview on Sunday.</p> <p>Asked on CNN’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/shows/state-of-the-union">State of the Union</a> if Biden could have reacted differently to the protests, which have seen clashes between pro-Palestine and pro-Israel protesters as well as dueling accusations of antisemitism and Islamophobia, Landrieu said: “The president’s been very clear about this. He’s also been very strong about the need to stamp out antisemitism and Islamophobia. It’s a very difficult time, [there are] very passionate opinions on both sides of this issue.</p> <p>“The president has been handling it I think very, very well and I think he will continue to do so.”</p> <p>Thousands of young people have protested at university campuses across the country in recent weeks, criticizing the Biden administration’s continued support of Israel. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, and 2 million displaced, since Israel attacked the enclosed strip in response to Hamas terrorist attacks which killed more than 1,100 Israelis.</p> <p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/may-5-sens-tim-scott-and-mark-kelly-plus-cindy-mccain-210292293753">NBC’s Meet the Press</a>, Mark Kelly, the Arizona senator, added his voice to Democrats who have voiced approval for police crackdowns on campus sit-ins, saying it is “appropriate for police to step in” when protests turn into “unlawful acts”.</p> <p>“When they cross a line and when they commit crimes, they should be arrested,” Kelly said.</p> <p>“That’s the appropriate thing to do.”</p> <p>Kelly said some of the university protests had “become very violent, and students – especially Jewish students – have the right to feel safe on a campus, and they’ve gotten out of control”.</p> <p>“Everybody has the right to protest peacefully. But when it turns into unlawful acts – and we’ve seen this in a number of colleges and universities including here in Arizona – it’s appropriate for the police to step in,” he said.</p> <p>Biden had mostly stayed silent on the unrest at university campuses until he addressed the issue <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/02/joe-biden-protests-speech#:~:text=%E2%80%9CViolent%20protests%20are%20not%20protected,this%20is%20a%20peaceful%20protest.%E2%80%9D">on Thursday</a>.</p> <p>“Dissent is essential for democracy,” Biden said in an address at the White House. “But dissent must never lead to disorder.”</p> <p>Biden said some protesters had used “violent” methods.</p> <p>“Violent protests are not protected. Peaceful protest is,” he said. “There’s the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos.”</p> <p>The president added: “Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campus, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation … none of this is a peaceful protest.”</p> <p>On Sunday, Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, defended how the police have handled protests in the city. About 280 people were arrested at Columbia University and the City University of New York last week.</p> <p>“When those protests reach the point of violence, we have to ensure that we use a minimum amount of force to terminate what is perceived to be a threat,” Adams <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mayor-eric-adams-defends-nypd-response-campus-protests/story?id=109928216">told ABC News This Week</a>.</p> <p>John Fetterman, the Democratic Pennsylvania US senator who is a vocal supporter of Israel, said the protests were “working against peace in the Middle East” and reiterated his backing for the US sending aid to the country.</p> <p>“I will never support any kind of conditions on Israel during this. And again, I would, I am going to continue to center – Hamas is responsible for all of that again, then,” Fetterman said.</p> <p>“And now if you’re going to protest on these campuses, or now what, they’re going all across America as well, too. I really want to, can’t forget, that the situation right now could end right now, if Hamas just surrendered.”</p> <p>Hours after calling in state troopers to break up a quiet, rain-soaked encampment of anti-war protesters, the University of Virginia president, Jim Ryan, issued a public statement calling the episode “upsetting, frightening and sad”.</p> <p>Ryan had been noticeably absent from the episode itself. His public statement Saturday evening, his first on the matter, came well after the encampment had been raided and the 25 demonstrators who had pitched tents on the patch of grass by the university’s chapel were arrested.</p> <p>Ryan called it unfortunate that a small group had chosen to break university rules after receiving repeated warnings.</p> <p>“I sincerely wish it were otherwise, but this repeated and intentional refusal to comply with reasonable rules intended to secure the safety, operations, and rights of the entire university community left us with no other choice than to uphold the neutral application and enforcement of those rules,” he wrote.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the arrests were criticized by Jamaal Bowman, the New York progressive Democratic congressman who has been critical of Israel.</p> <p>“I am outraged by the level of police presence called upon nonviolent student protestors on Columbia and CCNY’s campuses. As an educator who has first hand experience with the over-policing of our schools, this is personal to me,” Bowman <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBowman/status/1785483005890355359">wrote on X</a>.</p> <p>“The militarization of college campuses, extensive police presence, and arrest of hundreds of students are in direct opposition to the role of education as a cornerstone of our democracy.”</p>
