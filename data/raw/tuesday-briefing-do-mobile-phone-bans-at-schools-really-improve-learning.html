<p>Good morning. Today we’re going to take you straight to <a href="https://www.newmanrc.oldham.sch.uk/">Newman Catholic College secondary school</a> in Oldham to meet headteacher Glyn Potts, who is reacting to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/oct/02/gillian-keegan-plans-to-ban-mobile-phones-from-english-schools">education minister</a> Gillian Keegan’s plan to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/oct/02/gillian-keegan-plans-to-ban-mobile-phones-from-english-schools">ban pupils from using mobile phones in England’s schools</a>. “One of the biggest issues facing children and teachers is grappling with the impact of smartphones in our schools,” she told Conservative party conference. “The distraction, the disruption, the bullying – we know that teachers are struggling with their impact.”</p> <p>But are they?</p> <p>“It is so far down my list of priorities,” <a href="https://twitter.com/NewmanRC_Head?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Potts says</a> over the phone to me while on playground duty. “It wouldn’t make it into my list of the top 10 problems. In fact, I don’t think it would make it into the top 100.”</p> <p>Potts says his school – and most others in the country – already have mobile phone policies in place. “We don’t need to be told what to do about phones, what we need is for the government to focus on the recruitment and retention crisis, crumbling school buildings, the cost of living crisis and hungry pupils.”</p> <p>So why did Keegan announce the ban at Conservative party conference yesterday? More from Potts, and education expert Laura McInerney, after the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Transport</strong></em> | Rishi Sunak is set to confirm he is<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/oct/02/hs2-rishi-sunak-scrapping-manchester-leg"> scrapping the northern leg of HS2 </a>to Manchester at the Conservative conference in the city despite a furious response and Tory fears it will fatally undermine the party’s commitment to levelling up. Meanwhile business leaders who warned against Ed Miliband in 2015 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/02/business-chiefs-who-criticised-labour-in-2015-turn-on-rishi-sunak-green-u-turn-net-zero-policies">have now turned on Rishi Sunak</a>, criticising the prime minister’s plans to roll back net zero policies.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Education</strong></em> | Schools in England must challenge unconscious bias against the working class, according to the UK’s first professor of social mobility. Lee Elliot Major argues the system <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/03/warning-unconscious-bias-working-class-pupils-schools-england">tries to make working-class children into “middle-class clones”</a> when it should celebrate figures such as Stormzy, Tracey Emin, Mary Anning and Michael Faraday.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Crime</strong></em> | New powers will stop <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/03/people-jailed-for-killing-their-partner-will-lose-parental-rights-tories-to-announce">people who have killed their partners from gaining parental rights to surviving children</a>.

The 48-year-old comedian and actor has been accused of rape, assault and emotional abuse between 2006 and 2013, when he was at the height of his fame working for the BBC and Channel 4 and starring in Hollywood films. He denies the allegations.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Science</strong></em> | Prof Katalin Karikó and Prof Drew Weissman have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/02/scientists-whose-work-enabled-mrna-covid-vaccine-win-nobel-prize-for-medicine-katalin-kariko-drew-weissman">awarded the 2023 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine</a> for their contributions to RNA biology that contributed to the unprecedented speed of vaccine development during the Covid pandemic.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: ‘It’s a headline grabber, allowing government to avoid real problems facing schools’</h2>    <p>Keegan announced plans for non-statutory guidance (<a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt5802/jtselect/jtstatin/57/5707.htm">that means it’s not a legal requirement but more of an obligation</a>) to ban children from using their phones for the whole school day, including break time. She says phones are a big distraction in the classroom that affect children’s learning and can lead to disruptive behaviour as well as cyberbullying.</p> <p>Potts agrees that phones can cause problems, particularly with bullying and mental health. But he says teachers and headteachers have known this for years, and most schools have already taken action to ban or severely restrict pupils’ phone use at schools.</p> <p>The ban would only affect English schools, as the devolved governments have powers over schools in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Research by <a href="https://teachertapp.co.uk/articles/">TeacherTapp</a>, an app that surveys 10,000 teachers on a range of issues every day, found that 60% of schools already have policies that ban phone use throughout the day, including break times. Some schools even ban pupils from bringing their phones on to school premises, and some of these <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/hp/front/outstanding-hackney-school-asked-to-pass-on-its-success-6765952.html">policies have been in place for more than a decade</a>.</p> <p>A further 20% allow pupils to use their phones with the express permission of the teacher (to take photos of the classroom board, to look up information online or to take part in interactive quizzes), and another 20% allow phones only at break times.</p> <p>“This is a headline grabber, allowing the government to avoid the real problems we’re facing in schools,” Potts says. “It feels like another kick to headteachers who are already doing this, but the government is going to take credit for resolving it.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Do other countries ban phones?</strong></p> <p>Unesco, the UN’s education, science and culture agency, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/26/put-learners-first-unesco-calls-for-global-ban-on-smartphones-in-schools#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,bring%20in%20restrictions%20from%202024.">calling for a global ban on mobiles in schools</a>, warning that their use leads to reduced educational performance and has a negative effect on children’s emotional stability.</p> <p>“Even just having a mobile phone nearby with notifications coming through is enough to result in students losing their attention from the task at hand,” <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/smartphones-school-only-when-they-clearly-support-learning">a Unesco report says</a>. “One study found that it can take students up to 20 minutes to refocus on what they were learning once distracted.”</p> <p>Almost one in four countries have already banned smartphones in schools, according to the study, which found bans are most common in Asia but are also in place in countries ranging from Ivory Coast to Colombia.</p> <p>When France brought in a nationwide ban last year, education minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said: “Children don’t play at break time any more, they are just all in front of their smartphones, and from an educational point of view it’s a problem.”</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/04/mobile-phones-other-devices-to-be-banned-from-dutch-classrooms">Netherlands is bringing in a ban from 1 January</a>, as are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jul/07/queensland-school-mobile-phone-bans-two-terms">some Australian states</a>, and the issue is a hot topic on the campaign trail in the run-up to <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/politics/election-2023-national-wants-to-ban-phone-use-at-school-to-fix-declining-achievement/Q42N2P6J7VCVRGG7C6HGEXAABA/">New Zealand’s general election</a>.</p> <p>There’s little research to prove whether a ban works or not. But <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775719303966">academic research in Sweden found</a> “no impact of mobile phone bans on student performance and can reject even small-sized gains”.</p> <p>McInerney, a teacher who co-founded TeacherTapp, says her research doesn’t indicate that phones are a big concern for teachers. “The top three are more resources for pupils’ mental health, special educational needs provision and breakfast clubs.” She says that because the proposed ban is non-statutory it will have “very little impact for people on the ground”.</p> <p>“The one thing it will do is help headteachers who are struggling with parents who are calling for more permissive phone policies. They can now say, ‘Well this isn’t the school saying this, it’s the government.’”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Not a new policy</strong></p> <p>Potts accuses Keegan of wheeling out the policy as it is popular with most parents, and distracts from the other problems schools are facing. He also points out that it’s nothing new, and had been proposed by former education secretaries <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/nick-gibb-schools-minister-ban-mobile-phones-bedrooms-classrooms-253636">Nick Gibb in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56663010">Gavin Williamson in 2021</a>, who said “mobile phones should not be used or seen during the school day”.</p> <p><a href="https://educationhub.blog.gov.uk/2022/02/09/mobile-phones-in-schools/">The Department for Education last year said</a>: “Further intervention from government isn’t necessary. In most cases mobile phones are already banned for the majority of the school day with schools taking a range of measures to enforce that policy.”</p> <p>Potts says phones are such a small-scale problem at his school, that he “might see two or three phones a week, out of a school of 1,502 children”.</p> <p>“The kids are pretty sanguine about it now,” he says. “They’d all love to have their phones, but they do recognise that they can distract from their learning.”</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/summer-body">Annie Lord’s Vogue column</a> is a much-needed reminder that our <strong>bodies</strong> are not who we are, “they’re what we live in”, and are meant to be used as such. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Lars Findsen was in police custody when he discovered that <strong>spies from Denmark</strong>’s domestic intelligence agency had tapped his phone and wired his house with bugs.

The <strong>i</strong> has “Tory rebellion grows as PM scraps HS2 in the North” and the <strong>Financial Times </strong>reports “Sunak faces mounting protests over plan to axe northern branch of HS2”. “It’s Manc robbery!” says the <strong>Metro</strong>, with a picture of “furious” king in the north Andy Burnham (the Manchester mayor). The <strong>Daily Express</strong> thinks it’s these kinds of “tough decisions” that will win the Tories the next election: “Rishi’s ‘path to victory’ by delivering what’s best for Britain”. In other news: “Transgender women to be banned from female wards” says the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>.
