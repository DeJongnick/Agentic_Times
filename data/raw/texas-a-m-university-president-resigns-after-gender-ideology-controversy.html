<p>The president of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a> A&amp;M University’s main campus is stepping down less than two weeks after a student’s viral complaint about “gender ideology” in the classroom set off a chain of repercussions, including the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/texas-am-university-children-lit-professor-fired">firing of the teacher</a> as well as the dismissal of a dean and department chair.</p> 
<p>Mark A Welsh III, a retired air force four-star general, has been leading the university since 2022. His career before higher education included time as a fighter pilot, service on the joint chiefs of staff, work as the CIA’s associate director for military affairs, a term as commandant of cadets at the Air Force Academy, and a stint as dean of the Bush School of Government &amp; Public Service at Texas A&amp;M.</p> 
<p>“President Welsh is a man of honor who has led Texas A&amp;M with selfless dedication,” the university’s chancellor, Glenn Hegar, said in a <a href="https://news.tamus.edu/mark-welsh-steps-down-as-president-of-texas-am-university/">statement</a>. “We are grateful for his service and contributions. At the same time, we agree that now is the right moment to make a change and to position Texas A&amp;M for continued excellence in the years ahead.”</p>

<p>Welsh has not offered a specific reason for why he is leaving his position or clarified whether it is a result of the viral incident, instead simply saying: “Over the past few days, it’s become clear that now is that time” to step down, in a Friday statement.</p> 
<p>Welsh became president following the 2023 departure of Margaret Katherine Banks, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/21/texas-am-university-president-resigns-journalism-school-diversity">left</a> amid uproar over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/04/texas-am-settlement-kathleen-mcelroy-black-journalism-professor-dei">mishandled</a> hiring of a journalism professor, Kathleen McElroy. That controversy drew fire from Texas Republicans because of McElroy’s ties to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which are now prohibited in the state.</p> 
<p>According to the Thursday evening announcement, Welsh’s resignation will take effect on Friday.</p> 
<p>“Today, President Welsh has submitted his resignation, and both the Board of Regents and I agree that this is the right moment for change,” Hegar said in a <a href="https://x.com/Glenn_Hegar/status/1968819495343899065">post on X</a>.</p> 
<p>Brian Harrison, a Republican state representative who circulated the viral footage and pressed for Welsh’s removal, applauded the outcome.</p> 
<p>“As the first elected official to call for him to be fired, this news is welcome, although overdue,” Harrison <a href="https://x.com/brianeharrison/status/1968815550936543599">wrote on X</a>. “Now... END ALL DEI AND LGBTQ INDOCTRINATION IN TEXAS!!”</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/texas-am-university-children-lit-professor-fired">video clip</a> at the center of the controversy, which Harrison shared on 8 September, was originally filmed in July during a children’s literature course. The student who spoke out, whose identity Harrison withheld at their request, and the instructor, Melissa McCoul, are not visible in the footage.</p>

<p>In another recording Harrison shared on social media, the same student can be heard speaking with Welsh. She asks Welsh if he approves of LGBTQ+ content being taught at Texas A&amp;M, to which Welsh replies that the courses are typically for students entering fields such as psychiatry, counseling, education and non-profit work.</p> 
<p>“Those people don’t get to pick who their clients are, what citizens they serve, and they want to understand the issues affecting the people they’re going to treat,” Welsh tells the student. “So there is a professional reason to teach some of these courses.”</p> 
<p>The Texas governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/greg-abbott">Greg Abbott</a>, had threatened to fire Welsh in January after the university’s business school invited advanced PhD students and faculty to a conference designed to recruit Black, Hispanic and Indigenous graduate students.</p> 
<p>Though Abbott cannot fire university presidents, he appoints the members of the Texas A&amp;M University System board of regents, who do have that authority. Following the threat, Welsh said Texas A&amp;M would pull out of the conference completely.</p>
