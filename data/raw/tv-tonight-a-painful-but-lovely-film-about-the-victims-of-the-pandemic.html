<h2>Love and Loss: The Pandemic 5 Years On</h2> <p><strong>8.30pm, BBC One<br></strong>“It feels like we’re in a rush to forget and move on,” says film-maker Catey Sexton, in her feature documentary marking five years since the Covid-19 outbreak. But, as family members and friends of the more than 230,000 people who died tell her, life will never be the same again. Sexton’s own mother lost her life to the virus, and she wants to hear about the experiences of other people behind the numbers in a moving, lovely but heart-rending testimony. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Crongton</h2> <p><strong>7pm, BBC Three</strong></p>    <p>A bold new comedy drama for a young adult audience, based on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/mar/20/alex-wheatle-novelist-and-brixton-bard-dies-aged-62">Alex Wheatle</a>’s books. It follows Lemar “Liccle Bit” Jackson and his mates on the Crongton estate, with the actors cast after a social media callout for underrepresented talent. Its mix of mature jokes and cartoon animated scenes makes for something that feels unique. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Chess Masters: The Endgame</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Two<br></strong>World chess champion Magnus Carlsen (who has memorised more than 10,000 games) sets this week’s first challenge about memory. Then it’s time for team chess – it’s been smiles and hugs so far, so will this cause some divisions? But they must work together to avoid being the first person to be eliminated. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Panorama: Fixing the NHS – What Will It Take?</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One<br></strong>All agree the NHS is in critical condition, but when it comes to a course of treatment, opinions vary as widely as ambulance response times. Alison Holt speaks to frontline staff about how to deliver better care. Can the current reforms succeed where so many previous attempts have failed? <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2>Batch from Scratch: Cooking for Less</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4<br></strong>Full-time carers Kellie and Dom Evans have been struggling to provide healthy, nutritious meals for their children, who have additional needs. Enter Suzanne Mulholland, AKA the Batch Lady, a family-cooking expert and “time-saving guru”. Can she and Joe Swash help uncomplicate their lives? (Spoiler alert: yes.) <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>The White Lotus</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic<br></strong>The Ratliff men are in crisis in Mike White’s savage Thai resort satire. Timothy (Jason Isaacs) is agonising over his financial ruin while his two sons deal with throbbing hangovers after an uninhibited bacchanal. And luckless security guard Gaitok (Tayme Thapthimthong) vows to reclaim his stolen pistol. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Submarine (Richard Ayoade, 2010),</strong> <strong>1.50am, Film4</strong></p>    <p>Ayoade’s directorial debut is as quirky and unexpectedly touching as you’d expect from the comic actor. It’s a coming-of-age story with twin angles: 15-year-old, duffel-coated dreamer Oliver (Craig Roberts) experiences first love with the unforgiving Jordana (Yasmin Paige), while coming to understand the very middle-class relationship of his parents Lloyd and Jill (Noah Taylor and Sally Hawkins). Paddy Considine pops up with a terrific cameo as a stage psychic, an old flame of Jill’s. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p>
