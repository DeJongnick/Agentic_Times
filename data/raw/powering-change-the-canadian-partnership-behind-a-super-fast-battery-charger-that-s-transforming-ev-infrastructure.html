<p>A partnership between the University of Toronto and electric vehicle (EV) charging startup <a href="https://www.julepower.com/" rel="nofollow">Jule</a> has led to a gamechanging EV battery charger. Thanks to <a href="https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/u-of-t-engineering-partnership-with-jule-enabled-the-worlds-first-battery-powered-electric-vehicle-fast-charger/" rel="nofollow">technology developed</a> at the University of Toronto’s <a href="https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/research/centres/centre-applied-power-electronics-cape/#:~:text=The%20Centre%20for%20Applied%20Power,for%20electric%20power%20system%20applications." rel="nofollow">Centre for Applied Power Electronics</a>, drivers can fully charge their EVs in under 30 minutes without putting undue strain on the power grid.</p> <p>Working in close collaboration with Jule, Reza Iravani, a University of Toronto professor specialising in energy systems, and his team overcame a series of engineering challenges to develop the EV charger. Those challenges included minimising surge demand on the power grid when charging; operating and maintaining chargers in remote regions; and ensuring the chargers would work effectively during Canada’s extreme winters. Their solution was an integrated battery energy storage system that’s been so successful <a href="https://www.julepower.com/resources/ev-driver#map" rel="nofollow">Jule charging stations</a> have now been installed at locations across Canada and the US.</p> <h2><strong>Overcoming surge demand</strong></h2> <p>What makes the charger so effective is the use of a large battery system that trickles charge from the power grid at a slow, steady rate – minimising sudden surges, which could overwhelm the electricity infrastructure. It uses sensors to monitor the battery’s performance so any potential breakdowns can be spotted in good time and resolved before they become critical.</p> <p>The Jule system is a level 3 EV charger – the most powerful available – which can add 6-12 miles worth of range a minute to an EV. They are typically used in public fast-charging stations on highways and in urban areas. However, the Jule charger can operate on a lower-power grid connection (like a level 2 charger) but then rapidly discharge that stored energy to deliver a high-power level 3-equivalent charge to electric vehicles.</p> <p>“In some locations, utility companies limit the amount of power that chargers can draw from the grid, so we had to design controls capable of extracting the exact amount allowed,” says Iravani.</p>    <h2><strong>Operating in remote locations</strong></h2> <p>“And, of course, you have to minimise the requirements for maintenance, because Canada is huge. When you install these [chargers] at some locations, the distances from urban areas can be hundreds of kilometres,” he adds.</p> <p>Today, the Jule battery charger is proving popular not only in remote areas but also for public charging in urban locations and shopping centres. A Jule charging point has even been installed in a parking garage at the University of Toronto’s downtown campus.</p> <p>Iravani says that the concept can be developed for industry-specific applications as well, especially for those operating in remote areas. “For example, in the mining industry, they have many heavy trucks and machinery that can take advantage of this technology in a wide variety of locations.”</p> <h2><strong>Overcoming extreme weather</strong></h2> <p>To meet the original aim of providing charging stations in remote areas of Canada, the team had to overcome the issue of using a battery in very low temperatures. “In Canada, we deal with extreme cold conditions – in some cases, extreme rain and snow. The battery would have to accommodate all these conditions, particularly cold weather,” Iravani says.</p> <p>“You have to house it within a container, and ensure there is effective air conditioning, heating and cooling, while also adjusting sensors properly, designing adequate spacing between components and proper heat sinks [components that absorb and dissipate heat generated by the charging station].”</p> <p>This technical achievement was made possible when Jule’s partnership with the University of Toronto expanded in 2018 to include Prof Cristina Amon and Carlos Da Silva. Amon and Da Silva are leading researchers at the University of Toronto’s Advanced Thermofluids Optimization, Modelling and Simulation (Atoms) laboratory. Their efforts helped advance Jule’s technology on thermal management of batteries and power electronics.</p>    <h2><strong>A powerful partnership</strong></h2> <p>Jule embarked on its first research collaboration with the University of Toronto in 2010, a year after its founding, with research assistants from the university testing the design aspects alongside engineers from the company. Several PhD and post-doctoral fellows at the university have also fed into specific design aspects of the technology over the years.</p> <p>Jule was co-founded by University of Toronto mechanical engineering alumnus Carmine Pizzurro and employs 14 alumni today. Pizzurro says: “We chose to collaborate with the University of Toronto because of its world-class research expertise and commitment to innovation – a perfect match for Jule’s mission to modernise the grid and transform EV charging.</p> <p>“Since our partnership began, we have achieved several industry-first milestones together, from deploying the world’s first lithium-ion batteries on the electrical grid to advancing cleaner, more resilient EV infrastructure.”</p> <p>The collaboration with Jule has given University of Toronto researchers hands-on experience in a real-world setting, says Amon. “This partnership has significantly enhanced the learning experiences of our engineering students and researchers, enabling us to co-develop and test industry-relevant battery and charging technologies in ways that are usually limited in university lab settings.”</p> <p>She adds: “Our partnership with Jule is meeting the demand for groundbreaking energy storage solutions that will not only reduce the charging time but also enhance the safety and longevity of batteries, making electric vehicles more practical and appealing to consumers.”</p> <p>The development of Jule’s EV battery charger highlights the importance of the University of Toronto’s innovation strategy and, as fast chargers are transforming EV charging infrastructure across North America, it shows how collaboration between universities and industry can spark global innovation.</p> <p><em>Meet the extraordinary community at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/impact?utm_source=BMUTC&amp;utm_medium=guardianpaid&amp;utm_campaign=BA2025&amp;utm_content=article" rel="nofollow">University of Toronto</a> that’s pushing the boundaries of what’s possible</em></p>
