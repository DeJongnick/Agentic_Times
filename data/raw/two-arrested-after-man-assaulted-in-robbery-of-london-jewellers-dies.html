<p>Two people have been arrested over a robbery at a jewellery shop in south-west London, shortly after which a staff member was found dead.</p> <p>A man and a woman, both in their 30s, were detained by officers this week and later released while police continue to investigate. The body of Oliver White, who was assaulted but not seriously injured during the robbery, was found in Surrey the next day. Police have said they are not treating his death as suspicious.</p> <p>“First and foremost, our thoughts remain with Mr White’s family and friends at this unimaginably difficult time,” said Det Ch Insp Scott Mather of the Met police’s flying squad.</p> <p>“We are working tirelessly to get them the answers they need and are making good progress with our investigation. We urge anyone who has information that could assist us to get in touch as soon as possible.</p> <p>“The images we have provided are good quality and someone must recognise the men we need to speak to. If you don’t want to contact police, please contact Crimestoppers anonymously.”</p>    <p>The robbery took place in Kew Road, Richmond, at about 3pm on Saturday, when police said two unarmed men had stolen several high-value watches. Scotland Yard said White had been found dead about 10 miles (16km) awayin Shepperton on Sunday. This is being investigated by Surrey police, who are supporting the victim’s family, the Met said.</p> <p>White’s family paid tribute to him on Tuesday. They said in a statement: “Our son Oliver returned home from his place of work on Saturday traumatised and unable to speak. He had been the victim of a terrifying attack and high-value robbery at his place of work, which was later shared widely on social media.</p> <p>“Sadly, it is our belief that Oliver subsequently took his own life due to the anguish and distress of this terrible incident. As a family, we are devastated by the loss of our beautiful, funny, loyal boy, who lit up every room he walked into.</p> <p>“We are desperately trying to make sense and come to terms with this tragic incident and plead that we are given the privacy to grieve without additional stress and intrusion into our lives.”</p>
