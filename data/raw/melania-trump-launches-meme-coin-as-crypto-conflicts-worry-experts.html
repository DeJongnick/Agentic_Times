<p>The incoming US first lady, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/melania-trump">Melania Trump</a>, has followed her husband’s lead by launching a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency meme coin, fueling conflict of interest concerns as the new administration prepares to loosen regulation of the volatile and controversial assets.</p> <p>Digital currencies rallied as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> prepared to return to the White House. The decision to launch crypto coins on the eve of his inauguration alarmed presidential ethics experts.</p> <p>The price of the incoming president’s token, $Trump, had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/trump-crypto-meme-coin">tripled</a> to more than $70 (£57), giving it a total value of over $14bn shortly after its launch on Friday. However, the launch of his wife’s coin, $Melania, pared back those gains as investors piled into her rival coin.</p> <p>“This may represent the single worst conflict of interest in the modern history of the presidency,” Norman Eisen, a former ethics adviser in the Obama administration, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/19/trump-meme-coin-crypto/">told</a> the Washington Post. Trump has “the most profound conflict of interest” in the crypto space, he added, citing the fact he was “seeking to gain” and regulate the industry.</p> <p>Cryptocurrencies have made significant gains since Donald Trump’s election victory in November as he has signalled plans to deregulate the sector.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jan/20/bitcoin-record-high-dollar-dips-trump-coin-business-live">bitcoin – the world’s best known digital currency – reached a fresh record high</a> of $109,241, up by more than 5%. Dogecoin – which has been touted by Trump-supporting billionaire Elon Musk as the “people’s crypto” – gained nearly 5%, while Ethereum climbed 3.5% to $3,384.</p> <p>Trump, who will be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donald-trump-inauguration">inaugurated on Monday</a>, posted on social media as his token launched: “It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW.”. According to the meme coin’s website, a Trump-owned company, CIC Digital LLC, will own 80% of the token’s supply.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/19/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order">TikTok says it is restoring service in US after Trump vowed to delay ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The token quickly broke into the top 20 of all cryptocurrencies. Such was the extent of the digital stampede, blockchain analysts said, it sucked liquidity from the rest of the market, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-18/crypto-fans-bid-up-trump-branded-token-days-before-inauguration">causing other coins to fall in value</a>, as traders sold their existing holdings to buy into Trump’s.</p> <p>Melania Trump’s launch appeared to have a similarly unintended effect on the market, as some traders sold his meme coin for a new target. “The Official Melania Meme is live! You can buy $MELANIA now,” she posted on X, which was reposted by her husband.</p> <p>Shortly after the launch of $Melania, the price of $Trump fell by more than 50%, from $75 to $30, before recovering steadily in subsequent hours to about $64. The market capitalisation of $Melania reached as high as $13bn.</p> <p>“This is beyond insane,” analysts at The Kobeissi Letter <a href="https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1881091214474375346" title="https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1881091214474375346">posted</a> on X. “Less than 48 hours ago, Donald Trump launched $trump which just erased $7.5bn in market cap in 10 minutes. In the minutes around the launch of Melania Trump’s token, we saw massive sell orders in $trump.”</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/president-elect-trump-launches-cryptocurrency-meme-coin-ahead-inauguration">meme coin</a> is a type of cryptocurrency inspired by trends such as internet memes with no inherent utility, and are often susceptible to price swings and crashes. A coin launched by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/03/hawk-tuah-girl-podcast-interview">“Hawk Tuah girl” Haliey Welch</a> <a href="https://www.livenowfox.com/news/hawk-tuah-girl-crypto-crash-memecoin-controversy">dropped 95%</a> shortly after its release last month, falling from a $500m market capitalisation to $25m. Welch became famous after a viral video of her talking about oral sex.</p> <p>Meme coins have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/12/gambling-memecoins-donald-trump-hawk-tuah-girl-haliey-welch-crypto">described</a> by traders as a “pure form of gambling” and akin to “buying a lottery ticket”.</p> <p>While the notional value of the Trump-affiliated meme coins rose into the billions of dollars, in practice it would be difficult to realise that amount of money by selling the tokens without dramatically affecting the price. However, they could still allow Trump-controlled companies to make significant amounts of money as lock-up periods end over the next three to 12 months, while he is US president.</p> <p>The $Melania meme coin is marketed by MKT World LLC, a Florida-registered company owned by Melania Trump, whose previous surname name was Knauss. The owners will be able to sell the meme coin themselves after 30 days.</p> <p>“The meme coins have amplified bitcoin’s momentum, with retail traders optimistic about Trump reaffirming his commitment to the crypto industry,” Bloomberg reported Ben El-Baz, the managing director of the digital asset exchange HashKey Global, as saying.</p> <p>Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin’s release, saying it was symbolic of the incoming president’s support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trump-crypto-extremism">promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations</a> and picked its supporters for key government positions.</p> <p>But it has also stoked concerns of conflicts of interest and criticisms over an attempt to personally profit from political office.</p> <p>Trump <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/08/27/trump-selling-more-nft-trading-cards-as-he-courts-crypto-voters/">released batches of crypto trading cards</a> during his presidential campaign, generating more than $4m for each release. Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Jr also launched a cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial, in 2024, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/31/trump-crypto-family-affair-00176764">inciting concerns</a> of an overt conflict of interest.</p> <p>Donald Trump meme coin’s website included a disclaimer stating: “Trump memes are intended to function as an expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ‘$Trump’ and the associated artwork, and are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.</p> <p>“GetTrumpMemes.com is not political and has nothing to do with any political campaign or any political office or governmental agency.”<br><br>Melania Trump’s meme coin website has a similar disclaimer.<br></p>
