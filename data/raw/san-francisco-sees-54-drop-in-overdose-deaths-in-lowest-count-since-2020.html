<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> saw a 54% drop in overdose deaths in October 2024, compared with the same month a year earlier – the lowest monthly count since the city began publishing the figures in 2020, officials announced this week.</p> <p>Last month, 32 people died of accidental overdoses in the city; there were 70 deaths in October 2023, according to a report of preliminary <a href="https://www.sf.gov/sites/default/files/2024-11/2024%2011_OCME%20Overdose%20Report.pdf">data</a> from the city’s office of the chief medical examiner. Overdose deaths have declined in recent months and are down more than 20% in the span between January and October this year, compared with the same period last year.</p> <p>London Breed, the San Francisco mayor, attributed the progress to the city’s expanded resources, access to medicines to help people break addiction and “targeted enforcement disrupting the fentanyl supply chain”.</p> <p>“It is remarkable and it is saving lives,” Breed said at a news conference. “We’ve worked hard in San Francisco to try and combat these issues by providing a variety of not just services and support but also accountability.”</p> <p>San Francisco experienced its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/06/san-francisco-fentanyl-meth-drug-overdoses">deadliest</a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/06/san-francisco-fentanyl-meth-drug-overdoses"> </a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/06/san-francisco-fentanyl-meth-drug-overdoses">year</a> for drug overdoses in 2023 as the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl became more widely available in the US drug supply.</p> <p>Last year, 810 people <a href="https://www.sf.gov/resource/2023/drug-overdose-and-treatment-data-and-reports#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20the%20San%20Francisco,response%20and%20measure%20our%20progress.">died</a> from unintentional drug overdoses in the city, according to the office of the chief medical examiner. In August 2023 alone, someone died of an overdose every nine hours.</p> <p>Overdose deaths in the US soared during the pandemic but are now declining. Over a 12-month period that ended on 30 June, there were about 97,000 overdose deaths, down 14% from the previous 12-month period, according to provisional data from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/05/california-prop-36-results">California passes the tough-on-crime Proposition 36</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“This is a pretty stunning and rapid reversal of drug overdose mortality numbers,” said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.</p> <p>Experts have not determined the exact reasons behind the decline, but they say it could be the result of more harm-reduction strategies, such as expanding the availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone (Narcan), as well as medication treatments.</p> <p>The CDC director, Mandy Cohen, attributed the drop to increased awareness of fentanyl as well as the use of fentanyl-detecting test strips. Meanwhile, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) <a href="https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2024/11/15/deas-third-annual-national-family-summit-fentanyl-highlights-progress">reported</a> seeing a decrease in the potency of fentanyl pills.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>
