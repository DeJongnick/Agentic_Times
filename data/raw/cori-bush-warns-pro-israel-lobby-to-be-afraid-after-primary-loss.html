<p>Representative <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cori-bush">Cori Bush</a> has warned the pro-Israel lobby “to be afraid” after it poured millions of dollars into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/06/missouri-cori-bush-primary-bell-aipac-israel">defeating</a> the prominent member of the “Squad” of progressive Democrats in Tuesday’s primary election in St Louis.</p> <p>Bush said her loss to St Louis county prosecutor Wesley Bell after the hardline American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/03/cori-bush-wesley-bell-missouri-election">targeted her</a> for opposition to Israel’s attack on Gaza had freed her to openly challenge the powerful pressure group, which has vowed to spend $100m to influence US elections this year in favour of Israel.</p> <p>“They’re about to see this other Cori, this other side,” <a href="https://x.com/MarkMaxwellTV/status/1821058228953763891">she told supporters</a>. “Aipac, I’m coming to tear your kingdom down.”</p> <p>Bush, who will continue to serve in Congress until January, added: “All they did was radicalise me, so now they need to be afraid.”</p> <p>Bush did not say how she now intends to take on Aipac but critics of the lobby group, which has previously <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/07/04/real-insiders">boasted</a> of its ability to round up congressional support, have said that it should be obliged to <a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/aipac-should-register-as-a-foreign-agent/">register as an agent</a> of a foreign government because it pushes Israel’s interests over those of the US.</p> <p>Aipac spent $8.5m to defeat Bush, mostly on negative advertising through its campaign financing arm, the United Democracy Project (UDP), in the second most expensive primary race in the US this year.</p> <p>Aipac celebrated Bell’s win, a second major victory after the UDP played a leading role in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/25/new-york-democratic-primary-jamaal-bowman">unseating</a> New York representative Jamaal Bowman, another member of the Squad critical of Israel, with <a href="https://x.com/AIPAC/status/1821164560830677036">a tweet</a> proclaiming: “Being pro-Israel is good policy and good politics.”</p> <p>But groups supporting Bush noted that, as in other congressional races targeted by pro-Israel groups, almost none of the campaign advertising by the UDP addressed the Gaza war or Bush’s call for a ceasefire. Instead, the UDP went after her on unrelated issues, particularly her voting record in Congress.</p> <p>Similarly, the UDP spent $15m to defeat Bowman in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/20/jamaal-bowman-george-latimer-primary">most expensive</a> primary in US history with a barrage of negative advertising that had little to do with his criticisms of Israel. Much of the UDP’s money comes from billionaires who fund hardline pro-Israel causes and Republicans in other races, including some who have given to Donald Trump’s campaign.</p> <p>Jews for Cori, a coalition of progressive Jewish organisations, blamed Bush’s loss on “Aipac’s interference” on behalf of Israel and the Republicans.</p> <p>“While Aipac targeted both Bowman and Bush because of their support for Palestinian human rights, the group did not highlight or even mention this issue in their smear campaigns. While Aipac will claim their positions are ‘good policy and good politics’ it is clear that they are well-aware that they are losing the battle for public opinion,” it said.</p> <p>Justice Democrats, which spent $1.8m on advertising in support of Bush, called her opponent “an empty suit for Aipac and its GOP mega-donors to advance their own interests”.</p> <p>The group’s director, Alexandra Rojas, argued that the huge spending by the pro-Israel lobby to defeat individual members of Congress is a sign of weakness.</p> <p>“As Aipac’s influence in Congress wanes and the rightwing network that props it up is exposed, Aipac has to spend historic amounts in Democratic elections to continue advancing their interests at the expense of the Democratic mainstream that overwhelmingly supports a ceasefire and an end to the genocide in Gaza,” she said.</p> <p>Still, if Aipac’s intent in targeting Bush and Bowman was to warn other members of Congress that there will be a price to pay for muscular criticism of Israeli government policies and adopting minority positions, such as opposition to the US’s considerable military aid to Israel, then the strategy may have the desired effect of encouraging other politicians to keep their criticisms of Israel to themselves out of fear of a challenge from a well financed opponent.</p> <p>But Aipac is known to intervene when their congressional foes are already vulnerable. A number of the group’s former targets – other “Squad” members known for their criticisms of Israel – have been spared the onslaught, insulated by their popularity within their districts. </p> <p>The UDP spent heavily to try and oust Pennsylvania congresswoman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/22/summer-lee-progressive-congress-pennsylvania">Summer Lee</a> in the 2022 Democratic primaries. She won that race by less than 1% of the vote.</p> <p>This year, the lobby largely steered clear of Lee’s race despite the emergence of a pro-Israel challenger. Lee won the primary<strong> </strong>by a margin of more than 20 points.</p> <p>Similarly, a challenger backed by substantial pro-Israel money came close to unseating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ilhan-omar">Ilhan Omar</a>, another Squad member who has been accused of antisemitism over criticisms of Israel, in the 2022 primaries. Omar is again facing a challenge from the same opponent, Don Samuels, in next week’s Democratic primary, but Aipac and similar groups have not thrown as much money or effort into this year’s race. Opinion polls give Omar a substantial lead.</p> <p>The UDP focused its efforts this year on Bush and Bowman, who were vulnerable to attack on issues other than Israel and Gaza, which many voters agree with them on. Both members of Congress struggled to justify voting against Joe Biden’s trillion-dollar infrastructure bill – a primary line of attack of negative advertising.</p> <p>The redrawing of the boundaries of Bowman’s district reshaped it as a more traditionally Democratic constituency with less voter support for the Squad and progressive policies. Bowman was also open to criticism over an incident when he pulled a fire alarm at the Capitol in Washington DC in order to delay a vote on a government shutdown called by Republicans. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanour over the incident.</p>
