<p>Tensions between Michelle Wu, the mayor of Boston, and the Trump administration have been escalating in recent months over the administration’s aggressive immigration policies, with reports now signaling the possibility of a federal immigration enforcement surge in the city.</p> <p>The friction came to a head last week when the Trump administration reportedly began preparing an “immigration enforcement blitz” for Boston in the coming weeks, according to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/29/trump-admin-plans-immigration-enforcement-surge-in-boston-00536276">Politico</a>.</p> <p>The report, which cited unnamed current and former administration officials, <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/boston-follows-the-law-mayor-wu-responds-to-report-of-planned-ice-surge/3799776/">prompted a swift rebuke</a> from Wu, who has in recent months become a vocal defender of sanctuary laws and immigrant protections.</p> <p>“Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law – city, state and federal,” Wu said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MayorWu/posts/unlike-the-trump-administration-boston-follows-the-lawlocal-state-and-federalthe/791123140088049/">statement</a>. “We are the safest major city in the country because all of our community members know that they are part of how we keep the entire community safe. Stop attacking cities to hide your administration’s failures.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/trump-memes-immigration-deportation">From Uncle Sam to social media memes: inside homeland security’s push to swell Ice ranks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This standoff has been steadily building since March when Wu <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/politics/live-updates/boston-mayor-wu-testifies-before-congress-on-immigration-policies">testified</a> before Congress alongside <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/boston-chicago-denver-nyc-sanctuary-mayors-to-be-held-publicly-accountable-on-march-5/">three other Democratic mayors</a> to defend their cities’ immigration policies – specifically so-called sanctuary city laws that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/donald-trump-sanctuary-cities">limit state and local law enforcement cooperation</a> with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).</p> <p>Supporters of the laws, including local leaders and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116200/witnesses/HHRG-118-JU01-Wstate-BatistaR-20230713.pdf">police chiefs</a> in jurisdictions that have them, argue that these measures can help build trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement. Some studies have <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116200/documents/HHRG-118-JU01-20230713-SD003.pdf">found</a> that crime rates tend to be lower in sanctuary counties compared with those without such protections.</p> <p>Critics of these policies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/sanctuary-cities-trump-immigration.html">claim</a> that sanctuary laws undermine federal law enforcement’s ability to arrest and deport individuals with criminal records.</p> <p>So-called “sanctuary cities” have become <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/donald-trump-sanctuary-cities">a central target</a> of this Trump administration, as it pushes for mass deportations as part of its crackdown on immigration. In June, Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/pam-bondi-sanctuary-cities-letter-immigration">sent letters </a>to 32 US mayors, including Wu, demanding they end their sanctuary policies or face cuts to federal funding and possible legal consequences.</p> <p>Wu then <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/deadline-for-bostons-response-to-federal-government-on-immigration-enforcement/3792422/">issued a staunch</a> defense of Boston’s policies in a letter to Bondi and in a subsequent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/19/boston-sanctuary-cities-michelle-wu-trump-administration">press conference</a>.</p> <p>“The City of Boston is the safest major city in America,” she wrote. “Our progress is the result of decades of community policing and partnership between local law enforcement and community leaders, who share a commitment to making Boston a safe and welcoming home for everyone.”</p> <p>The progress, Wu said, was in part a result of the city’s local laws, including the Boston Trust Act, which prohibits local police from engaging with federal immigration enforcement unless there is a criminal warrant and is “fully consistent with federal law”.</p> <p>“On behalf of the people of Boston, and in solidarity with the cities and communities targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion, we affirm our support for each other and for our democracy,” she wrote.</p> <p>After Wu’s remarks, the acting Ice director, Todd Lyons, said that the agency intended to “<a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/ice-director-says-hell-flood-boston-after-mayor-wu-refuses-to-comply-with-feds/3794197/">flood the zone</a>, especially in sanctuary jurisdictions”.</p> <p>“Now you’re going to see more Ice agents come to Boston to make sure that we take these public threats out that she wants to let go back in the communities,” he said, vowing to make “America safe”.</p> <p>Patricia Hyde, Boston’s acting Ice field office director, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL_BbCkvp_Q">echoed Lyons’s sentiment</a>, warning that Ice was “not backing down” and that “the men and women with Ice, unlike Mayor Wu”, took an oath that they swore to uphold “to protect the cities and communities where we work and where we live, and that’s what we’re gonna do, despite the obstacles”.</p> <p>Wu fired back on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wutrain.bsky.social/post/3lwvss6ytj22v">social media</a> and said she took an oath to uphold the US constitution, noting that she was sworn in with her hand on a 1782 Aitken Bible “also known as the Bible of the Revolution”.</p> <p>As the threat of federal actions looms, Wu said last week that her administration was actively preparing for the possibility of a federal national guard deployment. Such a move would mirror recent actions by the Trump administration in both Washington DC and Los Angeles.</p> <p>The administration sent national guard <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/trump-washington-dc-crime">troops to Washington</a> DC last month under the pretext of combating a supposed surge in violent crime –&nbsp;a claim that stands in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/trump-washington-dc-crime-los-angeles">contrast to the city’s current crime data</a>. Earlier this summer, the administration also sent thousands of national guard troops to Los Angeles during protests against the administration’s immigration crackdown, a move a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/trumps-national-guard-troops-los-angeles-illegal">federal judge recently ruled</a> as unlawful.</p> <p>“We are following what’s happening in other cities around the country very closely,” Wu told <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2025-08-26/bostons-mayor-bracing-for-potential-national-guard-deployment">GBH’s Boston Public Radio</a> last week. “Unfortunately, we have seen what it would look like if that should come to pass, and that this federal administration is willing to go beyond the bounds of constitutional authority and federal law.”</p> <p>Wu also said her administration was reviewing relevant legal precedents and working “very closely” with community members “to ensure people know what’s happening and that this is not something that is needed or wanted or legally sound”.</p> <p>She added that “in this moment, however we got here, every mayor of every major city is having to take preparations for the national guard coming in against their will”.</p> <p>Wu’s comments come as leaders in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/jb-pritzker-trump-chicago-illinois">other Democratic-led cities</a> around the country are also bracing for the possibility of national guard deployments or Ice surges in their communities.</p> <p>The Trump administration announced plans this week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/jb-pritzker-trump-chicago-illinois">to ramp up immigration crackdowns and deploy federal agents</a> to Chicago, sparking strong <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/chicago-mayor-executive-order-trump-immigration-raids">backlash from local leaders</a>.</p> <p>On Thursday, JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, said he had been informed that expanded Ice operations would begin in and around Chicago this weekend, according to <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/post/national-guard-chicago-expanded-ice-operations-expected-start-saturday-governor-jb-pritzker-says/17737342/">ABC News Chicago.</a></p> <p>Pritzker said earlier this week that he was “<a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/pritzker-deeply-concerned-about-ice-targeting-mexican-independence-day-events/3818582/">deeply concerned</a>“ that Ice would target Mexican Independence Day celebrations on Saturday. So far, one independence day parade in North Chicago has been <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/mexican-independence-day-parade-waukegan-postponed/">postponed</a>.</p>
