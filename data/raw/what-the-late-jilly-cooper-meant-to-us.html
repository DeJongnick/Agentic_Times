<p>I have yet to try any of Jilly Cooper’s bonkbusters (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/06/dame-jilly-cooper-obituary">Obituary, 6 October</a>) but loved her column in the Sunday Times and read all her 1970s “permissive novels”, so when our first daughter was born in 1977, I&nbsp;knew at once that I wanted to call&nbsp;her <a href="https://www.jillycooper.co.uk/books/harriet/">Harriet</a>.</p> <p>I discovered recently that one of our oldest friends, an English scholar and great admirer of Jane Austen, had believed for almost 50 years that Harriet was named after a character in Emma. I was reluctant to shatter his fond illusions, but as my personal tribute&nbsp;to Jilly Cooper have decided&nbsp;I will now do so.</p> <p>Incidentally, our younger daughter is known as Bella, but not this time after a Cooper title character. Her full name is Isabella, again not in tribute to the Austen character in Northanger Abbey, but to Isabella Bird, the intrepid author of A Lady’s Life in the Rocky Mountains, a true story with no shortage of horses or rugged men, though not quite a bonkbuster.<br><strong>Caroline Cole</strong><br><em>Huddersfield, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• I have never read a Jilly Cooper novel, but nevertheless I am so sad to hear of her death. Long ago, in 1982, I saw her programme <a href="https://era.org.uk/shakespeare-resource/shakespeare-in-perspective-the-merry-wives-of-windsor/">Shakespeare in Perspective | The Merry Wives of Windsor</a> – part of the wonderful BBC Shakespeare series. I remember her insight, humanity and wry observations of&nbsp;class. Real intellect, and extremely funny with it.<br><strong>Bob Kentridge</strong><br><em>Professor of psychology, Durham&nbsp;University</em></p> <p>• As a recently married woman in the 1960s, I was surprised to receive <em>three</em><strong> </strong>copies of Jilly Cooper’s book How to Stay Married. The advice must have been good, though, as we celebrated our 57th&nbsp;anniversary&nbsp;in July.<br><strong>Jean Holmes</strong><br><em>Clitheroe, Lancashire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
