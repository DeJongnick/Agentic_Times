<p>Good morning. The threat posed by ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred is far from over. The rain is still bucketing down and parts of south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales are on flood watch, including parts of the Brisbane River. For many others, the massive clean-up after the storm has begun.</p> 
<p>In other news, our exclusive report reveals the federal government was warned by officials in late 2023 that its “one-sided” support of Israel was putting Australia’s social cohesion at risk.</p> 
<p>Overseas, millions of Palestinians could soon be left in the dark as Israel looks to sever electricity to Gaza as leverage against Hamas. And Moscow claims it is close to surrounding thousands of Ukrainian troops in its Kursk region with Russian forces on the advance.</p>

<p><strong>Inside the Islamic State prisons the west is trying to forget</strong><br><br>Michael Safi travelled to north-east Syria to speak to foreign Islamic State fighters imprisoned there. He discovered that a change in the US administration, and USAid funding cuts, mean there is a growing fear of prison breaks. The Kurdish forces running the prisons want foreign governments to take their fighters back. Many have refused – they prefer to forget about these IS legacies, even as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2025/mar/10/inside-the-islamic-state-prisons-the-west-is-trying-to-forget-full-story-podcast">global political events leave the prisons exposed</a>.</p>
