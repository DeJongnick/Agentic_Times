<p>Regarding gen Z parents not reading to their children (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jun/05/reading-to-children-should-be-a-pleasure">Letters, 5 June</a>), we must also consider what children are offered to read. It’s not just about reading more, but about stories that feel relevant, spark curiosity and reflect real lives. Many parents we work with say that books often feel repetitive, irrelevant or dominated by the same voices. When children and parents see themselves and their communities in stories, they enjoy reading more, which supports&nbsp;emotional development and academic success.</p> <p>Yet diversity in children’s books is falling. The <a href="https://clpe.org.uk/research/clpe-reflecting-realities-survey-ethnic-representation-within-uk-childrens-literature-2">latest CLPE report</a> shows that ethnic minority main characters dropped from 14% in 2022 to 7% in 2023, despite <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/school-pupils-and-their-characteristics/2024-25">nearly 40%</a> of schoolchildren in England being from those backgrounds. </p> <p>Our study with the University of Manchester, due to be published later this year, highlights how representation boosts Black children’s confidence and enjoyment of reading. Diverse stories help children build empathy, understanding and emotional literacy. If we want families to read more, we need books that truly reflect the world we live in.<br><strong>Keisha Ehigie</strong> <em>Founder, Imagine Me Stories</em>, <strong>Dr Nicola Lester</strong> <em>Lecturer in psychology, University of Manchester</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
