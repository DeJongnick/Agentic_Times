<p>OpenAI has broken ranks with the Tech Council of Australia over copyright restrictions, declaring that its artificial intelligence models are “going to be in Australia, one way or the other”.</p> <p>Chris Lehane, the chief global affairs officer of the artificial intelligence company responsible for ChatGPT, made a keynote appearance at SXSW Sydney on Friday, where he covered the geopolitics of AI, Australia’s tech future – and the global debate around using copyrighted material to train large language models.</p> <p>Scott Farquhar, the Tech Council chief executive and Atlassian co-founder, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/14/scott-farquhar-thinks-australia-should-let-ai-train-for-free-on-creative-content-he-overlooks-one-key-point">has previously said</a> Australian copyright law “hurts a lot of investment of these companies in Australia”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>In August, it emerged the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/05/productivity-commission-digital-economy-report-copyright-rules-text-and-data-mining-to-train-ai-models">Productivity Commission was examining</a> whether technology firms should be exempt from copyright rules that stop companies mining text and data to train AI models.</p> <p>But, when asked whether Australia could lose investment in AI development and datacentres if it didn’t loosen its copyright laws to fair use, Lehane told the audience:</p> <p>“No … we are going to be in Australia, one way or the other.”</p> <p>Lehane said countries generally chose one of two positions when it came to copyright restrictions and AI. One was to take a US-style fair use approach to copyright, allowing for the development of “frontier” (highly advanced, large-scale) AI, while the other was to maintain a historic position on copyright, limiting AI’s scope.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2025/oct/17/ai-you-cannot-escape-it-and-now-the-internet-claims-many-people-dont-even-care-what-is-going-on">AI – you cannot escape it!

Innovations come along, and then societies adapt to those innovations,” he said. “We are a non-profit, and our purpose is to build AI that benefits everyone … in the same way that a couple of generations ago, people could go to the library and learn.”</p> <p>OpenAI on Friday <a href="https://x.com/OpenAINewsroom/status/1979005850166648933">suspended the ability</a> to generate videos featuring likenesses of Martin Luther King Jr after his family complained about the technology.</p> <p>Lehane also said China and the US were engaged in a “very real competition” to shape the future of global AI, pitting values head-to-head.</p> <p>“We don’t necessarily think about this as a fight as much as it is a competition – but it is a very real competition, and the stakes are pretty significant,” he said, adding US-led frontier models will “inherently be built on democratic values”, while those of China will “probably” be built on autocratic norms.</p> <p>“One of the two will end up being the player that the rest of the world builds on,” he said.</p> <p>When asked whether he was confident that America would remain a democracy, he said, “democracy, as others have said, tends to be a very messy process – but the US has demonstrated over time that it gets this stuff right.”</p> <p>US and its allies – Australia included – are going to have to start generating a gigawatt of energy on a weekly basis to develop the infrastructure needed to maintain a “democratic lead” on AI, while Australia has the potential to develop its own frontier AI, he added.</p> <p>“Australia occupies a really unique position” in that it has a very high AI user base, 30,000 developers, “a tonne of talent”, a fast-growing renewable sector, fibre optics connections with Asia and is a Five Eyes nation, he said.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
