There’s still a long tournament ahead of us and we’ll be looking to put this behind us as quickly as we can.</p> <p>England bowled really well with the new ball. Linsey Smith was excellent; we probably didn’t expect that much swing and could have played straighter lines. We were a bit push-y at the ball as well and could have been a bit more calm.</p> <p>The message is to keep trusting what we’ve done in the past.

It’s a tough challenge but conditions really suited me today.</p> <p>[What’s the key to your success so far] I think just backing myself and not overcomplicating it too much. Keep it pretty simple, bowl at the stumps as much as possible. And yeah, it came off today.</p> <p>There’s huge talent in the squad and everyone’s pushing for places which is always good.

The talking is over, at least for now, and England’s World Cup is about to begin. The bad news is they start with a tough game against South Africa in Guwahati. The good news is they start with a tough game against South Africa in Guwahati. Victory today would give England instant momentum and underscore the cautious confidence of their pre-tournament chatter.</p> <p>An excellent win over Australia in their last warm-up has increased that confidence, even if the individual performances of Alice Capsey (88 not out) and Sarah Glenn (5 for 32) gave Charlotte Edwards a slight selection headache.</p> <p>Edwards is a serial winner, so there’s no danger of England setting their sights low. But from a distance they are in the slightly unusual position of having a very clear par for the tournament.</p> <p>Failure to reach the semi-finals would be a minor shocker, even allowing for the improvement among the traditional also-rans. Reaching the final ahead of either Australia or India, the two clear favourites to win the competition, would be a serious achievement. And if England win it… no, let’s not go there. It’s way too early for that sort of talk.</p> <p><strong>Today’s match begins at 10.30am BST.</strong></p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-03T11:51:54.000Z">at 12.51pm BST</time></p>  </div>
