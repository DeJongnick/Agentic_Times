<h1>The science behind winning a Nobel prize? Being a man from a wealthy family</h1>

<p>We like scientific breakthroughs. Humanity ultimately relies on them. So it matters if we’re missing out on discoveries.</p> <p>But compelling evidence that we are indeed missing out comes from a <a href="https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f209309.pdf">new study of the childhood background</a> (measured on the basis of their father’s occupation) of some very successful scientists: Nobel laureates.</p> <p>If talent <em>and</em> opportunity were equally distributed, the average winner would come from a middle income background. The reality? The average laureate grew up in a household just below the top 10%. More than 50% come from the top 5%. Dads of laureates are likely to be business owners, doctors or engineers (not politicians, sorry kids).</p> <p>So either talent is hugely unequally distributed, concentrated among richer families, or opportunity is. It’s the latter. Reinforcing the case that a more equal sharing of opportunity would mean more&nbsp;scientific progress, the authors show that cities that have more intergenerational mobility produce more laureates.</p> <p>Want your kids to win a Nobel and can’t change your own occupation? The research offers two bits of advice. Have a son (you need to be from a particularly rich family if you’re a woman, indicative of the wider barriers women face in science), and live in America.</p> <p>Access to scientific opportunity has improved over the Nobel prizes’ 125 years. The typical winner was in the top 10% in 1900 as against the top 20% now. But here’s a sobering fact on the size of the <a href="http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/inventors_paper.pdf">“lost Einstein” problem</a>, as other academics have called it. Those born in richer countries, not just to richer families, are far more likely to win a Nobel. This gap has hardly closed in a century. That’s a lot of talent wasted. And breakthroughs lost.</p> <p><em>• Torsten Bell is Labour MP for Swansea West and author of </em>Great Britain?
