<p>On the front page of the Daily Telegraph, Australia’s first comprehensive assessment of the risks from climate change became “SCIENCE FICTION”.</p> <p>In other leading stories, wind turbines became a frightening obstacle for firefighting planes and solar panels were a source of mountains of landfill waste.</p> <p>Some might say there’s a pattern there that would not be out of character with News Corporation’s more than occasional animosity towards climate change science and renewable energy.</p> <p>Was there any truth in all this? Let’s have a rummage.</p> <h2>Science fact not fiction</h2> <p>The National Climate Risk Assessment, released last month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/15/australia-national-climate-risk-assessment-summary-five-key-takeaways-heat-related-deaths-economic-cost-climate-change">found climate change would affect all aspects of Australian lives and the country’s economy</a>.</p> <p>“SCIENCE FICTION: Doomsday report out of this world: US expert” blared the Daily Telegraph’s headline, more than a week after the government released the assessment.</p> <p>“Bowen’s climate doom ‘fiction’,” declared a headline on an inside page.</p> <p>The front-page story, which was also page one news in Melbourne’s Herald Sun, was based entirely on the views of one US-based political scientist, Dr Roger Pielke Jr, who is <a href="https://www.desmog.com/roger-pielke-jr/">loved among climate sceptics for his views that have downplayed the costs of climate change impacts</a>.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/sign-up-for-the-clear-air-australia-environment-newsletter-with-adam-morton?CMP=copyembed">Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Pielke Jr is a senior fellow at the <a href="https://www.desmog.com/american-enterprise-institute/">American Enterprise Institute</a> – a conservative thinktank with a record of opposing climate action.</p> <p>He argued the Australian Climate Service that coordinated the assessment had chosen a scenario of the future that was “from science fiction” and “doesn’t pass the laugh test”, suggesting it was a gross overestimate of population rise, temperature rise and the amount of coal that would be burned in the future.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/24/coalition-mps-say-australias-emissions-are-a-fraction-of-the-worlds-total-what-kind-of-argument-is-that">Coalition MPs say Australia’s emissions are a fraction of the world’s total. What kind of argument is that?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“That’s a red herring,” said Dr Andrew Watkins, a research associate at Monash University, a lead author of the risk assessment and a former long-serving senior climatologist at the Bureau of Meteorology.</p> <p>“Maybe Roger doesn’t actually understand the purpose of the risk assessment?”</p> <p>Despite the tabloids’ hanging an entire page one story off Pielke Jr’s claim, experts told Temperature Check his focus on scenarios was not relevant.</p> <p>The risk assessment was based instead on the impacts in Australia from three different levels of global warming – 1.5C, 2C and 3C.</p> <p>Watkins said any suggestion global heating would be “well below or well above these scenarios is the greater science fiction”.</p> <p>“Lead authors, including [UN assessment] lead authors and those with professional lifetimes tackling the technical world of climate projections with some of the best climate minds in Australia, were involved in creating these datasets.</p> <p>“Why would you ignore that brilliance?” Watkins asked. “That’s not journalism.”</p> <p>Prof Christian Jakob, a climate modelling expert at Monash University who was not involved in the risk assessment, said Pielke Jr’s claim’s of “science fiction” were laughable.</p> <p>Jakob said the prospects of global heating of 1.5C and 2C were “very real”.</p> <p>“The [ACS] went to 3C of warming,” he said. “It would have been irresponsible not to assess the risks at that level of warming.”</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph ran one sentence of a four-sentence response from the ACS, which said Pielke Jr had “incorrectly represented the methodology used”.</p> <p>In some newsrooms, that might have been enough for editors to hit pause on a story.</p> <h2>Solar panel waste</h2> <p>“Solar rubbish piling up” was the headline on another <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/pictures-reveal-solar-panels-flogged-for-5-with-most-ending-up-in-australian-landfill/news-story/3bbc7ef24c7cabaa924d4a4f754d4774">Daily Telegraph story</a> last month, which said millions of panels were being thrown away.</p> <p>The Telegraph complained that this was happening while state and federal governments were “failing to implement a mandatory recycling scheme”.</p> <p>A month before this story ran, <a href="https://www.energy.gov.au/energy-and-climate-change-ministerial-council/meetings-and-communiques">state and federal environment ministers</a> had met to discuss the need for a scheme to make panel suppliers responsible for the design, recycling and disposal of solar panels.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>They fight fires in the US and Europe around windfarms.

That includes <a href="https://www.offgridenergy.com.au/sustainability-environment/a-look-into-australias-solar-panel-recycling-boom/">new businesses opening up that are recycling panels</a>.</p> <p>The story said 59,340 tonnes of solar panel waste was likely to be generated this year – a <a href="https://8db1c493-f0da-4408-b160-2b1691e11d2f.usrfiles.com/ugd/8db1c4_2f549a4a1c4848409435142afd61f7af.pdf">figure that comes from University of NSW research</a>. That sounds like a lot, but is it?</p> <p>The estimated tonnage of solar panels being dumped right now is about 0.2% of the <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/waste/publications/national-waste-resource-recovery-reporting/glance-2024">26m tonnes of waste going to landfill in Australia</a>.</p> <p>Curiously, the Daily Telegraph reported how it had “uncovered advertisements” on reselling sites such as Gumtree of solar panels being sold for as little as $5 each. An example, apparently, of panels not going to landfill (let’s not dwell on how you “uncover” an advertisement).</p> <p>Experts say 95% of solar panels can be recycled and, curiously again, the Telegraph spoke to one business owner who said it took “about a minute” to collect the aluminium, copper, silver and silicone that are in them.</p> <h2>‘Just fallacies’</h2> <p>This week the Daily Telegraph ran <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/pilot-claims-wind-turbines-are-dangerous-for-fireys-tackling-bushfires-from-the-air/news-story/30665699e6446b799186fb4deecc9b0c">a page one story</a> – “FANNING THE FLAMES” – on how aerial firefighting support pilots were refusing to fly near “giant net zero projects” for “fear of crashing into wind turbines”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/22/temperature-check-gina-rinehart-herald-sun-bush-summit-column">Gina Rinehart’s apocalyptic visions for bush summits just the latest in a history of climate science denialism | Temperature Check</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The printed version of the story didn’t include a response from the NSW Rural Fire Service but did include comments from a retired Yass Valley group captain who had sent a report to his local council outlining concerns about wind turbines.</p> <p>Greg Mullins, a former commissioner of Fire and Rescue NSW, strong advocate for climate action and still a volunteer firefighter, was not impressed.</p> <p>“These are just fallacies,” he told Temperature Check. “I can’t imagine there would be more than a handful of pilots that are not skilled enough to work out the hazards in their operating space.</p> <p>“They fight fires in the US and Europe around windfarms. Why this would suddenly emerge as a major problem here is a mystery. Firefighters and pilots will just work around turbines like they work around everything else. If there’s a hazard, they just wait and fight the fire away from it.”</p> <p>An RFS spokesperson said bushfires moving across a windfarm “are generally managed in the same way as any other bushfire and their presence does not preclude the use of firefighting aircraft to suppress the fire”.</p> <p>Mullins added that some renewable energy projects actually made firefighting easier, with provisions such as dams for filling aircraft and access trails.</p>
