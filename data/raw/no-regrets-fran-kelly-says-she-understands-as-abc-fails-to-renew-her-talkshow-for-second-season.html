<p>High-profile ABC host Fran Kelly says she has no regrets, despite her Friday night talkshow Frankly not being commissioned for a second season.</p> <p>Kelly said she was grateful the national broadcaster gave her the opportunity to try something different and she understood there were competing interests to juggle.</p> <p>“I am very proud of Frankly,” Kelly said. “I’m grateful for the opportunity and understand that the ABC has a lot of competing interests to juggle as we straddle this moment of transition from broadcast to digital first.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/oct/08/fran-kellys-frankly-shows-the-abc-is-making-only-the-safest-of-safe-choices">Fran Kelly’s Frankly shows the ABC is making only the safest of safe choices</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The veteran journalist, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/02/fran-kelly-bids-a-bittersweet-farewell-to-abcs-radio-national-breakfast-after-17-years">left Radio National Breakfast</a> in December 2021 after 17 years, spoke to Guardian Australia after <a href="https://tvtonight.com.au/2023/05/axed-frankly.html">news broke</a> earlier in the week that Frankly would not be returning.</p> <p>Kelly said the show covered multiple and diverse issues with guests including body image, fat shaming, cyberbullying, climate change, the voice, neurodivergence, racism, LGBTQ issues, courage and resilience – and had “a lot of laughs doing it”.</p> <p>“The team and I delivered a fun, warm and intelligent show that turned a well-worn format into a surprising place on Friday nights with a varied line up,” Kelly said.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed"> </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed">email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>“We built a broadcast audience that stayed for the duration of the season and our social media engagement was very strong.”</p> <p>Comedians Shaun Micallef, Magda Szubanski, Adam Goodes and Wil Anderson, anaesthetist and Thai cave rescuer Richard Harris, and musicians Natalie Imbruglia, Colin Hay and Vika &amp; Linda Bull were among the guests.</p> <p>Kelly had hoped to be back with a second season this year, especially since the show’s numbers built over the eight shows.</p> <p>“They’ve gone up basically every week since week two, and the social media is going gangbusters,” she said last year <a href="https://tvtonight.com.au/2022/11/frankly-it-felt-like-a-big-step-to-take-but-now-i-love-it.html">in an interview.</a></p> <p>“I’m getting nothing but positive feedback.
