<p>Long before the King Cascade’s wall of water comes into view, you can hear its thunder: a bone-rattling roar that fuels anticipation as the captain inches your ship ever closer. Mist beads on your arms, spray hits the air, and the Kimberley is all sound. Closer still you glide, until the bow of the ship noses right under the waterfall and you can step into one of the world’s most epic outdoor showers.</p> <p>It’s one of the highlights of True North’s Kimberley itineraries, known for getting closer to the wilderness: to the waterfalls, billabongs, fishing spots and rock art that make this region so magical. Here are three ways to experience the Kimberley, on itineraries of seven, 10 and 13 nights.</p> <h2>Explore the Kimberley coastline</h2> <p>Over millions of years, the Prince Regent River has muscled its way through Worrorra, Wunambal and Ngarinyin Country, north-east of Broome, forging near-vertical cliffs up to 50 metres high. The river’s tides can be unpredictable but True North’s expert guides know these lands and waterways like the back of their hands, and itineraries are tailored to the weather, rainfall and tidal pulls.</p> <p>This majestic river is a highlight of the<a href="https://truenorth.com.au/itinerary/kimberley-ultimate-cruise/" rel="nofollow"> Kimberley Ultimate</a> cruise, a 13-night adventure that takes in barramundi fishing at dawn and a hunt for the region’s famous black-lip oysters – bounty to be slurped straight from the shell later that same day. You’ll also see some of the oldest paintings in the world, the ancient and graceful Gwion Gwion figures, also known as the Bradshaw rock art.</p>    <p>　</p> <h2>Spot rays and clams along the reef</h2> <p>On the coast-hugging<a href="https://truenorth.com.au/itinerary/kimberley-coast-coral-10-night/" rel="nofollow"> Coast and Coral</a> cruise, explore the Kimberley’s great reefs, teeming with wildlife, over 10 unforgettable nights (with an option to extend the cruise to 13 nights). Watch for the soft puff of a turtle surfacing from the ocean, and swim, snorkel or dive among the vibrant corals, giant clams and darting fish of Clerke Lagoon in the Rowley Shoals Marine Park, 300km west of Broome.</p> <p>Then zoom out to a bird’s-eye view of the region, with a helicopter flight over camouflaged Jackson Falls, before gently coming back to earth with sunset drinks and a beachside view of the aquamarine waters of Prince Frederick Harbour.</p> <h2>Helicopter to a hidden lunch spot</h2> <p>By the time your helicopter lands on a remote outcrop at Eagle Falls, the chefs will already be setting up the gourmet picnic you’ll enjoy for lunch. While they fire up the barbecue and prepare the seafood, you can meander along bush trails to look out over a massive single-drop waterfall before cooling off with a dip in the inland waterhole.</p> <p>Back on board for the seven-night<a href="https://truenorth.com.au/itinerary/kimberley-snapshot-cruise/" rel="nofollow"> Kimberley Snapshot</a> cruise, you’ll weave through the 800-plus islands that make up the Buccaneer Archipelago – eyes peeled for dugongs, turtles and saltwater crocodiles – and go fishing and mudcrabbing in prime spots among the mangroves of the Hunter River.</p> <p>Head up to the deck to watch the rocky cliffs glow ochre and golden as the sun sets, before feasting on the catch of the day, expertly prepared by the on-board chefs.</p> <p><em><strong><a href="https://truenorth.com.au/cruise/kimberley/?utm_source=Guardian&amp;utm_medium=Digital&amp;utm_campaign=KIMBERLEY_Oct25_Guardian_Article1" rel="nofollow">The sun feels different after you see it turn the Kimberley into magic.
