The punctuation, first deployed in 1494, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/may/18/marked-decline-semicolon-use-english-books-study-suggests">seems to be in terminal decline</a>, with its usage in English books plummeting by almost half in two decades – from one appearing in every 205 words in 2000 to one used in every 390 words today.</p> <h2>In numbers</h2>    <p>Transparency and integrity experts have voiced alarm over the increasing rate at which freedom of information requests are being rejected. On Sunday, Guardian Australia revealed FoI refusals are at record rates, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/may/19/australia-news-live-albanese-zelenskyy-europe-pope-coalition-sussan-ley-nuclear-power-net-zero-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-682a8b758f088b79656bba83#block-682a8b758f088b79656bba83">27% of FoI requests rejected</a> outright in the December 2024 quarter. That’s a high not seen since at least 2014-15, data shows.</p> <h2>Before bed read</h2>    <p>Fed up with being inside all day? Missing fresh air and nature?
