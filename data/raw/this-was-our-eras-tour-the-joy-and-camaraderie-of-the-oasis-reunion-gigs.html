<h2>‘There were blokes crying everywhere’</h2> <p>I thought the show was going to be a bit of a money grab. I thought they’d turn their backs, play the songs, and not put too much effort into it. But it was just banger after banger. The pace was incredible. For me, it was pure nostalgia, with my brother and best mate. My brother and I had our own falling out earlier in the year, so there was reconciliation all round. Nature’s healing.</p>    <p>I think my highlight was Noel and Liam bowing to each other as they walked out. But Richard Ashcroft had already started strongly – when he played Bitter Sweet Symphony, tops were already off.</p> <p>Champagne Supernova and Acquiesce were special. There were blokes crying everywhere. This was our Eras tour.</p> <p>I last saw Oasis in the same stadium in 2009 when I was 15, on the last day of my GCSEs, and I thought Liam sounded crap. The roof was open, there wasn’t much of an atmosphere, the sky was grey, and they just sounded off. They needed a break; we all needed a break. You never know what you have until it’s gone. <strong>Lloyd Williams, 31, London (originally Cardiff)</strong></p> <h2>‘I felt seen as a younger generation Oasis fan’</h2> <p>I’ve been an Oasis fan since 2020. I was out of school, and I felt a bit lost, and their music helped me quite a bit going through that tough time during Covid. It made me realise I really do enjoy music.</p> <p>So seeing Noel and Liam finally back together was honestly one of the best experiences of my life. It lived up to everything I ever wanted it to be; an emotional and extremely memorable night. There were older fans, and fans who were younger than me. When Noel dedicated The Masterplan to people in their 20s and thanked them for “keeping the spirit of Oasis alive”, I started crying. I felt seen as a younger generation Oasis fan. I’m extremely grateful that I got to experience the monumental first night – it’ll forever be one of the best days of my life. <strong>Millie Cottrell, 21, Monmouthshire</strong></p> <h2>‘Liam’s voice was back to its best’</h2> <p>It was completely joyful, something I will remember for a long time. Oasis might not have been as talkative on stage as they used to be, but they gave the fans exactly what they wanted – hit after hit, with some of the fan-favourite B-sides.</p> <p>I was lucky enough to see Oasis five times back in their heyday, including Maine Road and Knebworth in 1996, so I have fantastic memories of seeing them at their very best when I was a teenager. But it felt as exciting to see them now. It was the perfect mix of nostalgia and joy at seeing them again. Liam’s voice was back to its best, and Noel – whose songs were always my favourite – belted them out with the crowd singing every word. <strong>Kate, 45, London</strong></p>    <h2>‘The anticipation was palpable’</h2> <p>Seeing Liam and Noel emerge on stage for the very first time in 16 years was always going to be electric. I was lucky enough to be there and the anticipation was palpable all day in Cardiff, with Oasis being blasted from pubs, and hordes of people wearing Oasis T-shirts and bucket hats milling around the city.</p> <p>Right from the opening lyrics of their first song on stage, Hello, it was clear that Liam’s voice was in top shape and the rest of the band ran a tight musical ship. I would say my highlight was Acquiesce. It’s one of the few songs where both Liam and Noel sing in shared verses – seeing them share the same song was pretty amazing. <strong>Muhammed Abdelmoteleb, 48, Newport</strong></p> <h2>‘I went to both nights – it felt like they had never been away’</h2> <p>When they announced Oasis was reuniting and I got pre-sale access, I felt sick with anticipation. I classify myself as a superfan and just had to be at both opening nights. I bought a ticket to the Saturday show in the first round of sales, but friends of mine said: “Well, you’re not really going to the reunion if you don’t go to the first gig.” So I spent a lot of time refreshing, and got lucky last week.</p> <p>It was beyond my wildest expectations. Richard Ashcroft really set the tone for a magical evening with a superb set. I don’t think I’ve ever seen as many people so engaged with a support act. The atmosphere before Oasis felt like the build-up before a massive heavyweight boxing match. When they arrived, it was a beautiful moment. Liam was on fire. The set list has to go down as one of the greatest of all time.</p> <p>I’d seen Oasis seven times before, where there were drinks thrown and a few fights. There was none of that. It seemed like the crowd didn’t want anything to spoil it. It felt like they had never been away. The best two gigs I’ve ever been to. <strong>Nigel Wright, 44, </strong><strong>Tongham, Surrey</strong></p> <h2>‘It was raw emotion’</h2> <p>Being there on the first night, in my country, after a 30-year wait, meant the world to me. I was singing loudly to Acquiesce with a bunch of strangers, never saying a word to each other but all knowing what the other was feeling. Back in the 90s, music was very tribal, but this crowd was full of different people, young and old.</p> <p>The band sounded great. Liam and Noel sang like no time had passed since the 1990s. Friday night took me back to 1996, when it felt like I could tell 13-year-old me that things are going to get dark, but they will get better. I know others will criticise the band for ripping off the Beatles – who hasn’t? – and for the Gallaghers having questionable opinions and means of expressing them in a non-musical setting. But it was raw emotion for me. While the Gallaghers can be right bellends, their music means so much more. They are <em>my</em> bellends, and will always be. <strong>Paul Hunt, 42, </strong><strong>Abercynon, Wales</strong></p>
