<p>A batch of 500,000 mpox vaccines has been bought by <a href="https://www.gavi.org/news/media-room/gavi-signs-agreement-bavarian-nordic-rapidly-secure-500000-doses-mpox-vaccines">the vaccine alliance Gavi,</a> for delivery this year to virus-affected countries in Africa, where until now doses have been scarce.</p> <p>It is estimated that 10 million vaccines are needed to meet demand, but the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which accounts for most cases, only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/sep/06/democratic-republic-congo-drc-donation-mpox-vaccines-outbreak-speading-africa-cdc">received 100,000 vaccines earlier this month</a> despite having had more than <a href="https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/">700 deaths this year and 22,000 cases</a> of the new Clade 1b strain. Neighbouring countries Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya have each reported a handful of cases.</p> <p>“We are committed to working with affected governments and our partners to turn these vaccines into vaccinations as quickly and effectively as possible and, over time, to build a global vaccine stockpile if sufficient funding is secured for Gavi’s work through 2030,” said Gavi’s head, Dr Sania Nishtar.</p> <p>Gavi said it had, for the first time, used the First Response Fund, established in June to quickly buy vaccines in health emergencies, which Nishtar said “takes us a long way towards our goal of protecting those most at risk”.</p> <p>Gavi said it decided to access the First Response Fund to buy the vaccines, on which it will spend up to $50m (£38m), shortly after the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/14/mpox-outbreak-africa-public-health-emergency-declares-who">declared mpox a public health emergency</a> in mid-August.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/20/what-is-mpox">What is mpox and why has it been declared a global health emergency?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/sep/01/mpox-africa-vaccines-fail-to-arrive">Campaigners for fairer access to medical treatment</a> have called for quicker delivery of vaccines and a reduction in the prices set by manufacturers.</p> <p>Reuters reported this month that rich countries such as Japan, the US and Canada have millions of doses of mpox vaccines stockpiled and only a small proportion of them have been pledged to help stop the outbreak in Africa.</p> <p>The UK has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/16/uk-orders-mpox-vaccine-spread-new-strain-africa">ordered 150,000 vaccines</a> for its own preparations against the new strain.</p> <p>Manufacturer Bavarian Nordic praised the deal, saying it would significantly increase the number of vaccines available in Africa. Gavi said it will now work to secure funding to build a stockpile of vaccines.</p> <p><em>The Bill Gates Foundation, which contributes funding towards the independent journalism produced on the global development site, also is among the contributors to the Gavi vaccine alliance.</em></p>
