<p>US and Russian officials agreed to explore the “economic and investment opportunities” that could arise for their countries from an end to the war in Ukraine after talks in Saudi Arabia that amounted to a tectonic shift in Washington’s approach to Moscow.</p> 
<p>The statements from the two sides came amid concerns in Kyiv and across Europe that Donald Trump could push for a peace settlement that favours Vladimir Putin. No Ukrainian or European officials were present at the meeting.</p> 
<p>Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump dismissed Ukrainian concerns about being excluded from the talks and, astonishingly, seemed to imply that Kyiv was to blame for the war.</p> 
<p>He said: “Today I heard, ‘Oh, we weren’t invited’. Well, you’ve been there for three years. You should have ended it three years [ago] – you should have never started it. You could have made a deal.”</p> 
<p>The president complained that he had seen no accounting of how US military aid is being spent and conspicuously avoided voicing support for Zelenskyy.</p> 
<p>“I think I have the power to end this war,” he said.</p> 
<p>After the talks at Diriyah Palace in Riyadh, the most extensive negotiations between the two countries in three years, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said agreement had been made to create a high-level team to support Ukraine peace talks and to explore “opportunities which will emerge from a successful end to the conflict in Ukraine”.</p> 
<p>It marked a dramatic break with the Biden administration’s efforts to isolate Moscow. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and Putin’s chief foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, were photographed sitting across from Rubio, who attended the talks alongside the US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East.</p> 
<p>Rubio said an end to the Ukraine conflict must be acceptable to all involved, including Ukraine, Europe and Russia, and that Washington’s European allies had been consulted. </p> 
<p>Kaja Kallas, the EU foreign policy chief, tweeted a message to Rubio: “Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps. By working together with the US, we can achieve a just and lasting peace – on Ukraine’s terms.”</p> 
<p>The talks in the Saudi capital, however, underscored the rapid pace of US efforts to halt the conflict, raising alarm in Kyiv and across Europe, where officials met on Monday to discuss the possibility of sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine.</p> 
<p>Lavrov rejected the prospect of such a move on Tuesday. He said the deployment of Nato member troops in Ukraine, even if they were operating under a different flag, was unacceptable to Moscow. Russia has repeatedly rejected the idea of western boots in Ukraine.</p>

<p>“We explained to our colleagues today what President Putin has repeatedly stressed: that the expansion of Nato, the absorption of Ukraine by the North Atlantic alliance, is a direct threat to the interests of the Russian Federation, a direct threat to our sovereignty,” Lavrov said.</p> 
<p>He also rejected a US proposal that Russia and Ukraine halt strikes on each other’s energy infrastructure, falsely claiming that Russia had never endangered Ukraine’s civilian energy supply system.</p> 
<p>Shortly after the meeting, Ushakov said the talks had gone well, with both sides agreeing that negotiators would discuss Ukraine. He said a potential Putin-Trump summit had been discussed, but that it was unlikely to happen next week.</p> 
<p>Ukrainian officials were not invited to the talks. During a visit to Ankara, where he held talks with Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not accept the results of talks on how to end the war with Russia that were held “behind Ukraine’s back”.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian president told reporters no decision could be made without Kyiv on how to end the war, and that he would always reject Putin’s “ultimatums”.</p> 
<p>The discussions in Riyadh mark the first high-level attempt to negotiate an end to Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since the war’s early days, when talks collapsed over the Russian president’s demands.</p> 
<p>Despite the flurry of diplomacy, little is known about Trump’s peace plan for Ukraine or Russia’s willingness to engage, and Tuesday’s meeting offered few new clues.</p> 
<p>Both sides issued carefully worded statements when the talks concluded. Rubio said the meeting was “the first step of a long and difficult journey”, adding: “An end to the Ukraine conflict must be acceptable to all involved, including Ukraine, Europe and Russia.”</p> 
<p>Waltz said: “This needs to be a permanent end to the war and not a temporary end as we’ve seen in the past.</p> 
<p>“The practical reality is that there’s going to be some discussion of territory and there’s going to be discussion of security guarantees, those are just fundamental basics,” he added.</p> 
<p>Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said the two sides had started listening to each other but it was too early to talk about compromises.</p> 
<p>Before the talks, Russian officials had said they would pursue “normalisation” with the US and lay the groundwork for a peace deal in Ukraine. But even before the meeting began, the US made several significant concessions to Putin, indicating that Ukraine would have to abandon its Nato ambitions and accept territorial losses.</p> 
<p>Putin has not commented publicly on the Saudi talks but told Trump last week during a phone call that Russia wanted to “settle the reasons for the conflict”. Some observers believe this suggests Russia may not limit its focus to Ukraine and may instead seek to reshape European security more broadly.</p> 
<p>Moscow’s demands could resemble those it issued on the eve of its full-scale invasion in 2022: that Ukraine adopt a neutral status and that Nato halts the deployment of weapons to member states that joined after 1997, when the alliance began expanding to include former communist nations. This would affect much of eastern Europe including Poland and the Baltic states – Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.</p> 
<p>After the talks, Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, issued what appeared to be new conditions for peace, saying Russia was demanding “not just a pledge to deny Ukraine Nato membership but the annulment of the 2008 Bucharest summit declaration which promised Kyiv eventual membership without a specific timeline”.</p> 
<p>Putin has previously insisted that Ukraine drastically reduce its military forces, which many in Ukraine fear would leave it vulnerable to future Russian attacks.</p> 
<p>In Riyadh, Russia was also expected to leverage discussions on a potential Ukraine settlement to push for relief from western sanctions, which have placed significant strain on its economy.</p>

<p>Leading Moscow’s economic negotiations is Dmitriev, the 49-year-old head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and a close friend of Putin’s daughter. A former investment banker, Dmitriev has played a key role in Russia’s outreach to international investors.</p> 
<p>“US oil majors have done very well in Russia,” Dmitriev said in a brief interview on Tuesday before the talks began, suggesting that American companies could come back to Russia. “We believe that at some point they will return – why would they pass up the opportunities Russia has provided for access to its natural resources?”</p> 
<p>Tuesday’s talks in Riyadh offered Saudi Arabia and its de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, an opportunity to assert themselves on the world stage.</p> 
<p>Once labelled a pariah by Biden over the 2018 killing of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi leader has emerged as a key intermediary in discussions between Russia and the US.</p> 
<p>The latest US diplomatic push has left Kyiv and key allies scrambling to secure a seat at the table, fearing Washington and Moscow could move forward with a deal that sidelined their interests. In response, France convened an emergency meeting of EU nations and the UK on Monday to coordinate a response.</p> 
<p>Emmanuel Macron announced after the meeting that he had spoken to Trump and Zelenskyy. “We seek a strong and lasting peace in Ukraine. To achieve this, Russia must end its aggression, and this must be accompanied by strong and credible security guarantees for the Ukrainians,” Macron wrote on X.</p> 
<p>Still, the security talks in Paris yielded no concrete measures, as European leaders struggled to present a united front amid divisions over the deployment of troops to Ukraine.</p>
