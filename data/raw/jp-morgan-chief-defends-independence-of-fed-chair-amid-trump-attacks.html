<p>The boss of JP Morgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, has defended the “absolutely critical” independence of the Federal Reserve chair, as Donald Trump continues to demand immediate cuts in interest rates.</p> <p>The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Tuesday that a formal process for choosing a successor to the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, had already begun – despite the fact that his term does not end until next May.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly criticised Powell, calling him “very dumb” and a “major loser”, and urging him to slash interest rates. The president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/07/trump-federal-reserve-jerome-powell">posted a handwritten note to Powell on social media last week</a>, saying: “You have cost the USA a fortune and continue to do so. You should lower the rate – by a lot!”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/07/trump-federal-reserve-jerome-powell">Trump takes on the Fed – but he has little power over central bank, economists say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Powell has said in turn that rate cuts have been delayed by Trump’s tariff policies, which many policymakers fear will boost inflation. Data for June, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/15/us-inflation-june-trump-tariffs">published on Tuesday</a>, showed the annual rate of inflation rising to 2.7%, from 2.4% a month earlier.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters as JP Morgan reported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, Dimon cautioned against interfering with the workings of the US central bank.</p> <p>“The independence of the Fed is absolutely critical – and not just for the current Fed chair, whom I respect, Jay Powell, but for the next Fed chair,” he said. “Playing around with the Fed can often have adverse consequences, the absolute opposite of what you might be hoping for.”</p> <p>Dimon’s remarks came as Bessent told Bloomberg TV that the White House would press ahead with choosing a replacement for Powell. “There are a lot of great candidates. And we’ll see how rapidly it progresses. It’s President Trump’s decision and it will move at his speed,” he said.</p> <p>Powell was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/federal-reserve-chair-blames-trump-tariffs-for-preventing-interest-rates-cut">given a round of applause by fellow central bankers</a> at a European Central Bank conference earlier this month in Sintra, Portugal, when he was asked about the president’s attacks.</p> <p>White House insiders have sent conflicting signals about Powell’s future. Bessent suggested Trump would not sack the Fed chair.</p> <p>“President Trump’s said numerous times he is not going to fire Jay Powell,” the treasury secretary said, adding: “I think an independent central bank is very important for the conduct of monetary policy.”</p> <p>But Kevin Hassett, director of Trump’s national economic council, said over the weekend that removing Powell was “being looked into”. Hassett is regarded as a potential contender for the role himself.</p> <p>Fed independence is seen as crucial to maintaining investors’ confidence, with policymakers deemed more likely to be able to bring inflation under control without political interference.</p> <p>Trump’s earlier attacks on Powell were seen as one factor behind the bond market selloff on Wall Street in April that led to the 90-day “pause” on tariffs – a deadline that has since been extended from 9 July to 1 August.</p>
