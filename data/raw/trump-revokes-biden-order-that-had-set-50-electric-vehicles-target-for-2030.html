<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> took aim at<strong> </strong>federal support for the sale of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/electric-cars">electric vehicles</a> (EVs) on Monday, amid a flurry of promised <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/tump-executive-orders-list">executive orders</a> on his first day back in the White House.</p> <p>“The United States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with impunity,” Trump said during a ceremony at Capitol One Arena, where he signed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-orders">raft of executive orders</a> before a roaring crowd.</p> <p>One of those orders <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/initial-rescissions-of-harmful-executive-orders-and-actions/">revokes 78 Biden-era actions</a>, including a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/biden-electric-vehicles-goal-2030-climate-crisis">2021 executive order</a> aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric.</p> <p>That target was not binding. It also won support from top automakers.</p> <p>“These clean car rollbacks will burden Americans with a Trumpfecta of higher prices, more pollution and weaker competitiveness,” said Dan Becker, director of the safe climate transport campaign at the environmental non-profit Center for Biological Diversity. “Our kids and everyone with lungs will pay the price for these politically motivated rollbacks of protections for our air and the climate.”</p> <p>Trump’s order is part of a promised push to repeal environmental protections introduced by Biden and to support US makers of gas-powered cars. He has also promised to roll back auto pollution standards finalized by Biden’s administration last spring – a rule Trump calls an “EV mandate”, though it did not directly require the production of electric vehicles.</p> <p><strong>Read more of the Guardian’s Trump coverage</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/president-trump-speech-inauguration">Trump embraces role of demagogue</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-vows-to-take-back-panama-canal-in-us-foreign-policy-vision">claims to be ‘peacemaker’</a> – follow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/20/president-trump-inauguration-swearing-in-timing-schedule-live-updates">inauguration updates</a> as it happened</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-inaugural-address-factcheck">Factchecking Trump’s speech</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/20/trump-elon-musk-salute">Elon Musk</a> appears to make back-to-back fascist salutes</p></li> <li><p>Activists ask: is there any point in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-activists-mass-protest">mass protest</a>?</p></li> </ul>
