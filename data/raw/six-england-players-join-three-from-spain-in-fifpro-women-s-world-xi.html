<p>Six England players have been named in the Fifpro women’s World XI after the team <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/27/chloe-kelly-winning-penalty-england-beat-spain-win-euro-2025">won the European Championship</a> this year. The captain, Leah Williamson, the goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, the defender Lucy Bronze and forwards Chloe Kelly and Alessia Russo make the list after aiding the team to the historic win against Spain.</p> <p>Millie Bright, the sixth England star to make the list, was not part of the tournament <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/oct/13/millie-bright-announces-england-retirement">and has since retired</a>. The centre-back captained Chelsea to the domestic treble last season but hung up her international boots last month.</p>    <p>Bronze, Bright’s teammate at club level, has made the World XI for a record eighth time. The 34-year-old overtook the France legend Wendie Renard, who made the list seven times. Bronze not only helped England win the European Championship in the summer but did so <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/27/lucy-bronze-fractured-tibia-euro-2025-england-win-reaction">with a broken leg</a>.</p> <p>For the first time, the women’s World XI features two African players. Zambia’s Barbra Banda and Morocco’s Ghizlane Chebbak feature, alongside the Spanish stars Ona Batlle, Aitana Bonmatí and Alexia Putellas, who round off the list.</p> <p>The World XI was voted for by more than 6,000 players from across the globe. They were able to vote for any player who had made 20 official appearances for club and country from 11 August 2024 to 3 August 2025.</p> <p>The men’s XI includes two England internationals, Jude Bellingham and Cole Palmer. The Manchester City goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who played for Paris Saint-Germain and Italy during the specified period, received more votes than any other player, with Lamine Yamal second.</p> <p><strong>Men’s XI</strong> (3-4-3): Gianluigi Donnarumma; Virgil van Dijk, Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes; Jude Bellingham, Cole Palmer, Pedri, Vitinha; Ousmane Dembélé, Kylian Mbappé, Lamine Yamal.</p>
