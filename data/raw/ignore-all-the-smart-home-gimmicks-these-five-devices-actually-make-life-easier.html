<p>I have tested hundreds of smart devices over the years, but only a select few have earned a permanent spot in my home. Too many seem to offer overcomplicated solutions for problems that barely existed in the first place – making them little more than a gimmick you toss in your closet weeks after purchase.</p> <p>However, while many smart home gadgets aren’t the wisest investment, others can bring serious improvements to your home. From robot vacuums and smart bulbs to smart locks and video doorbells, here are five smart home devices that have made my life easier, and why you should consider adding them to your home, too.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Smart home devices at a glance</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>For automating all of your floor-cleaning chores:</strong><br>Roborock Saros 10<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Saros-10-Avoidance-Intelligent/dp/B0DLH247PS"><sub>$1,599.99 at Amazon</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>For mimicking the sunrise for an easy morning:</strong><br>Wyze Smart Bulb<br><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Wyze-75-Watt-Equivalent-A19-Color-Changing-Wi-Fi-LED-Smart-Light-Bulb-with-16-Million-Colors-RGB-and-App-Control-2-Pack-WLPA19C2PK/316761195"><sub>$26.26 at Home Depot</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>For ensuring your never lose a key again:</strong><br>Yale Assure Lock 2<br><a href="https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2"><sub>$259.99 at Yale</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>For keeping your front door secure:</strong><br>Ring Video Doorbell<br><a href="https://ring.com/video-doorbell-cameras?"><sub>$49.99 at Ring</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>For maintaining a fresh-smelling home all day long:</strong><br>Aera Smart Diffuser<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fragrance-Electric-Diffuser-Controlled-Separately/dp/B08SHHWGYY"><sub>$199 at Amazon</sub></a></p></li> </ul> <p><em>All prices current at time of publication.</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Roborock Saros 10 robot vacuum</h2> <p><a href="https://us.roborock.com/pages/roborock-saros-10"><sub>$1,599.99 at Roborock</sub></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Saros-10-Avoidance-Intelligent/dp/B0DLH247PS"><sub>$1,599.99 at Amazon</sub></a></p>    <p>The Roborock Saros 10 has virtually removed all floor-cleaning tasks from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/nov/30/the-experts-cleaners-on-20-easy-ways-to-do-your-most-hated-household-chores">my chore list</a>. It not only vacuums and mops, it empties its own dustbin and self-cleans its mops after, so it can go weeks without any manual intervention. Tangle-free brushes, vibrating hot-water mops, and best-in-class suction ensure your floors are as clean as if you handled them yourself.</p> <p>Setting it up requires little more than plugging it in and syncing it to your phone. You’ll then let it roam around your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/homes">home</a> to map your floor plan, before letting it loose to vacuum and mop simultaneously (when traveling on carpet, it can either leave its mopping pads in the dock or automatically retract them).</p> <p>The only manual tasks you need to complete are filling up its clean water tank, emptying the dirty water tank, and replacing the huge dock dustbin that the bot’s bin empties into. Depending on the size of your home (and how dirty it is), you will typically deal with the water tanks on a weekly basis, while the dustbin can go months before needing a replacement.</p> <p>While it’s the most expensive item on this list, for anyone with a busy schedule, it is worth every penny.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Wyze smart colored bulb</h2> <p><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Wyze-75-Watt-Equivalent-A19-Color-Changing-Wi-Fi-LED-Smart-Light-Bulb-with-16-Million-Colors-RGB-and-App-Control-2-Pack-WLPA19C2PK/316761195"><sub>$26.26 at Home Depot</sub></a><br></p>    <p>Smart bulbs offer an affordable way to dip your toes into the world of automation. The <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Wyze-75-Watt-Equivalent-A19-Color-Changing-Wi-Fi-LED-Smart-Light-Bulb-with-16-Million-Colors-RGB-and-App-Control-2-Pack-WLPA19C2PK/316761195">Wyze Bulb Color</a> is one of the best, thanks to a competitive price, reliable performance and support for millions of tunable colors.</p> <p>I use it to simulate the sunrise each morning, allowing the light to automatically turn on at a low level when it’s almost time to wake up, then slowly increase its brightness until it is glowing a brilliant white when my alarm rings.</p> <p>When I’m ready to go to sleep, I can turn off the lights from my phone so I don’t have to trek across a dark bedroom and risk tripping over an errant dog toy. My home theater is equipped with a Wyze bulb, too – which lets me dim the lights for a cozy movie night or turn them a spooky red for a horror flick.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Yale Assure smart lock</h2> <p><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Yale-Assure-Lock-2-Smart-Door-Lock-with-Wi-Fi-and-Pushbutton-Keypad-Black-Suede-YRD410-WF1-BSP/330842273"><sub>$203 at Home Depot</sub></a><br><a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0CBN9Z74M"><sub>$239 at Amazon</sub></a></p>    <p>You might think <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/sep/13/you-be-the-judge-my-housemate-always-loses-our-keys-should-he-pay-for-a-smart-lock">smart locks</a> are a gimmick, but after years of using one, I’m a faithful convert. My Yale Assure Lock 2 lets me come and go without a physical key – so when I go out for a run, I don’t need to worry about lugging one with me. Instead, I simply enter a passcode into the Assure Lock 2 keypad. You can also create temporary codes for visitors that expire once their stay is complete (ensuring your primary code remains secret).</p> <p>I used to forget whether I locked the door before heading out, but now I just check the status of my door remotely on the companion app. Not only can it tell me if my door is open or closed, but it will tell me if it’s locked or unlocked. There’s a door history section as well, so you can see exactly when the door was opened or closed, locked or unlocked.</p> <p>Several variants of the Yale Assure Lock 2 are available (including key-free models and one that supports Apple Wallet keys), making it easy to find one that fits your lifestyle. Make sure to spring for wifi if you want to be able to control it away from home.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Ring Video Doorbell</h2> <p><a href="https://ring.com/products/video-doorbell-wired"><sub>$49.99 at Ring</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://www.homedepot.com/pep/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Wired-Smart-WiFi-Doorbell-with-HD-Video-Motion-Detection-Night-Vision-and-2-Way-Talk-B08CKHPP52/315741165"><sub>$49.99 at Home Depot</sub></a></p>    <p>Everybody on the block seems to have a Ring video doorbell – and for good reason. They are remarkably helpful in ways you may not realize until you own one. Away from home and need to keep an eye on a package that was delivered? Have a guest show up while you’re walking the dog and need to talk to them? Trying to capture funny videos to go viral online? Ring doorbells can do it all.</p> <p>I personally use an older model (Wired Doorbell Plus) that has treated me well for four years, and newer models including the Wired Doorbell Pro seem even more impressive. All of them send motion alerts to your smartphone when movement is detected, let you know when your doorbell rings, and let you chat with visitors through a two-way speaker without having to open the door.</p> <p>The entry-level <a href="https://ring.com/products/video-doorbell-wired">Video Doorbell Wired</a> is sufficient for most needs if you have existing doorbell wiring for power, but the <a href="https://ring.com/products/battery-doorbell-pro">Battery Doorbell Pro</a> and <a href="https://ring.com/products/video-doorbell-pro-2">Wired Doorbell Pro</a> add wireless convenience and enhanced video quality, respectively.</p> <p>If the $5 monthly subscription for video storage puts you off, you could also consider a Eufy video doorbell such as the <a href="https://www.eufy.com/products/e8222113?variant=37765877465274">C210</a>. These models store video locally on a <a href="https://www.eufy.com/products/t80301d1?ref=navimenu_1_1_6_1_img&amp;variant=41846278357178">separate box</a>, eliminating the need for a subscription.</p> <p>Just be careful not to succumb to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/may/01/stranger-danger-video-doorbell-derangement-syndrome">video doorbell derangement syndrome</a> with your newfound powers.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Aera smart diffuser</h2> <p><a href="https://www.aeraforhome.com/products/aera-diffuser"><sub>$199 at Aera</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B08SHHWGYY"><sub>$199 at Amazon</sub></a></p>    <p>The Aera smart diffuser solves a very real problem – a smelly home. If you live in a cozy space like I do, where your kitchen, gym, bathroom and main living space are all in close proximity, you know the struggle.</p> <p>Unlike candles, which need to be closely monitored, constantly replaced, and often degrade indoor air quality, the Aera is hypoallergenic and largely runs itself. After slotting a fragrance capsule into the diffuser, you can create schedules that run the device automatically, ensuring your home smells great all day long. You can even toggle it remotely, so if you’re coming back from a road trip, you will return to a pleasant aroma.</p> <p>The upfront costs are a bit expensive (the diffuser is $199), but a $60 fragrance capsule can easily last for three months, so over time, it’s not much more expensive than buying premium candles. And because it solves a frustrating problem without much manual input, it is one of my favorite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/smart-homes">smart home</a> devices.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jon Bitner is a writer covering travel, outdoors and technology for outlets including GameSpot, Digital Trends and Islands.
