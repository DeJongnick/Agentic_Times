<p>A massive Russian drone and missile attack has hit gas facilities in eastern Ukraine as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, flew to Washington for a meeting with Donald Trump to discuss the US providing Kyiv with long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles.</p> <p>Russia launched hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles, as well as glide bombs early on Thursday, sparking outages in eight regions in another large-scale bombardment targeting Ukraine’s energy network.</p> <p>“Russia launched more than 300 attack drones and 37 missiles, a significant number of them ballistic, against Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said on X. “This autumn, the Russians use every single day to strike at our energy infrastructure.”</p> <p>Zelenskyy said strikes had hit the regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Poltava, Sumy and Vinnytsia.</p> <p>One of the facilities hit was the Shebelinka gas processing plant in Kharkiv region, where large columns of black smoke and fiercely burning fires could be seen in the aftermath of the attack.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F10%2F16%2FLOOP_UKRAINE_GAS_PLANT_.00_00_00_00.Still001.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F10%2F16%2FLOOP_UKRAINE_GAS_PLANT.mp4" data-alt="Looping video of blaze at a Ukrainian gas facility after a Russian attack"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F10%2F16%2FLOOP_UKRAINE_GAS_PLANT_.00_00_00_00.Still001.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F10%2F16%2FLOOP_UKRAINE_GAS_PLANT.mp4">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Staff at the plant told the Guardian that it had been hit just after 5.30am by drones and missiles, setting off at least two blazes in different parts of the facility.</p> <p>Since invading Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has attacked Ukrainian power infrastructure each winter, forcing Kyiv to impose emergency blackouts and import energy from abroad.</p> <p>Commenting on the strikes, the Russian defence ministry claimed it had hit facilities used by the Ukrainian military with Kinzhal missiles “in response” to attacks on Russian infrastructure, an apparent reference to strikes on refineries in Russia.</p> <p>Sergii Koretskyi, the chief executive of the Ukrainian gas company Naftogaz, said: “There are hits and destruction in several regions at once. The operation of a number of critically important facilities has been halted.”</p> <p>Ukraine’s state grid operator, Ukrenergo, introduced emergency power cuts in every region of the country after the attacks, it said in a statement on Thursday.</p> <p>Ukraine’s air force said the Russian barrage comprised 320 drones and 37 missiles, adding that 283 drones and five missiles were downed.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/10/ukraine_tomahawk_missiles/giv-325540XuExNKHyb6p" data-alt="Map showing range of Tomahawk missiles from Ukraine to Russia"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/10/ukraine_tomahawk_missiles/giv-325540XuExNKHyb6p">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>It said the attacks mainly targeted the Kharkiv region in the north, and the eastern Poltava region, where the country’s largest private energy provider DTEK said a gas production facility was shut down.</p> <p>Media reports earlier suggested about 60% of Ukrainian gas production had been halted in recent Russian strikes, and attacks on power stations had cut electricity supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine.</p> <p>The latest strikes came as the Ukrainian military said North Korean troops based in Russia were operating drones across the border on reconnaissance missions – the first time Kyiv has reported a battlefield role for North Koreans in months.</p> <p>Thousands of North Korean troops fought last year alongside Russian forces in Russia’s Kursk region as Ukrainian troops mounted their biggest incursion into enemy territory since the war began.</p> <p>Ukraine later said the North Koreans were withdrawn after suffering heavy casualties. Ukrainian troops were pushed out of Kursk in March this year and have not reported engaging North Koreans on the battlefield since.</p> <p>Zelenskyy is expected in Washington on Friday for talks with Trump, after two phone calls between the two leaders over the weekend. Their relationship has warmed since February, when they sparred during an infamous televised meeting at the White House.</p> <p>Trump has since grown more hostile towards Moscow, showing mounting frustration with Vladimir Putin, while expressing sympathy for Ukraine.</p> <p>Senior Ukrainian officials visiting the Washington this week met representatives of US weapon manufacturers including Raytheon, which produces Tomahawk missiles.</p> <p>Zelenskyy will also meet arms makers to discuss when deliveries to Kyiv could begin, a source told Agence France-Presse. “But they need a political signal,” the source added.</p> <p>Russia has warned that sending Tomahawks to Ukraine – which would put Moscow and other large Russian cities within range of missile fire – would rupture its ties with Washington and cause further escalation.</p> <p>The source declined to disclose how many of the long-range missiles Trump is considering sending to Ukraine, saying only the arsenal would be “enough for Putin to feel it”.</p> <p><em>Agence France-Presse contributed to this story</em></p>
