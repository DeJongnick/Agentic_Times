<p>US treasury secretary Scott Bessent has said the Federal Reserve is and should be independent but that it had “made a lot of mistakes”, as he defended Donald Trump’s right to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/trump-federal-reserve-lisa-cook-explained">fire the central bank governor Lisa Cook</a>.</p> <p>The president has criticised the Fed and its chair, Jerome Powell, for months for not lowering interest rates. Independent central banks are widely seen as crucial to a stable global financial system. Bessent also rejected the idea that markets were disturbed by the Trump administration’s actions. “S&amp;P’s at a new high and bond yields are fine, so we haven’t seen anything yet,” he said.</p> <p>Bessent’s comments come as Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), said Trump undermining the independence of the world’s most powerful central bank could pose a “very serious danger” for the world economy.</p>  <h2>Trump’s war on Fed is ‘serious danger’ to world economy, says ECB head</h2>  <p>Lagarde, who was France’s finance minister until 2011 before leaving to run the International Monetary Fund, said it would be “very difficult” for Trump to take control of Fed decision-making on interest rates, but such a scenario would be highly dangerous.</p> <p>“If US monetary policy were no longer independent and instead dependent on the dictates of this or that person, then I believe that the effect on the balance of the American economy could – as a result of the effects this would have around the world – be very worrying, because it is the largest economy in the world,” she said, according to remarks reported by Reuters.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/01/trump-us-fed-ecb-christine-lagarde"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Guatemala says it is willing to receive hundreds of deported children from US</h2>  <p>Guatemala is ready and willing to receive about 150 unaccompanied children of all ages each week from the US, the country’s president has said, a day after a US federal judge halted the deportation of 10 Guatemalan children.</p> <p>Those children had already boarded a plane when a court responded to an emergency appeal on Sunday. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/judge-blocks-deportation-guatemalan-children">They were later returned to the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement</a>.</p> <p>On Monday, Guatemala’s president, Bernardo Arévalo, told journalists that his government had been coordinating with the US to receive the unaccompanied minors.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/01/guatemala-to-receive-deported-children-from-us"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Former CDC leaders slam RFK Jr for endangering Americans’ health</h2>  <p>Nine former officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said that Robert F Kennedy Jr’s leadership of the US health and human services department is “unlike anything our country has ever experienced” and “unacceptable”.
