<p>Sir Jim Ratcliffe cited email traffic statistics to Manchester United staff as the basis for a ban on working from home and told them to seek ­“alternative employment” if they are not ­willing to come to club premises.</p> <p>United have had a flexible work-from-home policy since Covid but Ratcliffe signalled an end to this ­during an all-staff meeting held in person and via video call last week as part of his tour of Old Trafford and the Carrington training base.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/07/erik-ten-hags-exit-may-be-inevitable-but-when-will-the-united-cycle-stop">Erik ten Hag’s exit may be near but when will the Manchester United cycle stop? | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He informed the club’s ­approximately 1,000 ­employees that&nbsp;email traffic dropped by 20% when one of his companies ­experimented with work-from-home Fridays, which he cited as the reason for his diktat.</p> <p>Ratcliffe believes having all staff on site will allow greater productivity and strengthen unity and collaboration. To emphasise his message United’s ­minority owner, who uses these ­methods at Ineos, told the ­meeting: “If you don’t like it, please seek ­alternative employment.”</p> <p>The news was met with bemusement by some staff, who view as shortsighted Ratcliffe’s ­explanation for changing their ­working practices. It has also become a humorous topic because there is not enough space in Manchester and at the club’s London premises to accommodate all staff owing to some being used for ­hospitality and other activities.</p> <p>A working group has been set up to implement Ratcliffe’s policy. Other challenges to be addressed include dealing with employees who live far from Manchester and London and the fact that some staff are on ­flexible contracts and do not have to work from club offices under their terms.</p>    <p>When Ratcliffe’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/24/sir-jim-ratcliffe-manchester-united-stake-announced#:~:text=He%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CAs%20a%20local,football%20operations%20of%20the%20club.">buy-in at United was agreed</a> the club said Ineos had been “delegated responsibility for management of football operations” but this is the latest indication his influence stretches further.
