Thank you so much for reading. My favourite song won, so I am happy. Was it a vintage year? Maybe not. Were there some surprises? Yes. Switzerland getting nothing from the public vote when it had done so well with the jury was astonishing. And the UK may have not won over the public, but at least they got a good haul from the jury. Nobody got <em>nul points</em>. And we will always have this moment …</p>    <p>Thank you for all your comments, and especially the lovely and kind messages I have had by email. I WILL HOPEFULLY SEE YOU SAME TIME, SAME PLACE, NEXT YEAR! Well done JJ. 🇦🇹🥳</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68291adb8f0812fb9704242a" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-17T23:26:33.086Z">12.26am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here are some more pictures of Austria’s JJ, who has just won the 69th Eurovision song contest.

The man and the woman were taken out of the venue and handed over to the police.”</p> </blockquote> <p>There have also been protests over Israel’s participation in the city centre of Basel.

They won’t want to be seen not awarding points to something that is proving to be a hit with the public.”</p> <p>But, Ewan explained, the bigger impact is possibly on where songs ended up in the running order and how that order affects chances in the public vote – something Eurovision fans obsess over. He told me:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is a producer led running order nowadays, so as not to put similar songs together. But it also allows you to stack the decks, so the ones that people are waiting for are going to be further down the order.</p> <p>Songs that are doing well on YouTube, Spotify, Instagram and so on, they are more likely to be considered for those sweet spots in the running order.</p> <p>It’s a small advantage, it’s a technical advantage, and it might not be picked up on, but yes, those numbers are going to influence decisions.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6828e8198f088b79656bb080" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-17T19:48:50.354Z">8.48pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>I love these blackout/mute drops at the end of this song.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6828e7678f088b79656bb07d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-17T19:46:44.077Z">8.46pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>If you check out singer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shpak_d_/?hl=en">Daniil Leshchynskyi’s Instagram</a>, he always somehow looks like he is starring in a 1970s episode of Doctor Who as the doomed leader of a future Earth colony in space about to get invaded by Daleks.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-6828647f8f088b79656bad44" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-17T19:45:23.834Z">8.45pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">7: 🇺🇦 Ukraine – Ziferblat with 'Bird of Pray'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>This three-piece band coming up were once mentored by Verka Serduchka on Ukraine’s X-Factor, but I can’t really see that much of that Verka glam has rubbed off on them, and it was maybe slightly a surprise they qualified, as they hadn’t done well in the snap polling of fans after their dress rehearsal.

Every time it comes up to the payoff lyric, it slams the anchors on, and brings the tempo right back to zero. Then it has to build it up again.</p> <p>So the song feels like it stops four times, and it feels like it’s stopping right at the point where you’re about to sell it, finally, to the audience.

Boooooooo!</p> <p>I’m in London, and I will be watching Eurovision on the television while hosting a small family watch party. I will also desperately be trying not to make the same jokes as Graham Norton on the BBC’s coverage.</p> <p>With me are my younger sister, who is a huge Eurovision fan, but also a massive spoilerphobe, so she has heard NONE of this year’s songs yet, so I am looking forward to seeing her reactions. Her son, who studies performing arts, is here too, as are my two kids, who are 12 and 15 and have been shamelessly indoctrinated into all things Eurovision since birth. I’ve printed out our own bingo and scorecards already.</p>    <p>But the most important component is YOU, the reader. I hope to add a little extra sparkle to your evening, and do feel free to email me your thoughts to <a href="mailto:martin.belam@theguardian.com">martin.belam@theguardian.com</a> as we go along, and I might feature some of them in the blog.

Probably not if you are already reading my live blog. But here is the lowdown on how the voting works tonight.</strong></p> <p>Every competing country in the contest – that is all 37 who initially entered, not just those appearing in the final – have both a jury awarding votes, and a public telephone vote. There is also an additional “rest of the world” aggregated telephone vote.</p> <p>Once voting closes, each country reveals who has received a maximum 12 points from their country’s jury. Points are awarded as follows: 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.</p> <p>This is the bit where we go from country to country and everybody says “Great show, Basel, you really blew our minds” and then <em>takes far too long to deliver the actual score</em>, causing the show to inevitably run behind schedule.</p> <p>After that procedure, we then get the public vote added to each song one by one, starting with the song placed last by the juries. That usually builds up to a tight climax where three or four songs leapfrog into the lead and then there is some suspense … and then Sweden almost certainly wins (probably).</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WK3HOMhAeQY"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WK3HOMhAeQY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>KAJ with strong favourite Bara Bada Bastu</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   </div> <div id="block-682311f48f0824efe73e3563" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-17T17:30:11.747Z">6.30pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Salut!
