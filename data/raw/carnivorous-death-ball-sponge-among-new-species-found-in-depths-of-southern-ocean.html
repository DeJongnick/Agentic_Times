<p>A carnivorous “death ball” sponge is among 30 previously unknown deep-sea species found by scientists in one of the most remote parts of the planet.</p> <p>Researchers sampled the depths of the Southern Ocean, including volcanic calderas, the South Sandwich trench and seafloor habitats around Montagu and Saunders islands.</p> <p>As well as the sponge, the scientists found new armoured and iridescent scale worms, previously unknown species of sea star, new crustaceans including isopods and amphipods, and rare gastropods and bivalves.</p>    <p>Experts are also assessing additional possible new species, among them black corals, and a potential new sea pen genus.</p> <p>“The Southern Ocean remains profoundly undersampled,” said Dr Michelle Taylor, head of science at the Nippon Foundation-Nekton Ocean Census, which carried out the expedition. “To date, we have only assessed under 30% of the samples collected from this expedition, so confirming 30 new species already shows how much biodiversity is still undocumented.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/oct/12/without-the-southern-ocean-we-cannot-survive-on-earth-our-research-must-wait-no-longer">Without the Southern Ocean we cannot survive on Earth.
