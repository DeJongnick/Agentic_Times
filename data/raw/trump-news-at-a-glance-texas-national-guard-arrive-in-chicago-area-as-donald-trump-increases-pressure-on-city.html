<p>Texas national guard troops have arrived in the Chicago area, marking an escalation of Donald Trump’s crackdown on the city.</p> <p>Chicago has already seen a ramping up of immigration enforcement in the past few weeks, as well as increasingly violent altercations in the suburb of Broadview, where law enforcement has been filmed deploying teargas and pepper gas against protesters.</p> <p>The latest military presence comes after April Perry, a US district judge, declined to immediately block troops from entering the city amid a pending lawsuit from the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago against the Trump administration’s actions.</p>  <h2>Texas national guard troops arrive in Chicago amid Trump’s crackdown</h2>  <p>Kwame Raoul, the Illinois attorney general, had filed the lawsuit on Monday in order to stop Trump from enlisting the state’s national guard or sending in troops from other states such as Texas “immediately and permanently”.</p> <p>But after Perry’s ruling, the troops were mobilized on Monday, and multiple outlets, including the Chicago Tribune and New York Times confirmed they were remaining in the Chicago area on Tuesday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/07/texas-national-guard-troops-chicago-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US supreme court appears poised to overturn Colorado ban on ‘conversion therapy’</h2>  <p>The US supreme court appeared ready to rule against a Colorado law that bans “conversion therapy” practices that seek to change minors’ sexual orientation or gender identity, repeatedly questioning the state over whether the law hindered free speech and whether these practices have been proven harmful.</p> <p>The high-stakes case could roll back the rights of LGBTQ+ youth across the country. Colorado is one of more than 20 states in the US that have banned conversion practices, and a ruling in favor of the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a Christian legal group, could make those laws vulnerable to similar challenges.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/07/conversion-therapy-ban-supreme-court-adf"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>White House says furloughed federal workers not entitled to back pay amid shutdown</h2>  <p>The White House’s office of management and budget (OMB) is arguing that federal workers who are furloughed amid the ongoing government shutdown are not entitled to back pay.</p> <p>In a draft memo first obtained by Axios, OMB argued that an amendment to the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) of 2019 would not guarantee furloughed workers back pay and that said funds must be set aside by Congress.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/07/government-shutdown-federal-workers-pay"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Pam Bondi and Senate Democrats spar amid Trump’s troop deployments</h2>  <p>Democratic senators sparred with attorney general Pam Bondi over her handling of the Epstein files and Donald Trump’s nationwide deployments of national guard at a bitterly partisan Senate hearing on Tuesday.</p> <p>Bondi’s appearance before the Senate judiciary committee was her first since being confirmed in February, and comes as the president steps up his crackdown on political opponents and Democratic-run cities nationwide.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/07/pam-bondi-testimony-senate-trump-troop-deployments"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Marjorie Taylor Greene open to healthcare deal with Democrats amid shutdown</h2>  <p>Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has indicated she is willing to negotiate with Democrats over healthcare insurance costs – the central political issue that has kept the US government shut down since 1 October.</p> <p>Indicating that she is willing to stand against her party on the issue, Greene said Monday night in a post on the social platform X that she’s “absolutely disgusted” insurance premiums could double if a system of tax credits dating back to Barack Obama’s presidency is allowed to expire at the end of the year.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/07/marjorie-taylor-greene-government-shutdown-healthcare"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump says there is ‘natural conflict’ with Canada during Carney visit</h2>  <p>Donald Trump said there is “mutual love” but “natural conflict” between the US and Canada as he hailed progress towards a trade deal but offered few concrete concessions on steep US tariffs during a visit by the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/07/trump-says-there-is-natural-conflict-with-canada-during-carney-visit"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Laura Loomer cautions Trump on idea of Ghislaine Maxwell pardon: ‘Do not do it’</h2>  <p>A noncommittal response from Donald Trump over whether he would pardon convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell provoked a response from the president’s staunch ally and far-right influencer Laura Loomer.</p> <p>“Do not do it,” Loomer wrote on X, tagging Trump, JD Vance and Pam Bondi, the US attorney general. “I repeat.
