Financial markets are only pricing a 25% probability of a 25bp cut, but a 60-65% chance of a cut by the end of the year.</p> <p>Recent data have been supportive of a rate cut. Headline inflation held at 3.8% in September, 0.2pp below the BoE’s forecast. Meanwhile, the labour market has shown further signs of deterioration. The unemployment rate rose to 4.8%, up 0.7pp from one year ago.

But it is still better than expected by analysts, who had forecast that prices would be flat.</p> <p>Property prices are 2.4% higher compared with a year ago, and now stand at an average of £272,226.</p> <p><strong>Robert Gardner</strong>, chief economist at Nationwide, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Against a backdrop of subdued consumer confidence and signs of weakening in the labour market, this performance indicates resilience, especially since mortgage rates are more than double the level they were before Covid struck and house prices are close to all-time highs.</p> <p>Looking forward, housing affordability is likely to improve modestly if income growth continues to outpace house price growth as we expect. Borrowing costs are also likely to moderate a little further if bank rate is lowered again in the coming quarters.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Alice Haine</strong>, an analyst at the investment platform Bestinvest, added the slowdown in house price growth suggests that buyers and sellers are adopting a “wait and see” approach ahead of the budget on 26 November. She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Among the myriad of proposals reportedly under consideration is a ‘mansion tax’ on homes valued over £2 million. Council tax reform, capital gains tax applied to the sale of high-value residences and replacing stamp duty with an annual property tax are also on the table. Even landlords are under pressure once again, despite already grappling with higher taxation and tighter regulation, with speculation that National Insurance (NI) may be applied to rental income – yet another hit for the private rental sector.</p> <p>…With so many property tax changes in the mix, buyer demand has slowed, but the number of homes up for sale has risen, placing those still hunting for a home in a stronger position. Some sellers, keen to move fast, may not only price their homes more competitively but also be more amenable to negotiation.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Elsewhere overnight, the biggest news came from US tech giants <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Amazon</strong>.</p> <p>Both companies reported better-than-expected results yesterday, thanks to record-breaking iPhone sales at Apple and huge demand for cloud computing at Amazon.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/30/apple-earnings-iphone-demand">Apple reports record iPhone sales as new lineup reignites worldwide demand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The results should put investors in the US in a good mood later this afternoon, but they appear to have had a mixed effect over in Asia: in Japan, the Nikkei 225 index rose by 2%, while shares in South Korea also rose.</p> <p>But shares in China fell on Friday after the electric car brand <strong>BYD</strong> reported a 33% drop in its third quarter profit.
