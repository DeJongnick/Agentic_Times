Will the Matildas finally have a new coach in the dugout for those games or, failing that, at least have one named? Will that effect the composition of the squad called up and how they look to set up?

She’s a special, special player.</p> <p>The scorer of her side’s first goal, Fowler was impressive once again out on the flank. A succession of Matildas coaches from Alen Stajcic, to Ante Milicic, to Tony Gustavsson, and now Tom Sermanni have all agonised how to get the best out of the prodigy but it’s out wide – the same position where she plays for Manchester City – that really seems to be where her future lies.</p> <p>With Sam Kerr set to return in the coming months, just how the next full-time boss of this side (Montemurro?) is able to properly utilise their attacking weapons could dictate how far this side goes in a home Asian Cup.

Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the second game of this two-game friendly series between the Matildas and South Korea. My name’s Joey Lynch and I’m set to take you through all the action this evening.</p> <p>After a Lim Seon-Joo own-goal was enough for an injury-hit Australian side to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/04/australia-matildas-south-korea-republic-match-report-result-scores">earn a 1-0 win in the first clash</a> between the two sides in Sydney last Friday, our belligerents this evening have headed up the highway to Newcastle for their re-match, to the home of the Jets (and Knights too, I guess) at McDonald Jones Stadium.</p> <p>After a winless SheBelieves Cup campaign at the start of 2025 laid bare the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2025/mar/01/matildas-football-world-rankings-performance-shebelieves-asian-cup-2026">state of purgatory</a> the Matildas have been placed in without a permanent coach, that win over the Taegeuk Ladies served as an important stabiliser for the side; providing a much-needed boost in morale for team and fans alike. It also provided some deserved respite for interim boss Tom Sermanni, who was tasked with righting the ship and getting the team enjoying their football again after last year’s Olympics but, in the face of Football Australia’s turgid search for a permanent coach, has been left in place long after he accomplished this task.</p> <p>There were some positive footballing signs from that game, too, with the deployment of a fluid frontline of Mary Fowler, Caitlin Foord, and Holly McNamara giving the former the scope to affect the game from where she does her best work out wide when she came off the bench. Katrina Gorry a late withdrawal from the squad with injury, Kyra Cooney-Cross also drew praise for her work leading the midfield and Charli Grant – getting some much-needed game time after logging just 285 cumulative WSL minutes at Spurs this season – was also one of Australia’s best.</p> <p>With load management an important factor in addition to the numerous injuries that have hit the team, Sermanni will once again be forced to reshuffle his XI and substitutes for this one. We’ll have line-ups for you shortly. Invariably, there will also be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/31/sam-kerr-matildas-captain-avoids-football-australia-sanction-captaincy-ntwnfb">plenty of shots of Sam Kerr in the stands</a> to attract the attention, too.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off is at 7:30pm AEST / 10:30am BST / 2:30am PT</strong>.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-07T08:56:18.636Z">at 9.56am BST</time></p>  </div>
