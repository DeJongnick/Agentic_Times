<p>UK manufacturing is expected to receive support to ease energy costs and boost skills, the Guardian understands, as part of a long-awaited industrial strategy due to be unveiled next week.</p> <p>Energy-intensive industries have long complained that they pay too much for electricity compared with competitors in the EU, while the wider industrial sector has struggled to recruit skilled staff.</p> <p>As Nigel Farage’s Reform party <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/09/nigel-farage-reform-uk-welsh-elections-coalmining-revived">targets support in Britain’s industrial heartlands</a>, ministers are poised to pour funds into boosting the manufacturing workforce with proposals similar to a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-unleashes-next-generation-of-construction-workers-to-build-15m-homes">£600m package for the construction sector</a> announced earlier this year, which underpins plans to build 1.5m homes.</p> <p>Ministers have drawn up plans to take aim at energy costs through two policies, one targeted at businesses that use the most electricity – such as steel and aluminium – and another designed to support manufacturing more broadly.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/17/trump-could-keep-tariffs-on-uk-steel-unless-us-secures-guarantees">Trump threatens to keep 25% tariff on UK steel imports over Port Talbot concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These are expected to be at the heart of the strategy, which could be announced as soon as Monday.</p> <p>First, the government will increase from 60% to 90% the “network compensation charging” (NCC) scheme, a discount for energy-intensive businesses on the fees they pay to connect to the Grid.</p> <p>The discount, which is ultimately paid for by other electricity bill-payers including households, is available under the British Industry Supercharger initiative brought in by the previous government.</p> <p>Industry sources said increasing the discount would reduce costs for struggling steelmakers by about £6.50 per megawatt hour (MWh).</p> <p>This is expected to help big companies such as Tata and British Steel, which is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/11/parliament-recalled-to-discuss-british-steel-nationalisation">under government control</a>, manage the costly transition from blast furnaces to greener electric arc furnaces.</p> <p>However, industry sources said that, while the policy was welcome, the overall saving for the sector is only expected to be worth about £15m a year.</p> <p>Energy costs are likely to remain significantly higher than in Germany and France, chiefly because UK electricity prices are linked to the cost of wholesale gas, which is a larger part of the British energy mix than on the continent.</p> <p>Speaking at the Paris airshow this week, the business and energy minister, Sarah Jones, said: “Whether you’re a company wanting to invest in the UK or whether you’re an existing company in the UK, energy prices is a challenge. The fact that we’re not competitive with it, with Europe, is the challenge.”</p> <p>For smaller manufacturers, ministers will consult on a new “intensity threshold” to provide relief. The scheme, which could be up and running as soon as 2027, is expected to work by analysing the ratio between a company’s energy usage and its turnover, adjusting the support on offer accordingly.</p> <p>Make UK, the trade body for the sector, welcomed indications that companies are in line to receive the support they have long campaigned for.</p> <p>“If we’re going to move the dial in the industrial strategy we have to get manufacturers’ eye-watering energy costs more in line with our competitors,,” said Stephen Phipson, chief executive of Make UK.</p> <p>“This would be an incredibly welcome move for companies and provide a much-needed shot in the arm at a time when they are facing multiple challenges on all fronts.</p> <p>“It would also give a vital kickstart to investment and help manufacturing support the government to deliver its growth mission to boost the economy.”</p> <p>The strategy is also likely to include greater powers for the state-owned British Business Bank to invest directly in businesses, particularly small and medium-sized startups.</p> <p>The department for business and trade declined to comment on the content of the industrial strategy.</p> <p>Ministers were expected to publish the industrial strategy earlier this year but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/12/labour-postpones-long-awaited-industrial-strategy">the announcement was postponed</a> as the government brought forward detailed plans for individual sectors.</p>
