<p>The government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/12/whats-in-uk-immigration-white-paper-visa-rules-deportations-fees">immigration white paper</a> aims to reduce the number of people arriving in the UK “significantly” by introducing restrictions across various forms of visas.</p> <p>Changes include the requirement of degree-level qualifications rather than those that are roughly equivalent to A-levels for skilled work visa applicants.</p> <p>Language requirements are to become more strict, with all adult dependants who come with arriving workers or students needing to show at least basic English skills, and to show progression over time. People will also have to wait at least 10 years to see settlement, rather than the current five.</p> <p>We’d like to know how your business might be affected by Labour’s plans. Do you have concerns? We’d also like to know why your business has been recruiting from abroad instead of from the UK, if applicable.</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="88255320-2e6d-4030-9395-d0cb21043f16" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p><em><strong>If you’re having trouble using the form click <a href="https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/employers_views_on_immigration_white_paper">here</a>.
