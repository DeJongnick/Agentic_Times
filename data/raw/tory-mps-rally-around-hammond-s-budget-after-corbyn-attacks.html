<p>Conservative MPs have countered Jeremy Corbyn’s swingeing criticism of the budget as the work of “a government no longer fit for office” with a broad endorsement of Philip Hammond, in sharp contrast to their open reservations about the chancellor’s plans last year.</p> <p>Hammond’s colleagues used the first of four days of scheduled debate about the budget to praise not just his high-profile announcements on housing, but also his commitment of £3bn to prepare for any Brexit eventuality.</p> <p>In his response to the budget, Corbyn – it is the leader of the opposition who traditionally speaks rather than the shadow chancellor – said Hammond had completely failed to tackle a national crisis of stagnation and falling wages.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/nov/22/autumn-budget-2017-philip-hammond-tax-spending-growth-deficit-politics-live">Autumn budget 2017: Hammond scraps stamp duty for first-time buyers for homes worth up to £300,000 - updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The test of a budget is how it affects the reality of people’s lives all around this country,” the Labour leader said. “And I believe as the days go ahead, and this budget unravels, the reality will be – a lot of people will be no better off. And the misery that many are in will be continuing.”</p> <p>Largely eschewing direct focus on Hammond’s specific announcements in favour of a broader critique of the government’s wider economic approach, Corbyn castigated Hammond for again missing deficit reduction targets, and for a continued spending squeeze on schools and the police.</p> <p>Speaking about housing, Corbyn said rough sleeping had doubled since 2010, and that this Christmas 120,000 children would be living in temporary accommodation. “We need a large-scale publicly funded housebuilding programme, not this government’s accounting tricks and empty promises.”Summing up, he said: “We were promised a revolutionary budget. The reality is nothing has changed. People were looking for help from this budget. They have been let down. Let down by a government that, like the economy they’ve presided over, is weak and unstable and in need of urgent change. They call this budget ‘Fit for the Future’. The reality is this is a government no longer fit for office.”</p> <p>The response from the bulk of Conservatives who spoke on the first day of debate was generally positive.</p> <p>Hammond’s first budget as chancellor last year had been marked by a humiliating U-turn on his most high-profile plan, to increase national insurance contributions for the self-employed, within a week. But this year members praised the £3bn funding for Brexit planning.</p> <p>Cheryl Gillan, who supported leave, said the money was “very important”. She told the Commons: “We do have to create an environment where we don’t have uncertainty about the economic impact and I hope that money will go towards providing more certainty in that area.”</p> <p>The first MP to speak after Hammond and Corbyn was Nicky Morgan, the Conservative former education secretary, who chairs the Commons Treasury committee, a role she took after the election.</p> <p>Morgan, one of the more vocal Brexit sceptics on the Tory back benches, welcomed Hammond’s plans, but noted that the financial models were based around a “relatively benign” departure from the EU.</p> <p>She said: “That cannot be guaranteed, and even though a transitional arrangement that would allow for such a smooth adjustment is manifestly in the interests of both the UK and the EU, it might, of course, not happen.”</p> <p>On future funding for the NHS and other services there “is not pot of gold under the Brexit rainbow”, Morgan warned.</p> <p>The Treasury committee would look in the coming weeks into the budgetary consequences of failing to reach a Brexit deal on transition, Morgan said, and would also examine the likely impact of Hammond’s raising of the stamp duty threshold for first-time homebuyers.</p> <p>John Redwood, the veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP, in contrast hailed the economic forecasts in the budget as more “realistically optimistic” about the benefits of Brexit, even though he argued they could have been more bullish still. </p> <p>But Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrats’ deputy leader, said Hammond’s budget had to be seen amid reduced growth forecasts which predict the economy in 2021 as being £45bn smaller than had been projected in March.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/22/housing-budget-cut-growth-forecasts-philip-hammond">The real budget story is the sharp cut in growth forecasts | Larry Elliott</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“And so I’m afraid his attempt to paint a cheerful vision of the future were rather less successful than his jokes,” Swinson said.</p> <p>“The truth is, as the chancellor knows, this budget and the next budget and the budget after that, and all the future budgets are made all the more difficult because of Brexit, and because of the extreme approach to Brexit this government is taking.”<br></p> <p>Labour’s Angela Eagle, formerly the shadow business secretary, noted that the £3bn extra set aside for Brexit was greater than the near-£2bn more promised for the NHS.</p> <p>Hammond had made no mention of financing for social care, or about the cost pressures on councils, Eagle said: “It’s 15 years of austerity – cut after cut, pressure on public services, year in, year out, with no end in sight.”</p>
