The all-world QB finished 15/34 for 250 yards, zero touchdowns, one pick and a rating of 57.2. Mahomes led the NFL in passing scores going into this and he didn’t get to add to his tally. Huge!</p> <p>Right, that is me done again for another week. But what a night it has been, easily the best Sunday of the season so far. So many lead changes, spills, thrills and even a few bellyaches.

Last chance saloon? Well, it is for this drive. One yard needed. They go again with Hunt. Great call as the Bills expect pass, no one on hand to tackle Hunt, touchdown! Then they go for two to make it a one-score game, of course Mahomes hooks up with Kelce with ease. “Old reliable,” says Romo.

After thrashageddon seven days ago the playoff contenders are emerging, however there is still enough rope left on the spool for the underdogs to plot a postseason course. So how about it Houston? What have you got Atlanta? The Ravens are flying, Pittsburgh, so can you take down the mighty Colts?</p> <p>With a stup(id)endous eight games to track we want drama, nay, we DEMAND drama. So let’s, as they say, ‘ave it.</p> <p>Your octet starting at 12pm CST/1pm EST/6pm (home teams listed first):</p> <ul> <li><p>(3-5) <strong>Cincinnati Bengals v Chicago Bears</strong> (4-3)</p></li> <li><p>(5-2) <strong>Detroit Lions v Minnesota Vikings</strong> (3-4)</p></li> <li><p>(5-1-1) <strong>Green Bay Packers v Carolina Panthers</strong> (4-4)</p></li> <li><p>(3-4)<strong> Houston Texans v Denver Broncos</strong> (6-2)</p></li> <li><p>(6-2)<strong> New England Patriots v Atlanta Falcons</strong> (3-4)</p></li> <li><p>(2-6) <strong>New York Giants v San Francisco 49ers</strong> (5-3)</p></li> <li><p>(4-3) <strong>Pittsburgh Steelers v Indianapolis Colts </strong>(7-1)</p></li> <li><p>(1-7)<strong> Tennessee Titans v Los Angeles Chargers</strong> (5-3)</p></li> </ul> <p>There are a number of potential upsets in the offing here but Pittsburgh seeing off Indianapolis would be the most spectacular. The game plan will likely revolve around stopping Indianapolis’ Jonathan Taylor. The back is enjoying a breathtaking year so far as he sits first in total rushing yards by almost 100 with 850, second (by a whole tenth of a yard) per carry at 5.9, and first in rushing touchdowns with 12. Slow him down and you have a foothold from which to build success, as the Rams found when they slapped the brakes on Taylor to the tune of 76 yards at 4.5 per carry and zero touchdowns during their 27-20 victory in September.</p> <p>Pittsburgh’s defense has been solid enough against the run. Only five touchdowns conceded shows some promise with a middle of the road EPA per rush of -0.02 meaning that on average they perform, well, very averagely. So crucially not disastrous like their passing defense. What they haven’t yet faced is an offense as abundantly brilliant as the Colts that puts quarterback Daniel Jones and his receivers are firmly in the conversation for being one of the best passing attacks. They might even be on top if Taylor wasn’t hogging so much of the limelight.</p> <p>The Steelers are in a bind. Head coach Mike Tomlin has to pick his poison, Jones is the likely choice so Pittsburgh may throw bodies into the box to force the Colts to pass. It is a gamble, but the risk could be worth the reward of a vital win in the race for the AFC North.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-02T18:03:28.264Z">at 6.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div>
