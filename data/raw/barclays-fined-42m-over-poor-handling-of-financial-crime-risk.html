<p>Barclays has been fined £42m over “poor handling” of financial crime risks linked to two clients, including a gold bullion business run by James Stunt, the former son-in-law of Formula One tycoon Bernie Ecclestone. </p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the bulk of the penalties, about £39.3m, related to Barclays’ failure to properly screen Stunt’s business – Stunt &amp; Co – and its relationship with Fowler Oldfield, a Bradford jeweller now infamously linked to a large money-laundering operation.</p> <p>The failures spanned 2015 to 2021, and Stunt &amp; Co ultimately received £46.8m from Fowler Oldfield.</p> <p>Barclays was made aware of the fact that Fowler Oldfield was the subject of a criminal investigation involving potential money laundering in August 2016. But the bank only started to review its exposure to the company five years later, when a court fined NatWest more than £264m over its relationship with the purported jeweller, in a case brought by the FCA.</p> <p>The case gained widespread press attention, given the extraordinary details, including that staff had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/13/natwest-fined-264m-after-admitting-breaching-anti-money-laundering-rules">depositing “big black bin liners” full of cash</a> at a NatWest branch that overwhelmed its floor-to-ceiling safes.</p> <p>The FCA said on Wednesday that Barclays “did not gather enough information at the start of the relationship or carry out proper ongoing monitoring”.</p> <p>In March, two directors for Fowler Oldfield were convicted of money laundering and sentenced to more than a decade in prison each. Stunt was cleared at Leeds crown court of any money-laundering charges in relations to funds received from the purported jeweller. </p> <p>Barclays was also fined £3.1m on Wednesday for failing to check it had enough information to understand the money-laundering risk before opening a client money account for the now-collapsed wealth management firm WealthTek.</p> <p>The FCA in December charged WealthTek’s former head partner John Dance with fraud and laundering more than £64m from the firm’s client accounts. Dance is due to face a criminal trial at Southwark crown court in September 2027.</p> <p>Commenting on the fines, the FCA’s joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, Therese Chambers, said: “The consequences of poor financial crime controls are very real – they allow criminals to launder the proceeds of their crimes, and they allow fraudsters to defraud consumers.</p> <p>“Banks need to take responsibility and act promptly, particularly when obvious risks are brought to their attention. In the first of these cases, Barclays secured a significant reduction in its fine through its extensive cooperation with our investigation and through making a voluntary payment to affected consumers at our request.”</p> <p>Barclays said the bank remained “deeply committed to the fight against financial crime and fraud”.</p> <p>It added: “The FCA’s investigation relating to Stunt &amp; Co was centred around historical money-laundering activity and made no findings that the bank had breached money-laundering regulations.</p> <p>“As acknowledged by the FCA, Barclays undertook an extensive review and self-reported its findings to the FCA. Barclays fully cooperated with both investigations and has further strengthened its financial crime and other control capabilities.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 17 July 2025. It was a court that fined NatWest more than £264m, not the FCA; however, the case was prosecuted by the FCA.</p>
