<p>Labour has appointed Tony Blair’s former policy chief to lead Britain’s new jobs market watchdog being created by the government to enforce its strengthening of workers’ rights.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/22/fair-work-agency-requires-proper-resources">Fair Work Agency requires proper resources</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Matthew Taylor, who led the influential <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/07/low-paid-workers-job-satisfaction-no-10-review-taylor-report">Taylor report</a> on the gig economy and modern working practices for Theresa May’s government, will become the chair of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/10/new-enforcement-agency-will-protect-workers-rights-as-part-of-watershed-bill">Fair Work Agency</a> when the body launches next April.</p> <p>The new watchdog will form a key plank of Labour’s proposals to drastically strengthen workers’ rights by drawing together Britain’s existing labour enforcement agencies into a single body.</p> <p>It will have powers to tackle employers flouting the law, including naming and shaming rogue businesses paying staff below the legal minimum wage, issuing fines and bringing legal cases on workers’ behalf.</p> <p>Taylor, who ran Blair’s No 10 policy unit in the 2000s, used his gig economy review for May’s government to call for a drastic overhaul of workplace rights. While his report was seen as central to Tory efforts to win over economically insecure Labour voters, it was largely mothballed as the party cycled through prime ministers.</p> <p>He also held the role as the government’s head of labour market enforcement between 2019 and 2021, but sharply attacked the Tories for backsliding on its pledges to protect workers from unscrupulous employment practices.</p> <p>Taylor told the Guardian Starmer’s government had the potential to make progress after the Tories had reneged on their promises.</p> <p>“I think it was quite clear that the previous government had not got that balance right, [and] I think this government is going to get that balance right,” he said.</p> <p>“Flexible work will always have an important role in our economy, but it mustn’t be at the price of the insecurity and unfairness towards workers.”</p> <p>Hiring Taylor – one of the country’s leading employment experts – is expected to underscore Labour’s commitment to bolstering workplace rights despite mounting pressure from businesses for the party to water down planned changes.</p> <p>Bosses have warned the government’s landmark employment rights bill, which includes banning zero-hours contracts and day-one rights protecting against unfair dismissal, will drive up unemployment and hurt the economy.</p> <p>Business groups have ramped up their lobbying before Rachel Reeves’s 26 November budget, amid criticism that the chancellor added to a slowdown in the jobs market by raising taxes on employment in last year’s budget.</p> <p>Ministers have, though, insisted the bill will be enacted “in full” amid intense pressure from trade unions and leftwing MPs fearful that Keir Starmer’s government will backslide on the legislation.</p> <p>Starmer’s reshuffle last month fuelled unease among trade unions after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/05/angela-rayner-resignation-letter-in-full">resignation of Angela Rayner</a> and replacement of Justin Madders, the employment minister, who had championed the plan.</p> <p>Labour also faced a fierce trade union backlash after the Guardian revealed this month that ministers were exploring charging workers a fee to take their bosses to an employment tribunal. The justice secretary, David Lammy, then ruled out the measure last week.</p> <p>Kate Dearden, who replaced Madders last month, said Labour was “absolutely committed” to boosting workers’ rights.</p> <p>“We’ll always listen carefully to feedback from businesses and from trade unions, because we want to ensure this legislation works for workers and employers alike. That’s why it’s pro-business, it’s pro-worker, and pro-growth,” she said.</p> <p>The creation of the Fair Work Agency, however, comes amid questions over the resourcing and the capacity of the government to oversee its tougher approach to the enforcement of its package of workers’ rights.</p> <p>While drawing together the<strong> </strong>functions and powers of the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority, along with other existing enforcement responsibilities, to create the Fair Work Agency, experts believe extra resources are also likely to be required.</p>
