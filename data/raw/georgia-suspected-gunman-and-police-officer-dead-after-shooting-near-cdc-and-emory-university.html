<p>A suspected gunman and a police officer are dead after law enforcement responded to reports of an active shooter near the adjoining campuses of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, on Friday, authorities said.</p> <p>“It is with profound sadness that we announce the death of one of our very own DeKalb county police officers,” Greg Padrick, the county’s interim police chief, said at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/741098695372394/?s=single_unit">a news conference</a> on Friday night. The name of the officer who was fatally shot while responding was not immediately released.</p> <p>The Atlanta police department, the FBI and the Georgia bureau of investigation are investigating the incident.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/08/fort-stewart-georgia-army-base-suspect">Fort Stewart shooting suspect was relentlessly mocked for stutter, soldiers say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No civilians are believed to have been injured, Darin Schierbaum, the Atlanta police chief, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzgqELXMgpY">told reporters</a>, but several rounds hit buildings on the CDC’s campus.</p> <p>The gunman was found on the second floor of a building across the street from the CDC and died at the scene, Schierbaum said.</p> <p>Atlanta police <a href="https://x.com/Atlanta_Police/status/1953950275687133346">said</a> just after 6.40pm local time there was “no ongoing threat to the Emory campus or the surrounding neighborhood. The incident involved a single shooter, who is now deceased.”</p> <p>Emory University had alerted students and staff earlier to an active shooter on their Atlanta campus, telling students to “RUN, HIDE, FIGHT” and avoid the area. Just after 6.30pm local time, another update from the university advised students that “Shelter in place has been lifted”, but that the police emergency continued and they should avoid the area.</p> <p>Witnesses told local media that shots were fired near the Emory Point CVS, which is close to the university’s Atlanta campus and the CDC’s Roybal campus.</p> <p>Employees at the CDC said bullets struck the windows of several buildings on the federal agency’s campus. One CDC employee sent <a href="https://x.com/AndyPierrotti/status/1953936304535986392">photographs</a> to the local CBS News affiliate in Atlanta showing what appeared to be shattered glass from the impact of gunshots on a federal building.</p> <p>“Twice this week, deranged criminals have targeted innocent Georgians,” Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, said in <a href="https://x.com/GovKemp/status/1953942109636956437">a statement</a>, referring to the new incident and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/06/fort-stewart-georgia-lockdown-shooting">the mass shooting</a> at Fort Stewart military base in south-east Georgia on Wednesday.</p> <p>“Each time, brave first responders rushed toward the danger to subdue the shooter and save lives, reminding us of just how crucial they are. Marty, the girls, and I are thankful for all those who answer the call to serve and who protect their fellow Georgians. We ask that you join us in holding them in our prayers, along with those harmed this evening near the CDC center.”</p> <p>Staff at a deli near campus locked the doors and hunkered down inside. Brandy Giraldo, the General Muir deli’s chief operating officer, said staffers inside heard a string of gunshots.</p> <p>“It sounded like fireworks going off, one right after the other,” she said.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>
