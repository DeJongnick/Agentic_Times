In response, May said she accepted that “as we leave the EU we will no longer be full members of the single market”. But she said it was in the interests of both sides to get a deal covering goods and services. She went on:</li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think the City of London will continue to be a major global financial centre. That is an advantage not just for the UK, it’s actually good for Europe and good for the global financial system.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>May and Macron, accompanied by a cohort of senior British and French ministers, struck a series of agreements relating to Anglo-French cooperation after the summit.</strong> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-france-summit-2018-documents">They released 13 papers and agreements in total,</a> covering areas like security and defence, cyber and digital, foreign policy and even sports events. Afterwards, in a reference to his announcement about letting the Bayeux Tapestry visit the UK in 2022, Macron said the two countries were “making a new tapestry together”.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Macron said that as a result of what he described as the Sandhurst treaty affecting border controls at Calais the processing of migrants coming to the UK would be speeded up.</strong> (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/18/macron-may-summit-french-president-emmanual-macron-theresa-may-labour-mp-calls-for-windfall-tax-on-pfi-companies-politics-live?page=with:block-5a60e7a6e4b0ff81ba724d1c#block-5a60e7a6e4b0ff81ba724d1c"> 6.33pm.)</a> May, who has been criticised by the former Ukip leader Nigel Farage for the deal, was less keen to talk about this aspect of the summit and did not use the phrase “Sandhurst treaty”.</li> </ul>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/954064675674652672">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Un nouveau traité, le traité de Sandhurst, permettra d’améliorer la coopération pour gérer notre frontière commune. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UKFRSummit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UKFRSummit</a> <a href="https://t.co/hIPFtotg7l">pic.twitter.com/hIPFtotg7l</a></p>&mdash; Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/954064675674652672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/954064896534220801">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Un point important du traité de Sandhurst : la réduction des délais pour le traitement des mineurs non accompagnés. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UKFRSummit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UKFRSummit</a><a href="https://t.co/tvWn1aQksP">https://t.co/tvWn1aQksP</a></p>&mdash; Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron/status/954064896534220801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>That’s all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2018-01-18T20:05:04.315Z">at 8.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5a60f4e6e4b0ff81ba724d8d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T19:34:29.857Z">7.34pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here is some comment from journalists on the press conference.</p> <p>From Politico Europe’s<strong> Charlie Cooper</strong></p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/CharlieCooper8/status/954064318013870081">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Macron punchier than might have been expected on Brexit.

I’m here neither to punish nor to reward. I want to make sure that the single market is preserved because that is very much at the heart of the European Union.</p> <p>So the choice is on the British side, not on my side. They can have no differentiated access to financial services. If you want access to the single market, including the financial services, be my guest. But it means that you need to contribute to the budget and acknowledge European jurisdiction. Such are the rules and we know this is the system already in place for Norway.</p> <p>If you want a trade access, it will cover everything, but then it is not full access to the single market and to financial services. Otherwise it’s closer to the situation of Canada. We have some trade agreements which allow access to all services, be they financial or others, access as well to any industry sector, but not the same level of relationship as if you were a member of the single market. And there shall be no hypocrisy in this respect, otherwise it will not work. Or we would destroy the single market and its coherence.</p> <p>So, its’s simple. I would not want to exclude any sector in the trade agreement to come. The negotiations will be led by Michel Barnier. But it does not mean that the access it will allow will be equivalent to [being] a member of the single market. Otherwise you can choose between Norway, or being the equivalent of a current member of the European Union. </p> </blockquote> <p>There is nothing new or surprising about his comments. Ever since Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016 EU leaders, more or less unanimously, have been saying that the UK will not be able to maintain all the benefits of single market membership when it leaves without accepting the concomitant obligations. In Brussels that prospect is usually described as “cherry picking”, while in the UK it is (Boris Johnson-style) having one’s cake and eating it. Whatever, Macon is saying it won’t be allowed.</p> <p>But even though EU leaders have repeatedly made comments like this, Theresa May and her colleagues continue to insist (as May did this evening - see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/18/macron-may-summit-french-president-emmanual-macron-theresa-may-labour-mp-calls-for-windfall-tax-on-pfi-companies-politics-live?page=with:block-5a60ec48e4b063d00a112612#block-5a60ec48e4b063d00a112612">6.54pm) </a>that some form of cherry picking or cake having-and-eating will be permitted. That’s why the Macron words are news; it is the reality drum beat (or the bluff drum beat, if you think the EU are bluffing) getting louder and louder as the Brexit deadline looms.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2018-01-18T20:06:06.967Z">at 8.06pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5a60ee35e4b063d00a112623" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T18:58:57.262Z">6.58pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>May says the summit today has been about developing the partnership between the two countries.</p> <p>It was also about developing interests for their economic future. </p> <p>That is good for the people of France and the people of the UK, she says.</p> <p>And that’s it.</p> <p>I’ll post a summary shortly.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-5a60ee0ce4b0307acc11f6b8" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T18:57:43.575Z">6.57pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The press conference is still going on.

welcomed President Emmanuel Macron for summit talks which will see Britain commit tens of millions of pounds to strengthen UK border controls in France. </p> <p>The French president, making his first visit to Britain since entering the Elysee Palace, was greeted at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, with a guard of honour from the Coldstream Guards. </p> <p>Before the ceremonial welcome, the two leaders enjoyed a working lunch at the Royal Oak pub in Paley Street, in May’s Maidenhead constituency. </p> <p>Officials said the £44.5m cash injection would go towards fencing, CCTV and detection technology in Calais and other ports along the Channel. </p> <p>Part of the money will also go towards helping relocate people away from Channel ports to prevent another migrant camp from forming as it did in Calais in 2015. </p> <p>Britain could also commit to taking in a higher proportion of child refugees from France as part of its commitment to resettle 480 unaccompanied children under the Dubs scheme, it is understood. </p> <p>Figures show more than 750 children have been transferred to Britain through various routes since the “Jungle” camp was shut down in 2016. </p> <p>May’s official spokesman said on Wednesday: “We have given a clear commitment in relation to child refugees following the Dubs amendment. </p> <p>“The work to identify unaccompanied minors in and around the Calais area continues and where it’s appropriate to find them homes in the UK we’re determined to do so.” </p> <p>The French president has been pressing for Britain to increase its financial contribution as well as a commitment to take more refugees ahead of his first visit to the UK as president. </p> <p>A government spokeswoman said: “This is about investing in and enhancing the security of the UK border. </p> <p>“Just as we invest in our borders around the rest of the UK, it is only right that we constantly monitor whether there is more we can be doing at the UK border controls in France and Belgium to ensure they are as secure as possible.” </p> <p>The summit is also an opportunity for the two leaders to underline their countries’ enduring ties, despite Britain’s impending withdrawal from the EU. </p> <p>Increasing co-operation on defence and counter-terrorism will be high on the agenda at an event which will see the first meeting together of the heads of the two countries’ main intelligence agencies. </p> <p>The heads of MI5, MI6, GCHQ and France’s DGSE and DGSI will discuss how they can work together to counter threats such as the targeting of concert venues like Manchester Arena and the Bataclan in Paris, and terrorists using the internet as a “safe space”. </p> <p>Britain will also commit to participating in Mr Macron’s “European intervention initiative”, which officials do not regard as a European army but a plan to enhance co-ordination of existing armed forces.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time

Shipman quotes Johnson as saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If you wanted to show your commitment to Europe, is it not time for us to have further and better economic integration with a road tunnel? That’s what we need ...</p> <p>You could come out of the EU but join Europe in the most fundamental way ...</p> <p>You undo the damage done at the end of the ice age. The Channel is really a river whose tributaries used to be the Seine and the Thames. It became bigger and bigger and bigger as the ice melted until it separated Britain from France.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to Shipman, Johnson was keen to float the plan at the Conservative conference in 2016 but was talked out of his by his advisers.</p> <p>However, it now seems Johnson is keen to revive the idea.

The theory is that the Taoiseach who leads a minority coalition might gain encouragement from the next major opinion poll on the state of Irish parties at the end of January and consider going to the country in April.</p> <p>At present Varadkar relies on his very own ‘confidence and supply arrangement’ of the type the DUP has to keep Theresa May in <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=10+Downing+Street&amp;entry=gmail&amp;source=g">10 Downing Street</a>. The Taoiseach and his Fine Gael party not only need the support of an alliance of Independent Dail deputies but also the qualified backing of the main opposition party Fianna Fail. A series of polls that put Varadkar and his party further ahead of Fianna Fail may tempt him to dissolve the Dail after his trip to the White House on St Patrick’s Day. There is even speculation that Fine Gael may even to a deal with Sinn Fein, which will be led by Dublin TD Mary Lou McDonald to set up a stable coalition.</p> <p>Varadkar’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister Simon Coveney was asked today if this potential scenario would convince Sinn Fein it would be useful to be in government both in Belfast and Dublin thus giving new hope of a deal to restore power sharing in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Coveney’s reply was unequivocal: “I don’t see any prospect of a general election in the Republic of Ireland any time soon.”<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-5a60c8e1e4b0ff81ba724bbd" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T16:22:01.932Z">4.22pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here are some more pictures from the May/Macron summit.</p>         </div>   </div> <div id="block-5a60c474e4b063d00a112436" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T16:13:35.439Z">4.13pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Lord Ashcroft, the former Conservative party deputy chairman who now specialises in researching public opinion, has published a new poll today. <a href="https://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2018/01/lord-ashcroft-where-the-parties-stand-and-more-on-that-second-eu-referendum.html">The findings are worth reading in full,</a> but here are three that stand out.</p> <p><strong>1 - Voters will clearly back a second referendum - but only if it’s a choice between Brexit with a deal, and Brexit with no deal.</strong> Ashcroft asked four different questions about a possible second referendum, and if staying in the EU is an option, voters are against.

Opposition to a new referendum outweighed support (indeed with between a quarter and a fifth of remainers answering in the negative) in all scenarios but one: a choice between accepting the terms negotiated for Brexit, or leaving without a deal – that is, a referendum which would result in Britain leaving the EU in any event. This was both the least unpalatable option to leavers, a quarter of whom supported the idea, and the least attractive to remainers, only 57 per cent of whom were in favour.</p> </blockquote>    <p><strong>2 - “Don’t know” has now overtaken both Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn in the ‘Who would make best PM?’ chart.</strong></p>    <p><strong>3 - Labour is ahead of the Conservatives on most key ‘party character’ traits - although both parties have seen their ratings fall on these measures since last summer.</strong></p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-5a60c2fbe4b0307acc11f4c8" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T15:54:27.914Z">3.54pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Gary Gibbon</strong>’s Channel 4 News <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/by/gary-gibbon/blogs/brexit-talks-may-macron-lunch?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">blog about the May/Macron summit</a> is worth reading.

The minister said there were strong suspicions that Paris was keen to stretch out the negotiations over a transition phase to prolong uncertainty for UK businesses pondering a move to Paris.</p> <p>One other theme you repeatedly hear on the transition is how many EU capitals are convinced that the UK is going to need a status quo transition that lasts long after the end of 2020 (the current working notion of an end date). But EU officials say extending the transition is too controversial a topic to introduce into Britain’s fragile political state, and not something the EU27 particularly want to complicate their lives with at the moment either. If it is needed later it can be negotiated then, the rationale runs, and the EU27 will have more leverage in that conversation because the UK needs would be that much more pressing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-5a60bde3e4b063d00a1123e9" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T15:33:03.936Z">3.33pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>This is from<strong> Romain Raoux,</strong> who works for the French embassy in London. </p> <p>(Clearly a man who deserves a pay rise.)</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/RomainRaoux/status/954013193051009024">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s raining a bit at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sandhurst?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Sandhurst</a>, but President <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmanuelMacron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EmmanuelMacron</a> has clearly arrived 🇫🇷🌈 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UKFRsummit?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UKFRsummit</a> <a href="https://t.co/FCkh3d6UAM">pic.twitter.com/FCkh3d6UAM</a></p>&mdash; Romain Raoux (@RomainRaoux) <a href="https://twitter.com/RomainRaoux/status/954013193051009024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2018</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-5a60bd6ae4b0ff81ba724b10" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T15:31:30.351Z">3.31pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Telegraph’s <strong>Jack Maidment</strong> has more on Theresa May’s lunch with Emmanuel Macron.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/jrmaidment/status/954012507261358080">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron went for a pub lunch at the Royal Oak, Paley Street, in the PM&#39;s Maidenhead constituency.

In other words the extra £1bn could only be spend once devolved power sharing was back up and running.</p> <p>But the DUP and indeed her predecessor James Brokenshire always insisted the £1bn aid package was not contingent on the Northern Ireland Executive being restored after over a year of political stasis. This was actually raised at the briefing by another reporter.</p> <p>In later statement this afternoon, Bradley said the government’s preference is to have “elected ministers spend the money” in the region but added that the £1bn the DUP secured would still be spent in the absence of devolution. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-5a60b892e4b0307acc11f428" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/henrymcdonald"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T15:11:20.498Z">3.11pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The new Northern Ireland secretary<strong> Karen Bradley</strong> has been described by Democratic Unionist Party MP Ian Paisley as a solid unionist in outlook.</p> <p>But on one issue she is poles apart from the DUP - gay marriage equality.</p> <p>Bradley voted in favour of gay marriage equality law which does not apply to Northern Ireland where it is a devolved issued.</p> <p>The DUP has used a special parliamentary veto in the now deadlocked Stormont Assembly to block legislation that would make LGBT marriages legal in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>While Bradleywas focussed mainly today on announcing talks aimed at restoring power-sharing government in Northern Ireland (see<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2018/jan/18/macron-may-summit-french-president-emmanual-macron-theresa-may-labour-mp-calls-for-windfall-tax-on-pfi-companies-politics-live?page=with:block-5a60ac45e4b0307acc11f37a#block-5a60ac45e4b0307acc11f37a"> 2.22pm)</a>, the secretary of state was asked about what she was going to do about the region being the only part of the UK were gay marriage is not recognised in law. </p> <p>“I am not here to impose,”Bradley answered, means the status quo remains. Only when the Stormont Assembly is back up and running, and if (as seems unlikely) the DUP lifts its opposition to gay marriage will the current scenario change.</p> <p>A number of Ulster Unionist politicians had earlier proposed on Thursday that one way around the problem was for the Westminster government to legislate for a referendum in Northern Ireland allowing the people of the region to vote for or against gay marriage.

The withdrawal agreement, it is clear from the outset, is for the transition and no longer than the transition period which is currently planned to end no later than 30 December 2020. We can set aside legal arguments as to whether or not a contracting party to the EEA agreement ceases to be one if they leave the EU by making provision for the small amendments that make it clear that the UK will continue to be a contracting party to the EEA within the withdrawal agreement. As such an amended EEA Agreement will respect our sovereignty, as it does for Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein ...</p> <p>This EEA transition option plainly gives the UK more power and control over subsequent developments than would the European council’s proposal of last December. But it would also be easier for EU members. It follows precedent and in some parts would be bespoke but it means much of the legal provision is contained in a well understood international treaty with its own legal framework. It ought to unite all shades of Leave opinion, and attract some remainers who recognise the need in practical negotiations to start to respect the referendum decision.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-5a60a536e4b092da99aa7c70" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T13:46:47.580Z">1.46pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">   </div>   </div> <div id="block-5a60a389e4b092da99aa7c61" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T13:43:52.721Z">1.43pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Ashworth hints he is open to funding NHS through hypothecated tax</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/health/2018/01/place-fear-labours-jonathan-ashworth-how-solve-nhs-crisis">an interesting interview with the New Statesman</a> <strong>Jonathan Ashworth</strong>, the shadow health secretary, has hinted that he is open to the idea of funding the NHS through a hypothecated tax.

But she has been criticised for giving MPs the chance to delay yet again a project deemed essential to experts.</p> <p>To recap: the Houses of Parliament, which were rebuilt in the middle of the nineteenth century after the fire in 1834, are in an appalling condition and in need of multi-billion pound repairs. This has been acknowledged for years, and in 2015 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jun/18/palace-of-westminster-renovation-options-report">a report was published saying a renovation programme was needed that could cost more than £7bn and last up to up to 40 years.</a></p> <p>After that <a href="https://restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk/joint-committee-appointed.html">a joint committee of MPs and peers was set up to consider the options. </a>It produced<a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201617/jtselect/jtpow/41/41.pdf"> a report (pdf) </a>in September 2016 saying that there was a “clear and pressing” need to act “to prevent catastrophic failure in the next decade”. It recommended “a full decant” (parliamentarians moving out of the building for good during the repairs, which would be cheaper than options allowing MPs and peers to remain fully or partly) and said a “delivery authority” should be appointed to start planning the work “as soon as possible”.</p> <p>But since then the government and parliament have delayed taking a decision. Many MPs and peers are thought to be very unhappy about the idea of moving out of one of the most famous buildings in the world, and they fear that voters will object to so much money being spent on parliament.</p> <p>Today Leadsom announced that the debate on what do to next, <a href="https://restorationandrenewal.parliament.uk/government-defers-debate-on-the-future-of-the-palace-of-westminster.html">which had been expected in early January, </a>will finally take place on Wednesday 31 January. But it will only be a half-day debate, taking place roughly between 4pm and 7pm after a debate on a Labour motion.</p> <p>And MPs will get the chance to vote for a motion putting off any long-term decision until 2022. Leadsom has tabled two motions for MPs to choose between (you can find the text of both motions <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmagenda/OP180118.pdf">on this document [pdf]</a> on pages 53 and 54) and the first one says only “essential work” will be carried out this parliament, with a review before 2022 deciding what comprehensive work might take place after that election.</p> <p>If that motion fails, MPs will instead vote on an alternative motion calling for the work to start “as early as possible in the next decade”. This motion would also establish a sponsor board to decide what whether or not to go ahead with the “full decant” option - even though the joint committee took a decision on this.</p> <p>In the Commons <strong>Valerie Vaz</strong>, the shadow leader of the Commons, accused Leadsom of not taking the problem seriously. She said the government should allocate more time for the debate and, referring to John Bercow’s love of tennis, she said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Mr Speaker, I can only think of one phrase that you are very familiar with in tennis circles, the government “cannot be serious”. It is as if the joint committee have never met. The joint committee took the evidence and reported and all the government does in their motion is to note it. Can the government think again and retable the motions.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Leadsom rejected this claim. She told Vaz.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The House needs to decide whether we can afford to justify the undoubted work that needs to take place to restore this Palace, a UNESCO world heritage site that has over 1m visitors a year, at a time when there are great fiscal constraints. It is a genuinely open decision that the House needs to make and, what the government has sought to do is, taking into account the very broad range of views across the House on what should happen, is to put forward first of all the open discussion about whether the House is willing to bear that cost from the taxpayers’ purse, and then secondly, if the House does believe that now is the time, then how can we go about doing that to ensure the very best value for taxpayers’ money.</p> </blockquote> <p>Although Leadsom described it as “an open decision” for MPs (ie, a free vote matter), the fact that the government is putting the option of postponing the decision for another four years on the table suggests that it would be happy for this to be the outcome.</p> <p>If you are curious as to why the restoration project is deemed essential, do read the long read on this topic that my colleague <strong>Charlotte Higgins</strong> wrote at the end of last year.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/01/a-tale-of-decay-the-houses-of-parliament-are-falling-down">‘A tale of decay’: the Houses of Parliament are falling down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Charlotte discovered that the state of the building is so bad that there is a real fear that it could effectively collapse into a pile of shit.

Aside from all the rather unpleasant stuff about the rising levels of sewage, the fact is that when it hits the high-tension electricity cables, the electricity is out, you don’t have any fresh water, and you are done for.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2018-01-18T12:50:31.992Z">at 12.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5a6081abe4b01e0d7f971181" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2018-01-18T11:23:46.097Z">11.23am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">David Gauke sworn in as lord chancellor</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>David Gauke, </strong>the justice secretary, has been sworn in today as lord chancellor, the role he holds alongside his post as head of the Ministry of Justice.

(John McDonnell announced this at the party conference last autumn, although the policy small print made it clear that<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/sep/25/john-mcdonnell-labour-would-bring-pfi-contracts-back-in-house"> the actual plans are not quite as radical as the headlines generated by McDonnell’s speech implied.)</a> In a statement today <strong>Peter Dowd,</strong> shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The National Audit Office confirms that, not only is there little evidence of the benefits of private finance procurement, but also that it “results in additional costs compared with publicly financed procurement”.</p> <p>According to the NAO’s analysis of a schools building project, costs under the Tories’ new PF2 schemes are 40% higher than through direct government funding.</p> <p>Worryingly, despite this and the Office for Budget Responsibility’s description of PFI as a “fiscal illusion”, it seems that the Treasury has actively decided against removing budgetary incentives which exist in favour of PFI.</p> <p>Today’s report only further demonstrates this Tory government’s continued commitment to fleecing tax payers for the benefit of large PFI firms. It also raises more questions over the use of PFI in a week in which the Carillion scandal has left many fearing for their jobs and standard of their public services.</p> <p>The next Labour government will draw a line under the failed PFI approach to public investment, and will replace it by a transparent and accountable approach, which will reduce the costs and deliver significant savings to the taxpayer.”</p> </blockquote>    <p>But on the Today programme a Labour MP, <strong>Stella Creasy,</strong> offered another proposal. Creasy first made her name as an MP campaigning against payday lenders and she described PFI firms as “the legal loan sharks of the public sector”.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>What the NAO reports shows, to devastating effect, is that PFI and PF2, because the government brought in exactly the same scheme under a different name, is both too expensive to continue on with and very expensive to get out of. </p> <p>Of that £10bn [the annual charge for PFI contracts] what that study also shows is that half of that is interest on charges. These companies, these type of contracts, really are the legal loan sharks of the public sector. It’s like a payday loan or a hire purchase agreement to build a school or a hospital and then run one. It’s a very expensive way to do it. And the question we all have to ask ourselves is what do we do next. </p> </blockquote> <p>Creasy said, given the difficulties of halting PFI contracts, the government should instead consider imposing a windfall tax on these firms.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This is why I’m calling for a windfall tax on these companies. The one place where we do have leverage with them is on the tax they pay. They’ve also had a massive corporation tax bonus because corporation tax on a lot of these contracts [when they] were signed, and it was part of the deal and the reason why we went with them, was around 30%. Under this government it has now dropped to 17%. So we are estimating that some of them have saved around £190m in corporation tax payments alone. That is money that is owed to our public sector, and is money we could get back with a windfall tax. </p> </blockquote>    <p>I will post more on this as the morning goes on.</p> <p>Then, this afternoon, the main even will be Theresa May’s summit with Emmanual Macron.
