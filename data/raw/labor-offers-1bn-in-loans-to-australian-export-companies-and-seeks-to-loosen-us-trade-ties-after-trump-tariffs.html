<p>Labor will provide $1bn in zero interest loans to help export-focused companies tap alternative markets as Australia seeks to loosen trade ties with the US in response to Donald Trump’s new tariffs.</p> 
<p>The lending facility would complement a separate government initiative to fund representative bodies of affected sectors “to secure and grow new markets”.</p> 
<p>The pledges, announced on Thursday, were made shortly after Trump’s “liberation day” speech. The US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/03/donald-trump-hits-australian-exporters-with-10-tariffs-in-liberation-day-speech">hit Australia with a 10% tariff </a>in response to claims that Australia imposes the same sized impost on US goods through various trade barriers, a claim that Albanese disputes.</p> 
<p>Australia has sought to boost trade to countries like India and the United Arab Emirates and sign a free trade agreement with the European Union in a diversification strategy to be fast-tracked amid the upheaval in global diplomatic and economic relations.</p>

<p>Wesley Widmaier, professor of international relations at Australian National University, said it was natural for countries facing tariffs to look for other export markets.</p> 
<p>“Countries are looking to do something outside the US umbrella,” he said.</p> 
<p>“Everyone is looking at diversifying, from the Europeans to the Canadians and the Australians.”</p>

<p>The Albanese government opted against retaliating with tariffs and instead announced five measures designed to find new markets and offer some protection to affected industries.</p> 
<p>These are:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p>Strengthening the anti-dumping regime to protect against tariff-hit overseas steel, aluminium and other products undermining local manufacturing. <br></p></li> 
 <li><p>Providing $50m to affected sectors to secure new markets for their products.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li><p>Providing $1bn in zero interest loans to help Australian companies capitalise on export opportunities.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li><p>Bringing Australian businesses to the “front of the queue” for government contracts.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<ul> 
 <li><p>Establishing a<strong> </strong>strategic reserve of critical minerals.</p></li> 
</ul> 
<p>While the US only accounts for about 5% of Australian exports, it is the biggest destination for Australian beef exports, taking about 400,000 tonnes, worth $3.4bn, in 2024.</p> 
<p>The National Farmers’ Federation president, David Jochinke, said while the sector was “profoundly disappointed” in the US decision, it would not support a response that included reciprocal tariffs.</p> 
<p>“The Australian agricultural industry supports a considered and measured approach to negotiations with the United States and will work closely with the government and all sides of politics to seek a resolution to this issue,” Jochinke said.</p> 
<p>There were some exemptions to the tariffs, although those sectors could still be caught by future policy announcements.</p>

<p>Australia’s largest pharmaceuticals group, CSL, said “at this stage” its products were not subject to the 10% tariffs.</p> 
<p>“CSL is continuing to assess the broader impact of the tariffs and will monitor further announcements by the US government,” the vaccine maker said.</p> 
<p>While Australia was hit with the minimum tariff level of all affected nations, it was enough to unsettle the ASX on Thursday, with the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX 200 down more than 1% by early afternoon trading.</p> 
<p>Shares in Australian home appliance manufacturer Breville were down more than 5% on Thursday. While it has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/11/breville-coffee-bean-sales-increase-beanz-donald-trump-tariffs">diversifying its manufacturing base</a>, it still produces the majority of its appliances in China, which has been hit by a 34% tariff.</p>
