 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>This blog will be closing shortly. Here is an overview of today’s developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, floated the idea of nominating the US president, Donald Trump, for the Nobel peace prize in a briefing to reporters, two days ahead of the announcement of this year’s winner, who would have been selected earlier in the autumn. </strong>Zelenskyy said in comments released on Thursday: “If Trump gives the world – above all, the Ukrainian people – the chance for such a ceasefire, then yes, he should be nominated for the Nobel peace prize. We will nominate him on behalf of Ukraine.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Strikes on Russian oil facilities by Ukraine’s newly developed long-range missiles and drones are causing significant gas shortages in Russia, while on the battlefield a recent Ukrainian counteroffensive has derailed Russia’s plans to capture parts of the eastern Donetsk region, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says. </strong>Ukraine’s new Palianytsia missile has hit dozens of Russian military depots, Zelenskyy said. The Ruta missile drone, meanwhile, recently struck a Russian offshore oil platform more than 150 miles (250km) away in what Zelenskyy called “a major success” for the new weapon.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of wanting to sow “chaos” in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> by launching strikes on his country’s energy grid and railway infrastructure, in comments published on Thursday. </strong>Moscow, whose forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, have in recent weeks escalated aerial attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities and rail systems.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Ukrainian military said on Thursday that it had struck the Korobkovsky gas processing plant and oil transport infrastructure in Russia’s Volgograd region overnight.</strong> The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had struck port facilities and energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa region that were used by the Ukrainian army.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s prime minister, the head of presidential office, and a senior sanctions adviser will go to the US early next week for talks with US officials, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Thursday. </strong>Zelenskyy wrote in a post on social media: Topics include air defence, energy, and sanctions steps, as well as the negotiation track. The issue of frozen assets will also be discussed with the US.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A man formerly employed by Warsaw city council in its registry of births, marriages and deaths was charged with espionage for allegedly providing Russia with false identities its spies could use.</strong> The man, identified only as <strong>Tomasz L.</strong> in line with Polish privacy laws, was indicted on charges of espionage and abuse of power, the Polish Internal Security Agency wrote in a statement on Thursday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Keir Starmer has said the UK will back India taking its “rightful place” on the UN security council as he met Narendra Modi in Mumbai at the end of his two-day trip, saying both he and Modi had discussed the need for a “just and lasting” peace in Ukraine.</strong> He said both had agreed the need to “break away from fossil fuels” as he praised the “remarkable” speed of India’s growing economy.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>US sanctions on Serbia’s majority-Russian-owned oil company, which operates the country’s sole refinery, took effect on Thursday after months of delay.</strong> The US sanctioned the company, Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS), in January as part of its crackdown on the Russian energy sector following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister by Friday evening, his office has said, hinting at the French president’s hopes that a sixth prime minister in less than two years will manage to steer a budget through the country’s deeply fragmented parliament. </strong>“This might be the last chance,” government spokesperson Aurore Bergé told RTL radio on Thursday. “I believe this is the last chance for politicians to regain credibility … all of this is only strengthening the chances and capabilities of the far right to take power.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The French state prosecutor has called for the jail term of an unemployed builder to be increased after he contested his conviction for raping Gisèle Pelicot after she had been drugged unconscious by her husband. </strong>Dominique Sie, the lead state prosecutor, told the court of appeal in Nîmes that Husamettin Dogan’s claims of innocence were an example of how rape culture was still widespread in society as part of “archaic” forms of “male domination”.</p></li>

  <p><em>Angelique Chrisafis is the Guardian’s Paris correspondent.</em></p> 
  <p>The French state prosecutor has called for the jail term of an unemployed builder to be increased after he contested his conviction for raping <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gisele-pelicot">Gisèle Pelicot</a> after she had been drugged unconscious by her husband.</p> 
  <p>Dominique Sie, the lead state prosecutor, told the court of appeal in Nîmes that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/gisele-pelicot-appeal-trial-never-gave-consent-husamettin-dogan">Husamettin Dogan’s</a> claims of innocence were an example of how rape culture was still widespread in society as part of “archaic” forms of “male domination”.</p> 
  <p>Sie said: “Now we must change rape culture to a culture of consent.”</p> 
  <p>Dogan, 44, a married father, was sentenced to nine years in prison last year for raping Pelicot in her bed when she was in a comatose state in June 2019. He is the only one of 51 men found guilty in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/19/gisele-pelicot-trial-husband-jailed-for-20-years-as-all-51-men-found-guilty">high-profile trial</a> last year to have appealed against his conviction and is undergoing a retrial in southern France.</p> 
  <p>Sie recommended the jury should find Dogan guilty and increase his sentence to 12 years, because he “absolutely refuses to take any responsibility”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Zelenskyy says he will nominate Trump for peace prize if he secures Ukraine ceasefire</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements">

  </blockquote> 
  <p>Zelenskyy has worked hard to win Trump’s support, and appears to be making some headway.</p> 
  <p>Tomahawk missiles top Kyiv’s wishlist of US weapons it believes can inflict serious damage on Russia and force it to the table.</p> 
  <p>Trump, who has expressed frustration with Russia’s Vladimir Putin, has signalled he is open to providing them.</p> 
  <p>The US president has said he deserved the Nobel award, given to four of his White House predecessors, for what he has described as his efforts in securing numerous peace deals.</p>

  <p><strong>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, told Azerbaijan’s leader that two Russian missiles had detonated beside an Azerbaijan Airlines plane last year after Ukrainian drones entered Russian airspace, and promised compensation to those affected,</strong> Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>Flight J2-8243, en route <strong>from Baku to the</strong> <strong>Chechen capital Grozny,</strong> crash-landed on 25 December <strong>near Aktau in Kazakhstan</strong> after diverting from southern Russia, where Ukrainian drones were reported to be attacking several targets. <strong>At least 38 people were killed.</strong></p> 
  <p>Video footage on Thursday showed Putin and the <strong>Azerbaijani president,</strong> <strong>Ilham Aliyev, </strong>shaking hands and smiling before a bilateral meeting in Tajikistan at which Putin spoke about the plane crash.</p> 
  <p>Putin last year issued a rare public apology to Aliyev for what the Kremlin called a “tragic incident” over Russia in which the plane crashed after Russian air defences were deployed against Ukrainian drones.</p> 
  <p>He said on Thursday:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Of course, everything that is required in such tragic cases will be done by the Russian side on compensation and a legal assessment of all official things will be given,” Putin told Aliyev.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It is our duty, I repeat once again … to give an objective assessment of everything that happened and to identify the true causes.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Putin told Aliyev that two Russian air defence missiles had detonated several metres away from the plane after Ukrainian drones entered Russian airspace.</p>

  <p><strong>Staff at Venice’s La Fenice opera house have voted to strike over the appointment of a conductor with ties to Giorgia Meloni’s far-right government.</strong></p> 
  <p>The strike will be held on Friday 17 October, the date of the opera house’s first performance of a run of Alban Berg’s Wozzeck, which will close its 2024-25 season.</p> 
  <p>The theatre’s musicians and staff have for months called for Beatrice Venezi’s appointment as music director to be revoked, claiming she does not have enough experience for the high-profile role and was picked only because of her government connections.</p> 
  <p>Venezi, 35, whose father is a former member of the neofascist Forza Nuova party, was appointed as a music adviser at the culture ministry shortly after Meloni came to power three years ago and has been praised by the Italian prime minister on several occasions, also receiving an award from her far-right Brothers of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy">Italy</a> (FdI) party.</p> 
  <p>Venezi has conducted orchestras across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> and beyond. However, critics of her recruitment argue she lacks the calibre expected for such a post, noting that she has never directed at La Fenice – except for a brief promotional event – nor at any major international opera house.</p>

  <p><strong>Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister by Friday evening, his office has said, hinting at the French president’s hopes that a sixth prime minister in less than two years will manage to steer a budget through the country’s deeply fragmented parliament.</strong></p> 
  <p>“This might be the last chance,” <strong>government spokesperson Aurore Bergé</strong> told RTL radio on Thursday. “I believe this is the last chance for politicians to regain credibility … all of this is only strengthening the chances and capabilities of the far right to take power.”</p> 
  <p>The country’s longstanding political crisis deepened earlier this week after the <strong>prime minister, Sébastien Lecornu, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/06/france-pm-sebastien-lecornu-resigns">resigned</a> after 27 days in office.</strong> Lecornu’s decision left Macron <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/07/edouard-philippe-sebastien-lecornu-france-emmanuel-macron-elections">with few options;</a> call snap legislative elections, resign as president or attempt to find a new prime minister.</p> 
  <p>Soon after, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/06/france-pm-sebastien-lecornu-resigns">Macron asked Lecornu</a> to stay on for two more days to hold last-ditch talks aimed at charting a way out of the spiralling political crisis that has gripped the EU’s second-largest economy.</p> 
  <p>After hours spent speaking to parties across the political spectrum – save the far right and hard left who declined to take part – Lecornu <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/08/outgoing-french-pm-hopeful-concessions-avoid-snap-elections">appeared cautiously optimistic</a> that a solution could be found.

  <p><strong>Finnish prosecutors said on Thursday they were appealing against a Helsinki court’s decision to dismiss a case against three crew members from Russia’s “shadow fleet” suspected of cutting Baltic Sea cables,</strong> Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/11/finland-accuses-tanker-crew-sabotage-undersea-cables-anchor">In a trial that took place in August and September,</a> crew members of the Cook Islands-registered Eagle S oil tanker were accused of dragging their anchor on the seabed for about 56 miles (90km), damaging five undersea cables in the Gulf of Finland on 25 December 2024.</p> 
  <p>In early October, the Helsinki district court ruled that the case was beyond Finnish jurisdiction, and it would be up to the vessel’s flag state or the defendants’ home countries to try them – the ship captain is Georgian, and its two senior officers are Georgian and Indian.</p> 
  <p>In a statement published on Thursday, the prosecution said the court ruling had concluded that “restrictions arising from the United Nations convention on the law of the sea” made the Finnish criminal code inapplicable, “even though Finland could be considered the place where the alleged crimes were committed”.</p> 
  <p>It said the deputyprosecutor general would appeal against the Helsinki district court’s decision to rule inadmissible the charges of cable breaches outside Finnish waters.</p> 
  <p>According to the European Union, the Eagle S belongs to Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet” – old oil tankers used by Moscow to dodge sanctions imposed by Western allies over the Ukraine war.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ukrainian counteroffensive derails Russia's plans to capture Donetsk cities, Zelenskyy says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Strikes on Russian oil facilities by Ukraine’s newly developed long-range missiles and drones are causing significant gas shortages in Russia, while on the battlefield a recent Ukrainian counteroffensive has derailed Russia’s plans to capture parts of the eastern Donetsk region, the Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy says, according to the Associated Press (AP).<br><br></strong>Ukraine’s new Palianytsia missile has hit dozens of Russian military depots, Zelenskyy said. The Ruta missile drone, meanwhile, recently struck a Russian offshore oil platform more than 150 miles (250km) away in what Zelenskyy called “a major success” for the new weapon.<strong><br></strong><br>Also, swarms of Liutyi and Fire Point long-range drones – up to 300 units in one operation – have hit Russian energy facilities, and Ukrainian forces recently fired Neptune and Flamingo missile systems at Russia, the Ukrainian leader said.</p>

His remarks were embargoed until Thursday.<br><br>“The main thing is that [Russia is] now importing gasoline – that’s a signal,” he said. Ukrainian intelligence reports show Russia has boosted imports from Belarus sixfold and removed import duties, while also bringing in fuel from China.<br><br>On the battlefield, Zelenskyy said the most intense fighting remains around <strong>Pokrovsk and Dobropillia in the eastern Donetsk region,</strong> where Ukrainian troops have launched a counteroffensive operation he described as “very difficult but very timely – and successful.”<br><br>“This operation derailed Russia’s summer offensive campaign,” he said, adding that what he said was Moscow’s plan to occupy much of the Donetsk region by November had failed.<br><br>Russian commanders have been ordered “to take Pokrovsk at any cost”, he said, citing intercepted Russian military communications.<br><br>Zelenskyy also said Ukraine has contingency plans to protect its natural gas infrastructure, which has been the target of heavy Russian attacks in recent weeks as winter approaches.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We have Plan A and Plan B.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Plan A is to rely more on our own extraction. Plan B … is to switch to imports. We understand the volumes, the cost of those imports, and where to get the necessary funds.</em><br></p>

  <p>The 72-year-old’s former husband has admitted to drugging her with sedatives and inviting dozens of strangers to rape and abuse her over nearly a decade in a case that shocked the world.</p>

  <p><strong>Public prosecutor Dominique Sie</strong> said he was asking for three extra years in view of “Dogan’s stance, in all its rigidity, as he absolutely refuses to take any responsibility”.</p>

  <p><strong>US sanctions on Serbia’s majority-Russian-owned NIS oil company,</strong> which operates the country’s sole refinery, <strong>took effect on Thursday after months of delay,</strong> Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.</p> 
  <p>The United States sanctioned the company, <strong>Petroleum Industry of Serbia (NIS),</strong> in January as part of its crackdown on the Russian energy sector following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p> 
  <p>After the sanctions came into force on Thursday morning, NIS said it “had not yet been granted an extension of the special licence from the United States Department of the Treasury”.</p> 
  <p>“NIS is working to overcome this situation,” it said in a statement, adding it would work with the US Treasury to seek its removal from the sanctions list.</p> 
  <p>The company said it has “sufficient crude oil reserves for processing at this time, while petrol stations are fully supplied with all types of petroleum products”.</p> 
  <p><strong>President Aleksandar Vučić</strong> warned on Monday that the sanctions would have a <strong>serious impact</strong> and hit the <strong>banking sector</strong> first.</p> 
  <p>“There is no bank in the world that would risk violating US sanctions,” Vučić said.</p> 
  <p>NIS confirmed it expects foreign payment cards to “cease functioning”, with petrol stations accepting only Serbia’s domestic card or cash.</p>

  <p>He said both had agreed the need to “break away from fossil fuels” as he praised the “remarkable” speed of India’s growing economy.</p>

  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Russian strikes killed three people and wounded two in Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy region, its military administration said.</strong> The attacks came after Russia said on Wednesday that momentum towards reaching a peace deal in Ukraine had largely vanished, after Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump’s presidential summit in Alaska, dimming hopes for a quick end to the three-and-a-half year war.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A Russian overnight drone attack injured five people and damaged port and energy infrastructure in Ukraine’s southern region of Odesa,</strong> <strong>its governor said on Thursday.</strong> The attack cut power to 30,000 consumers and set containers with vegetable oil and wood pellets on fire in the port, Oleh Kiper said on Telegram. It came as fires broke out at fuel and energy facilities in Russia’s Volgograd region as a result of a drone attack, Governor Andrei Bocharov said on Thursday.</p></li>
