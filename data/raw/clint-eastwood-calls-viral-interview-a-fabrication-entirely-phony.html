<p>Clint Eastwood has released a statement to claim a recent interview with him is a fabrication.</p> <p>Quotes from <a href="https://kurier.at/stars/clint-eastwood-95-geburtstag-interview/403045513">an alleged interview</a> with the Oscar-winning actor and director had gone viral over the weekend and were picked up by a number of sites. Yet Eastwood has now said that he never spoke to anyone from the German-language Austrian newspaper Kurier.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jun/04/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-clint-eastwoods-interview-debacle-reveals-bleak-truths-about-film-journalism">The good, the bad and the ugly: Clint Eastwood’s interview debacle reveals bleak truths about film journalism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“A couple of items about me have recently shown up in the news,” Eastwood said in a statement released to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/clint-eastwood-assails-austrian-interview-in-austrian-kurier-entirely-phony-1236420771/">Deadline</a>. “I thought I would set the record straight. I can confirm I’ve turned 95. I can also confirm that I never gave an interview to an Austrian publication called Kurier, or any other writer in recent weeks, and that the interview is entirely phony.”</p> <p>Eastwood, who turned 95 over the weekend, had been originally quoted as saying he was in pre-production on his new movie and had railed against “an era of remakes and franchises”.</p> <p>Kurier is based in Vienna and has a circulation of approximately 100,000 copies.</p> <p>There is no official statement from Kurier or any details on how the interview was assembled. Underneath the interview, a note claims that the paper is “currently investigating the matter”.</p> <p>Eastwood’s most recent film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/30/juror-2-review-clint-eastwood-nicholas-hoult-court-dilemma">Juror #2</a>, which starred Nicholas Hoult, was released at the end of last year with no confirmed word on what his next film will be. In an <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/clint-eastwood-ruin-filmography-why-did-i-make-this-1235069094/">interview</a> to support the film with the Metrograph magazine, he addressed his legacy as a film-maker.</p> <p>“That would be up to them, to the audiences, to answer,” he said. “Up to the people on the outside. I just kind of go along. I consider this, again, emotional. It comes upon you. You have a story, you make a movie of it. You have to just go for it. If you think too much about how it happened you might ruin it. I go back and look at films I’ve made, and I could easily ask, ‘Why the heck did I make this?’ I don’t remember! It might have been a long time ago.”</p> <p>Eastwood had recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/27/the-greatest-hollywood-pays-tribute-to-gene-hackman-after-actors-death">paid tribute</a> to co-star Gene Hackman after Hackman’s death in February. “There was no finer actor than Gene,” he said. “Intense and instinctive. Never a false note.” He added: “He was also a dear friend whom I will miss very much.”</p>
