<p>Liberal Jacinta Nampijinpa Price backed out as the headlining speaker at an upcoming anti-immigration protest spanning several of Australia’s cities that was inspired by rightwing protests in the UK in September.</p> 
<p>The Northern Territory senator announced shortly before midday on Friday she was “honoured” to join the rally against “mass immigration” and net zero. Less than 24 hours later, and after Guardian Australia contacted Nampijinpa Price’s office with questions, her announcement was wiped from social media.</p> 
<p>The Put Australia First rallies, organised by anti-lockdown protester Monica Smit and others associated with the “freedom” movement, have been organised in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane for the end of November.</p> 
<p>In a now-deleted post on X, Nampijinpa Price said she was “honoured” to join the Sydney event, which will also feature a virtual appearance from the British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/who-were-the-key-figures-at-the-unite-the-kingdom-rally-in-london">behind the “Unite the Kingdom” march</a> in London.</p>

<p>“Honoured to stand with fellow Australians who share our unyielding commitment to national sovereignty and prosperity,” Nampijinpa Price wrote on X on Friday, promoting the event’s poster.</p> 
<p>“On 29 November, let’s unite in Sydney to hear the voices that matter most - those of everyday Aussies demanding real change. Together, we Put Australia First.”</p>

<p>The rallies follow similar gatherings in August in Australia, which turned violent and attracted controversy after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/31/march-for-australia-neo-nazis-among-protesters-at-anti-immigration-rallies">being promoted and attended</a> by neo-Nazis.</p> 
<p>Put Australia First’s rally organisers say the upcoming events are not connected to those held in August, and neo-Nazis will not be welcomed.</p> 
<p>Guardian Australia contacted Nampijinpa Price’s office on Friday afternoon to ask whether she felt comfortable appearing alongside Robinson, a controversial UK figure known for his ties to fascism and anti-Islamic groups.</p> 
<p>On Saturday morning, a spokesperson said the senator would no longer attend due to “personal commitments”. Nampijinpa Price and her musician husband, also due to appear, have both been removed from the group’s website.</p> 
<p>It’s understood Sussan Ley’s office was not informed about the Liberal backbencher’s speech ahead of her announcement on Friday. A spokesperson for the opposition leader’s office declined to respond when asked if the opposition leader intervened to prevent Nampijinpa Price’s attendance.</p> 
<p>While Nampijinpa Price didn’t attend the August rallies, the Northern Territory Liberal senator congratulated the marchers and said the “vast majority” were people who “love this country”.</p> 
<p>The senator said she “utterly condemned those who call themselves neo-Nazis”, and said they had “hijacked” the marches.</p> 
<p>In an interview with the ABC days later, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/03/ed-husic-anthony-albanese-jacinta-nampijinpa-price-march-for-australia-immigration-comments-ntwnfb">Nampijinpa Price falsely claimed</a> federal Labor was promoting migration by specific ethnic groups, namely from India, to grow its electoral support.</p> 
<p>Indian Australians had been targeted by anti-immigration protesters in August, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/05/melbourne-immigration-migrated-indians-targeted-racist-messaging-asking-why-ntwnfb">prompting concern</a> the senator’s comments would further incite racism and division.</p> 
<p>She <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/04/jacinta-nampijinpa-price-blames-abc-for-claim-government-prioritising-labor-voting-migrants">walked back the comments</a> shortly after but refused to apologise for the comments or publicly express support for the Liberal leader, Sussan Ley, leading to her sacking from the shadow ministry.</p>

<p>Smit said the upcoming event had no connection to August’s rallies and she strongly condemned “extremist views of the NSN [National Socialist Network] and [does] not associate with anyone who has offered them a platform to speak and recruit”.</p> 
<p>“Thousands of everyday Aussies at past events have had their genuine concerns misappropriated by dishonest or radical voices,” she told Guardian Australia.</p> 
<p>Smit said all speakers were invited by the group and there would be no “open mic” opportunities for attenders.</p> 
<p>Robinson is billed to appear virtually at the event, with Smit acknowledging on social media he would likely not be granted a visa to enter the country.</p> 
<p>Robinson, who co-founded the now defunct Islamophobic group the English Defence League, has convictions for violence, public order offences, and financial and immigration frauds. His <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/10/amazon-criticised-as-tommy-robinson-book-tops-chart">latest book</a> centres on the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, claiming the UK’s population is being “replaced” by non-Anglo immigrants.</p> 
<p>Smit defended Robinson’s inclusion, saying he would “share his energy and patriotism via a pre-recorded video speech”.</p> 
<p>“We have connected with Tommy Robinson, as he has a large global profile as someone who is patriotic and speaks up for his own country, voicing the concerns of many of his fellow countrymen and women,” she said.</p>
