<p>Snow has fallen in southern Queensland and the New South Wales State Emergency Service (SES) has responded to reports of up to 100 vehicles stuck in heavy snow blanketing the northern tablelands.</p> 
<p>Footage sent to Guardian Australia showed snow tumbling down at Dalveen, between Stanthorpe and Warwick in south-east Queensland, about 4pm on Saturday.</p> 
<p>Videos posted on social media page Higgins Storm Chasing showed snow falling on the town at the same time.</p> 
<p>Also at 4pm on Saturday, the SES reported up to 100 vehicles were stuck in snow on New England Highway, Waterfall Way, Norris Drive and Grafton Road in the northern tablelands. It said snow in the area was “at depths never seen before”.</p> 
<p>Rain was battering other parts of NSW on Saturday, and the SES had issued 28 warnings for residents across the Coffs Coast, Mid North Coast, Upper Hunter and New England regions.</p> 
<p>The SES warned 24-hour rainfall totals between 65mm and 100mm were likely, with isolated falls exceeding 130mm possible.</p> 
<p>The service’s assistant commissioner, Nicole Hogan, said heavy and persistent rain could result in some roads being flooded and becoming impassable.</p> 
<p>“We’ve had crews in Tamworth doorknocking low-lying areas to alert locals of potential localised flash flooding and road closures overnight tonight,” Hogan said.</p> 
<p>“We implore the community to never drive, walk or play in floodwater – if you come across a flooded road, turn around and find an alternative route.”</p>

<p>The heavy rainfall has caused rivers to rise, with moderate flooding along the Peel river at Tamworth and Namoi river at Gunnedah.</p> 
<p>In Queensland, a major cold front has swept the state, with snow falling in the south-east around Stanthorpe, Warwick and Dalveen.</p> 
<p>Videos posted on social media by Higgins Storm Chasing showed snow falling at Dalveen about 4pm on Saturday.</p> 
<p>In NSW, unusual snow levels had been reported at Armidale and Guyra, and falls of up to 50cm are possible throughout Saturday.</p> 
<p>Hogan said black ice was a significant risk and was causing dangerous road conditions throughout the northern tablelands.</p> 
<p>“We have road crash crews prepositioned and ready to respond to any rescues, but we ask the community to please avoid unnecessary travel,” she said.</p> 
<p>“If you do need to be on the roads in areas with snow, drive with caution, always use your brakes gently and drive slowly.”</p> 
<p>Damaging wind gusts exceeding 90km/h and large and powerful surf are also forecast.</p> 
<p>More than 1,000 NSW SES volunteers have been deployed across the state. The SES has responded to 750 calls since the onset of the bad weather.</p>
