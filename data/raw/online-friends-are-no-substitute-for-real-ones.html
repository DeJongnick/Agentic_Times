<h1>Online friends are no substitute for real ones</h1>

<p>I empathise with Moya Lothian-McLean’s article on withdrawing from social media (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/02/life-oversharing-costs-thrill-privacy-social-media-journalism" title="">2 May</a>). I also tended to post a lot, but Covid has taught me that of my 360-odd Facebook “friends”, only a select few have bothered to check up on me during the past two difficult years, when I was alone for much of the time. Real friends are the ones who are there for you in hard times, and do things like drop by with a bunch of flowers, offer to do a bit of shopping, or ring up for a chat. While social media can have some positive outcomes, it has created a lot of negatives, such as cyberbullying and invidious comparisons with people’s seemingly perfect lives. <br incopy-break-type="webbreak"><strong>Sharman Finlay</strong><br incopy-break-type="webbreak"><em>Portrush, County Antrim </em></p> <p><strong>• <em>Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
