screening tool used to determine which domestic violence victims need support has “obvious problems” and should be replaced, the UK safeguarding minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/jess-phillips">Jess Phillips</a>, has said.</p> <p>Phillips is reviewing systems, including the Dash (domestic abuse, stalking, harassment and “honour-based” violence) questionnaire, largely relied on by police, social services and healthcare workers across the UK since 2009 to assess risk.</p> <p>Academics and others working in the sector have raised concerns about the 27-question tool, which assesses answers to decide which respondents are deemed high risk so they can be referred to specialist care.</p>    <p>Phillips <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr4e7yrxkgvo">told the BBC’s File on 4</a> that she was reviewing the entire system supporting victims but said it would not change overnight.</p> <p>“My instinct is that the tool doesn’t work, but until I can replace it with something that does, we have to make the very best of the system that we have,” Phillips said.</p> <p>Any risk assessment tool was “only as good as the person who is using it” and people had been killed even when deemed to be at high risk, she said.</p> <p>You can read the full story here:</p> <aside class="element
