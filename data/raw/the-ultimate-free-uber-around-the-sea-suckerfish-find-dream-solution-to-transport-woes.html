<h1>‘The ultimate free Uber around the sea’: suckerfish find dream solution to transport woes</h1>

<p>The clutch of remora fish are holding on tight, but collectively release their grip just as the humpback whale they are riding breaches the surface of the ocean.</p> 
<p>Moments later, everyone is back on board, as the whale re-enters the water, all hurtling together off the coast of south-east Queensland.</p> 
<p>This rare footage of suckerfish was captured by marine scientist Dr Olaf Meynecke from Griffith University using camera tags attached to humpback whales.</p> 
<p>“The remora are able to sense the change in speed and water depth,” he said.</p> 
<p>“It was amazing to see how fast and nimble they were during several different rides with the whales.”</p> 
<p>Remora are long, slender fish that grow between 30-90cm. Instead of a dorsal fin on their backs, remora have a suction disc that they use to attach to larger marine animals, earning them monikers like “sharksucker”, “whalesucker” or “marlinsucker”.</p>

<p>In Australia, there are <a href="https://fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/genus/1296">several species of remora</a>, known to attach to sharks, turtles, whales and dolphins, and occasionally even humans.</p> 
<p>Little is known about them – they are challenging to study, due to their need for speed. But the footage offered fascinating insight, Meynecke said.</p> 
<p>From the whale’s point of view, remora probably increased the total drag, he continued. In return, the hitchhikers likely earned their way by eating parasites and cleaning the whale’s skin.</p> 
<p>The footage seemed to confirm this. Like humans, whales constantly shed dead skin, and in some vision, remora can be seen eating it.</p>

<p>Remora were generally thought to be host-specific, Meynecke said, which meant they remained with the same species all their lives<strong>.</strong></p> 
<p>But the sucker fish sometimes even attach themselves to scuba divers, Prof Culum Brown said, an expert in fish behaviour at Macquarie University, who was not involved in the research.</p> 
<p>Remora’s modified dorsal fin provided the suction and it is “quite a unique little engineering feat,” he said.</p> 
<p>“If they’re pushing themselves up against their host and they wiggle backwards, it actually increases the suction. And if they swim forwards, it decreases the suction.”</p> 
<p>By hitching a ride rather than swimming for themselves, remora gained several advantages, Brown said.</p> 
<p>Aside from enjoying a feast of whale detritus, remora even breathe easier – instead of pumping water across their gills to breathe, they simply open their mouth and enjoy the ride.</p> 
<p>“I think they’re basically cheating the whole system. They’re getting a free ride and a free feed, which is a bit cheeky,” Brown said.</p> 
<p>Whale scientist Dr Vanessa Pirotta, who was not involved with the research, said whales were providing “the ultimate free Uber around the sea”. And remora weren’t the only animals hitching a ride, she said, but barnacles as well.</p> 
<p>“Whales are a vehicle transporting an abundance of marine life throughout their journey. An aspect we often underestimate or simply don’t see,” Meynecke said.</p>
