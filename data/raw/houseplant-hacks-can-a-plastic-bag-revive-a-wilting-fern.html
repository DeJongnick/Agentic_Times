<p><strong>The </strong><strong>problem</strong> <br>Few plants test a person’s patience like ferns. One day they’re full of life; the next they look like tumbleweed left on a radiator. Fern fronds crisp up at the first hint of dry air, and once they turn brown, most think it’s game over.</p> <p><strong>The</strong><strong> hack</strong> <br>Put the plant inside a clear plastic bag – but don’t seal it as it still needs some airflow – and place it in bright but indirect light. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/07/houseplant-clinic-why-is-there-a-chalky-crust-on-my-plants-soil">Houseplant clinic: why is there a chalky crust on my plant’s soil? </a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The Theory</strong><br>The bag creates a mini terrarium, trapping humidity around the plant. Think of it as recreating the rainforest atmosphere – the moist microclimate where ferns thrive. It doesn’t water the plant for you, but it drastically slows down evaporation and encourages fragile new fronds to unfurl.</p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>test</strong> <br>I used this trick on a Boston fern that looked beyond saving. After 10 days in its misty cocoon the soil was still damp and tiny green curls began to appear. By the end of the month, the plant was noticeably thicker and greener.</p> <p><strong>The verdict</strong><strong> </strong><br>This isn’t a miracle cure and you may lose some fronds along the way, but the bag trick can genuinely save a fern on the brink. For zero cost, it’s one of the most effective resuscitation methods out there.</p>
