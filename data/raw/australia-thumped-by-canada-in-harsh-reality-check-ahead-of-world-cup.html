<p>The rise of Australia’s rugby women has been rocked by a clinical Canada in Brisbane, walloped 45-7 by the world No 2 side to crush local hopes of a first Pacific Four title. It extends the Wallaroo’s dismal run against the North Americans to 0-7 in XVs and leaves them plenty to ponder in the three Test lead-in to the World Cup in August.</p> <p>The eight-try trouncing salts the wound of Australia’s shock defeat to Canada in the Sevens semi-final at the 2024 Olympics, where a 12-0 lead at Stade de France imploded into a 22-12 cataclysm. It ended their gold medal dreams and impacted the playoff for bronze, where a late USA try ultimately left the 2016 champions without a medal.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/17/australia-wallaroos-usa-eagles-womens-rugby-union-pacific-four-test-match-report">World Cup buzz grows as steely Australia upstage Ilona Maher’s USA</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But hopes were high those demons could be laid to rest in Brisbane. With an infusion of Sevens stars by coach Jo Yapp, Australia had posted spirited victories over Fijiana and USA this past month. But against the Pacific Four champions – fresh from a 27-all draw with world champs New Zealand – they needed everything to go their way.</p> <p>It didn’t. The kickoff was a disaster with a wicked bounce allowing Canada to regather 10 metres out. Two desperate turnovers by captain Siokapesi Palu kept the Canadians out initially, but a third error in as many minutes let the Red Army roll a maul 30 metres downfield, where prop McKinley Hunt planted the ball over the stripe for 7-0.</p> <p>With blood in the water, Australia’s panic was preyed on. Timid defence and repeat errors was gifting halfback Olivia Apps fast ball to light up Canada’s attack. In the 11th minute DeLeaka Menin burst through loose Wallaroos defence to put Karen Paquin over. A third stolen lineout then sent fullback Julia Schell to the line for 21-0.</p> <p>Australia capitalised on a disallowed visitors try to launch raids down the short side. Again, Sevens convert Charlotte Caslick was the spark. Shifted from wing closer to the action at inside-centre, the 30-year-old was troubling Canada captain Alexandra Tessier with her charges and putting the Red Army on their heels with torrid defence.</p> <p>But the gulf in class between the sides was sobering. Although Canada botched a second try through obstruction in the 39th minute, they shrugged it off to deal the home side a mortal blow on the stroke of halftime, a stolen scrum giving Laetitia Royer a clear path to the line for a fourth try and an ominous 26-0 lead at the break.</p> <p>If there was a glimmer of hope for the Wallaroos, it was that they had fought back from 26 down against New Zealand a fortnight back, holding the Black Ferns to parity in the final 30 minutes to go down fighting by 38-12. Sure enough, they shot from the sheds, a Caitlyn Halse kick winning territory for Adiana Talakai to cross the stripe.</p> <p>Alas, the try was scrubbed for a knock-on in the lead-up. Undaunted, Australia came again, Georgina Friedrichs making the break for Desiree Miller to carry two defenders over the line for 26-7. The “game on” glow lasted three minutes before Canada struck again, fast hands from Apps to her backs putting wing Krissy Scurfield into the corner.</p> <p>Yapp had made five changes to the match-day 23 that defeated USA 27-19 in Canberra last week, including an all-new front row for the second-week running. When veteran centre Alex Tessier cut through to make it a 30-point margin, the coach rang more changes, seeking the alchemy Australia need to win a RWC top-four berth in England. It put starch in the gold line but not enough to stop Julia Omokhuale crossing for 45-7.</p> <p>Although the Wallaroos have improved significantly this season and have one Test against New Zealand and two against Wales to experiment before the RWC pool stages, the dissolution of their set-piece in Brisbane is a major worry. The lineout and scrum were a shambles and Canada dismantled the home side in every department.</p> <p>“Our setpiece was challenged,” Palu said after the loss. “But if we’re to try and take the positives, we’ve grown our depth in the middle.”</p> <p>Canada’s victory leaves them top of the Pacific Four ladder, although New Zealand can wrestle the title away by defeating US and surging past Canada’s on points difference.</p>
