<p>The nine-spine stickleback, <em>Pungitius pungitius</em>, is Britain’s smallest freshwater fish and one of the toughest, able to withstand oxygen-poor water and a variety of temperatures.</p> <p>Like its more numerous cousin, the three-spine stickleback, the males play a significant role in the breeding process. They build a nest and, once the female has laid her eggs, the males protect them from predators.</p> <p>Using their fins, they channel freshwater through the nest to make sure there is a good oxygen supply. When the young hatch, they continue to protect them, herding them together and taking on any creature that tries to eat them.</p> <p>Once the young develop their own spines, parental duties cease and the young are driven away.</p> <p>Considering the fish is only 8cm (3in), defending their young can be a dangerous business. Although their spines lock upright to prevent them being swallowed, they are not as prominent as those of the three-spine variety.</p> <p>The males do not turn red for danger in the breeding season like their larger cousins, only going dark underneath and lighter above.</p> <p>Although they are called nine-spine, they can have anything from eight to 12 spines. They live in ponds, lakes, rivers and estuaries, and are often the first fish to colonise once-polluted waterways. </p>
