 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary: Starling fined £29m; oil prices in spotlight amid Middle East crisis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Starling Bank has been fined £29m by the City watchdog for “shockingly lax” financial crime controls which “left the financial system wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions”.</strong></p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-fines-starling-bank-failings-financial-crime-systems-and-controls">The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said</a> the challenger bank had grown quickly but “measures to tackle financial crime did not keep pace with its growth”.</p> 
  <p>Starling, a UK-based online bank founded in 2014 by entrepreneur Anne Boden, grew rapidly, from 43,000 customers in 2017 to 3.6 million in 2023.</p> 
  <p>Banks are required by law to conduct rigorous checks on new customers to prevent fraud and money laundering.</p> 
  <p>Starling said it “regrets and apologises” for its failings, and has paid the fine as full and final settlement. It added that it had rescreened transactions and reviewed its customer accounts in depth, and introduced additional safeguards.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>US hiring accelerated by more than expected in September, with 143,000 jobs created in the private sector according to employment agency ADP.</strong></p> 
  <p>There was a “widespread rebound after a five-month slowdown” in US job creation, ADP said. </p> 
  <p>The rapid job creation compared with 99,000 new jobs in August, according to ADP’s data. Economists polled by Reuters had expected ADP to report 120,000 new jobs created in September. </p> 
  <p>The ADP numbers are a precursor to the closely followed non-farm payrolls data, which show the pace of job creation in the US economy. The non-farms are vital to the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy judgements, as the central bank considers when to cut interest rates.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Bank of England working on digital assets tech to avoid shift away from central bank money</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Bank of England is working on technology to settle blockchain payments using central bank money in order to prevent a shift to private settlement that could undermine financial stablity, according to a senior official.</strong></p> 
  <p>Sasha Mills, executive director of financial market infrastructure for the Bank, said in a speech on Monday that the Bank was acting to link up the traditional financial sector to digital technologies so that payments continue to be made using central bank money rather than through digital assets such as stablecoins.</p> 
  <p>Stablecoins are a form of cryptocurrency designed to hold value and make payments quicker and cheaper by avoiding the need for a trusted middleman. They can be used to settle transactions, although in practice adoption has been relatively slow because of technical hurdles and waning interest in cryptocurrency from companies and investors. Their reputation has also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/16/qa-the-collapse-of-terra-and-what-it-could-mean-beyond-crypto">suffered after notable collapses</a> that have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/12/stablecoin-tether-breaks-dollar-peg-cryptocurrencies">sparked crypto market turmoil</a>.</p> 
  <p>Nevertheless, Mills said there was a risk that payments could shift “away from central bank money to private settlement assets, weakening financial stability”. She was speaking at Digital Assets Week, a London conference.</p> 
  <p>The Bank this week opened a “digital securities sandbox” alongside the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates financial services firms, to allow companies to test out trading using blockchain technologies. Mills said the regulators had allowed non-sterling assets to be used in the trial after feedback from companies.</p> 
  <p>Mills said there were risks, but also that digital assets could make payments “faster, cheaper, and more straightforward”. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While unbacked crypto grabs the headlines, to me developments in the underlying technologies, including blockchains and programmable ledgers, may be what will have the lasting positive impact on supporting financial markets and growth.</p> 
   <p>We have a low-risk appetite for a significant shift away from wholesale settlement in central bank money towards private settlement assets (such as from the use of stablecoins for wholesale transactions), because settlement in central bank money is the anchor back to the state.</p>

  <p><strong>The FCA was damning on Starling Bank’s leadership under founder Anne Boden, who left the business in May 2023.</strong> </p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Starling’s senior management failed to adequately oversee and monitor the day-to-day compliance […] There were also key failings in the communications between senior management and the staff responsible for the day- to-day implementation.</p>

  <p><strong>Starling’s financial crime controls “failed to keep pace with its growth”, the Financial Conduct Authority said in an official notice detailing its reasons for a £29m fine.</strong></p> 
  <p>The bank put in place a financial sanctions screening framework in 2017. However, its automated screening system had only been screening the names of new and existing customers against “a fraction” of the names on the UK’s consolidated list – resulting in many oversights.</p> 
  <p>The FCA did not say which individuals under sanctions that Starling dealt with, but the regulator noted that it had written to Starling and other banks in February 2022 – as Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine – to remind them of their duties to comply with updated sanctions rules relating to Russia.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starling Bank fined £29m for sanctions breaches</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The UK financial regulator has fined app-based Starling Bank £29m for “shockingly lax” failures related to financial sanctions screening.</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>Financial Conduct Authority</strong> (FCA) said that Starling had reported “multiple potential breaches of financial sanctions” despite its financial checks process being under scrutiny by the regulator.</p> 
  <p>The fine was reduced by 30% from £41m because it agreed to resolve the issues.</p> 
  <p>Starling has grown rapidly as it aims to take on the big high-street lenders with an app-only offering. It is one of several app-only competitors that have started up in the last decade, including rivals such as Monzo and Revolut.</p> 
  <p>However, the rush to grow has caused concerns. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/27/former-minister-accuses-starling-bank-over-covid-loans">Starling Bank was criticised in 2022</a> by a former government minister who claimed it did not run adequate checks on borrowers before handing out taxpayer-backed Covid-19 loans. Starling Bank’s founder, <strong>Anne Boden</strong>, at the time said she was “shocked” by Agnew’s comments, asked the former minister to withdraw his statements, and said the bank was one of the “most active and effective banks fighting fraud”.</p> 
  <p>Yet as far back as 2021 the FCA had “identified serious concerns with the anti-money laundering and sanctions framework” at the bank.</p> 
  <p>Starling agreed to regulatory restrictions preventing it from opening new accounts for high-risk customers until it improved, but the FCA said that it failed to comply and opened over 54,000 accounts for 49,000 high-risk customers between September 2021 and November 2023.</p> 
  <p><strong>Therese Chambers</strong>, the <strong>FCA</strong>’s joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Starling’s financial sanction screening controls were shockingly lax. It left the financial system wide open to criminals and those subject to sanctions. It compounded this by failing to properly comply with FCA requirements it had agreed to, which were put in place to lower the risk of Starling facilitating financial crime.</p>

  <p><strong>Bert Colijn</strong>, chief economist at <strong>ING</strong>, a Dutch investment bank, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The unemployment rate remains at the lowest level recorded since the eurozone began in 1999. The low rate remains remarkable given the sluggish economic environment that the eurozone has been in since late 2022. But labour demand remains high despite a weak economic environment.

 <h2 class="block-title">Israel 'could target Iran oil facilities' in retaliation for missile attack</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Israel could target Iranian oil refineries in retaliation for Tuesday night’s attack, in which Tehran launched an estimated 180 ballistic missiles at Tel Aviv and other targets across the country in a dramatic escalation of the conflict between the two countries<em>, write the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont and Andrew Roth</em>.</p> 
  <p>The US website Axios has reported that Israeli officials are considering a “significant retaliation” to the Iranian attack within days that could target oil production facilities inside <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> and other strategic sites.</p> 
  <p>US lawmakers have backed a strike against Iranian oil production. Sen Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said he would “urge the Biden administration to coordinate an overwhelming response with Israel, starting with Iran’s ability to refine oil”. In a statement, he said Iran’s oil refineries should be “hit and hit hard”.</p>

  <p>Iran’s oil is sanctioned by the USA, so it does not directly reach the US or its allies (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/25/the-trade-in-sanctioned-oil-is-booming-as-the-us-turns-a-blind-eye">indirectly is another matter</a>). However, there are plenty of other non-allied countries who are willing to buy it, so any disruption to Iranian oil supplies would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/apr/15/what-next-oil-prices-iran-israel-middle-east">probably impact the global market and raise prices</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Shipping company Maersk has said that it is continuing to send ships to Beirut, despite the incursion of Israeli troops into Lebanon and the heavy bombardment of its capital.</strong></p> 
  <p>“While Maersk’s business in the country is impacted, we currently remain in a position to serve our customers,” a Maersk spokesperson said in an email reported by Reuters.</p> 
  <p>Beirut’s port handled 827,000 twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) shipping containers in 2023. That does not put it in the ranks of the biggest ports in the Mediterranean, but does make it a vital trade artery for Lebanon.</p> 
  <p>Lebanon has been struggling with economic crisis for several years.

 <h2 class="block-title">Saudi Arabia reportedly said oil prices could drop to $50 per barrel</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Oil prices may be up today, but Saudi Arabia is warning that prices could fall as low as $50 per barrel, the Wall Street Journal reports.</strong></p> 
  <p>The reported comments came ahead of an online meeting on Wednesday of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, an oil cartel described as Opec+ that controls a large proportion of global supplies.</p> 
  <p>Before the escalation of the Middle Eastern crisis, oil prices had been on a downward path for weeks – and prices are well below the $90 per barrel level a year ago despite the conflict.</p> 
  <p>The Saudi energy minister warned other Opec+ members that they should comply with production cuts to avoid further price drops. The Wall Street Journal reported:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>During a conference call last week, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the oil minister of OPEC kingmaker Saudi Arabia, warned fellow producers prices could drop to $50 a barrel if they don’t comply with agreed production cuts, according to OPEC delegates who attended the call.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Falling oil prices would help consumers after several years of inflation – and it could help Kamala Harris in her effort to defeat Donald Trump in the US presidential election. However, oil producers – with Saudi Arabia as the biggest – want to sustain prices.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">AO World agrees £10m takeover of phone reseller musicMagpie (after £200m listing)</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>One share price that has surged on Wednesday is that of musicMagpie. The second-hand smartphone seller is up 48% after retailer AO World agreed a takeover.</strong></p> 
  <p>But it is hardly a happy ending for musicMagpie, which started out as a reseller of CDs and DVDs. It listed shares in 2021 with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/16/musicmagpie-plans-208m-flotation-on-london-stock-market">a heady £200m+ valuation</a> (netting chief executive and co-founder Steve Oliver £12m in the process). But the 9.07p-per-share takeover values the company at only £10m three years later.</p> 
  <p>As any buyer of second-hand electronics knows, you have to be careful what you pay for. Investors in musicMagpie bought in during the coronavirus pandemic boom in tech sales. Shortages of computer chips meant that electronic devices were hard to come by, which helped resellers.</p> 
  <p>However, that boom had petered out by early 2022, and musicMagpie’s share price slumped as it turned lossmaking.</p> 
  <p>It has had some interest since, notably with BT Group last year considered a bid to complement its EE mobile network business, which also sells electronics. But its share price was at 5.75p on Tuesday before the takeover was announced – 97% down from the heights above £2 in April 2021.</p> 
  <p>The directors of musicMagpie unanimously backed the takeover.</p> 
  <p><strong>John Roberts</strong>, <strong>AO</strong>’s chief executive, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>To achieve our strategic ambition of becoming the destination for electricals, it is crucial for AO to enhance its consumer tech offering. A top-tier trade-in service will be essential, and musicMagpie represents a significant enabler in unlocking value through our reverse supply chain.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The biggest share price drop on the FTSE 100 this morning is trainer and clothing retailer JD Sports. It is down by 3.6% on Wednesday morning.</strong></p> 
  <p>UK business has been hit by falling sales after disruption in the Red Sea stalled deliveries and the cold wet spring reduced demand for camping kit and clothing.</p> 
  <p>The retail group, which owns Millets and Blacks in the UK, said sales at the outdoor kit chain were down 5.3% in the six months to 3 August as “key product lines” had been delayed by <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/article/2024/jun/15/houthi-attack-forces-crew-to-abandon-coal-carrier-in-red-sea">Houthi attacks off Yemen</a> delaying or rerouting shipping and the early date of Easter fell outside the camping season for the first time since 2018.</p> 
  <p>It said poor weather compounded the issue, reducing demand for seasonal outdoor living product such as tents and camping equipment.</p> 
  <p>The chilly wet weather also hit the group’s main JD sportswear chain in the UK where sales at established stores were down 4.6% in what the group described as a “challenging and often volatile UK market”.</p> 
  <p>JD said discounting in the market had surged after “unfavourable spring and early summer weather conditions, dampened footfall and full price demand for seasonal [clothing]”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Oil prices rise as investors await Israeli response to Iran missile attacks</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets.</strong></p> 
  <p>Oil prices rose on Wednesday morning as investors around the world weighed the risk of threats to energy supplies after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-vows-to-retaliate-after-iran-launches-unprecedented-missile-attack">Iran’s missile attack on Israel</a> threatened to escalate the Middle East conflict.</p> 
  <p>The price of Brent crude oil futures, the North Sea benchmark, rose by 1.6% to $74.75, while the price of futures for its North American counterpart, West Texas Intermediate, rose by 1.7% to $70.98.</p> 
  <p>Prices surged on Tuesday as reports of Iran’s imminent attack emerged. The attack was a response to Israel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/28/israel-says-it-has-killed-hezbollah-leader-hassan-nasrallah">killing last week of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah</a>, the leader of Lebanon’s powerful militant group, Hezbollah. Hezbollah is widely seen as an Iranian proxy, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/01/israel-order-evacuation-southern-lebanon-border-villages-incursion">Israeli troops have moved into Lebanon</a>.</p> 
  <p>Brent crude prices rose by 3.8%, after the largest intra-day move since April 2023, according to analysts led by <strong>Jim Reid</strong> at <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>. They wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There were some indications that escalation risks might be higher this time around. The Pentagon said that this attack used around twice as many ballistic missiles as the one in April, while Iranian commentary was more ambiguous on whether the attack would be one-off.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Most <strong>Asian stock markets outside China</strong> slumped on Wednesday morning, following the lead of US indices the night before. Japan’s Nikkei slumped by 2.2%, South Korea’s Kospi fell by 0.6%, and Australia’s ASX 200 index fell by 0.1%.</p> 
  <p>However, <strong>Hong Kong’s stock market</strong> soared by 6% amid Beijing’s stimulus, which has pushed up Chinese stocks. The mainland Chinese stock markets were closed for the Golden Week holiday.</p> 
  <p>Investors are now considering whether Israel will respond directly to Iran, while Israeli forces continued to strike Beirut, Lebanon’s capital. Israel has also been fighting in Gaza, to its west, for almost a year after the attacks by Hamas on 7 October.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mohit Kumar</strong>, chief economist for Europe at <strong>Jefferies</strong>, an investment bank, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Risk off dominated the markets on escalation in the Middle East. Oil moved higher on geopolitical risks. Markets did stabilise after the initial risk off and investors now wait for the response from Israel.</p>
