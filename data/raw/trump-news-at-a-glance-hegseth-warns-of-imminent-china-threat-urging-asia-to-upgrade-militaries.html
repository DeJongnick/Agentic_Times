The threat China poses is real, and it could be imminent.”</p>  <h2>‘Deterrence doesn’t come on the cheap’</h2>  <p>Hesgeth said Donald Trump’s administration had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/31/new-era-of-threat-amid-changing-face-of-war-uk-defence-review-to-warn">pushed European countries to boost their defensive spending</a>, taking on a greater “burden” of responding to conflicts in their region, and it was time for Asian nations to do the same.</p> <p>The defense secretary, who in March was revealed to have told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/25/stunning-signal-leak-reveals-depths-of-trump-administrations-loathing-of-europe">a Signal group chat that Europe was “pathetic” and “freeloading”</a> on US security support in the region, told the Singapore conference it was “hard to believe” he was now saying this but Asian countries should “look to allies in Europe as a newfound example”.</p> <p>“Deterrence doesn’t come on the cheap … time is of the essence.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/31/pete-hegseth-calls-on-asia-to-boost-military-spending-in-face-of-imminent-threat-from-china-us-defence-secretary"><sup>Read the full story</sup></a></p> <h2>Georgia shows the effects of Trump tariffs</h2>  <p>If you want a bellwether to measure the broad impact of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">tariffs</a> on the economy, look to the state of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia">Georgia</a>.</p> <p>So far, it’s a mixed bag.
