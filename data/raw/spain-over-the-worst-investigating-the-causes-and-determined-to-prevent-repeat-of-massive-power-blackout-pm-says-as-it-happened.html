  <p>He said that the <strong>investigations as to the causes of the blackout were ongoing</strong>, as he promised to get to the bottom of the outage and to implement necessary reforms to prevent it in the future.</p> 
  <p>The government has <strong>set up a commission to investigate the incident,</strong> he said, and will also look at the role of private energy companies.</p> 
  <p>Reuters reported that Sánchez also ruled out he possibility that an excess of electricity generated by renewable sources caused the outage.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">EU to consider lessons learned from Spanish, Portuguese outage</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>EU “will be looking into the lessons learned”</strong> from the blackout in Spain and Portugal to prevent a similar outage elsewhere in Europe, an EU spokesperson said.</p> 
  <p>Speaking at the daily press briefing, the European Commission chief spokesperson <strong>Paula Pinho</strong> said the cut was “of un precedented magnitude” and assured that the bloc will “obviously draw the necessary conclusions, and share them, and, if necessary, take the necessary action.”</p> 
  <p>“We look very closely into what were the reasons, how well were we prepared, and what are the lessons that can be drawn from such an incident. This will definitely keep all these actors busy in the coming days and weeks,” she said.</p> 
  <p>Pinho said the EU was still awaiting full assessment by Spain as to the causes, as she declined to comment on speculations whether the use of renewable power could contribute to the outage.</p> 
  <p>Pinho also called out mis- and disinformation circulating online yesterday, including an article featuring a made-up quote falsely attributed to commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.</p> 
  <p>Separately, commission spokesperson on preparedness, <strong>Eva Hrncirova</strong>, added that the Spanish and Portuguese operators are “well experience in handling high volumes of renewables in their electricity system.”</p> 
  <p>Hrncirova was also asked about the EU’s recent call for Europeans to step up their preparations for any disruptions, as she said “it applies to many situations in life, being prepared is better than being badly surprised.” </p>

  <p><strong>Portugal’s</strong> government on <strong>ruled out a cyber-attack as the cause of a sweeping blackout across the Iberian Peninsula</strong> the previous day, after Spain’s grid operator said it reached the same conclusion, AFP reported.</p>

  <p>While the system weathered the first event, it could not cope with the second. Prieto said the problem had originated in southwest Spain, which is where much of the country’s solar energy is generated.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Lights flickered back to life across most of <strong>Spain</strong> and <strong>Portugal</strong> after a massive blackout hit the Iberian peninsula, stranding passengers in trains and elevators while millions lost phone and internet coverage.</p> 
  <p>As of Tuesday morning, both Spain and Portugal reported power supplies <strong>almost back to normal</strong> with the network stabilised after <strong>the largest power cut in Europe’s recent history.</strong></p> 
  <p>On Monday night, many went to bed in darkness, while others posted videos online celebrating the gradual return of power after many hours off-grid.</p> 
  <p>But for a continent so willing to talk up its efforts on energy security – with many leaders attending a high-level summit on this only last week – there will be <strong>many persistent questions that need urgent answers.</strong></p> 
  <p>How do you so easily get a blackout affecting some 60 million people? What caused it? And, crucially, <strong>can it be prevented from happening at this – or larger – scale ever again?</strong></p> 
  <p>Many will also study the <strong>mis- and disinformation on the causes or the culprits behind the blackout that managed to get traction during the blackout</strong>, with both Spanish and Portuguese governments forced to issue direct warning against speculations and reports online.</p> 
  <p>Despite the energy back on this morning, the disruption is likely to remain for a bit longer, as trains and planes are out of position and other processes are disrupted.</p> 
  <p>I will bring you all the latest.</p>
