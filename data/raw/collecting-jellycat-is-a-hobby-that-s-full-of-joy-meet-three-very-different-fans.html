<p>When passers-by saw an excited queue of people snaking around a department store in Birmingham earlier this year, they might have been forgiven for assuming they were waiting for a celebrity book signing or long-awaited sneaker drop.</p> <p>Instead, these diehard fans were waiting to get their eager hands on <a href="https://jellycat.com/albee-bee/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=the+guardian+jellycat" rel="nofollow">Albee Bee</a> and the latest <a href="https://jellycat.com/shop/?search=blossom+bunny?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=the+guardian+jellycat" rel="nofollow">Blossom Bunny</a> – two of the Loveables from Jellycat’s spring 2025 collection.</p> <p>The last few years have seen a huge surge in the popularity of these adorable characters: soft, velvety and packed with personality, Jellycat have become much-loved companions for collectors young and old.</p> <p>One of the devotees you’d have spotted in the queue in Birmingham was Nirah Shaheen, 24, who has been collecting Jellycat for more than a year.</p> <p>“My first-ever Jellycat was a <a href="https://jellycat.com/bashful-moss-bunny/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=the+guardian+jellycat" rel="nofollow">Bashful Moss Bunny</a>,” says Shaheen, a cybersecurity graduate from Birmingham. “I thought a green rabbit was pretty unusual, but when we saw him in a shop in Solihull the friend I was with said: ‘This bunny is you in a nutshell!’</p> <p>“I love gardening and nature, and it felt like Moss encapsulated that – I also thought he’d be a lovely reminder of being carefree at university and the last few summers spent in the garden.</p> <p>“From then on, I started collecting Jellycat to keep hold of important moments in my life. For me, they’re not just soft toys – they represent milestones in my life, and a way of unwinding from everyday stresses.”</p>    <p>So far, Shaheen has amassed an impressive collection of more than 100 Jellycat characters.</p> <p>“Posting <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nirahsjellycats" rel="nofollow">Jellycat content on TikTok</a> has helped me build my confidence,” she says. “When lockdown hit when I was at university, my social skills took a knock. Since then, meeting other Jellycat fans at special events and chatting to them about new launches has really helped me. Whatever your age, the Jellycat community is always welcoming.”</p> <p>You don’t have to look far to find members of this thriving community. Search social media for signs of Jellycat joy, and you’ll find 2.4 million followers of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jellycat/?hl=en" rel="nofollow">official Jellycat Instagram page</a>, and dozens of accounts dedicated to fans’ Jellycat collections – including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jellycatsmakeyousmile" rel="nofollow">@jellycatsmakeyousmile</a>, created by foster carer Beverley Adamson, 66.</p> <p>“My daughter Liz has been collecting Jellycat for many years, and although I could see how much pleasure she got from them, I honestly thought she was a bit crazy,” says Adamson, from Derbyshire. “But then last September, she bought me a <a href="https://jellycat.com/burly-boo-sheep/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=the+guardian+jellycat" rel="nofollow">Burly Boo Sheep </a>for my birthday, followed by several more Jellycat. I started buying them for myself too, and now I don‘t want to stop.”</p> <p>A year on, Adamson has a collection of about 300 – “although I haven’t counted them recently” – and is a passionate member of the Jellycat fandom.</p>    <p>“Collecting Jellycat is a hobby that’s full of joy – only Jellycat could make an onion look cute,” she says. “Everyone in the community is so supportive, non-judgmental and kind, and the whole family loves Jellycat now.</p> <p>“My husband Sam and I are full-time foster carers for a 15-year-old, who has Dravet syndrome – he loves arranging my collection, and it’s something we can do together. Because Jellycat are meant to be cuddled, I share the joy with my five grandchildren, and even Sam has become interested.</p> <p>“He made me buy <a href="https://jellycat.com/ramonda-ostrich/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=the+guardian+jellycat" rel="nofollow">Ramonda Ostrich</a> in a shop because he felt sorry for her – he thought she looked sad, sitting there in a glass cupboard. Which she did!”</p> <p>Committed Jellycat lovers are prepared to travel across the UK and beyond to track down their favourite characters. In October, a Jellycat Airlines pop-up in London was inundated with collectors, all keen to encounter luggage carousels and aeroplane cabins filled with bestselling characters.</p> <p>Those fans who are happy to go the distance for their Jellycat cravings include mechanic Alana Balfour and her partner Jordan Powell, who run a business servicing and repairing performance cars in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire.</p> <p>The couple’s collection began in 2022, when Balfour’s mother bought her a plant from the Silly Succulent range.</p> <p>“She wanted to buy me a plant I couldn’t kill for my office, and that was the start of my collecting,” says Balfour, 28, from South Lanarkshire. “It was a lone venture until Jordan got involved, but now I’ve got around 250 characters, while Jordan has 40 of his own.</p> <p>“About once a month, we’ll travel around Scotland in our campervan – which is seasonally decorated in Jellycat, of course – basing our route on where we’ll find stockists. We also make a seven-hour trip every month to our favourite shop to find retired Jellycat treasures.”</p> <p>Balfour credits the characters with helping her through a difficult time in her life. “I love the comfort of Jellycat – they make me feel safe, and speak to my inner child,” she says. “In 2023 I found out I’m autistic, which was a bit of a shock. But having some cuddly Jellycat companions on my journey of acceptance has actually made it easier. And now? It’s fair to say I’m obsessed …”</p> <p><em>Discover the irresistible world of Jellycat – where you’ll find cuddly friends in all shapes and sizes ready to steal your heart. <a href="https://jellycat.com/?utm_source=theguardian&amp;utm_me%20dium=affiliates&amp;utm_campaign=the+guardian+jellycat" rel="nofollow">Take a look at the very latest</a></em></p>
