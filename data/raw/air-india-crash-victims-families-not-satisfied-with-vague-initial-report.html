<p>Families of the Air India crash victims have said they are hoping for more answers from investigators after a report found the plane’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/11/engine-fuel-switches-cut-off-before-air-india-crash-that-killed-260-report-finds">fuel switches were cut off</a>, deepening the mystery of what happened.</p> <p>The preliminary report from India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, published on Friday, said both of the plane’s fuel switches moved to the cut-off position immediately after takeoff, stopping fuel supply to the engines.</p> <p>“In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut off. The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report reads.</p> <p>The London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed into a medical college shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad airport on 12 June, killing 241 people on board.</p> <p>Another 19 people died on the ground and 67 were seriously injured.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/indiacrash-zip/giv-325544mEDVZd2eVnH/" > <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/indiacrash-zip/giv-325544mEDVZd2eVnH/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The cousin of sisters Dhir and Heer Baxi, who were flying home to London after surprising their grandmother for her birthday and died in the crash, said he was not satisfied by the report.</p> <p>Ishan Baxi, who lives in Ahmedabad, said: “We’re still hoping for a more transparent and honest investigation that doesn’t shy away from addressing possible mechanical flaws or lapses in protocol to avoid future potential accidents.</p> <p>“I just hope the final report brings full clarity on what exactly failed and who’s accountable. It shouldn’t hide behind vague terms.</p> <p>“More than anything, it should push for real changes so this never happens again.”</p> <p>Relatives of Akeel Nanabawa, his wife, Hannaa Vorajee, and their four-year-old daughter, Sara Nanabawa, who died in the crash, said in a statement that the report was “the first stepping stone” and that the family were still “working our way through the weight of our loss”.</p> <p>“Moving forwards, we require honesty, transparency and an unwavering commitment to uncovering the full truth,” they said.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/dreamliner-cockpit/giv-32554JxvgmtPctN7f/" > <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/dreamliner-cockpit/giv-32554JxvgmtPctN7f/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“We seek justice and answers, both of which are essential for us to find any sense of closure. We accept God’s fate, but knowing what happened will help ease our hearts and allow us to begin the long journey of healing.</p> <p>“Above all, we hope that by pursuing the truth, no other family will ever have to endure the shock, uncertainty, and profound sorrow that we have lived through this past month.”</p> <p>A lawyer advising some of the families affected by the crash said the findings were deeply concerning.</p> <p>Demetrius Danas, an aviation lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: “We’re continuing to speak with and advise families who’ve been affected by the Air India crash. Understandably, all they want is to be provided with answers.”</p> <p>Fifty-two British nationals were killed, making it one of the deadliest plane crashes in terms of the number of British fatalities.</p> <p>The preliminary report says all crew members were breathalysed on their arrival at Ahmedabad airport and found to be “fit to operate the flight”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/12/why-did-he-cut-off-what-has-the-report-on-air-india-flight-171-found">‘Why did he cut off?’: what the report on the Air India Flight 171 crash found</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No significant bird activity was detected near the flight path and the aircraft started to lose altitude before crossing the airport perimeter wall.</p> <p>Investigators have identified “components of interest for further examinations”, the report says.</p> <p>Fuel samples taken from tanks used to refuel the aircraft were “satisfactory”.</p> <p>The UK transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said on Sunday that she had confidence in the investigation. “We stand ready to assist the Indian authorities if they require that from us,” she said.</p> <p>Asked whether she thought Indian authorities were doing a good job getting to the bottom of the causes of the crash, she said: “On the basis of what I have seen so far, yes, but we do stand ready to provide any assistance.
