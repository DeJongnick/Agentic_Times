<p>Australian-made animated series Bluey was the most streamed show in the US in 2024, topping Nielsen’s annual year-end streaming charts, released this week.</p> <p>US viewers watched 55.62bn minutes of the 7-minute show on Disney+ according to Nielsen’s reporting, just shy of the all-time yearly record of 57.7bn minutes set by Suits in 2023.</p> <p>The Nielsen numbers cap a massive year for Bluey, which never fell off the top ten on streaming charts and ended 2024 by announcing a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/18/australian-childrens-television-sensation-bluey-to-be-turned-into-movie">full-length movie</a>, due to hit cinemas in 2027.</p> <p>It was bittersweet news for fans, with the show’s creator, Brisbane animator Joe Brumm, <a href="https://www.bluey.tv/blog/a-letter-from-joe-brumm/">revealing in a blogpost</a> soon after the announcement that while he would write and direct the movie adaptation, he was stepping away from the TV series. A fourth season has yet to be announced, but when questioned about the show’s future last April, Bluey producer Sam Moor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “It is not the end for Bluey. I’m sure we have many more surprises in store for you.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for ABC (who originally co-commissioned the series with BBC, and who is the Australian streamer) also confirmed: “We have no plans to end the show.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/dec/21/bluey-fans-fearful-and-excited-for-future-of-childrens-cartoon">‘It will exist for ever’: Bluey fans fearful and excited for cartoon’s future</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A fair chunk of Bluey’s extraordinary 2024 streaming numbers can be attributed to its hugely popular season three finale <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/apr/13/paradigm-shattering-blueys-biggest-episode-ever-is-packed-with-magic">The Sign</a>, a 28-minute special episode released in April. According to Disney+, the Sign drew 10.4m views globally in its first seven days of availability, making it the most-viewed Disney Junior episode premiere ever.</p> <p>The storyline, in which the family of blue heelers prepare for the wedding of Uncle Rad while struggling with the decision to sell their home and move to another city, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/commentisfree/2024/apr/16/blueys-blockbuster-episode-hit-a-nerve-for-my-family-by-casting-moving-house-as-difficult-and-scary">captured the hearts of parents and kids</a>. In Australia, it even spawned three special-edition <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/article/2024/jun/05/bluey-coins-royal-australian-mint-release-1-dollar">Bluey-themed $1 coins</a>.</p> <p>Bluey’s Nielsen numbers reflect a broader trend in streaming: the dominance of “library series”. As in 2023, the top 10 titles in Nielsen’s 2024 year-end chart are all long-running shows with huge back catalogues. Grey’s Anatomy finished second with 47.85bn minutes, with other top 10 contenders including Family Guy, NCIS and Law &amp; Order: SVU.</p> <p>The Netflix series Bridgerton was the top original series of 2024, with 21.42bn minutes of viewing, concentrated around the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/streaming-ratings-the-boys-house-of-the-dragon-return-to-charts-1235946573/">release of season three</a> in May and June. Prime Video’s Fallout, with 11.95bn minutes, was the top new series.</p>
