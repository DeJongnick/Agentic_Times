<p>The third British victim of the Lisbon funicular crash has been named by Welsh police as Andrew David Kenneth Young, 82, a transport enthusiast from Holyhead.</p> <p>Young was among 16 people who died when the Elevador da Glória, a popular tourist attraction, derailed in the centre of the Portuguese capital on Wednesday.</p> <p>A further 21 people were injured, including five seriously, and the Portuguese authorities have said the crash was probably caused by a problem with a cable connecting the streetcar’s two cabins.</p> <p>Young’s “final moments were in pursuit of the hobby which gave him so much happiness”, his family said.</p> <p>In a statement issued by North Wales police, his relatives said: “Andrew David Kenneth Young was known to most as Dave. He was raised in Auchterarder, Perthshire. He moved to Holyhead in 1980 where he had a long career as a customs officer.</p> <p>“A lifelong transport enthusiast, in retirement he enjoyed visiting heritage railways and tramways around the world. It is a comfort to his sons, their mother, and his brothers that his final moments were in pursuit of the hobby which gave him so much happiness.”</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/06/british-couple-killed-in-lisbon-funicular-crash-named">other British victims have been named as</a> the theatre director Kayleigh Smith, 36, and her partner Will Nelson, 44, a lecturer at Manchester’s Arden School of Theatre.</p> <p>Also among the dead were five Portuguese nationals, two Canadians, two South Koreans, one American, one French, one Swiss and one Ukrainian.</p> <p>Portugal’s Office for Air and Rail Accident Investigations on Saturday released its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/06/lisbon-funicular-cable-disconnected-before-deadly-crash-report-finds">first investigative report</a> into the crash, which said the cabins had travelled “not more than about six metres” when they “suddenly lost the balancing force provided by the cable connecting them”.</p> <p>The report said an examination of the wreckage showed “the connecting cable had given way” at the attachment point to the cabin at the top of the hill.</p> <p>A preliminary and final report are expected to be published later.</p> <p>Lisbon’s city council has tasked a team of experts with designing a new mechanism to ensure the safety of the Glória funicular railway, a city official said on Monday.</p> <p>“We must guarantee maximum security,” the council’s vice-president, Filipe Anacoreta Correia, said, adding that the country needed to be reassured over safety before the cable car could reopen.</p> <p>The group will include technicians from the municipal public transport company Carris, which operates the funicular, and experts from universities, Portugal’s engineering regulatory organisation, and national civil engineering laboratory LNEC, Correia added.</p> <p>During an extraordinary meeting, the council also voted to give the expert team the final say on when it was safe to resume the funicular’s operation.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Reuters</em></p>
