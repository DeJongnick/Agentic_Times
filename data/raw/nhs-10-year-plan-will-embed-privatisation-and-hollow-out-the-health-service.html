<p>Your editorial states that the government will be judged on the state of the NHS (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/22/the-guardian-view-on-labours-nhs-reforms-where-is-the-plan-to-deliver-them">The Guardian view on Labour’s NHS reforms: where is the plan to deliver them?, 22 September</a>). It is a pity that it doesn’t also consider the risks to the future of the NHS posed by the&nbsp;10-year health plan, which shifts outpatients from publicly owned hospitals to public-private-funded neighbourhood health centres and commits to contracting&nbsp;out NHS services, embedding privatisation.</p> <p>Those who feel relaxed about the use of the private sector to deliver NHS care should note the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/10/eye-doctors-say-private-cataract-operations-have-hurt-the-nhs">devastating impact it is having on NHS eye care</a> and the <a href="https://www.chpi.org.uk/reports/out-of-sight-the-hidden-profits-and-conflicts-of-interest-at-behind-the-outsourcing-of-nhs-cataract-care">research by the Centre for Health and the Public Interest</a> showing that on average £1&nbsp;in every £3 that the NHS pays for a cataract operations leaks out in the form of profit. They should also heed the warnings implicit in Sam&nbsp;Freedman’s book <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/02/failed-state-by-sam-freedman-review-how-to-fix-britain">Failed State: Why Nothing Works and How We Fix It</a>: in 1979, 64% of social care beds were provided by the state, but by&nbsp;2012, it was 6%. Clearly, contracting out leads to a loss of state capacity to deliver.</p> <p>There are real fears that the NHS will be hollowed out and share the same fate as social care: something that everyone wants to be there should they need it, but which the&nbsp;state no longer has the means&nbsp;–&nbsp;or will – to deliver.<br><strong>Margaret Greenwood</strong><br><em>Former MP for Wirral West</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
