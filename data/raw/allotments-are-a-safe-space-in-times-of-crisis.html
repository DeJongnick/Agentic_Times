<p>As a former allotment holder in Glasgow, I read Robin&nbsp;Tyne’s article with empathy (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/02/search-for-glasgow-allotment">‘I joined every list’: the gruelling search for a Glasgow allotment, 2 September</a>). I too joined every waiting list in Glasgow before I&nbsp;became a plotholder. There are not enough allotments in Glasgow and indeed across the UK. While the company Roots and other private allotments have a place, they can never be a replacement for local authority ones. Under the 2015 Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act, Scottish local authorities have a duty to provide allotments. We need to find more space in our cities for them – spaces that have been proven to improve mental and physical health, at an affordable&nbsp;price.</p> <p>In 1932, the <a href="http://goodfoodforall.co.uk/communal-gardening-and-social-action-in-scotland">Scottish allotment scheme for the unemployed</a> was created. Plots were provided, as well as grants for seeds and tools. The scheme was not just to provide a place for growing food but also seen as preventing a mental health crisis, even though that would not have been said at the time. Plots were found on existing allotment sites, but the scheme also&nbsp;worked with local authorities to create&nbsp;new&nbsp;sites.</p> <p>We call on allotments in times of crisis, and I believe our plot got me, my husband and our baby through the Covid lockdowns. It gave us a safe outside place beyond our flat&nbsp;to go to. </p> <p>The value of allotments needs to be recognised by the government. If we could find extra land in the 1930s, surely we can do it now without the need of&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;companies.<br><strong>Dr Hannah Connelly</strong><br><em>Hull</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
