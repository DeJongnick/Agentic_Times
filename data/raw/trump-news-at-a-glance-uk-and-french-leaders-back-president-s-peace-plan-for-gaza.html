<p>Some of America’s key allies have backed Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, after the president and the Israeli prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, delivered an ultimatum to Hamas, warning the militant group to accept their 20-point plan or face the consequences.</p> <p>UK prime minister Keir Starmer has called on Hamas, to “agree to the plan and end the misery, by laying down their arms and releasing all remaining hostages”. French president Emmanuel Macron said “France stands ready to contribute” to the efforts to end the war.</p> <p>Trump and Netanyahu have hailed their proposal as a historic breakthrough and new chapter for the Middle East, but it was clear that Hamas had not been consulted and its position on the terms remained uncertain.</p>  <h2>Trump and Netanyahu to Hamas: accept Gaza peace plan or face consequences</h2>  <p>Both Trump and Netanyahu made clear that they were not offering Hamas a choice in the matter. If the group refused, Trump told reporters, “Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas”.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister said ominously: “If Hamas rejects your plan, Mr President, or if they supposedly accept it and then do everything to counter it, then Israel will finish the job by itself. This can be done the easy way or it can be done the hard way, but it will be done.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/trump-netanyahu-gaza-peace-plan"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump talks with Democrats fail to yield breakthrough as US shutdown nears</h2>  <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/28/democrats-government-shutdown-republican-healthcare-cuts">high-stakes meeting</a> between Donald Trump and top congressional Democrats on Monday resulted in no apparent breakthrough in negotiations to keep the government open, with JD Vance declaring afterwards: “I think we are headed into a shutdown.”</p> <p>Democrats, who are refusing to support the GOP’s legislation to continue funding beyond Tuesday unless it includes several healthcare provisions, struck a more optimistic tone after the Oval Office encounter, which also included the Republican leaders of the Senate and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">House of Representatives</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/trump-meeting-democrats-republicans-shutdown-tensions"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Portland braces for deployment of 200 national guard troops to city</h2>  <p>Portland is bracing for the deployment of 200 national guard troops as Donald Trump moves ahead with plans to bring the US military into another Democratic-run city.
