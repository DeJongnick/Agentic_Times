Since 2022, efforts to limit the spread of bird flu have led to the slaughter of more than 145m chickens, turkeys and other birds, causing the price of eggs to jump. In 2024, egg prices rose <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-a-deadly-strain-of-bird-flu-is-making-egg-prices-soar-nationwide">65%</a> and then another <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/egg-prices-bird-flu-inflation-stores-limit-purchases/">15%</a> in the month of January alone.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/15/musk-doge-bird-flu-pandemic">Musk’s takeover of US health agencies raises pandemic threat, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The USDA’s mistaken firings come as other federal agencies experience heavy job losses related to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/trump-buyout-federal-workers">voluntary buyout scheme</a> and the firing of probationary employees, both carried out by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>.</p> <p>It terminated 1,165 workers at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/trump-nih-funding-scientists">National Institutes of Health</a> (NIH) on Sunday, Reuters reported.
