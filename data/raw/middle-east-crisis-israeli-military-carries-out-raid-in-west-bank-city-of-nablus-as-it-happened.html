In recent weeks, images of starving Palestinians in Gaza, including children, have shocked the world and fuelled criticism of Israel over the worsening conditions.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Hamas on Tuesday rejected an Israeli statement saying a strike on a Gaza hospital that killed several journalists was aimed at a camera operated by the militant group, calling the accusation “baseless”. </strong>The Israeli military on Tuesday said its forces were targeting a camera operated by Hamas in two strikes that killed five journalists at a hospital a day earlier, triggering a wave of international condemnation. <strong>Monday’s strike in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis killed at least 20 people,</strong> including the five reporters who worked for Al Jazeera, the Associated Press and Reuters, among other outlets.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hamas denied on Tuesday that any of the Palestinians killed in Israel’s attack on Gaza’s Nasser hospital on Monday were militants. </strong>Earlier, Israel said it had killed six militants in the attack but it was investigating how civilians, including five journalists, were killed. “We can confirm that the Reuters and AP journalists were not a target of the strike,” military spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani told Reuters on Tuesday. </p></li> <li><p><strong>The UN has demanded that Israel’s investigations into unlawful killings in Gaza, including its “double tap” bombing of Nasser hospital, yield results and ensure accountability.</strong> “There needs to be justice,” Thameen Al-Kheetan, the spokesperson for the UN’s human rights office, told reporters on Tuesday in Geneva. He added that the number of journalists killed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> raised many questions about the targeting of media workers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Tens of thousands of people took part in demonstrations across Israel on Tuesday, blocking highways on a “day of disruption” that aimed to push Benjamin Netanyahu into agreeing a deal to end the war and calling off plans to attack Gaza City. </strong>Relatives of hostages led the biggest march and rally in Tel Aviv, while in Jerusalem hundreds of people gathered outside the prime minister’s office as the security cabinet met to discuss the war. There were dozens of other protests around the country, including on the main highway to the northern city of Haifa and inside Ben Gurion airport.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israeli forces raided the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah on Tuesday, targeting a currency exchange and, according to the Red Crescent, leaving dozens of Palestinians wounded. </strong>Israel carries out frequent raids across the West Bank, where tensions have remained high throughout the Gaza war, but incursions into central Ramallah – seat of the Palestinian Authority – are relatively rare.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog has said a team of its inspectors are “back in Iran,” the first to enter since Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities this year.</strong> Iran suspended cooperation with the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency after a 12-day war with Israel in June, with Tehran pointing to the IAEA’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear facilities.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Iran held talks on Tuesday with European powers, seeking to avert a sanctions snapback which they have threatened to impose under the moribund 2015 nuclear deal.</strong> Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian deputy foreign minister who attended the talks with Britain, France and Germany in Geneva, said in a post on X it was “high time” for the European trio “to make the right choice and give diplomacy time and space”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>French president Emmanuel Macron strongly rejected Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent criticism over rising antisemitism in France and warned the issue should not be “weaponised”, in a letter to the Israeli leader published on Tuesday. </strong>Rows have broken out about an increase in antisemitic acts and hate crimes in France as international tensions mount over the conflict in Gaza.</p></li> <li><p><strong>US envoy Tom Barrack said on Tuesday that Washington would support the extension of the mandate of UN peacekeepers in Lebanon for one more year. </strong>A planned vote at the UN security council on the future of the UNIFIL peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, whose mandate ends on Sunday, has been postponed amid US and Israeli opposition to the draft text, several diplomatic sources told AFP.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Journalists in Lebanon have demanded an apology from a senior US envoy after he told them to “act civilized” and not be “animalistic”. </strong>As reporters shouted questions after the US delegation’s meeting with the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, on Tuesday, Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, stepped up to the podium in the packed room and said: “We’re going to have a different set of rules … please be quiet for a moment. The moment that this starts becoming chaotic, like animalistic, we’re gone.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>A man charged with setting fire to a Melbourne synagogue appeared in court on Wednesday over an attack Australia says was orchestrated by Iran and has led to the expulsion of Tehran’s ambassador. </strong>Australia said on Tuesday Iran sought to disguise its involvement in two 2024 attacks, at the Adass Israel Synagogue in Melbourne and on a kosher restaurant in Sydney, by using criminals and members of organised crime gangs.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Australia on Wednesday dismissed suggestions by Israel that its interventions prompted Canberra to expel Iran’s ambassador as it blamed Tehran for directing at least two antisemitic arson attacks in the country’s biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne. </strong>“Complete nonsense,” Home Affairs minister Tony Burke told ABC Radio, when asked about Israel claiming credit for Australia’s decision to order Tehran’s ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi to leave the country.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Six Syrian soldiers were killed in Israeli drone strikes in the Damascus countryside, state-run El Ekhbariya TV reported early on Wednesday.</strong> Syria and Israel are engaged in US-mediated talks on easing tensions in southern Syria, with Damascus seeking a security deal that could open the door to wider political negotiations.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Israeli military said on Wednesday it intercepted a missile fired from Yemen, where Houthi rebels have regularly launched attacks they say are in response to Israel’s offensive in Gaza.</strong> “Following the sirens that sounded a short while ago in several areas in Israel, a missile that was launched from Yemen was intercepted by the IAF,” Israel’s army said on Telegram, referring to the air force.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div>
