<p>The Australian Navy is offering high school graduates “with no experience at all” up to $120,000 to become nuclear submarine officers who will eventually manage nuclear reactors and weapons systems.</p> <p>The recruitment drive has been launched despite Defence not being expected to receive a Virginia-class submarine from the US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/13/aukus-10-things-we-need-to-know-about-australias-nuclear-submarine-program">as part of the Aukus deal</a> until at least the early 2030s and amid warnings of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/18/aukus-submarine-deal-us-australia-cost-blowouts">cost blowouts</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/09/us-virginia-class-submarines-hit-further-two-year-delay-as-australia-awaits-2030-delivery">delays</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/06/aukus-deal-australian-submarine-agency-mckinsey-consultancy-costs-ntwnfb">Agency overseeing $368bn Aukus deal in morale crisis paid consultancy $9.5m for management advice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A navy job ad targets people who may have “recently finished school or are currently studying” with the promise of eventually “driving the vessel and charting its position”.</p> <p>“Your training will first equip you with technical expertise in nuclear propulsion, the platform, and its equipment,” <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/80540214?type=standout&amp;ref=search-standalone#sol=9dd3a3a75e3ca70f4f17589fb9792ece490b9116">the ad said</a>. “You will then move into your submarine qualification and oversee day-to-day operations, and you could one day lead the entire crew as commanding officer.”</p> <p>A Defence spokesperson said the hiring drive was part of a long-term strategy to ensure it had enough specialist staff to deploy the submarine once acquired.</p>    <p>The trainee workforce would supplement “experienced personnel transferring from across the Australian defence force”.</p> <p>“This is to ensure we have the right mix of candidates and to ensure there is time to generate a sustainable career pathway,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>Once accepted, an officer would undergo 12 months of nuclear training in the US along with three months of basic submarine and warfare courses. The officers would then be posted to a seagoing submarine for further training.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Nuclear submarine technicians would receive 18 months of training in the US including six months of nuclear theory and 12 months of practical training on existing vessels. The technicians would also be posted to seagoing submarines.</p> <p>“A Virginia-class submarine is crewed by highly trained officers and sailors,” the spokesperson said. “This takes time and highly sophisticated training processes.”</p> <p>The job ad also offers recruits “travel opportunities, job security, incremental salary increases as you progress through training and ranks, chef made meals at sea, social and fitness facilities, balance of shore and sea postings [and a] variety of allowances”.</p> <p>This month the defence minister, Richard Marles, confirmed that navy personnel were undergoing training on Virginia-class submarines in the US and on Astute-class submarines in the UK.</p>    <p>“Developing the skills and expertise to safely operate conventionally armed nuclear-powered submarines is at the heart of the Aukus pathway,” Marles said.</p> <p>Defence has previously struggled to recruit enough personnel. In a briefing to Marles in 2022, obtained under freedom of information laws, Defence warned: “The last year has seen lower recruiting achievement and higher separation rates, which have resulted in the ADF and [Department of Defence] workforce size being below approved levels.”</p> <p>The federal government also funded a new training centre at HMAS Stirling, a Royal Australian Navy base in Western Australia, to train a local workforce to deploy the Virginia-class submarines.</p> <p>The US plans to sell Australia at least three and potentially five nuclear-powered Virginia-class submarines in the 2030s, before Australian-built submarines enter service in the 2040s.</p> <p>In the lead-up of the acquisitions, from 2027 at the earliest, there are plans to establish a rotational presence of one Royal Navy Astute-class submarine and up to four US navy Virginia-class submarines at HMAS Stirling.</p>
