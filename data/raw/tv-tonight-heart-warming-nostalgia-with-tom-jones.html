<h2>In My Own Words: Tom Jones</h2> <p><strong>10.40pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>A lovely, intimate trip down memory lane as the Welshman with the voice watches back smile-raising footage of his life. From working-class life in Pontypridd to breakout hit It’s Not Unusual, his first TV show and a midlife comeback that led him to a knighthood – some highlights include his surprise hit Glastonbury slot (“I didn’t realise he had so much magnetism!” said one woman in the crowd), hair dye regrets and his quest to collaborate with up-and-coming Welsh bands.<em> Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Mary at 90: A Lifetime of Cooking</h2> <p><strong>7.30pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>A warm hug of a new six-part series for Mary Berry, the nation’s favourite baker, who looks back at her 60 years in foodie broadcasting. She is first joined by the comedian Tom Allen, for whom she makes old favourites including pan-fried cod and bread and butter pudding. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Murder Before Evensong</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong><strong><br></strong>“Does anyone here not have a secret?” The plot thickens in this 80s-set murder mystery based on the Rev Richard Coles’s novel. Canon Daniel Clement (Matthew Lewis) thinks the killings are connected with the victims’ interest in war. But DS Neil Vanloo (Amit Shah) has other ideas. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>The Good Life: Inside Out</h2>    <p><strong>9pm, U&amp;Gold</strong><strong><br></strong>It’s been 50 years since Barbara and Tom Good swapped the rat race for a self-sufficient life. Penelope Keith, who played snooty neighbour Margo Leadbetter, fronts this retrospective for the superfans (which included Queen Elizabeth II, apparently). It also features rarely seen interviews with co-stars Richard Briers, Felicity Kendal and Paul Eddington. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Worlds Apart</h2> <p><strong>9.15pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>It’s penultimate episode time – and everything hinges on a coin count for our inexperienced young Brits and their plucky pensioner pals, racing across Japan for a £50,000 prize. This week’s details are under wraps, but we can reveal they’ve reached Osaka, and with just four teams left, they face their first-ever group challenge, putting teamwork and trust to the test. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Storyville: Welded Together</h2> <p><strong>10pm, BBC Four</strong><strong><br></strong>A lyrical story of self-sacrifice from Belarus, this film tells the story of welder Katya who is determined to look after her half-sister Tanya in the wake of the pair’s traumatic childhood. As life conspires against Katya, it’s virtually impossible not to be moved, but director Anastasiya Miroshnichenko never portrays this heroic woman as a victim. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>EFL Cup</strong><strong>: Wrexham v </strong><strong> Cardiff City, </strong><strong>7.30pm, ITV1 </strong>Newcastle play Tottenham on Wednesday at 7.30pm.</p>
