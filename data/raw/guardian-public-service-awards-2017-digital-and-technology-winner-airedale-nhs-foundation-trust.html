<p>‘I’m sad about all the missed opportunities for friendships,” Alex said before starting speech therapy. “I’ve tried to escape from my stammer. I’ve failed.” A month later, the 27-year-old had a different outlook. “The world suddenly seems full of possibilities,” he said.</p> <p>Another patient, Nadim, 47, had been petrified of saying his own name, but was discharged happily after four therapy sessions, saying he was no longer scared of his stammer. And soon after his first session, Liam, 29, took his young children to the park. It was the first time he had dared go out with them on his own, finally free of the fear he would be unable to ask for help if something bad happened.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>I’ve had people saying they’ve been trying for years to get help ...

Since April the project has been offering a specialist speech therapy service to adults across the UK via videolink to patients’ laptops, tablets and even mobile phones.</p> <p>The telemedicine service mirrors a typical face-to-face speech therapy session. It includes an initial assessment of the individual’s needs and the development of a personal strategy. That could involve learning speech techniques to improve fluency or learning how to manage living with a stammer.</p> <p>With many NHS trusts no longer providing speech therapy for adult stammerers, the British Stammering Association (BSA) receives more than a thousand enquiries annually from people desperate for help.</p> <p>The impetus for the Airedale project came from speech and language therapist Stephanie Burgess, who received a letter from a prisoner, Mark, she had worked with via videolink. “I read this handwritten letter and cried,” she recalls, “and thought: ‘Wow, that’s an amazing story.’” She sent it on to the BSA – and <a href="https://www.stammering.org/speaking-out/article/speech-therapy-success-prison">when the BSA shared the story, it went viral</a>. “The BSA chair rang me up, wanting to know if this was something we could do with everyone.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/apr/15/how-technology-is-changing-speech-and-language-therapy">How technology is changing speech and language therapy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Set up with a funding of £75,000 from the Health Foundation’s Innovating for Improvement programme, the scheme has had 42 referrals through the BSA’s website since its April inception. The results are being evaluated by Leeds Beckett University’s speech therapy research department; Burgess’s own investigations already show promising outcomes. Using a 10-point rating scale to illustrate measurable impact, she determined that, by July, six of the seven patients who started in April had achieved their target, or were within half a point – including those whose therapy was not yet complete.</p> <p>Despite not seeing them in person, Burgess has found no problems building rapport with her clients. In fact, she thinks there are tangible benefits to receiving therapy digitally, rather than face-to-face. “I think, in many cases, it’s better. Coming to therapy is quite a daunting, scary thing for many people. With this system you don’t have to go to your GP – you just fill in a form online. People feel comfortable and secure.”</p> <p>The trust and the BSA are now trying to secure funding to continue the project after next April. “I’ve had people saying they’ve been trying for years to get help,” Burgess says. “People have told me this has changed their lives.”</p>
