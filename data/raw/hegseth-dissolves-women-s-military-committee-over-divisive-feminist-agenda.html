<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, the US defense secretary, ended an advisory committee on women in the armed services Tuesday, saying it was putting forth a “divisive feminist agenda”.</p> <p>“The Committee is focused on advancing a divisive feminist agenda that hurts combat readiness, while Secretary Hegseth has focused on advancing uniform, sex-neutral standards across the Department,” said Kingsley Wilson, press secretary for the Pentagon.</p> <p>The defense advisory committee on women in the services started in 1951 and gathered information to provide recommendations to the defense secretary on issues related to women in the military.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/09/pete-hegseth-video-pastors-women-voting">Pete Hegseth reposts video that says women shouldn’t be allowed to vote</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of those recommendations, “the majority … have been either fully or partially implemented”, a <a href="https://dacowits.defense.gov/About/">website</a> for the committee says. “The Committee’s recommendations have been instrumental in effecting changes to law and policies pertaining to the service of women in the US military.”</p> <p>The Military Times <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2025/05/30/defense-advisory-boards-including-dacowits-to-shutter-in-dod-purge/">reported</a> earlier this year that the committee was one of 14 defense advisory committees flagged for potential termination, though many of those would require congressional approval to be disbanded.</p> <p>The Pentagon previously told advisory committees they needed to show their worth, saying they needed to detail how they benefited the government and the country, and that they aligned with a “warrior ethos”, the Military Times <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2025/02/21/dod-advisory-committees-must-prove-warrior-ethos-in-new-directive/">reported</a>.</p> <p>Wilson shared a link on X to an article from the rightwing outlet the Daily Signal, which cites concerns the committee expressed about access to reproductive healthcare after the overturning of Roe v Wade as an example of the “feminist agenda” the committee was pushing.</p>
