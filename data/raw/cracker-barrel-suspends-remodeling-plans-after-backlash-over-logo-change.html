<p>Cracker Barrel announced on Tuesday that it’s suspending plans to remodel its restaurants just weeks after reversing a logo change that ignited a political firestorm.</p> <p>The 56-year-old restaurant chain, known for southern-style cooking and country-store aesthetic, faced intense <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/cracker-barrel-backlash">backlash last month</a> after unveiling a rebranding effort aimed at modernizing its image. The company rolled out a new minimalist logo and plans for more contemporary interiors, and it updated menu items.</p> <p>The new logo replaced the brand’s image of an old man in overalls leaning against a wooden barrel with a simplified gold background and the words “Cracker Barrel” in minimalist lettering.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cracker-barrel-logo-trump">‘A proxy for America’s culture war’: why Cracker Barrel’s new logo sparked ire on the right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The change was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/26/cracker-barrel-logo-apology?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=fb_us&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawMtWzhleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFURTNBcjFsdzhTdVQ5WHRWAR48MYVFSKspy01UFRDfJcAyKafK6KWEmlmFiwnpbShuhGCgs7CMD5kKui6pfQ_aem_1aU5r0zC2hGxrjHh695MRA#Echobox=1756218989">immediately met</a> with intense outrage online from conservatives and far-right influencers who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/cracker-barrel-backlash">accused the company</a> of going “woke”.

Even Donald Trump weighed in and publicly urged Cracker Barrel to return to its old logo. Shortly after, the restaurant chain announced that it would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/26/cracker-barrel-logo-apology?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=fb_us&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawMtWzhleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFURTNBcjFsdzhTdVQ5WHRWAR48MYVFSKspy01UFRDfJcAyKafK6KWEmlmFiwnpbShuhGCgs7CMD5kKui6pfQ_aem_1aU5r0zC2hGxrjHh695MRA#Echobox=1756218989">restore the old logo</a> and the president praised the reversal.</p> <p>Now, on Tuesday, Cracker Barrel said it was also shelving its interior redesign plans as well.</p> <p>“Your Old Country Store is Here to Stay,” the company said in a <a href="https://www.crackerbarrel.com/allthemore">statement</a> on its website. “You’ve shared your voices in recent weeks not just on our logo, but also on our restaurants. We’re continuing to listen. Today, we’re suspending our remodels. If your restaurant hasn’t been remodeled, you don’t need to worry, it won’t be.”</p> <p>The company said that it heard “clearly that the modern remodel design does not reflect what you love about Cracker Barrel”.</p> <p>Cracker Barrel said it had tested the new interior look in four of its 660 locations and would not be moving forward with the redesign.</p> <p>“The vintage Americana you love will always be here –&nbsp;the rocking chairs on the porch, our fireplaces and peg games, unique treasures in our gift shop and antiques pulled straight from our warehouse in Lebanon, Tennessee,” the chain said.</p> <p>“With our recent announcement that our ‘Old Timer’ logo will remain, along with our bigger focus in the kitchen and on your plate, we hope that today’s step reinforces that we hear you.”</p>
