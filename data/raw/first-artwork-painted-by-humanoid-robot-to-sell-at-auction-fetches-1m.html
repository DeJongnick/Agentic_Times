<p>A portrait of English mathematician Alan Turing has become the first artwork by a humanoid robot to be sold at auction, fetching US$1.08m (£566,000, A$1.63m) in New York on Thursday.</p> <p>The 2.2 metre (7.5 feet) portrait, titled A.I. God. Portrait of Alan Turing, was created by Ai-Da, the world’s first ultra-realistic robot artist. It smashed pre-sale expectations between $120,000 and $180,000 when it went under the hammer at Sotheby’s, which confirmed that 27 bids were placed on the work.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/04/mind-blowing-ai-da-becomes-first-robot-to-paint-like-an-artist">‘Mind-blowing’: Ai-Da becomes first robot to paint like an artist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Today’s record-breaking sale price for the first artwork by a humanoid robot artist to go up for auction marks a moment in the history of modern and contemporary art and reflects the growing intersection between AI technology and the global art market,” the auction house said in a statement.</p> <p>Ai-Da, which uses AI to speak, said: “The key value of my work is its capacity to serve as a catalyst for dialogue about emerging technologies.”</p> <p>Ai-Da added that a “portrait of pioneer Alan Turing invites viewers to reflect on the God-like nature of AI and computing while considering the ethical and societal implications of these advancements.”</p>    <p>Turing, a mathematician and early computer scientist who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/15/alan-turing-father-of-modern-computing-50-pound-note">played a crucial role in fighting Nazi Germany by working as a code breaker</a>, raised concerns about the use of AI in the 1950s.</p> <p>One of the most advanced robots in the world, Ai-Da is designed to resemble a woman and is named after Ada Lovelace, who is considered the world’s first computer programmer.</p> <p>Ai-Da was devised by Aidan Meller, a specialist in modern and contemporary art.</p> <p>“The greatest artists in history grappled with their period of time, and both celebrated and questioned society’s shifts,” Meller said.</p> <p>Meller led the team that created Ai-Da and worked with artificial intelligence specialists at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham.</p> <p>Ai-Da generates ideas through conversations with members of the studio, and had suggested creating an image of Turing during a discussion about “AI for good”.</p> <p>The robot was then asked what style, colour, content, tone and texture to use, before using cameras in its eyes to look at a picture of Turing and create the painting.</p> <p>The artwork’s “muted tones and broken facial planes” seemingly suggested “the struggles Turing warned we will face when it comes to managing AI”, Meller said.</p> <p>Ai-Da’s works were “ethereal and haunting” and “continue to question where the power of AI will take us, and the global race to harness its power”, he added.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/04/mind-blowing-ai-da-becomes-first-robot-to-paint-like-an-artist">In an interview with the Guardian in 2022</a>, when asked whether the robot painted from imagination, Ai-Da responded, “I like to paint what I see. You can paint from imagination, I guess, if you have an imagination. I have been seeing different things to humans as I do not have consciousness.”</p> <p><em>Agence France-Presse contributed to this report</em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 8 November 2024 to correct the final amount the painting sold for.</p>
