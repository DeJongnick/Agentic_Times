<p>Australia’s race discrimination commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/15/dastyari-high-number-of-no-votes-in-labor-seats-shows-huge-disconnect">the high no vote in western Sydney</a> in last week’s historic same-sex marriage postal survey reflects religious observance rather than ethnicity, and he has warned against an outbreak of crass, cultural stereotyping.</p> <p>Soutphommasane used a speech at the University of Western Sydney to issue a pointed warning against adopting “easy narratives” devoid of evidence about the behaviour or inclinations of particular ethnic groups in Australia.</p> <p>“In a world that many describe as post-truth or post-factual, our social cohesion is not always well served by jumping to conclusions,” he said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2017/nov/21/burst-your-bubble-australia-sour-grapes-on-the-right-after-yes-majority">Burst your bubble Australia: sour grapes on the right after yes majority | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Once-appealing narratives take hold, they can help fuel stereotypes about others – and these can be difficult to shake off. Sometimes this is because they may conveniently help to confirm cultural hierarchies in our society.”</p> <p>Soutphommasane said a narrative has sprung up since the postal survey which centres on ethnic minorities or multicultural communities being intrinsically hostile towards same-sex marriage, and to the LGBTI community at large.</p> <p>He said while some ethnic communities hold to the view that marriage is between a man and a woman, that view is shaped often by religious or cultural traditions.</p> <p>The race commissioner said a more clear-eyed examination of the postal survey data suggests religiosity, or religious observance, was a more significant factor for no voters – a fact well understood by the no campaign, which targeted messages to a range of communities in Sydney’s west.</p> <p>Soutphommasane said if you look at the voting trends outside western Sydney, a more mixed picture emerges – a picture where seats with populations of more than 40% born overseas overwhelmingly voted yes.</p> <p>He pointed out that the most multicultural electorates in New South Wales and Victoria recorded high yes votes – seats like Sydney, Grayndler, Kingsford Smith, Bradfield, Batman, Wills, Gellibrand and Chisholm.</p> <p>“To suggest that an overwhelming majority of multicultural communities voted no – and did so out of some essential cultural hostility against gays and lesbians – is to entertain something that comes close to an unkind stereotype,” the race commissioner said. </p> <p>He said the 38% national no vote included people from a range of backgrounds “yet judging from some commentary, you’d be mistaken to think that vote came almost exclusively from migrant and ethnic communities”.</p> <p>Soutphommasane pointed to a double standard in some of the public commentary, where people from “multicultural backgrounds are held to a standard that isn’t necessarily applied to others”.</p> <p>He said there is an element where a no vote is acceptable from someone of the majority, but unacceptable if the position is held by a minority.</p> <p>“There is that notion that migrants are somehow ungrateful to Australia in not extending to others the kind of respect and tolerance that they demand themselves,” he said . “How interesting that this judgment doesn’t appear to have been formed about others who may have voted no”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/16/after-the-yes-vote-i-feel-relief-and-vindication-as-a-social-researcher">After the yes vote, I feel relief - and vindication as a social researcher | Rebecca Huntley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Soutphommasane said false narratives around racism stoke populist narratives which have the potential to erode social cohesion and racial harmony in a multicultural society. </p> <p>“Such challenges have always been present for our multiculturalism,” he said. “There can never be any guarantee against such challenges”.</p> <p>“The best defence of our cohesion and harmony, as ever, is our vigilance and our virtue. We must be prepared to defend liberal values of equality, tolerance and non-discrimination.</p> <p>“And it is not enough for our society merely to be non-racist; it must be resolutely anti-racist.”</p>
