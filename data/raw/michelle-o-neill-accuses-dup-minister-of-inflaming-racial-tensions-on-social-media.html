<p>Northern Ireland’s first minister has accused a DUP politician of inflaming tensions after a leisure centre in Larne was set on fire.</p> <p>Gordon Lyons, the communities minister, should “consider his position”, Michelle O’Neill said. Hours before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/11/second-night-rioting-ballymena-police-officers-injured-northern-ireland">centre was set on fire</a> by a mob of masked youths on Wednesday, Lyons had posted on social media that the building was being used to accommodate several people who had fled from Ballymena, about 20 miles (32km) away.</p> <p>Staff and customers, including children learning to swim, were in the leisure centre at the time of Wednesday’s attack, which coincided with violence in Ballymena amid tensions over immigration.</p>    <p>Hours before the attack, Lyons posted on social media that “a number of individuals were temporarily moved to Larne leisure centre in the early hours of the morning after the disturbances in Ballymena.</p> <p>“As a local MLA [member of the legislative assembly] for the area, neither I nor my DUP colleagues were made aware or consulted on this decision until late this afternoon,” he added. “Protesting is of course a legitimate right but I would encourage everyone to remain peaceful.”</p> <p>Speaking to reporters on Thursday, O’Neill, of Sinn Féin, said Lyons had failed to show the correct leadership. “I think that his commentary falls very short and very much strays into the territory of inflaming the situation,” she said. “So, I think he should consider his position.”</p> <p>The Sinn Féin finance minister, John O’Dowd, also called on Lyons to resign, while Matthew O’Toole, the SDLP and opposition leader, said he would refer Lyons to the standards commission. “The actions of the communities minister cannot be ignored,” he said. “He is the minister responsible for the housing executive and lives are at stake.”</p> <p>Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary, also called on Lyons to reflect on his comments.</p> <p>Lyons is defying the calls, saying that under Stormont’s system of government no other party can force him to quit: “That is not in their gift.”</p> <p>Lyons told the BBC his message “was posted because rumours had been circulating that the leisure centre was being turned into a permanent centre” and that was no longer the case. He said he was trying to defuse the situation.</p> <p>The chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Jon Boutcher, said the recent disorder in Northern Ireland was “absolutely race-motivated”.</p> <p>Speaking at a news conference he said 41 police officers had been injured and 14 arrests had been made so far. Addressing targeted communities, Boutcher said: “We stand shoulder to shoulder with you. These bigots and racists will not win the day.”</p> <p>O’Neill and the deputy first minister, Emma Little-Pengelly, appeared together on Wednesday to condemn the violence.</p> <p>Echoing comments from the police, the first minister said: “It’s pure racism, there’s no other way to dress it up.” Little-Pengelly described the scenes in Ballymena as “utter thuggery”.</p> <p>Police came under attack for a fourth consecutive night on Thursday as unrest spread to multiple towns across the region.</p> <p>In Portadown, missiles were thrown at officers during a protest, continuing a pattern of disorder that began earlier in the week in Ballymena. While tensions remained high, Thursday’s incidents appeared to be of lower intensity compared with previous flare-ups.</p> <p>Police said a separate protest in east Belfast concluded early in the evening without major incident.</p> <p>The latest disturbances follow strong words from Northern Ireland’s police chief, who said “bigots and racists” were behind the violence.</p> <p>There were calls for urgent action after the names of streets and addresses in Ballymena were posted on a Facebook page with some designated “local”, the apparent suggestion being that they should not be targeted.</p> <p>The local Sinn Féin MLA, Philip McGuigan, has called on the police and Meta to take action. “This is a very dangerous situation in Ballymena, and what is happening is absolutely disgusting and disgraceful,” he said.</p>
