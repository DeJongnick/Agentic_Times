<p>The proportion of women giving birth after fertility treatment in the UK has increased by more than a third in a decade, with the equivalent of one child in every classroom now born as a result of IVF, figures show.</p> <p>One in 32 births in 2023 were the result of in vitro fertilisation, up 34% from one in 43 in 2013, according to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).</p> <p>Overall in 2023, 52,400 patients had more than 77,500 IVF cycles at licensed fertility clinics in the UK, while about 20,700 babies were born via the process, up from 8,700 in 2000, the fertility regulator said.</p> <p>The number of women <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jun/20/rise-women-freezing-eggs-uk">freezing their eggs</a> also increased sharply, with cycles up from 4,700 in 2022 to 6,900 in 2023. Egg freezing increased most among women in their 30s, but the number using their stored frozen eggs remained low, the report said.</p> <p>IVF births now make up a higher proportion of all UK births, increasing from 1.3% in 2000 to 3.1% in 2023. “This means around one in 32 UK births in 2023 were via IVF – roughly one child in every classroom – compared to one in 43 in 2013,” the report said.</p> <p>For women aged 40-44, 11% of births were as a result of IVF, up from 4% in 2000, accounting for 0.5% of all births, HFEA said. </p> <p>About 820 babies were born as a result of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/27/doing-it-with-no-partner-easier-single-women-using-fertility-treatments">donor insemination (DI) treatment</a> in 2023.</p> <p>The report also reveals a reduction in the number of IVF treatments funded by the health service. The proportion of NHS-funded IVF cycles declined from 35% in 2019 to 27% in 2023 in the UK, decreasing most in England, the HFEA said.</p> <p>More than half (54%) of IVF cycles in Scotland were funded by the NHS in 2023, compared with 49% in Northern Ireland, 33% in Wales and 24% in England.</p> <p>The HFEA also raised concerns about racial disparities in IVF treatment. In recent years, Asian and black patients have had lower birthrates compared with white patients and those from mixed ethnic backgrounds, according to the report.</p> <p>Julia Chain, the chair of the HFEA, said: “IVF is helping more people have babies including patients of different ages and family types. One in 32 of all UK births are from IVF … We are also seeing more single patients and female same-sex couples having IVF. These findings highlight the changing landscape of the UK fertility sector and how it could develop in the years to come.</p> <p>“However, we are very concerned to see that black and Asian patients continue to have lower IVF birthrates compared to other patient groups, and our recent national patient survey found that Asian and black patients are less likely to report being satisfied with their fertility treatment.”</p> <p>The survey also found that of the 80% of fertility patients who spoke to a GP before starting treatment, most waited up to a year to start treatment but 16% waited more than two years.</p> <p>Recent data showed that gynaecology waiting lists were long, Chain said. Anyone with concerns about their fertility should speak to their GP, she added. “We also encourage all primary care providers to ensure speedy referrals to specialist fertility services, if needed, to ensure the chances of success are as high as possible.”</p> <p>The fertility rate in England and Wales in 2023 was 1.44 children per woman, according to the Office for National Statistics – the lowest level on record.</p>
