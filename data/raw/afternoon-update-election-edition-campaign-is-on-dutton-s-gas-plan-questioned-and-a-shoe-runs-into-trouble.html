<p>Hi readers. You may have noticed today’s newsletter looks a little different. For the duration of the federal election campaign, Afternoon Update will be rebadged Afternoon Update | Election 2025. We’ll keep you updated on key developments from the campaign trail, but we’ll still bring you the day’s big non-election news.</p> <p>On that note, the governor general has given Anthony Albanese the green light and the cannons have been fired at Parliament House. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2025/mar/28/its-a-date-the-2025-federal-election-has-finally-been-called-full-story-podcast">It’s official</a>: Australia is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/28/what-date-is-the-australian-federal-election-everything-you-need-to-know-about-voting-and-the-state-of-the-parties">heading to the polls on 3 May</a>.</p> <p>Albanese told reporters this morning he was “born ready” for the campaign and argued the country is “turning the corner”. He painted the election as a choice between “Labor’s plan to keep building or Peter Dutton’s promise to cut”.</p> <p>Also this morning, Peter Dutton went <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/28/australia-news-live-federal-election-2025-updates-australian-pm-anthony-albanese-poll-date-peter-dutton-latest?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67e5eaf18f08bb7e41c339de#block-67e5eaf18f08bb7e41c339de">heavy on his narrative of choice</a>: “who can better manage our economy”.</p> <p>In non-election news, further down you can read about the former NSW police officer avoiding a prison sentence despite his conviction for the Taser death of Clare Nowland; and how photographs of US secretary of defense Pete Hegseth’s Arabic tattoo are stirring controversy.<strong> </strong></p> <h2>Today’s big stories</h2>    <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/28/australian-prime-minister-calls-election-amid-shadow-of-trump-and-cost-of-living-crisis">cost of living</a> is a key focal point for both leaders as they head on to the campaign trail. Albanese at one point <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/28/australian-federal-election-date-anthony-albanese-calls-poll-for-3-may">brandished a Medicare card</a> (politicians love a prop) to illustrate Labor’s commitment to better, affordable health policies.</p> <p>Whether Dutton’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/27/peter-dutton-budget-reply-speech-gas-reservation-scheme-public-service-cuts">national gas plan</a> will land favourably with voters is up for debate, with experts warning it would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2025/mar/28/peter-duttons-new-energy-plan-sounds-like-a-gas-in-reality-it-means-more-emissions-and-more-profits-for-industry">take years to approve</a>, build and develop, and would lock in fossil gas use for decades.</p> <p>With parties unlikely to form a majority government, the Coalition is entering the campaign with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/28/australian-federal-election-2025-analysis-liberal-labor-dutton-albanese">slight edge in the polls</a> but a narrower path to victory than Labor. It’s all on.</p> <h2>What they said</h2>    <p>***</p> <p>“Minority government is coming. And with the major parties’ offerings about as attractive as a dead fish, you can see why.”</p> <p>The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/28/australia-news-live-federal-election-2025-updates-australian-pm-anthony-albanese-poll-date-peter-dutton-latest?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67e5d8e68f08bb7e41c33921#block-67e5d8e68f08bb7e41c33921:~:text=10.17%20AEDT-,6h%20ago,10.04%20AEDT,-Bandt%20says%20%E2%80%98minority">told reporters on Friday</a> this election would be an “incredible opportunity” for a minority government.</p> <p>The 2010 federal election was the last time Australia fell into minority, with Julia Gillard securing the support of Bandt and three crossbenchers. This time around, that crossbench is looking a little more crowded.</p> <h2>How social media saw it</h2>    <p>The Shovel is clearly not ready for five weeks of politicians wearing hard hats and having awkward conversations with punters in pubs and supermarkets. “Can we just fast forward to the bit where we get a sausage in bread?”</p> <h2>The big picture</h2>    <p>Parliament House was looking beautifully serene as the sun rose this morning, before Albanese met with the governor general, Sam Mostyn, to dissolve the 47th Parliament of Australia.</p> <h2>Watch</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2025/mar/28/australian-prime-minister-anthony-albanese-announces-election-date-with-pitch-to-voters-video">Anthony Albanese announces poll date with pitch to voters</a></p> <h2>And in other news …</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/28/former-nsw-police-officer-kristian-white-sentenced-shooting-95-year-old-clare-nowland-ntwnfb">Clare Nowland’s son says decision not to imprison police officer who killed her a ‘slap on the wrist’</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/pete-hegseth-tattoo-arabic-language">Pete Hegseth’s Arabic tattoo stirs controversy: ‘clear symbol of Islamophobia’</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/mar/28/no-other-land-co-director-condemns-academys-letter-to-members-after-hamdan-ballal-attack-ntwnfb">No Other Land co-director condemns Academy’s letter to members after Hamdan Ballal attack</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/28/indigenous-man-riding-e-bike-killed-when-nsw-police-car-attempted-to-pull-him-over-ntwnfb">Man riding e-bike killed when NSW police car attempted to pull him over</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/28/hoka-running-shoe-brand-maori-culture-ntwnfb">Running shoe brand accused of misappropriating Māori culture</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/28/intimidation-journalists-indonesia-pig-heads-rats">A pig’s head and decapitated rats: a new era of intimidation dawns for journalists in Indonesia</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Daily word game</h2>    <p>Today’s starter word is: <strong>FAS. </strong>You have five goes to get the longest word including the starter word. <a href="https://www.wordiply.com/">Play Wordiply</a>.</p> <h2>Sign up</h2> <p>If you would like to receive this Afternoon Update: Election Edition to your email inbox every weekday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/13/afternoon-update-newsletter-best-daily-news-email-guardian-australia-free-sign-up?CMP=copyembed">sign up here</a>, or start your day with a curated breakdown of the key stories you need to know with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/23/morning-mail-newsletter-best-daily-news-email-guardian-australia-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe?CMP=copyembed">our Morning Mail newsletter</a>.
