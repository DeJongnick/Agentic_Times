<p>When I was a trainspotter in the 50s and 60s, railway signals were mostly of the semaphore type operated by wires and men in signal boxes, and I don’t remember “signal failure” ever being a cause of disruption to services, whereas <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41708585">nowadays it is a daily occurrence</a>. Is the new technology more trouble than it’s worth, or is my memory at fault?</p> <p><em>David Harrison, Brighton </em></p> <p>Post your answers – and new questions – below or email them to <a href="mailto:nq@theguardian.com">nq@theguardian.com</a></p>
