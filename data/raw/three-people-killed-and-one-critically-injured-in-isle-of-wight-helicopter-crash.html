<p>Three people have been killed after a helicopter crashed on the Isle of Wight during a flying lesson.</p> <p>The helicopter carrying four people crashed into a field near Shanklin at about 9.20am on Monday. One person onboard was airlifted to hospital and remains in a serious condition.</p> <p>Hampshire and Isle of Wight police confirmed that three people had been killed in the crash. In a statement, the force said: “At this time we are unable to provide further information about the people involved, as efforts continue to contact and support their families.</p> <p>“We will not be commenting on the circumstances of the incident but continue to work alongside the Air Accident Investigation Branch.”</p> <p>The AAIB said it had launched an investigation into the incident, adding: “A team of inspectors has been sent to the accident site to gather evidence and make inquiries.”</p> <p>Northumbria Helicopters, the operator of the aircraft, confirmed that four people were on aircraft G-OCLV involved in the crash. It said: “The flight, which departed from Sandown airport at approximately 9am was carrying four passengers on board including the pilot, and was undertaking a flying lesson.</p> <p>“Northumbria Helicopters is giving its full cooperation to the authorities investigating this incident.</p>    <p>A spokesperson for Hampshire and Isle of Wight Air Ambulance said: “We have treated and airlifted one patient to the Major Trauma Centre, University hospital Southampton. Our thoughts are with them, and everyone involved in today’s incident.”</p> <p>One witness, Leigh Goldsmith, said she saw the helicopter “spiralling”.</p> <p>Speaking to the Isle of Wight County Press, she said she was driving towards Shanklin when the helicopter disappeared and came down in a hedge. Afterwards, she said she went to the scene of the crash and saw what looked like airbags activated under the helicopter.</p> <p>Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Joe Robertson, MP for the Isle of Wight East, told people to avoid the area.</p> <p>“Where the helicopter came down is fairly rural,” he said. “It’s surrounded by fields and a road that runs from Shanklin and Sandown, which are on the east, quite well-known for their beaches, through to Ventnor in the south, which is part of the rocky part of south of the island.</p> <p>“It is not in a very populated area, albeit it seems to be fairly close to a road that runs between two towns.”</p>
