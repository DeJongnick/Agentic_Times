<p>Hearts will create Scottish football history by appointing Shelley Kerr, a former manager of the women’s national team, to a key position relating solely to the development of male players.</p> <p>The Edinburgh club are poised to confirm Kerr as their first technical development manager, giving the 55-year-old significant responsibility for the transition from academy to first-team football. Kerr will become the first woman to take on such a position at a major Scottish club. The Uefa pro licence holder will also assist with the Hearts B team and monitor the progress of coaches at the training base.</p> <p>Besides Kerr’s technical qualifications, Hearts believe her personality will be a huge asset to the progression of players and coaches. With no hitches anticipated from either side, an announcement is expected from Hearts in the next 24 hours.</p> <p>Kerr, a Hearts supporter in her youth, played for the club long before the formation of the Scottish Women’s Premier League. After a spell managing Arsenal, she was hired by the men’s Lowland League side University of Stirling. The Scotland post came next, with Kerr leading her country to the 2019 Women’s World Cup. She left a year later after the team failed to qualify for the Euros. Kerr has subsequently worked for the English Football Association in a development capacity with women’s teams, while maintaining a presence in Scotland through punditry roles.</p> <p>Hearts’ sporting director, Graeme Jones, took office this week. Jones was previously a respected part of Steve Clarke’s backroom staff as the Scottish FA’s performance director. A key element of Jones’s remit at Hearts involves talent production for first-team use and potential sale.</p> <p>The lack of game time afforded to Scottish youth players in the country’s top flight has been a key talking point in recent times. Hearts are keen to buck that trend; James Wilson, 17, scored the equaliser in an Edinburgh derby last month and the 19-year-old Adam Forrester has been utilised in the first team under Neil Critchley.</p> <p>Hearts recently confirmed a partnership with Jamestown, a football analytics firm founded by Tony Bloom, the Brighton owner. Bloom could buy a minority stake in Hearts, subject to ratification from the Foundation of Hearts, the majority shareholder, in what would be viewed as tacit admission of his belief in what Jamestown can deliver in Scotland.</p>
