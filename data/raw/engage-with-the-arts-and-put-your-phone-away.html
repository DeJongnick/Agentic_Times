<p>The case that you brilliantly make for seeing actual paintings rather than reproductions (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/02/the-guardian-view-on-art-and-health-the-masterpiece-can-cure-the-body-as-well-as-the-soul">Editorial, 2 November</a>) also goes wholeheartedly with seeing real and actual performances by live human beings rather than the two-dimensional screen reproductions which are now accepted as the norm.</p>  <p>Humans benefit enormously from seeing live performances, and they benefit even more from taking part in them. We have the greatest theatre legacy and culture since ancient Athens. Let all witness this, but also take part. The buoyancy and creativity of our country, and therefore its true economy, will bounce like never before.<br><strong>Ian Flintoff</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>• I venture to disagree over the Guardian editorial on the overall healing effect of a masterpiece. There seems to be a consensus that art, literature and music exist as a nannying purpose, as a retreat from life. There is a more uncomfortable function, of challenge, both personal and societal, of upending rigidly held views, and of looking beyond the narrow world of self.</p> <p>There is an exhibition at the Sainsbury Centre in Norwich called <a href="https://sainsburycentre.ac.uk/whats-on/can-we-stop-killing-each-other/">Can We Stop Killing Each Other</a>? It looks at the expression of violence through art and theatre throughout the ages. At the end, the viewer is asked questions such as: “Why are we violent?” and “How can we stop it?” Strong meat, and first-class art.<br><strong>Val Mainwood</strong><br><em>Wivenhoe, Essex</em></p> <p>• Your editorial says: “Galleries are quiet, contemplative places. We stop scrolling and start really looking.” Quite so – as long as you’re able to ignore jostling fellow visitors snapping paintings with their phones, presumably to admire them on a screen at some later time.<br><strong>Ross Speirs</strong><br><em>Watlington, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p><em><strong>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
