<p>Park Royal is the worst underground station in London and therefore the world. You come out of a stubby 1930s entrance hall that must have been cute once, right on to a dual carriageway. There’s a hotel on the other side of the road, and a tourist will most likely approach you, asking how she’s supposed to cross, and your answer will be just a sub-verbal collapse into nothingness. There is no obvious way to cross the road. This place was built for cars, and if you’re not a car, you’re stuck in a tube station now. There is actually an underpass, but that’s no excuse for dystopian urban planning.</p> <p>I was there helping the Stop Trump Coalition make a video before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/27/trump-protest-movement-50501">US president</a>’s state visit, whenever that might be, and they were there to see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/13/elon-musk-tesla-takedown-protest">Tesla Takedown</a>, which is not as antagonistic as it sounds, just a score of people, one dressed as a shark for some reason, holding signs that said: “Honk if you hate billionaires.” Tesla drivers were honking as they drove into the showroom. It wasn’t the easiest thing to guess, a year ago, that you were buying an ad for the values of Elon Musk, nor what those values would transpire to be.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/27/trump-protest-movement-50501">‘A trickle to a tidal wave’: behind the Trump protest movement that launched on Reddit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everyone honked: big cars, small cars; rich people, not rich people; an Ocado van. An ambulance put its siren on. Was this a movement building? “The feedback mechanism of a honk is quite ephemeral, isn’t it?” said an anthropologist who had declined to be interviewed. But hah, he shouldn’t have kept talking to me.</p> <p>It was the smallest protest I’d ever seen, unless you count the Prettiest Staffy in Lewisham beauty pageant, organised by someone to low-key protest against the vilification of staffordshire bull terriers. But those on it – US progressives, a woman from Ukraine who has lived in the UK since before the Russians invaded, an anti-Brexit campaigner who had brought his EU flag – should have been the most politically depressed people you could meet, whereas in fact, they were the least.</p> <p>The true mechanism of a honk is that it buoys the spirit, for ages, possibly for ever.</p> <p>• Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
