<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2025">US government shutdown</a> stretched into its 28th day with no resolution in sight on Tuesday, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">Senate</a> remained deadlocked over spending legislation even as a crucial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/food-stamps-lawsuit-states-sue-trump-administration">food aid program</a> teeters on the brink of exhausting its funding.</p> <p>For the 13th time, Senate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> blocked a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a>-backed bill that would have funded federal agencies through 21 November. The minority party has refused to provide the necessary support for the bill to clear the 60-vote threshold for advancement in the Senate because it does not include funding for healthcare programs, or curbs on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s cuts to congressionally approved funding.</p> <p>The quagmire continued even after the president of the largest federal workers union <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/afge-union-government-shutdown-federal-workers">called on Congress</a> to pass the Republican proposal, citing the economic pain caused to government workers.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/food-stamps-lawsuit-states-sue-trump-administration">Two dozen states sue White House over food stamps suspension amid shutdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight. Today I’m making mine: it’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today. No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay – today,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/afge-union-government-shutdown-federal-workers">Everett Kelley</a>, president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), said in a statement released on Monday.</p> <p>But the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, signaled no change in his party’s strategy of holding out for concession from the Republicans, citing the imminent rise of premiums for Affordable Care Act health plans. Though tax credits that lower their costs expire at the end of the year, many enrollees in the plans have received notices of steep premium increases ahead of Saturday’s beginning of the open enrollment period.</p> <p>“Families are going to be in panic this weekend all across America, millions of them. How are they going to pay this bill? How are they going to live without healthcare? It’s tragic, and of course, it didn’t have to be, but Republicans are doing nothing,” Schumer told reporters at the US Capitol.</p> <p>The Republican Senate majority leader, John Thune, seized on the AFGE’s statement to argue that Democrats were being irresponsible for refusing to back the bill, which Republicans in the House of Representatives approved on a near party line vote last month before the speaker, Mike Johnson, ordered the chamber into a recess that has yet to end.</p>    <p>“It’s not very often that I get a chance to say this, but I agree with the AFGE,” Thune said.</p> <p>He reiterated that he would negotiate with Democrats over the expiring tax credits, but not with “a gun to our heads”.</p> <p>“I sincerely hope, in the best interest of every American who is impacted by this shutdown, and particularly those who are going to be really adversely impacted come this weekend, that the enough Democrats will come to their senses and deliver the five votes that are necessary to get this bill on the president’s desk,” Thune said, adding that he planned to hold further votes on the spending legislation.</p> <p>Both parties traded blame for the imminent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/food-benefits-federal-shutdown">expiration of funding</a> for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps. The Department of Agriculture has announced that it does not have the money to continue providing the benefit after 1 November, though on Tuesday, more than two dozen states <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/food-stamps-lawsuit-states-sue-trump-administration">sued the Trump administration</a>, arguing that funds are available for Snap benefits to continue.</p> <p>North Dakota senator Kevin Cramer said Democrats should either support a proposal from fellow Republican senator Josh Hawley to allow Snap to continue during the shutdown, “or they could just reopen the damn government, which is what they should be doing and should have been doing for the last month”.</p> <p>South Dakota senator Mike Rounds said the tax credits should be addressed by bipartisan action, but criticized the affordability of Affordable Care Act health plans. “The Obamacare product itself is fatally flawed. It continues to create a death spiral coming down with regard to the increasing costs. There are people out there, real people, that are going to get hurt because Obamacare is not working,” he said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/afge-union-government-shutdown-federal-workers">Leader of top federal worker union calls for end of US government shutdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview, Massachusetts Democrat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/28/elizabeth-warren-urges-us-regulators-to-investigate-jes-staley-ties-to-epstein">Elizabeth Warren</a> signaled no change in the party’s strategy for the shutdown, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/us-government-shuts-down">began</a> at the start of the month after Congress failed to pass legislation to continue funding that expired at the end of September.</p> <p>“Millions of people across this country are receiving their health insurance premium notices, and telling Democrats and Republicans, lower those costs,” Warren said. “Democrats are in there fighting to lower healthcare costs for millions of Americans. Donald Trump would rather shut down the government than help out these families.”</p> <p>Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who has repeatedly broken with Trump as she faces what is expected to be a tough re-election contest next year, said she did not buy that the agriculture department lacked funding to continue Snap, but noted the money it had on hand was not enough to cover the program’s costs.</p> <p>However, Collins expressed concerns about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/air-traffic-controller-shortages-shutdown">the readiness</a> of air traffic controllers, who did not receive a fully paycheck on Tuesday due to the shutdown. She noted that on two recent flights to Ronald Reagan Washington National airport, her plane had to divert at the last second.</p> <p>“I can’t help but think that reflects the strain on air traffic controllers,” she said.</p>
