<p>Thunderstorms across New South Wales and eastern Victoria on Monday brought flash flooding, destructive winds and hail, as the Bureau of Meteorology warned severe conditions would continue.</p> 
<p>A major storm rolled across the Sydney CBD about midday, bringing dark skies and heavy rainfall. By mid-afternoon, he city had recorded 52.8mm of rain at Observatory Hill since 9am, according to the BoM. Horsley Park, 50km west of the city, had recorded 88mm.</p> 
<p>Between noon and 2pm, the State Emergency Service had rescued 21 people from vehicles caught in flash flooding in the Sydney metropolitan area, a spokesperson said.</p> 
<p>“It’s a reminder that flash flooding can occur quickly and without warning, and if people do come across a flooded road, they should stop, turn around and find an alternate route.”</p> 
<p>Since midnight, the SES had responded to more than 500 calls for assistance due to trees down, roof damage, and requests for sand bags, particularly in the southern and central western parts of NSW and metropolitan Sydney.</p>

<p>Late Monday morning, the SES warned residents of a number of Sydney suburbs to stay indoors due to heavy rainfall. By about 1.30pm, the warning had been downgraded, but residents were advised to drive slowly and to stay clear of fallen trees, power lines and any damaged buildings.</p> 
<p>“For people driving home this afternoon during peak hour traffic due at about 5pm, they should really heed the warnings through emergency services, and if they do come across a flooded road, just don’t take the risk,” the SES spokesperson said.</p>

<p>The senior meteorologist Jonathan How had said earlier there was potential for damaging to destructive winds and giant hail throughout the day.</p> 
<p>“We have seen some high rainfall totals starting to build with those storms pushing through,” he said, with “plenty more showers to come”.</p> 
<p>Severe thunderstorms brought 2-6cm hail in Boorowa, Harden and Temora.</p> 
<p>“The risk is not over yet,” the senior meteorologist Miriam Bradbury warned early on Monday afternoon.</p> 
<p>Areas to the west of the NSW ranges were due to “high end severe thunderstorms” on Monday. These “very dangerous” systems were predicted to bring destructive wind gusts of up to 125km/h.</p> 
<p>Just after 4pm on Monday, the bureau issued a severe thunderstorm warning for heavy rainfall, large hailstones and damaging winds over the NSW northern interior, including parts of the north-west and central west slopes and plains, riverina, upper and lower western districts.</p> 
<p>“The driving factor of this wet, stormy weather is a low-pressure trough lying through NSW,” Bradbury said. “That trough is helping to draw in moisture from the north and off the ocean, feeding it into any showers, storms and rain areas that develop. It’s fairly stagnant, it’s not moving anywhere very quickly.”</p> 
<p>Severe storms were likely to continue on Tuesday, but in Victoria conditions would start clearing from the afternoon, she said.</p> 
<p>In Victoria, the State Emergency Service had received more than 680 requests for assistance since Saturday morning.</p> 
<p>In the 24 hours to 9am on Monday, rainfall totals reached 89mm in Murrumburrah, north of Gundagai. Coonabarabran recorded 61mm overnight, while 43mm of rain was observed at Gunnedah, and 54mm at Mount Palmer, in the Hunter.</p> 
<p>How advised people in central and eastern NSW and eastern Victoria to keep an eye on the radar and stay up-to-date with warnings from the weather bureau, state emergency services and authorities.</p> 
<p>The bureau issued a severe weather warning for the NSW south coast, including Batemans Bay, Eden, Bega, Moruya and Merimbula.</p> 
<p>In Victoria, heavy rainfall would continue over east Gippsland, How said, with the potential for severe thunderstorms across the north-eastern parts of the state. Thunderstorms could also reach Melbourne’s outer suburbs by Monday afternoon.</p> 
<p>A severe thunderstorm warning for “heavy to intense rainfall” was issued by VicEmergency for parts of Gippsland, including Sale, Maffra, Bairnsdale, Orbost, Buchan and Mallacoota.</p> 
<p>Orbost, in Victoria’s Gippsland region, recorded 28mm since 9am .</p> 
<p>Wet conditions were expected to linger on Tuesday in eastern NSW, with drier conditions expected on Thursday and Friday.</p>
