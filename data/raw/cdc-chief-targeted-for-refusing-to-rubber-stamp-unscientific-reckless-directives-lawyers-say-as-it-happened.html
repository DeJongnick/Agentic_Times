Then it was the dismissal of seasoned scientists. Now, Robert F Kennedy Jr and HHS have set their sights on “weaponizing public health for political gain” and “putting millions of American lives at risk”, lawyers for Monarez said in a statement. “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted. Dr. Monarez has neither resigned nor received notification from the White House that she has been fired, and as a person of integrity and devoted to science, she will not resign.”</p></li> <li><p>At least three CDC senior officials resigned after<strong> </strong>Monarez was ousted. One squarely blamed <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong>’s leadership.</p></li> <li><p>“I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponization of public health,” Dr <strong>Demetre Daskalakis</strong>, who resigned as director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases told colleagues.</p></li> <li><p>Public health experts are sounding the alarm about the chaos at the CDC, as at least three senior leaders resigned following the ouster of the apparent ouster of the CDC director.</p></li> <li><p>As a Senate-confirmed official, only the president has the authority to fire her, and, for once, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has been strangely silent as this drams unfolded. But the White House press office issued a statement saying that Monarez had been removed, not by Trump but by “the White House”.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-28T02:18:05.032Z">at 3.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68afb7108f080ebbe15bd6b0" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-28T02:02:57.607Z">3.02am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Unlike Kennedy or Trump, CDC director mourned officer who defended CDC from gunman</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>While differences over vaccines appear to have been central to the rift between the ousted CDC director, Susan Monarez, and Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, Monarez also stood out from her bosses by mourning for the officer who died defending the agency’s campus in Atlanta from a gunman who was driven by misinformation about the Covid-19 vaccine.</p> <p>While Monarez publicly mourned David Rose, who, as our colleague <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/27/atlanta-cdc-shooting-david-rose">George Chidi wrote</a>, was murdered by a lie, others in the CDC were distressed that Kennedy said little, and Trump nothing about the attack on their campus.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/CDCMonarez/status/1958979280358007132">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A large group of CDC employees and I attended today&#39;s memorial for Officer David Rose, whose Tour of Duty ended on August 8 when he responded to shots fired.

It’s unclear whether the CDC director—confirmed just weeks ago—has been fired or not.

The recent change in the adult and children’s immunization schedule threaten the lives of the youngest Americans and pregnant people,” Daskalakis wrote, in reference to the decision in May, for the CDC to remove its recommendation of the Covid-19 vaccine for healthy children and pregnant women.</p> <p>He added that the data to support this change was never shared with the CDC and that a public information sheet on the change, “written to support the Secretary’s directive” was circulated by the health department “without input from CDC subject matter experts”.</p> <p>Daskalakis also called out Kennedy’s fondness for “social media posts announcing major policy changes” without consulting CDC experts in advance. “Having to retrofit analyses and policy actions to match inadequately thought-out announcements in poorly scripted videos or page long X posts should not be how organizations responsible for the health of people should function,” he wrote.</p> <p>“The intentional eroding of trust in low-risk vaccines favoring natural infection and unproven remedies will bring us to a pre-vaccine era where only the strong will survive and many if not all will suffer,” he added. “I believe in nutrition and exercise. I believe in making our food supply healthier, and I also believe in using vaccines to prevent death and disability. Eugenics plays prominently in the rhetoric being generated and is derivative of a legacy that good medicine and science should continue to shun.”</p> <p>“The recent shooting at CDC is not why I am resigning,” Daskalakis wrote, drawing attention to the gunman who fired hundreds of rounds into CDC buildings who was motivated by unfounded theories about injuries from the Covid-19 vaccine that Kennedy has promoted.</p> <p>“My grandfather, who I am named after, stood up to fascist forces in Greece and lost his life doing so. I am resigning to make him and his legacy proud. I am resigning because of the cowardice of a leader that cannot admit that HIS and his minions’ words over decades created an environment where violence like this can occur. I reject his and his colleagues’ thoughts and prayers, and advise they direct those to people that they have not actively harmed,” Daskalakis wrote.</p> <p>“For decades, I have been a trusted voice for the LGBTQ community when it comes to critical health topics,” the doctor, who formerly led HIV/AIDS prevention at the CDC, and once <a href="https://www.advocate.com/exclusives/2021/12/13/how-cdcs-dr-demetre-daskalakis-stood-frontlines-2021?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAaehBQup8dqpYVCCmMazwa6Bpjc1n8EgXxaCu97rSzDKGdvjIcawMjjYetasWQ_aem_2ObGv1j92E7_gjJvJ53UeQ">dressed in drag to administer meningitis vaccines</a>, added. “I must also cite the recklessness of the administration in their efforts to erase transgender populations, cease critical domestic and international HIV programming, and terminate key research to support equity as part of my decision.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-28T01:36:41.689Z">at 2.36am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68af92718f080ebbe15bd5cb" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-27T23:55:25.993Z">12.55am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">RFK Jr 'weaponizing public health' and 'putting millions of American lives at risk', ousted CDC director's lawyers say</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Susan Monarez</strong> was removed from her position as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday without being told why she was fired, her lawyers said in a statement.</p> <p>“First it was independent advisory committees and career experts.

Informed consent and shared decision-making must focus not only on the risks but also on the true, life-saving benefits that vaccines provide to individuals and communities. It is, of course, important to question, analyze, and review research and surveillance, but this must be done by experts with the right skills and experience, without bias, and considering the full weight of scientific evidence. Recently, the overstating of risks and the rise of misinformation have cost lives, as demonstrated by the highest number of US measles cases in 30 years and the violent attack on our agency.”</p> <p>Houry’s statement seemed like a clear response to recent statements and actions to limit access to vaccines by the anti-vaccine health secretary, <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong>.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/leadership/ncezid-director.html">Dr Daniel Jernigan</a></strong>, who resigned as director of the premiere US center for the study of emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases, told colleagues: “I believe strongly in the mission of public health and the leadership that CDC has given for almost 80 years; however, given the current context in the Department, I feel it is best for me to offer my resignation.”</p> <p>Jernigan, whose center included the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office, <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CDC_SSCP-Testimony-for-02.15.2024-Hearing.pdf">testified to Congress last year</a> that the CDC estimates that the vaccination of children born between 1994 and 2021 “will prevent 472 million illnesses and 29.8 million hospitalizations, help avoid 1,052,000 deaths, and save nearly $2.2 trillion in total societal costs”.</p> <p>He also pointed to research that, as of November 2022, Covid-19 vaccines had “saved more than 3.2 million lives in the United States, prevented more than 18.5 million hospitalizations, and averted over $1.15 trillion in healthcare costs”.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-27T23:42:25.222Z">at 12.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68af874e8f081f67d77bfaab" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-27T22:45:08.255Z">11.45pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">CDC immunization director cites 'ongoing weaponization of public health' for resignation – report</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>“I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponization of public health,” Dr <strong>Demetre Daskalakis</strong>, who resigned on Wednesday from his position as the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC told colleagues in <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-ousted/">an email obtained by STAT</a>, a health news site.</p> <p>Those concerns were echoed by another departing CDC leader, Dr <strong>Deb Houry</strong>, the chief medical officer, who wrote that “ongoing changes prevent me from continuing in my job as a leader of the agency” adding that science should “never be censored or subject to political interpretations”.</p> <p>The two CDC leaders, and their colleague <strong>Daniel Jernigan</strong>, who ran the Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, quit the agency after the abrupt departure of <strong>Susan Monarez</strong>, the Senate-confirmed director of the CDC.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-27T23:16:01.179Z">at 12.16am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68af82898f081f67d77bfa73" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-27T22:43:44.543Z">11.43pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Key event</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>US officials announced on Wednesday the departure of the director of the nation’s top public health agency, after less than one month in the job.</p> <p>“Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
