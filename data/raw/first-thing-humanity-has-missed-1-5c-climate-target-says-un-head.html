The cuts come months after its chief executive warned white-collar employees their jobs could be taken by artificial intelligence. The Amazon senior vice-president Beth Galetti wrote in a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction">blog post</a> that “this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet”, and added that Amazon needed to be “organized more leanly, with fewer layers”.</p> <h2><strong>Don’t miss this: ‘DeepSeek is humane.
