<p>A baby girl named Remi, born just minutes into the new year on the NSW midnorth coast, is believed to be the first Australian birth of 2025 – and the first of “generation Beta”.</p> <p>Tzu-Ling Huang and Liam Walsh had a quiet New Year’s Eve planned at their home in Comboyne, but their daughter surprised them and arrived two weeks early.</p> <p>Remi was born at 12.05am on Wednesday.</p> <p>The parents said the arrival of their first child was momentous. </p> <p>“The attention is exciting,” Walsh said. “We thought Remi might be the last baby of 2024 and it was a surprise to be the first of 2025.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>“We just want to provide a happy life for Remi to grow up and live how she wants.”</p> <p>Family members from Newcastle travelled to Port Macquarie base hospital for their first cuddles with Remi. The family plans to travel and visit more family once Remi has her passport.</p> <p>Obstetrics and gynaecology registrar Dr Sarah Keenan, who worked with midwives to deliver Remi, said she was “so absorbed in the moment” she “completely missed the clock ticking past midnight”.</p> <p>“I was so excited when our midwife called out the time of birth at 00.05,” she said.</p> <p>“It was a surreal experience and an unforgettable way to celebrate the new year that I will cherish for the rest of my career. The midwives in our team on the night were incredible and I want to thank them.”</p>    <p>NSW Health was unable to confirm whether Remi was officially the first child born in the country in 2025, as they do not have oversight of other jurisdictions. But when compared to other 1 January babies, Remi appears to have been the first.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/first-sydney-baby-of-the-year-born-on-new-years-day/news-story/f134130075a64f6d53a73f6c94fead0b">first Sydney baby of the year</a>, Shawn Cedric Biansi, was born at 12.32am at the Royal hospital for women in Randwick.</p> <p>Baby Pippa Elliot was <a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8857465/canberra-welcomes-first-of-generstion-beta-babies-in-2025/?msg=login">born at 12.19am</a> at North Canberra hospital.</p> <p><a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/welcoming-generation-beta-the-first-babies-of-2025/news-story/b056f7f8cdede4e82e8435eeea87c59b">In Victoria</a>, baby Hannah Nguyen was born at 12.16am at the Joan Kirner women and children’s hospital.</p> <p>A baby boy born at Mandura’s Peel Health Campus at 12.41am was <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/kayla-and-raven-te-awas-baby-born-one-of-the-first-born-in-perth-in-2025-and-the-first-of-generation-beta--c-17253624">one of the first in Western Australia</a>.</p> <p>And <a href="https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/tallulah-webster-among-the-first-babies-of-2025-and-of-gen-beta/news-story/9a1b90b469d90b77098c305859e50971">in South Australia</a>, baby Tallulah Webster was born at 7.33am at the Women’s and Children’s hospital.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/02/new-year-goals-25-ways-to-make-your-life-easier-cheaper-and-more-fun-in-2025">New year goals: 25 ways to make your life easier, cheaper and more fun in 2025</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All these 1 January babies are among the first children belonging to generation Beta, spanning those born between 2025 and 2039. </p> <p>They will be the children of younger millennials and older gen Zs, according to market research firm McCrindle Research.</p> <p>By 2035, they are expected to make up 16% of the global population, and many will live to see the 22nd century.
