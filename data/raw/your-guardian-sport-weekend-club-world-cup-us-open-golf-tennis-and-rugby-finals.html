South Africa are 213-2 in their second innings, needing 69 more to win, after a wonderful partnership between Aiden Markram and an injured Temba Bavuma. Join Geoff Lemon on our over-by-over report, before he joins Ali Martin, Andy Bull and Simon Burnton to review all of the action.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/jun/14/australia-vs-south-africa-world-test-championship-final-cricket-day-four-live-blog-updates-scores-results-teams-lords"><sub>Read more</sub></a></p> <p>3pm</p> <p>Bath v Leicester live</p> <p>Premiership rugby final</p>  <p>Bath are aiming to roll back the years by claiming their first league title since 1996 against another of the game’s storied clubs at Twickenham. Under Johann van Graan the regular-season table-toppers have already enjoyed a bumper season, claiming silverware in the Premiership Rugby Cup in February and European Challenge Cup last month. What chance a treble 12 months on from their 25-21 final defeat by Northampton? Staging something of a grand farewell party are Tigers, who have a host of key figures bidding a last hurrah: Ben Youngs, Dan Cole, Mike Brown, Julián Montoya, Handré Pollard and the head coach, Michael Cheika, all bow out after the final – and signing off with English rugby’s prime silverware would be quite the sendoff. Your live host Lee Calvert keeps the updates flowing while Robert Kitson and Michael Aylwin report from a sold-out Twickenham.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/jun/14/bath-v-leicester-premiership-final-live"><sub>Read more</sub></a></p> <h2></h2> <p>5pm</p> <p>Queen’s Club </p> <p>Tennis</p>  <p>Saturday’s first semi-final will see Germany’s 37-year-old Tatjana Maria take on second seed Madison Keys, while Chinese first-seed Qinwen Zheng will play American Amanda Anisimova. Sean Ingle is our reporter courtside in west London.</p> <p>6pm</p> <p>US Open third round live</p> <p>Golf</p>  <p>Nine years ago, the last time Oakmont hosted the US Open, Scottie Scheffler was a 19-year-old amateur when he made an opening 69. Although he went on to miss the cut in 2016, the American world No 1 is back as a heavy favourite to win back-to-back major titles following his US PGA Championship triumph. That would give Scheffler the third leg of a career grand slam and he would join a list of Oakmont winners which includes Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Ernie Els. Scott Murray keeps you updated with rolling coverage of the third round while Ewan Murray reports from Pennsylvania.</p>   <p>9pm</p> <p>Canadian Grand Prix qualifying live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>Max Verstappen will have to keep out of trouble as he chases an unprecedented fourth Canadian Grand Prix win in succession, with only a penalty point between the defending champion and a race ban. The Red Bull driver has won for the past three years in Montreal, the last time after starting alongside Mercedes’s pole-sitter, George Russell – the same rival he clashed with two weekends ago – in a qualifying draw. How Verstappen will respond is an open question but others are sure to want to take whatever advantage they can of the situation at a circuit famed also for changeable weather. Yara El-Shaboury keeps track of the action with our rolling blog.</p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>1am</p> <p>Al Ahly v Inter Miami live</p> <p>Club World Cup</p>  <p>Alexander Abnos is your host as Fifa’s billion-dollar global club tournament gets under way in Miami. Thirty-two teams take part, with the matches staged across 11 cities in the United States, the month-long event involves the English clubs Chelsea and Manchester City. Inter Miami’s involvement rests on their winning the MLS Supporters’ Shield for the best performance in the regular season, even though LA Galaxy went on to win the actual MLS playoffs and were left out. That meant organisers could shoe-horn in the eight-time Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi as well as Luis Suárez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba. Barney Ronay reports from the Hard Rock Stadium.</p> <p>5pm</p> <p>England v Slovenia live</p> <p>European Under-21 Championship</p>  <p>Lee Carsley is confident there is more to come from his young squad after the holders opened their campaign with a 3-1 win over the Czech Republic. They next face Slovenia in Nitra, before their last group fixture against Germany. “I definitely expect us to keep improving, the longer we can stay in the tournament,” says Carsley, who had seen his side fail to pick up victories in their last two warm-up matches against the Netherlands and Spain, alongside a 5-3 defeat by France in March. Rob Smyth helms our minute-by-minute coverage.</p>   <p>6pm</p> <p>US Open final round live</p> <p>Golf</p>  <p>Scott Murray returns to provide expert commentary on the closing stages at Oakmont where many of the big names have struggled. The tournament will come to the boil at a venue with a history of dramatic finishes, including Dustin Johnson’s fraught finale in 2016, Ernie Els’s three-way tussle in 1994 and Johnny Miller’s barnstorming surge to victory in 1973.</p>
