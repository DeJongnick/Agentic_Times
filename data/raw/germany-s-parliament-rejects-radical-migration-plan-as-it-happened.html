<p><em>in Athens</em></p> <p>The <strong>Bundestag debate</strong> was being followed closely in <strong>Greece</strong>, an EU frontier country that has seen migration flows jump considerably with refugee arrivals on <strong>Crete</strong> and the adjacent isle of <strong>Gavdos</strong> increasing six-fold last year to the astonishment of locals.</p> <p>As Europe’s southernmost point, Gavdos in particular has become the focal destination for would-be asylum seekers setting off from the port city of <strong>Tobruk</strong> in <strong>Libya</strong>. Boats are frequently crammed with unaccompanied minors.</p> <p>Greece’s centre-right government has applied what it has called a “tough but fair” migration management policy. But for migrant solidarity workers, the measures, including containing refugees in closed controlled access centres (CCAC) on Aegean isles, have been unduly harsh - a reflection, say NGOs, not only of political sentiment across the continent but of the unspoken desire to deter would-be asylum seekers from making similar journeys.</p> <p>This week, the Human Rights Legal Project (HRLP), described conditions in the safe zone area of Samos island’s CCAC’s – the zone where unaccompanied minors reside – as “horrific.”</p> <p>“The area, which was originally designed to accommodate 200 children, is now hosting 485 unaccompanied minors, many of whom lack shoes and adequate clothing,” it said.</p> <p>Shortages not only included beds and lack of access to education and health services but basic products such as soap and toothpaste.</p> <p><strong>Refugee Support Aegean,</strong> another NGO, also deplored the “inadequate presence of organisations and authorities” to deal with the upsurge in flows to the country. The lack of preparedness, had it said, resulted in ever growing numbers of newly arrived refugees being compelled to stay in “unsuitable facilities without basic necessities” in Gavdos and Crete.</p>   <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/27/how-people-smugglers-set-sights-on-tiny-greek-island-gavdos">‘Pushed to the limit’: the tiny Greek island in people smugglers’ sights</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-01-31T16:40:31.844Z">at 4.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-679cf8078f083390b0b977b6" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/jakub-krupa"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-01-31T16:25:17.130Z">4.25pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Ooh, this is an interesting one.</p> <p><a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestag-fdp-will-abstimmung-ueber-migrationsgesetz-der-union-verschieben-a-49286684-0e9a-4d76-8e5c-c6226a6c33c0">As Der Spiegel notes</a>, the parties that technically declared their support for the bill would have the majority if all their members voted for it.
