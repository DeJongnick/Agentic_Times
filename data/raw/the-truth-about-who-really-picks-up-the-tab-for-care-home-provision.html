<p>Your article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/18/older-people-34000-a-year-care-home-residential-care-crisis-provision" title="">Soaring care home costs mean you now pay £34,000 a year</a>, 18 November) fails to give an accurate account of the financial obligations of self-funders. This happens all too often across the media. Local authorities do not “pick up the tab” when a person’s assets fall to £23,250. In fact, LAs continue to take £1 per £250 on a sliding scale until a person’s assets reach £14,250. At this point a care home resident is allowed to hold on to the remaining sum. However, their contributions do not end there as a council will claw back any pensions, state or private, while also expecting families to pay top-up fees. My mother has severe dementia and has been in a nursing home for over four years and has paid over £250,000, having been compelled to sell her two-bedroom flat and use her savings.</p> <p>One of the major problems is the privatisation of care homes as there is no limit to what they can charge a self-funder when demand is so high. This inevitably means that a person’s resources diminish quickly and then the LA has to step in. A few years ago I became aware of newspaper advertisements around the world encouraginge people to invest in UK care homes as they’d be assured of a 8% return on their stake. Yes, there is a compelling need for a concrete plan on the future of social care, but it must re-examine the whole structure on which provision is founded. Our elderly must not be treated as mere commodities but with the dignity and fairness they deserve.<br><strong>Diane Wall</strong><br><em>Sidcup, Kent</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Join the debate – email </em></strong><a href="mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com" title=""><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>• Read more Guardian letters – </em></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters" title=""><strong><em>click here to visit gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p>
