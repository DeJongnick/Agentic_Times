<p>A motorway bridge collapse has killed at least three people and injured seven as spans of the partly built structure collapsed one after the other.</p> 
<p>The accident took place on Tuesday in Anseong, about 70km (43.5 miles) from Seoul, when five 50-metre steel support structures collapsed in turn after being hoisted into place by a crane, the Yonhap news agency reported. The collapse was captured by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2025/feb/25/bridge-collapse-in-south-korea-kills-at-least-three-people-video">rear-facing dashcam of a car on a road beneath</a>.</p> 
<p>The national fire agency said three people died and six were injured, including five who were in a critical condition. Other reports said there were seven injured.</p> 
<p>Authorities were searching for another person who was thought to be buried under rubble at the site, the fire agency said.</p> 
<p>Hunting for survivors, rescue workers at the site were seen examining twisted metal struts and fractured concrete slabs below the columns of the highway bridge.</p> 
<p>South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, called for mobilisation of all available personnel and resources to rescue any missing people and to ensure public safety.</p> 
<p>The transport ministry said it had dispatched officials to the scene.</p>
