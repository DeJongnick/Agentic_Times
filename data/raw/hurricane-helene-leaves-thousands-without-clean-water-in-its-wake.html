<p>Hurricane Helene left a path of devastation behind, with storm-ravaged areas struggling to access safe water for days because flooding damaged sewage systems, wastewater treatment plants and pipes that deliver drinking water to residents in the affected areas.</p> <p>Boiling water advisories and water conservation orders are in place in counties in <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hurricane-helene-map-drinking-water-boil-advisory-1961660">Florida</a>, <a href="https://www.augustaga.gov/3237/Hurricane-Helene-Water-Boil-Information">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://www.tn.gov/environment/news/2024/10/1/mandatory-water-conservation-order-boil-water-advisories.html">Tennessee</a> and <a href="https://montva.com/1/news/n/2024/09/30/new-river-valley-regional-water-authority-issues-boil-water-notice">Virginia</a>.</p> <p>More than <a href="https://www.ncdhhs.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/01/ncdhhs-urges-safe-water-usage-following-hurricane-helene#:~:text=Currently%2C%20approximately%20160%20boil%20water,or%20illness%20after%20the%20storm.">160</a> boil water advisories were in effect in North Carolina as of Tuesday.
