The University of Oxford topped the list for the 10th consecutive year, while the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, Princeton University and University of Cambridge were also in the top five.</p> <p>It came after the QS World University Rankings <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/19/top-australian-universities-tumble-in-global-ranking-amid-trump-era-attacks-and-international-student-cuts-ntwnfb">placed 10 Australian institutions</a> in its top 100.

In response, the university said it could have provided “clearer active notice” about its use of wifi location data but maintained it was “reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances”.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="embed">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
