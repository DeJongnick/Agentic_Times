<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position:</strong> 12th (NB: this is not necessarily Sophie Downey’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> <p><strong>Last season’s position:</strong> 10th</p> <h2>Prospects</h2> <p>Leicester’s rather muted pre-season got turned upside down with the announcement that the club had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/27/leicester-sack-manager-amandine-miquel-11-days-before-their-wsl-opener">parted ways with the manager Amandine Miquel</a> 11 days before the start of their campaign.</p> <p>On the face of it, the decision appears to be harsh on a manager who will feel she was building something after a rollercoaster of a first year. As injury after injury rolled in during the first four months of last season, Miquel cut an increasingly baffled figure at her side’s constant run of bad fortune and her lack of centre-forward options. Jutta Rantala, Lena Petermann and Noémie Mouchon sustained season-ending injuries; Shana Chossenotte was troubled by recurrent injury issues; and Deanne Rose and Hannah Cain continued their recovery from long-term problems. The defensive midfielder Saori Takarada and Ruby Mace were among those given a try-out in the No 9 role as Miquel tried to find a solution.</p> <p>An impressive 1-1 draw at home to Chelsea in December proved a turning point. A strong finish meant Leicester recorded their highest WSL points tally, securing 10th place. They were a team built on solid defensive play, quick transitions and a strong trust in young players – a hallmark of Miquel’s style – and the foundations looked to have been laid for the coming campaign.</p> <p>There has been player turnover this summer and recruitment has been a challenge. Seven players have left, leading to a loss of experience. Petermann, Takarada and CJ Bott returned home and the departures of the ever-present Sophie Howard to FC Como and Yuka Momiki to Everton will have been a blow.</p> <p>Only three players have come through the door. The 18-year-old goalkeeper Katie Keane is one of the Republic of Ireland’s brightest young talents and made the move from Shamrock Rovers. The experienced midfielder Celeste Boureille arrived from Montpellier and Heather Payne also signed.</p> <p>Leicester’s problems could mount rapidly given their tough start. They face Manchester United and Chelsea in the first three games, a challenge that has become more difficult in recent days.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/leicester-pastfiveyears/giv-325543vKaPuQwAcUN" data-alt="How they finished in the past five seasons"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/leicester-pastfiveyears/giv-325543vKaPuQwAcUN">Interactive</a> <figcaption>How they finished in the past five seasons</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The manager</h2> <p>The rumour mill is circling around who Miquel’s replacement could be, with Matt Beard a strong contender after his shock departure from Burnley. As it stands the team are manager-less at a time when several key rivals are recruiting significantly. Whoever comes in will have their work cut out and will need to get a young team up to scratch very quickly to avoid a washout.</p> <h2>Off-field picture</h2> <p>The appointment of Lee Billiard as director of women’s and girls’ football was regarded as a coup after his four-year spell at Aston Villa as Leicester look to build for success on the pitch and commercially. Now without a manager and assistant manager – Amaury Messuwe also departed – he will be busy as the season approaches, with the squad also needing to be bolstered. Will the decision to remove Miquel prove to be the making or breaking of his tenure at the club?</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/1bjCv/1/" data-alt="Last season’s results"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/1bjCv/1/">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Last season’s results</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Star signing</h2> <p>In a relatively quiet summer to date, Payne has been the signing that has caught the eye. The Republic of Ireland international arrived after two years at Everton and getting over recent injury struggles. A versatile wide player, the 25-year-old has the attacking attributes to thrive as a winger but can equally be used as a full-back or wing-back. With more than 50 caps, she adds to Leicester’s growing international contingent and played a significant role in Ireland’s inaugural World Cup appearance in 2023.</p>    <h2>Stepping up:</h2> <p>The 17-year-old Nelly Las has had a year to remember for club and country and signed a new contract this summer. Her transition from Leicester’s academy, which she joined at the age of nine, to the senior setup has appeared seamless. She made her debut in the League Cup in October 2024 and has since been a regular in the matchday squad. A dynamic full-back, Las can play on either flank and was also utilised further forward by Miquel. She was a core member of the England squad that finished fourth at the Under-17 Women’s World Cup last autumn before helping the Under-19s qualify for next year’s U20 World Cup.</p> <h2>It was a good summer for…</h2> <p>Olivia Clark and Cain made history this summer as part of the Wales team that competed at Euro 2025. Clark, a goalkeeper, played in two of Cymru’s three matches. Cain, a forward, was a starter in their opener against the Netherlands before coming off the bench against France and England. She announced herself on the European stage with a finely taken goal against the Lionesses. Although Wales lost all three group games, it was a memorable summer for Rhian Wilkinson’s side, a first taste of major tournament football on which to build for the future.</p>    <h2>Main initiative to attract more fans</h2> <p>Leicester will continue to play at the King Power Stadium, with season ticket and matchday packages provided. A season ticket will not only get fans into every home game but also provide priority access to away games, exclusive events and retail launches and a 10% discount on stadium tour experiences. Children can also be a mascot (seven-11 years) and get an invitation to the junior Christmas party. The club put on coach travel to away games.</p>
