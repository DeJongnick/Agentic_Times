This comes as traders weigh up the potential for progress between the US and China, with talks due to get underway in Switzerland [at the weekend]. The response to that news has been surprisingly muted, with the Shanghai composite (up 0.8%) providing the one bright spot as domestic Chinese optimism builds. Nonetheless, coming off the back of a one-month period that has seen sharp gains for the DAX (+17%), IBEX (14%), Eurostoxx (13%), FTSE 100 (11%), and CAC (10%), it comes as no surprise that much of the upside of a resumption in US-China trade talks have been baked in.</p> <p>The DAX remains within touching distance of the all-time high of 23,479. In spite of those US-centric concerns, the German economy remains in a more positive position as the new chancellor <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong> looks to bring forth a new phase of increased spending and a potential resurgence for German business activity.</p> <p>This morning saw German factory orders jump 3.6% for the month of March, representing the strongest monthly increase since December. This growth in demand came particularly from other euro area nations (8%), while domestic (2%) and rest of the world (2.8%) demand also remained healthy. With Mertz now confirmed as chancellor after a second attempt, the economy looks to be in a more stable position as the government seeks to push forward with a plan to ramp up borrowing and spending in a bid to raise growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>Turning to tonight’s Federal Reserve meeting, where interest rates are expected to stay unchanged, he said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Looking ahead, today’s FOMC [federal open market committee] meeting undoubtedly provides the main event of note, with traders watching out for commentary from [Fed chair <strong>Jerome] Powell</strong> over the direction of travel for rates in the face of economic uncertainty. The sheer number of unknowns mean that we are highly unlikely to see the Fed cut rates this time around. However, the events of the past week have also seen markets lose confidence over the potential for a June cut, with a pause going from a 33% outside chance to the 70% base case.</p> <p>Nonetheless, traders still expect to see the bank cut rates another 3-4 times this year, and thus the outlook provided by Powell today will likely help inform markets over the direction of travel for rates.

Its market value has halved to about $310bn.</p> <p>This is likely to deepen investor concerns that Denmark’s biggest company is losing market share to its US rival Eli Lilly, which makes the diabetes and obesity drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.</p> <p>Hargreaves Lansdown analyst <strong>Susannah Streeter </strong>said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Obesity drug maker Novo Nordisk looked like a lean profit machine but its sales are turning flabbier as main rival Eli Lily gains more muscle in the space.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wegovy was the first of a new wave of anti-obesity drugs, known as GLP-1s after the gut hormone they mimic, to hit the market in 2023. Sales of the injectable drug totalled 17.36bn Danish kroner between January and March, down by 13% from the previous quarter. This was below the 18.7bn crowns forecast by analysts.</p> <p>Overall revenues rose by 18% and operating profits advanced by 20% at constant exchange rates in the first quarter, but Novo Nordisk said it was being hit by compounding — medications made by pharmacies using the active ingredients of patented drugs.</p> <p>As a result, Novo Nordisk cut its annual forecasts, ending a four-year run of upgrades. The Danish company now expects 13%-21% sales growth this year, down from the 16%-24% range given at the start of the year. Operating profits are expected to rise by 16%-24%, compared to the previous estimate of 19%-27% growth. </p> <p>Analysts are forecasting that sales and operating profit this year will grow by 17.8% and 21.5%.</p> <p>Chief executive <strong>Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In the first quarter of 2025, we delivered 18% sales growth and continued to expand the reach of our innovative GLP-1 treatments.</p> <p>However, we have reduced our full-year outlook due to lower than-planned branded GLP-1 penetration, which is impacted by the rapid expansion of compounding in the US.</p> </blockquote> <p>Novo reported first-quarter profits before interest and taxation of 38.79bn crowns, up 22% from a year earlier.</p>    <p><strong>Derren Nathan</strong>, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Novo Nordisk has lashed out at the controversial US compounding industry in its quarterly update, citing a focus on preventing unlawful formulations of semaglutide, the active ingredient in its weight-loss wonder jab Wegovy. In some cases US compounding pharmacies are allowed to formulate active medical ingredients into non-approved drugs to meet individual requirements or combat shortfalls in supply.</p> <p>Wegovy sales growth in the US was hardly pedestrian,at 39%, but it was international sales that drove most of the 83% uplift, as new markets open up. None of this was enough to prevent a downgrade to full-year guidance.</p> </blockquote> <p>News earlier in the year that the US drugs reglator FDA has declared the shortage of GLP-1 medicines as over is something of a double-edged sword, he said.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There’s a clampdown on compounders, but question marks remain over its enforcement. The end of the shortage also raises questions about the health of US demand. That’s also reflected in Novo’s deal last week with a US healthcare provider to provide Wegovy to patients at a discounted rate of $499.</p> <p>There’s intense competition too from Eli Lilly, both in injectables and in the race to bring an oral alternative to the market. These challenges have been reflected in a 40% decline in the share price over the last six months. Novo remains a key player in the biggest shift in healthcare treatment of our generation. This could mark an attractive entry point for opportunistic investors, but there’s a real job to do to restore market confidence.</p> </blockquote> <p>Competition is set to heat up further, with other drugmakers developing GLP-1 medications, and cheaper generic versions coming onto the market.</p> <p><strong>Sheena Berry</strong>, healthcare analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Currently, the obesity market is still dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, but there are numerous clinical trials ongoing with competitors looking to enter the space.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-05-07T08:39:00.471Z">at 9.39am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-681b0fba8f086f71ec8c8843" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/phillipinman"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-07T07:50:19.670Z">8.50am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Global debt surges to new record high of $324tn</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Global debt has hit a new record high of more than $324tn, fuelled by extra borrowing by Beijing as the Chinese authorities sought to offset the impact of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s tariffs with extra public spending.</p> <p>Debt rose by $7.5tn in the first three months of the year, according to figures from the Institute of International Finance (IIF).</p> <p>A modest increase in economic growth across much of Europe, the US and Asia meant that as a share of economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP), global debt edged down to almost 325%, maintaining a modest annual drop since a borrowing peak in 2021.</p> <p>The IIF, which represents 400 of the largest financial companies from more than 60 countries, said that while major industrialised countries either mainted or reduced debt-to-GDP ratios, emerging markets reached an all-time high of 245% in the first quarter of 2025.</p> <p>China’s government debt-to-GDP ratio has surged past 90%, up from 60% in 2019.</p> <p>The IIF said one of the greatest sources of rising debt could be found in Washington, where plans by the White House to reduce taxes without cutting spending could send the US debt-to-GDP ratio above 200%.</p>    <p>In a hard-hitting judgement on the US president’s first 100 days, the usually restrained IIF said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>US government debt levels are projected to soar over the next several years and could trigger increased market volatility unless new revenues can be sourced to offset planned tax cuts and extensions.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Tax breaks that are still in place from Trump’s first period in office could take the debt to GDP ratio to 180%.
