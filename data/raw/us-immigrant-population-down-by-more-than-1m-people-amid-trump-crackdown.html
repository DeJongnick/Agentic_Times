<p>The immigrant population of the United States, which has been growing for more than 50 years, has declined by more than a million people since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> took office in January and defined immigration as a threat to the nation, not one of its strengths. </p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/21/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/">a new study</a> by the Pew Research Center, there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the US in January, when Trump took office for the second time. By June, that number had dropped to 51.9 million. </p> <p>Among all US residents, 15.4% were immigrants as of June 2025, down from the recent historic high of 15.8% in January. </p> <p>The Pew survey also found that 750,000 immigrant workers had dropped out of the US labor force since January, which is now 19% foreign-born. </p> <p>The center pointed to several policy changes that have affected immigrant populations across the US, including Joe Biden’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/30/biden-asylum-restrictions-mexico-border-immigration"> restrictions</a> on asylum applications in 2024, which led to a significant decrease in border crossings involving immigrants seeking asylum.</p> <p>Additionally, the center pointed to Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/trump-2-immigration-first-100-days">181 executive actions</a> targeting immigration, including the arrival of new immigrants and the mass deportation of non-citizen immigrants.</p> <p>The center noted that the change in the data could be due to a declining survey response rate among immigrants.</p> <p>Mexico remains the largest origin country among US immigrants. As of mid-2023, more than 11 million US residents were born in Mexico, marking nearly a quarter, or 22%, of all immigrants nationally. Nevertheless, immigration from Mexico has declined since 2007 and the Mexican-born population in the US has dropped. From 2010 to 2023, the Mexican share of the US immigrant population dropped from 29% to 22%, according to Pew’s research.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/23/sanctuary-cities-trump-administration-funding">Judge blocks White House from defunding 34 municipalities over ‘sanctuary’ policies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second-largest immigrant group was from India, at 3.2 million, or 6% of the total immigrant population, as of mid-2023. The next largest immigrant groups were from China, at 3 million, or 6%, followed by the Philippines, at 2.1 million, or 4%, and Cuba, at 1.7 million, or 3%.</p> <p>In July, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention">a Guardian analysis </a>of arrest and deportation data revealed how Trump has “supercharged the country’s immigration enforcement apparatus – pushing immigration officials to arrest a record number of people”. </p> <p>The analysis found that average daily arrests were up by 268% compared with June 2024 and that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) was targeting all unauthorized immigrants, including people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/ice-arrests-migrants-trump-figures">with no criminal records</a>.</p> <p>The analysis also found that the US had deported more than 8,100 people to countries that are not their home country.</p> <p>Trump’s crackdown on immigration has shown no signs of stopping, with the state department <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/trump-administration-news-today">announcing</a> this week that it is reviewing the records of more than 55 million foreign citizens with visas allowing them to visit or reside temporarily in the US for potential revocation.</p>
