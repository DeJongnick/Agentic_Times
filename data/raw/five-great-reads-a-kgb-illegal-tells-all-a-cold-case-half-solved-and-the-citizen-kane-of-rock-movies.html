<p>Top of the (long) weekend to you all. I trust Australian readers marked Good Friday in the traditional fashion: by complaining that nothing was open. Before you head to the shops to restock, here are some amazing tales to pore over.</p> <h2>1. The nameless girl found dead in a Spanish border town</h2>    <p>A young woman’s body was found hanging from a pine tree in Portbou one morning in 1990. The position she was found in suggested she could not have got there alone but her death was ruled a suicide and the mystery girl’s body was buried in a mass grave at the local cemetery.</p> <p>A 2022 true crime program revived interest in the case. An Austrian TV network broadcast a short follow-up segment. An Italian holidaying there with relatives emailed in a tip. The next day the Austrian show’s director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/apr/15/mystery-girl-found-hanged-spanish-border-town-portbou">made a call to someone who had given up looking for answers</a>.</p> <p><strong>Art imitates life: </strong>The police officer turned author Rafael Jiménez in 2017 wrote a novel, imagining the girl’s story, called The Hanging Bride in the Land of Wind.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Twelve minutes.</p> <h2>2. The great seafood robbery</h2>    <p>From smoked salmon to award-winning cheddar, luxury foodstuffs have become hot property for UK criminals. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/apr/13/who-stole-all-the-cheese-the-inside-story-of-the-boom-in-luxury-food-heists">the thieves – sophisticated and clearly “specialists” in artisan produce</a>, according to the victims – are using all the methods in the online scammers’ toolbox to pull off their heists.</p> <p><strong>Main character energy: </strong>In the most meta moment in Five Great Reads history, the aggrieved fishmonger in this story is Chris Swales (no relation, I think).</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Six minutes.</p> <h2>3. A father’s fight to keep his wife’s dream alive</h2>    <p>Making the decision to send your children to school wouldn’t be an inflection point in most films but it marks the moment the hero of A New Kind of Wilderness admits he can no longer cope. The documentary follows Nik Payne, who with his wife, Maria, was raising and home schooling their children in remote Norway – until cancer claimed Maria’s life.</p> <p>Now the remaining Payne family are touring the world’s film festivals, holding Q&amp;As after screenings. They made the mistake the first time of sitting through A New Kind of Wilderness in full. As Patrick Barkham, who caught up with Nik Payne and his three children, writes: “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/15/a-new-kind-of-wilderness-film-nik-payne-norway-interview">Watching him grieve on film is agonising</a>.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>“It’s part of you for ever but it’s not the defining part.” – Nik Payne on grief.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Four minutes.</p> <h2>4. ‘I have a story to tell you’</h2>    <p>If your father sat you down for a chat and that was his opening line, where would you mind race to? Were your parents breaking up? Were you really adopted?</p> <p>Peter Herrmann, 16, was finally about to learn the reason his father detested US pop music. Turns out dad was a deep-cover KGB spy, and that conversation was the catalyst for Herrmann’s recruitment by Moscow as a second-generation “illegal”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/apr/10/deep-cover-kgb-spy-recruited-son-peter-herrmann-illegals">The man codenamed “the Inheritor”</a> shares the story of his brief career in espionage.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Fourteen minutes.</p> <p><strong>Further viewing: </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/30/secrets-lies-new-cold-war-how-the-americans-became-topical">The Americans</a> is somehow still one of the more slept-on shows of the prestige TV era.</p> <h2>5. The rock movie that time forgot (until now)</h2>    <p>When you read the phrase “the Citizen Kane of rock movies”, what springs to mind – The Wall? Purple Rain? The film critic Mark Kermode was in fact referring to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/14/citizen-kane-rock-movies-glam-rockers-slade-in-flame">Slade in Flame</a>, released in 1975 as a vehicle for the band behind such misspelled glam anthems as Cum On Feel the Noize.</p> <p>Featuring canal-side conversations about the meaningless of life amid pintloads of grimness, it tanked upon release. On the eve of its 50th anniversary re-release, the band and film-makers reflect on its favourable reassessment.</p> <p><strong>How long will it take to read: </strong>Four minutes.</p> <p><strong>Sneak preview: </strong>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqJv_DDOKe0&amp;t=36s">film’s trailer</a> suggests it may have more in common with Ken Russell’s Tommy than Orson Welles.</p> <h2>Sign up</h2> <p>Enjoying the Five Great Reads email?
