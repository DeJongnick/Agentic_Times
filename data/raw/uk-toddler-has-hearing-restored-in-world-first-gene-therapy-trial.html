<p>A British toddler has had her hearing restored after becoming the first person in the world to take part in a pioneering gene therapy trial, in a development that doctors say marks a new era in treating deafness.</p> <p>Opal Sandy was born unable to hear anything due to auditory neuropathy, a condition that disrupts nerve impulses travelling from the inner ear to the brain and can be caused by a faulty gene.</p> <p>But after receiving an infusion containing a working copy of the gene during groundbreaking surgery that took just 16 minutes, the 18-month-old can hear almost perfectly and enjoys playing with toy drums.</p> <p>Her parents were left “gobsmacked” when they realised she could hear for the first time after the treatment. “I couldn’t really believe it,” Opal’s mother, Jo Sandy, said. “It was … bonkers.”</p> <p>The girl, from Oxfordshire, was treated at Addenbrooke’s hospital, part of Cambridge university hospitals NHS foundation trust, which is running the <a href="https://www.senselab.neurosciences.medschl.cam.ac.uk/our-research/chord-gene-therapy-clinical-trial">Chord trial</a>. More deaf children from the UK, Spain and the US are being recruited to the trial and will all be followed up for five years.</p> <p>Prof Manohar Bance, an ear surgeon at the trust and chief investigator for the trial, said the initial results were “better than I hoped or expected” and could cure patients with this type of deafness.</p> <p>“We have results from [Opal] which are very spectacular – so close to normal hearing restoration. So we do hope it could be a potential cure.”</p> <p>He added: “There’s been so much work, decades of work … to finally see something that actually worked in humans …. It was quite spectacular and a bit awe-inspiring really. It felt very special.”</p> <p>Auditory neuropathy can be caused by a fault in the OTOF gene, which makes a protein called otoferlin. This enables cells in the ear to communicate with the hearing nerve. To overcome the fault, the new therapy from biotech firm Regeneron sends a working copy of the gene to the ear.</p> <p>A second child has also recently received the gene therapy treatment at Cambridge university hospitals, with positive results.</p> <p>The overall Chord trial consists of three parts, with three deaf children including Opal receiving a low dose of gene therapy in one ear only.</p> <p>A different set of three children will get a high dose on one side. Then, if that is shown to be safe, more children will receive a dose in both ears at the same time. In total, 18 children worldwide will be recruited to the trial.</p> <p>Opal is the first patient globally to receive the therapy and is “the youngest globally that’s been done to date as far as we know”, Bance said.</p> <p>The gene therapy – DB-OTO – is specifically for children with OTOF mutations. A harmless virus is used to carry the working gene into the patient.</p> <p>The trial is “just the beginning of gene therapies”, Bance said. “It marks a new era in the treatment for deafness.”</p> <p>Martin McLean, a senior policy adviser at the National Deaf Children’s Society, said deafness should never be a barrier to happiness or fulfilment. “Many families will welcome these developments, and we look forward to learning about the long-term outcomes for the children treated.”</p> <p>With Opal’s hearing restored, her parents now have a fresh problem to contend with: their daughter’s new favourite hobby is slamming cutlery on the table to make as much noise as possible.</p>
