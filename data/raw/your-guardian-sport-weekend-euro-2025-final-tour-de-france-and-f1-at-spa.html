Preparations for the showpiece event are in full swing, with both teams gearing up for what is sure to be a compelling climax between the holders and the world champions. <strong>Emillia Hawkins</strong> will be bringing you all the latest from Switzerland throughout the day, along with news and transfer updates from the wider football world.</p> <p>11am</p> <p>Australia v British &amp; Irish Lions second Test live</p> <p>Rugby union</p>  <p>A beefed-up Australia will look to win the physical battle at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and avoid the ignominy of losing the series with a Test to spare in front of a bumper crowd of 95,000. The home coach, Joe Schmidt, will look for more power in the collisions from the loose forward Rob Valetini and the lock Will Skelton, whose collective brawn was missed in Brisbane as the duo nursed calf problems. Nine Ireland players are in Andy Farrell’s starting XV. It’s a chance to clinch a first series win in the 12 years since Warren Gatland’s team beat Robbie Deans’ Australia 2-1. Victory at the MCG would also make Farrell’s Lions the first to wrap up the series with a match to spare since the 1997 tour of South Africa. <strong>Lee Calvert</strong> helms our live blog, with <strong>Robert Kitson</strong> and <strong>Gerard Meagher</strong> in Melbourne.</p>   <p>11am</p> <p>Tour de France stage 20 live</p> <p>Cycling</p>  <p><strong>John Brewin</strong> is your host for a busy day of live cycling. In the men’s Tour, Tadej Pogacar took a huge step towards winning his fourth title by stealing a march on Jonas Vingegaard on the formidable Col de la Loz. The penultimate stage sees the race cross the Jura towards Pontarlier, making its first Tour appearance since 2009, when Alberto Contador won the stage to Verbier. British interest focuses on the young Scot Oscar Onley, whose hopes of a podium finish took a blow on La Plagne on Friday. This summer’s <strong>Tour de France Femmes</strong> gets under way later on Saturday, with Kasia Niewiadoma ready to defend the title she so dramatically seized by just four seconds in 2024. <strong>Jeremy Whittle</strong> is our reporter in France.</p> <p>11am</p> <p> England v India, fourth men’s Test live</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p>Who better than <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> and <strong>Tim de Lisle</strong> to guide you through the over-by-over action on day four of yet another compelling Test in a dramatic series? Anyone seeking a lesson from the past will note that when England last faced India at Old Trafford, in early August 2014, the hosts won by a tidy innings and 54 runs. England took nine wickets after tea to bowl India out for 161, with the spinner Moeen Ali taking four for 39. That was after poor Stuart Broad had his nose broken by an Varun Aaron bouncer at the end of England’s first innings. <strong>Ali Martin</strong>, <strong>Simon Burnton</strong> and <strong>Taha Hashim</strong> form our expert reporting cadre in Manchester.</p>   <p>11am</p> <p>Belgian GP sprint race and qualifying live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>Formula One returns from its midseason break and for its first gathering in 20 years without Christian Horner in the paddock. The Red Bull principal was dumped after Silverstone and there is sure to be plenty of focus on Max Verstappen’s foundering team, despite the world champion insisting that he is staying put – with a winning car, that is. The rivalry between the McLarens could also take a significant twist at Spa. After two wins in a row, Lando Norris trails teammate Oscar Piastri by just eight points in the title race. That’s the same number awarded for a sprint win – but the Australian is on pole for Saturday’s sprint. <strong>Tom Bassam</strong> will cover all the action live, with the sprint race at 11am and qualifying at 3pm. <strong>Giles Richards</strong> reports.</p> <p>4.10pm</p> <p>The King George at Ascot </p> <p>Racing</p>  <p>The big race on Saturday is the King George VI And Queen Elizabeth Stakes, which is being billed as a rematch between Jan Brueghel and Calandagan. Francis Graffard’s Calandagan triumphed in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and has form at Ascot, romping home in last year’s King Edward VII Stakes. Rebel’s Romance and Kalpana are also in with a shout. <strong>Greg Wood</strong> reports from Ascot.</p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>12pm </p> <p>Tour de France Femmes live</p> <p>Cycling</p>  <p><strong>Michael Butler</strong> picks up the stage two action and whirls you along to the finish in Quimper. This year’s Tour has grown to nine stages and now heads east across France to a conclusion in the Alps. Our live blogging team then switches to live coverage of the final stage of this year’s men’s <strong>Tour de France</strong> from 4pm. To mark the 50th anniversary of the first finish on the Champs Élysées, it’s no champagne-sipping procession into the heart of Paris this time: <em>mais non</em>, it’s three laps of the Champs circuit, then three times up the Butte Montmartre. <strong>Jeremy Whittle</strong> will cover the climax.</p>   <p>2pm</p> <p>Belgian Grand Prix live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>Last year at Spa, Lewis Hamilton inherited victory after his then Mercedes teammate George Russell was disqualified, his car 1.5kg underweight – about the same as a medium-sized pineapple. Since this season’s move to Ferrari the picture has been mixed for Britain’s seven-time world champion. His scarlet car now boasts a new floor and updated suspension, upgrades that should help him on the fast and flowing Spa circuit – although he span out of sprint qualifying on Friday. It’s a big race for the Scuderia, with <strong>Luke McLaughlin</strong> your live host. <strong>Giles Richards</strong> is at the track.</p> <p>5pm</p> <p>England v Spain live</p> <p>Euro 2025 final</p>  <p>England have reached their second successive Women’s Euros final through sheer grit. Late goals by the 19-year-old Michelle Agyemang rescued the Lionesses in their quarter-final against Sweden and semi-final against Italy to set up Sunday’s decider against the world champions, Spain. It’s a third consecutive major tournament final for Sarina Wiegman’s team and a chance for revenge against the side that beat them in the 2023 World Cup final. It’s a huge day for women’s football, with Emillia and <strong>Dominic Booth </strong>leading the pre-match buildup.<strong> Sarah Rendell</strong> will cover all the match action, minute by minute. In Basel, our team of <strong>Suzanne Wrack</strong>, <strong>Tom Garry</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Liew</strong> will report on the final.</p>
