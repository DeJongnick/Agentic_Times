<h1>Study arts and humanities because you love them (and so do employers, by the way)</h1>

<p>I reflect on GCSE results day with a sense of pride tinged with sadness. Proud because this year’s cohort achieved fantastic results, given the challenges they have faced since the pandemic, but sad because for many it will be the last time they study humanities (languages, history and religious and classical studies) subjects.</p> <p>I won’t hide my bias: I studied Spanish, history and philosophy and ethics at A-level, and Latin and religious studies at GCSE, so I’m a strong advocate for the humanities. Yet, they’re steadily becoming an unpopular choice, with <a href="https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/documents/5468/British-Academy-report-Subject-choice-trends-post-16-education-England.pdf">only 38% of students</a> taking at least one humanities course in the 2021/22 cohort compared to just under 60% from 2003/4 to 2015/16.</p> <p>One reason for this decline can be traced back to Michael Gove’s decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/jan/23/michael-gove-a-level-reforms">decouple AS-levels from A-levels</a> – with many students now forgoing AS-levels altogether in favour of the new two-year A-level course. Students who might previously have studied three Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects and one humanities for AS-level are narrowing their choices to three much earlier as a result of the split. But I fear there’s another factor influencing young people’s decisions: money.</p> <p>On the surface it seems to make sense. According to findings from the House of Commons Library, the average debt for students who started university last year will be an <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn01079/">estimated £45,600</a> by the time they finish their courses. Even young people who decide not to go to university face a prolonged<a href="https://www.bigissue.com/news/politics/inflation-rates-2024-uk-cost-of-living-crisis/"> cost of living crisis.</a></p> <p>Times are tough, so studying Stem subjects has a greater draw. Boys who study two or more Stem subjects at A-level <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/science-and-maths-send-girls-future-wages-soaring">earn 7.8% more</a> on average. Girls who study the same earn a whopping 33.1% more.</p> <p>But Stem subjects aren’t the only route to a lucrative career. Any humanities student would know things are rarely that black and white.</p> <p>David Rubenstein, the co-founder and chairman of private equity firm The Carlyle Group, has argued that policymakers and educators have put too much focus on Stem subjects. “The reasoning skills that come with a well-rounded humanities education actually result in higher-paying jobs over time,” <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/carlyle-co-founders-formula-for-success-study-the-humanities/">he argued</a> at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2014.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/aug/21/ministers-urged-to-act-over-numbers-failing-english-and-maths-gcses">Ministers urged to act over numbers failing English and maths GCSEs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Private equity is one of the most lucrative and sought-after careers in finance, let alone the wider job market; Carlyle is one of the biggest firms in private equity, with <a href="https://ir.carlyle.com/static-files/374d8136-a509-4812-8578-e17eb2911f1f#:~:text=With%20%24435%20billion%20of%20assets,29%20offices%20across%20four%20continents.">$435bn of assets</a> under management; and Rubenstein is a billionaire who, similar to Jay-Z, uses his creativity to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIUG3rDyP-Y">rap about how much money</a> he’s making.</p> <p>Rubenstein valued the problem-solving skills humanities subjects teach so much that he came up with an acronym to accompany his argument. “H=MC. Humanities equals more cash.” But just in case Rubenstein’s humanities argument isn’t enough, take mine.</p> <p>I interned at a couple of private equity firms while studying history at university and without a single Stem qualification beyond GCSE. I saw first-hand how my skills were valued in the industry.</p> <p>First, my understanding of languages and cultures was an advantage. Private equity means international business and teams are often split into different regions. On both internships I worked with teams focusing on European investment and I was struck by the number of languages spoken in the office. While I never had to speak Spanish at work, the fact that I knew the language helped me to understand reports and relate to my Spanish-speaking colleagues.</p> <p>Second, the analytical skills I developed while studying history were key when providing investment recommendations in board meetings with my colleagues. I remember reading report after report to prepare my case for a real estate development in Berlin. I had to understand the social factors such as immigration to the city, the politics of Berlin rent caps and the economic implications that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would have on material costs. My ability to digest information and form an opinion was key when making persuasive arguments.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/19/to-be-16-today-is-totally-different-to-when-i-was-growing-up">What does it mean to be 16 today? It is totally different to when I was growing up | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Third, I applied my critical thinking to monitor a tobacco company’s takeover of an inhaler company. While it didn’t take tutoring from Aristotle to realise that the deal was wrong, or controversial at best, my grounding in philosophy and ethics helped me to articulate this to my colleagues.</p> <p>All aspects of my humanities A-levels were put to use. I’m sure a grounding in Stem, economics or finance wouldn’t have hurt, but I felt well equipped. I soaked up all the basic accounting and finance skills I needed through training and learning on the job.</p> <p>Corporate recruiter and author of The DIY Career Switch, Andrew Osayemi, told me that a generalist skill-set is valuable across professions. “Once those beginning themes are learned you are on the same level as anyone else, regardless of what they studied,” he said. “One of the key skills employers are looking for is problem-solving. Whether you use technology to solve a problem or your hard work and intelligence, employers don’t care. They just want the problem to be solved.”</p> <p>Humanities subjects provide students with this key skill. From there it’s about showing your interest in a certain career and gaining experience. There is no one-size-fits-all approach or linear route to success. So, as our young people receive their GCSE results today, I’d encourage them to remain open to different subjects, interests and career paths for as long as possible. Both to get the maximum enjoyment out of learning – and to make sure we have truly diverse workforces.</p> <ul> <li><p>Xaymaca Awoyungbo is a freelance football writer and film director</p></li> </ul>
