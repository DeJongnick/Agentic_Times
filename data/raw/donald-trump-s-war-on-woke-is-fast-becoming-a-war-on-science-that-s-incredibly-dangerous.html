<p>Donald Trump’s attacks on diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives since his January inauguration have been intense, indiscriminate and escalating. A tragic plane crash was baselessly blamed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvmdm1m7m9o">on DEI</a>. All <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/">DEI programmes within public bodies</a> have been ended and private contractors face cancellation if they also don’t comply. Webpages that <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/pentagon-removes-web-pages-about-holocaust-remembrance-9-11-to-comply-with-trump-dei-order/ar-AA1BgxAw?ocid=BingNewsSerp">defend religious diversity</a> in the context of Holocaust remembrance have been taken down.</p> <p>Science and academia have been particularly targeted. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-dei-college-investigation-phd-project-65d5d9bd5a13db89bea730142b467fde">Universities are threatened</a> with losing federal funding if they support DEI. Government reports and government-funded research are being held back if they include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/trump-health-dei-orders-risk">prohibited terms</a> such as “gender”, “pregnant person”, “women”, “elderly”, or “disabled”. Grants funded by the National Institutes of Health are being <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/07/nih-terminates-dei-transgender-related-research-grants/#:~:text=In%20an%20unprecedented%20move%2C%20the,and%20inclusion%2C%20transgender%20issues%2C%20or">cancelled</a> if they address diversity, equality or inclusion in any form.</p> <p>What is more, this total “war on woke” (more accurately: “fight against fairness”) is happening in the UK as well as the US. Already, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-finance-watchdogs-drop-woke-diversity-push-amid-trump-backlash/">British companies and British watchdogs</a> are abandoning their diversity drives. Tory leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/17/kemi-badenoch-western-civilisation-will-be-lost-tory-party-fails">Kemi Badenoch has described</a> diversity initiatives as a “poison”.</p> <p>These attacks are rooted in wilful distortions of what DEI is all about. There are two big lies that need to be nailed. The first is that diversity and inclusion initiatives compromise the quality of employees by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5280368/intellectual-disabilities-air-traffic-controllers-faa-trump">selecting incompetent candidates</a> because of their minority group membership. The second is that DEI is <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/comment/the-times-view/article/the-times-view-on-diversity-policies-dei-another-day-b3b0fs3v6">a distraction that holds back success</a>. Let’s consider each in turn, using the field of science itself as an example.</p> <p>The notion that DEI involves putting group membership before ability and leads to the appointment of incompetent candidates is a misrepresentation of what DEI initiatives are all about. Scientific ability is not restricted to one sex, ethnicity or religion, or to the able-bodied. Embracing diversity has the simple advantage of <a href="http://www.na-businesspress.com/JLAE/Pemberton-JonesEJ_Web12_2_.pdf">widening the pool of talent</a> from which scientists are drawn. DEI initiatives are about ensuring that less competent members of the most privileged groups are not advantaged over more competent members of less privileged groups.</p> <p>Bias starts at school, particularly in the <a href="https://journals.le.ac.uk/index.php/new-directions/article/view/2966">physical</a> sciences, where both girls and boys consider these “boy subjects” <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/46062/chapter-abstract/404545771">by the time they are teenagers</a>. Even once you start your academic career, bias affects grant <a href="https://eos.org/articles/twenty-years-of-nsf-funding-show-racial-disparities">funding </a>decisions and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01498-1">publication </a>rates. Women and minorities face additional barriers to <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/87062">career progression</a>: for instance, both <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9352587/">female </a>and <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/significant-inequalities-affect-non-white-researchers-when-publishing-their-work/">ethnic minority</a> scientists receive less credit for their work than male or white scientists respectively. Bias affects whether <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bes2.2033">you feel at home</a> in the scientific workplace. Institutions that tackle the many workplace barriers for women and ethnic minorities (child-unfriendly working hours, tolerance of harassment, culturally insensitive socialisation practices) have higher retention rates among <a href="https://www.paradigmpress.org/SSSH/article/view/1460">women</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-0335.00284">minority </a>researchers. Diverse workplaces <a href="https://www.mededportal.org/doi/full/10.15766/mep_2374-8265.11472">attract more diverse staff</a> to apply for jobs – creating a positive feedback loop. And we know that scientific research teams and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1915378117">institutions that prioritise diversity</a> perform better.</p> <p>As for the second myth that DEI is a barrier to success, diversity actually improves the quality of science. <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19905/revisions/w19905.rev0.pdf">Evidence</a> shows that scientific papers produced by ethnically diverse teams are more impactful than those written by homogeneous teams. Similarly, <a href="https://wepub.org/index.php/TEBMR/article/view/4527">studies</a> show that diverse teams consider more alternatives and make better decisions.</p> <p>Scientists from diverse backgrounds raise new research questions and priorities – especially questions that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31633016/">affect minoritised communities</a>. The lack of women in the higher echelons of biomedical science has led to a comparative lack of research into <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8812498/">menstrual and reproductive health problems</a>. The lack of black scientists has led to a neglect of conditions that affect black people such as <a href="https://www.sicklecellsociety.org/challenging/">sickle cell disease</a>. And when it comes to the intersection of “race” and sex, things are even worse. It is only in the last few years that it even became known that black and Asian women are <a href="https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/assets/downloads/mbrrace-uk/reports/MBRRACE-UK%20Maternal%20Report%202018%20-%20Lay%20Summary%20v1.0.pdf">much more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth</a> than white women.</p>    <p>Medical sciences and social sciences have long suffered from a lack of diversity in research design, leading to worse medicine because findings do not apply to all populations. For example, clinical trials have tended to test treatments mainly on <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37664573/">men</a> and <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1718-7729/31/9/396">on white people</a>, leading to poorer health outcomes for women or minorities. A <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jso.28010">diverse group of researchers</a> makes members of minorities more willing to volunteer for trials and helps ensure diverse participant recruitment. This improves scientific validity. It also increases the trust of minorities in the outputs of research (<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2215609">say, the development of new vaccines</a>) and hence the societal impact of the research (<a href="https://www.covidvaccineresearch.org/news/study-shows-much-lower-vaccination-rates-among-black-people-compared-other-ethnic-groups">say, their willingness to get vaccinated</a>).</p> <p>All in all, ensuring diversity and equality and inclusion among scientists makes for better scientists and better science. While our examples are drawn from science, they are true much more broadly. DEI initiatives are about ensuring that we always select the best irrespective of group membership, not about selecting by group membership irrespective of who is best. Science is fundamentally about discovering truth through rigorous, unbiased, transparent inquiry and narrow pools of talent or perspectives make that much harder. Therefore,<strong> </strong>DEI initiatives are necessary to achieving the core mission of science, not a distraction from it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Christina Pagel is a professor of operational research within UCL’s clinical operational research unit.
