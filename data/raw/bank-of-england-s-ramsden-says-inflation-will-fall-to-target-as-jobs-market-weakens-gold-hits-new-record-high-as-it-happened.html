As a result, gross public debt (as measured by the IMF) is now at 101% of GDP, which is historically high outside of major wars and meaningfully exceeded only by Italy (135%) and France (115%) in Europe, Japan (237%) and the US (121%).</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Secondly, the public deficit is high:</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In 2024, the UK had the third-highest deficit at 5.7% of GDP among European countries, and the fifth-highest among 36 advanced economies, surpassed only by the US, France, Slovakia and Israel. The deficit is also elevated on a “structural” basis—excluding interest payments and the effects of the cycle—which the government has struggled to reduce meaningfully since Covid.</p> <p>The UK’s accounting of the BoE’s QT losses, moreover, will put additional upward pressure on public debt in coming years.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Third, borrowing costs are high relative to growth.</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>While UK growth has been broadly similar to other advanced economies, inflation has remained notably higher than elsewhere. As a result, the Bank of England has lowered the policy rate more slowly and Bank Rate remains in restrictive territory. This adverse macro mix implies that the UK faces one of the highest interest rate/growth differentials across advanced economies—often referred to as “r-g”—which plays a key role in the assessment of debt sustainability.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fourth, the UK has one of the highest current account deficits across advanced economies.</strong></p> <p><strong>Goldman</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>While not directly relevant for the dynamics of public debt, <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/rogoff/files/from_financial_crash.pdf">research</a> shows that large “twin” deficits have historically been associated with fiscal crises, with markets requiring a larger term premium in countries that run large current account deficits.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Fifth, the structure of UK debt has become more unfavourable:</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The<strong> </strong>UK retains a large share of inflation-linked debt, with the proportion of linkers rising from 10% in the late 1980s to 25% now (twice as high as the next advanced economy, Italy, with 12%). As a result, UK debt dynamics have been more exposed to high inflation than in other economies in recent years.</p> </blockquote> <p>BUT it’s not all bad. Goldman point to a number of factors that mitigate the UK’s fiscal vulnerability compared with other advanced countries. They include the UK’s “strong fiscal institutions”, the government’s fiscal rule, and its “long and encouraging track record of fiscal consolidation”….</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68da4e508f08c0f8b6cd7f49" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-29T11:09:40.098Z">12.09pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Gold hits $3,800 per ounce as rally continues</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The gold price has surged over the $3,800 per ounce mark for the first time today.</strong></p> <p>The spot price of gold is up 1.5% at $3,819 per ounce, meaning the precious metal’s value has jumped 45% so far this year, on track for its strongest annual gains since 1979.</p> <p>Today’s rally is being credited to expectations of a U.S. rate cut and concerns about a potential government shutdown.</p> <p>I’ve looked at some of the other factors here:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/28/bullion-bonanza-why-is-gold-hitting-record-highs">Bullion bonanza: why is gold hitting record highs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Paul Williams</strong>, managing director of <strong>Solomon</strong> <strong>Global</strong>, now envisions $4,000/oz being hit by the end of this year, saying: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Gold has increased almost $400 since August 22nd, supported by numerous factors including a softening US dollar, inflation concerns, anticipated additional rate cuts from the Fed, declining confidence in risk assets, ongoing geopolitical flashpoints and continued accumulation by central banks.</p> <p>These dynamics and this momentum look set to remain, putting gold on a trajectory that makes $4000 by Christmas a strong possibility.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68da65fc8f08206a90f08b80" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-29T10:59:24.529Z">11.59am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>A new healthcheck on UK borrowing shows that people are taking out more credit, as demand for new home loans fades a little.</strong></p> <p>The Bank of England has reported that UK consumer borrowing rose at the fastest pace since October 2024 in the 12 months to the end of August.</p> <p>Net consumer borrowing rose by £1.692bn, up from £1.669bn in July.</p> <p>Net mortgage approvals for house purchases decreased by 500 in August, to 64,700.

There’s an exciting pipeline ahead and, this year alone, GSK’s on track for five major regulatory approvals. Her reign also saw a line drawn in the sand in the Zantac litigation case, removing a key financial uncertainty.</p> </blockquote> <p>But, <strong>Nathan</strong> adds, GSK’s share price performance has been lacklustre on Walmsley’s watch:</p> <p>He points out that its stock trades at a significant discount to the peer group, adding:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Although her record of delivering on financial guidance has been strong, the company’s growth rates remain stuck in single digit territory.
