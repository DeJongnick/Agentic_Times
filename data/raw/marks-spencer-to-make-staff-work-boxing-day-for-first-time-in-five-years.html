<p>Many Marks &amp; Spencer staff will be expected to work on Boxing Day for the first time in five years as the retailer has ditched its offer of an automatic holiday in an attempt to cut costs.</p> <p>Workers said some colleagues were upset by changes to Christmas working, under which all staff must work at least one of 26, 27 and 28 December and be available to work all three days in the run-up to Christmas Day.</p> <p>An M&amp;S document seen by the Guardian said that last year more than 40% of permanent and 30% of seasonal workers did not work one of the peak days and, as this was not enough to restock shops sufficiently, this year “all colleagues must play their part to deliver a successful Christmas”.</p> <p>It is understood that this year about a quarter of store staff will work on Boxing Day alone.</p> <p>It is understood that the changes began to be implemented in March, before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/25/marks-and-spencer-pauses-online-orders-cyber-attack-fallout">cyber-attack in April</a> that caused weeks of disruption.</p> <p>Posts on M&amp;S’s internal messaging board describe the new setup as a “slap in the face” and “like a punishment” after a tough period trying to operate stores with limited technology after the cyber-attack.</p> <p>While all large stores will remain closed on the Boxing Day bank holiday, the clothing, food and homewares retailer has told workers they will have to take the day as part of their annual holiday allocation. Only a limited number of workers will be able to book the day off, in an attempt to “save costs and reduce complexity”.</p> <p>Since Christmas 2020, during the Covid pandemic, M&amp;S has asked for volunteers to work on Boxing Day and has in effect automatically given the day off to most workers. Only small food stores and some discount outlets have opened. Last year, it publicly said it kept stores closed “in order to give our colleagues a much-deserved extended break with their family and loved ones”.</p> <p>Jayne Wall, operations director for M&amp;S, said: “Christmas at M&amp;S is very special and we are grateful to our hardworking colleagues who make our stores great places for our customers to shop. Like most retailers, we always have some colleagues in our stores and depots on Boxing Day to help reset. However, this year we will have more colleagues working than previously so we are in great shape to welcome customers on 27 December.”</p> <p>The closure of most M&amp;S stores on Boxing Day started as a “thank you” after workers put in long hours during the pandemic, and covered staff in stores and head office as well as the group’s distribution centre in Castle Donington, Leicestershire.</p> <p>A similar decision was made by large retailers including Waitrose and The Range as well as John Lewis, which has traditionally given its workers the bank holiday off. Morrisons gave workers Boxing Day off only in 2021 and most leading retailers open on that day.</p> <p>One M&amp;S worker told the Guardian that he felt colleagues had been “strong-armed into agreeing to work more hours”.</p> <p>“This has been an incredibly difficult year for colleagues dealing with the cyber incident and the company has been reluctant to give extra hours to stores, so many stores are dealing with low colleague numbers. After such a hard time many colleagues feel this is an extra slap in the face.”</p> <p>Another member of staff posted on the group’s internal messaging service: “Over recent months it’s been recognised that colleagues have gone above and beyond, doing everything asked of them to keep standards high and deliver excellent service during very challenging times.</p> <p>“That’s why it feels especially disheartening that Christmas – such a precious time for family – is being disrupted for so many of us. Instead of feeling rewarded for our commitment, it comes across more like a punishment.”</p>
