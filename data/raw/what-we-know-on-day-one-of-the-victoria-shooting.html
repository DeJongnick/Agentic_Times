The officers killed were a 59-year-old detective and a 35-year-old senior constable.</p></li> <li><p>Another police officer was shot and has undergone surgery. </p></li> <li><p>According to the chief commissioner of Victoria police, <strong>Mike Bush</strong>, the officers were<strong> </strong>“met by the offender, and they were murdered in cold blood”.</p></li> <li><p>Police have deployed hundreds of specialist resources, including air and ground, to find Freeman. </p></li> <li><p> The Porepunkah community was being urged to stay indoors on Wednesday until Freeman was apprehended. </p></li> <li><p>On Tuesday, Bush described the suspect’s address as a semi-rural property with a bus on site, which housed the alleged offender, his partner and children.</p></li> <li><p>The local council closed all facilities “effective immediately”, and Porepunkah primary school was in lockdown earlier on Tuesday. Principal <strong>Jill Gillies</strong> said on Tuesday afternoon almost all students had returned home, adding it had been “quite an ordeal”. </p></li> <li><p>The Police Association Victoria chief executive, <strong>Wayne Gatt, </strong>said “hundreds of our members” were continuing to “put themselves in danger right as we speak” in an attempt to apprehend the suspect.</p></li> <li><p>The Victorian premier, <strong>Jacinta Allan</strong>, said the thoughts of “all Victorians” were with the police, saying the response showed first responders’ “extraordinary bravery and courage”.</p></li> <li><p>The prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, said his thoughts were with the “police for the work they do, each and every day”. He said “the men and women who wear the uniform of the police take risks” for everyone.</p></li> <li><p>The mayor of Alpine Shire, <strong>Sarah Nicholas</strong>, said in a video message that Tuesday had been a day of “deep sorrow and shock” for the community. “We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of the two police officers tragically killed in Porepunkah. Our thoughts, love and unwavering support are with you during this incredibly painful time.”</p></li> </ul>  <p>•This article was amended on 27 August 2025.
