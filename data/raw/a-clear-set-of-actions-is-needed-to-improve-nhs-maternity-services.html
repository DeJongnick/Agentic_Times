<p>This inquiry (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/23/wes-streeting-announces-investigation-into-nhs-maternity-services">Wes Streeting announces investigation into ‘failing’ NHS maternity services, 23 June</a>) needs to get to the heart of why NHS maternity services in England are falling far short of where they need to be.</p> <p>It must leave no stone unturned; there are significant, systemic challenges that affect trusts’ ability to consistently deliver high-quality care, deep-rooted issues with morale and culture within maternity services and, as you highlight (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/23/the-guardian-view-on-maternity-care-failings-wes-streetings-new-inquiry-must-learn-from-past-mistakes-not-repeat-them">Editorial, 23 June</a>), the “shockingly higher risk of mortality faced by black and Asian mothers” and those from more deprived backgrounds.</p> <p>There have been innumerable recommendations and a regulatory landscape that has become complex, distracting and difficult for trusts to navigate. Trust leaders will welcome proposals to introduce one clear set of actions to improve care across every NHS maternity service.<br><strong>Saffron Cordery</strong><br><em>Deputy chief executive, NHS&nbsp;Providers</em></p> <p>• After a number of years overseeing maternity and perinatal services at regional level, this proposal frustrates me. The inquiry is purely politically motivated and will not add any value to the women, babies and families affected previously or who may be in the future. </p> <p>Multiple strategic transformation programmes have been commissioned and funded. There is nothing new to discover; obstetricians focus on healthy babies, midwives focus on happy mothers. The medical v social models of care make this an impossible divide, not helped by either group frequently failing to listen and respond effectively to women’s concerns.</p> <p>Perhaps when there are sufficient staff to work together as a team, and we place the woman at the centre of care and an effective digital infrastructure is in place to support effective communication, instead of focusing on the either/or approach of “high risk” v “low risk”, we might get somewhere.<br><strong>Ann Pearson</strong><br><em>Gatley, Cheshire</em></p> <p>• We do not need another review of failing maternity services. The national service development funding (SDF) for maternity services <a href="https://www.birthcompanions.org.uk/articles/maternity-services-funding-cuts-birth-companions-response">will be cut</a> from £95m in 2024-25 to just £2m in 2025-26.</p> <p>The patriarchy<strong> </strong>rules<strong> </strong>and as a consequence misogyny sets the tone for maternity care.<strong> </strong>Why else would there be gynaecology beds for women experiencing miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or termination on a postnatal ward?<br><strong>Zoe Green</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• Although failures in maternity care are of great concern, rather than simply chasing after the evidence of what failures look like and castigating those accused of “passing the buck”, perhaps Wes Streeting should also look at the 10 best performing units to find out what they do and how they achieve success. That might prove informative and more inspirational than (once again) punishing those that fail.<br><strong>Simon Gibbs</strong><br><em>Emeritus professor of inclusive educational psychology and philosophy, Newcastle University</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
