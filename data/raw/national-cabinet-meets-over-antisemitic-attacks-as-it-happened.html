  <p>Kershaw said that Special Operation Avalite was targeting high-harm antisemitism and the AFP-led Operation Ardvarna investigated the display of prohibited symbols. He said both operations had made arrests and more were expected soon.</p> 
  <p>Avalite received 166 reports since it was established in December last year, but Kershaw said many of those reports were duplicates, already under investigation by state police, or did not meet the threshold of a crime.</p> 
  <p>Avalite was investigating 15 serious allegations, he said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>All lines of inquiry are open to the investigations – including what anonymising technology, such as dedicated encrypted communication devices, have been used to commit these crimes.</p> 
   <p>We are looking into whether overseas actors or individuals have paid local criminals in Australia to carry out some of these crimes in our suburbs.</p> 
   <p>We are looking at if – or how – they have been paid, for example in cryptocurrency, which can take longer to identify.</p> 
   <p>We are looking into whether any young people are involved in carrying out some of these crimes, and if they have been radicalised online and encouraged to commit antisemitic acts.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Kershaw said he would meet with state police commissioners on Wednesday.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">AFP investigating if foreign actors paid local criminals to carry out antisemitic attacks</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The AFP commissioner, <strong>Reece Kershaw</strong>, has revealed his officers are investigating if “overseas actors” are paying local criminals to commit acts of antisemitism, which he described as a “disease” that “needs to be aggressively attacked”.</p> 
  <p>Kershaw, who said there was no doubt antisemitism was escalating and that it was having an impact on social cohesion “and crime in general”, also revealed that there were 15 serious incidents under investigation.</p> 
  <p>Kershaw’s statement was published about the same time as he addressed a national cabinet meeting on the issue.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Antisemitism is a disease in our community, and it needs to be aggressively attacked because history shows what happens when action is not taken against those who fuel fear and terrorise others.</p> 
   <p>I know many people feel they want more action to go with words.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">National cabinet agrees to new database to track antisemitic crimes</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The snap national cabinet meeting on antisemitism has ended, but seemingly without a great deal of news or new initiatives.</p> 
  <p>The only new initiative, according to a statement shared by <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>’s office, is “a new national database to track antisemitic crime and other antisemitic incidents and behaviours”.</p> 
  <p>“The commonwealth will work with states and territories on the development of the database,” Albanese said.</p> 
  <p>“The purpose of one national reporting system is to better inform and coordinate responses to antisemitic incidents.”</p> 
  <p>The statement says that state and territory leaders were “united in working together to stamp antisemitism out – and keep it out”. The meeting heard from the AFP commissioner, <strong>Reece Kershaw</strong>, who earlier gave an update that its Operation Avalite targeting antisemitism had received 166 reports, with 15 under investigation.</p> 
  <p>The statement goes on to outline that 36 people had been charged with “antisemitic related offences” in NSW, and 70 arrests had been made in Victoria.</p> 
  <p>“The prime minister reaffirmed that the full resources of the AFP and federal intelligence agencies stand ready to assist the efforts of Strike Force Pearl, Operation Shelter and Operation Park, and actions by other state and territory governments, as has been occurring to date,” Albanese’s statement said.</p> 
  <p>The meeting also agreed that “commonwealth, state and territory attorneys general will work to ensure best practice is shared across jurisdictions with Victoria and New South Wales leading this work”.</p> 
  <p>“The prime minister, state premiers and chief ministers unequivocally condemn antisemitism and reaffirmed to stamp it out in Australia.”</p>

  <p><strong>NSW police double size of strike force investigating antisemitism</strong></p> 
  <p>The NSW police commissioner, <strong>Karen Webb</strong>, has announced she has doubled the number of officers investigating antisemitic incidents in Sydney.</p> 
  <p>She said in a statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Today I have allocated an additional 20 investigators to Strike Force Pearl. This effectively doubles the investigative capacity of Strike Force Pearl, which continues to work tirelessly to identify and arrest those responsible for the recent antisemitic incidents in Sydney and put them before the courts.</p> 
   <p>I have also significantly increased proactive taskings aimed to disrupt this type of criminal activity around significant sites and places of worship across Sydney.</p> 
   <p>This boost in resources allocated to Strike Force Pearl reflects the seriousness of these crimes and the importance of putting those responsible before the courts as soon as possible. These acts are despicable and have no place in our society.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Eight people charged over alleged antisemitic incidents in Sydney</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>NSW police have charged eight people with 59 offences in relation to a spate of alleged anti-Israel and antisemitic incidents in Sydney in recent months.</p> 
  <p>One of those people was 34-year-old <strong>Tammie Farrugia</strong>, who appeared before court today after she was charged in relation to an incident in Woollahra in December which saw a home spray-painted with anti-Israel graffiti, and a car set alight.</p> 
  <p>Farrugia has been charged with participating in a criminal group to contribute to criminal activity and destroying or damaging property. She will appear before court again on 5 February and has made no application for bail.</p> 
  <p>It comes after a childcare centre in Sydney’s east was vandalised with antisemitic graffiti that read “Fuck the Jews” and was set alight. It is the sixth antisemitic attack in Sydney in two months, with counter-terrorism police called in to investigate after a Sydney synagogue was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/13/counter-terrorism-police-take-up-investigation-of-swastika-attack-at-sydney-synagogue">spray-painted with red swastikas</a> earlier this month. There have also been previous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/10/allawah-synagogue-graffiti-swastikas-southern-sydney-ntwnfb">attacks on synagogues</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/11/car-set-on-fire-and-buildings-vandalised-with-anti-israel-graffiti-in-sydney-ntwnfb">suburban streets</a> in Sydney.</p> 
  <p>NSW police said in a statement on Tuesday that eight people had been arrested under Strike Force Pearl, which was set up in the wake of a spate of antisemitic and anti-Israel graffiti. This included:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Three men – 20,19 and 21 – have been charged after 10 vehicles and buildings were allegedly deliberately damaged in Woollahra in November 2024.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Four men – 31, 27, 40 and 26 – have been charged following allegedly suspicious fires at two businesses in Bondi in October 2024.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Commissioner says Guardian inquiry shows ‘inadequacy’ of Australia’s approach to slavery</strong></p> 
  <p>On Monday, we revealed that <strong>thousands of imports</strong> were coming into Australia from Chinese companies <strong>blacklisted in the US over their alleged links to forced Uyghur labour</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Former Labor minister and Australia’s new anti-slavery commissioner, <strong>Chris Evans</strong>, has issued a strong statement about the Guardian’s findings.</p> 
  <p>Evans said the revelations demonstrate “the inadequacy of Australia’s current approach to addressing modern slavery risks in supply chains”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While the government’s commitment to reform is welcome, the pace of implementation remains concerning given the serious nature of these human rights violations.</p> 
   <p>Many businesses have been asking for clearer guidance to help address this issue. No business can address this level of complexity alone. However, these findings show many are simply ignoring the facts, relying on outdated strategies that are not fit for purpose. Clearly, both government and business must do more and we must start now.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Evans was appointed last year and commenced his role last month. The government has committed to reforming modern slavery laws, including to consult on a model allowing it to make written declarations that particular regions, industries, products or suppliers are regarded as high-risk for modern slavery.</p>

  <p>A teacher’s aide in NSW has been charged with allegedly engaging in child prostitution.</p> 
  <p>Police will allege in court the man met children online who he paid to film them engaging in sexual acts with him. Police will also allege he had a number of fraudulent online profiles which he would use to extort young children.</p> 
  <p>Last September, officers commenced an investigation into the activities of an 18-year-old Picton man.</p> 
  <p>On 24 November, detectives executed a search warrant in Picton and allegedly located and seized electronics relevant to the investigation.</p> 
  <p>About 8.45am today, detectives returned to the address and arrested an 18-year-old man. He was taken to Narellan police station and charged with two counts of acting as a client with a child aged 14-18 in prostitution, producing child abuse material and possessing child abuse material.</p> 
  <p>He was refused bail to appear in Moss Vale local court today. Police said investigations continue.</p>

  <p><strong>Jewish group backs national cabinet meeting on antisemitism</strong></p> 
  <p>The Executive Council of Australian Jewry has welcomed the announcement of today’s snap national cabinet meeting on antisemitism, calling for a “whole of government approach” to the issue.</p> 
  <p>Anthony Albanese is convening state and territory leaders at 5pm AEDT. We’ll expect some news shortly after that meeting. ECAJ co-chief executive <strong>Peter Wertheim</strong> said the Jewish community wanted to see concrete action, and noted his peak community group had been calling for such a meeting since late 2024. He said in a statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We welcome the Prime Minister’s announcement today that he will be convening the National Cabinet to deal with the crisis of antisemitism in Australia. This is a step which we called for in early December.</p> 
   <p>It is deeply saddening that the announcement comes in the wake of an arson attack on a child care centre. We look forward to National Cabinet providing Federal, State and Territory governments with the leadership and direction needed for them to attack the problem of antisemitism with a co-ordinated whole of government approach.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>ECAJ in December had called for uniform policing guidelines, law reform and public campaigns on antisemitism, including asking police to enforce existing laws on protests at schools and places of public worship.</p> 
  <p>The group also urged tougher bail and sentencing laws for antisemitic offences, as well as urging mandatory education against antisemitism, hatred and extremism in schools.</p>

  <p>Twyford will also be tasked with identifying best practice internationally for protecting children from sexual abuse, identifying perpetrators and responding to abuse. The inquiry is due to be completed later this year.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A three-year-old child was reportedly bitten on the leg in a dingo attack on K’gari in Queensland at the weekend.</p> 
  <p>The island, previously known as Fraser Island, is home to a colony of dingoes which are believed to be the most pure strain of animal in the east of the country. They are protected under Australian law.</p> 
  <p>The attack took place at about 5pm on Saturday 18 January, according to a spokesperson for Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service.</p> 
  <p>While walking with family on the beach near Kingfisher Bay, the child was bitten on the back of the leg by a tagged dingo. Despite efforts to scare the animal away, it wasn’t deterred.</p> 
  <p>People on two nearby yachts came to assist, with one using a kayak paddle to attempt to fend off the animal. The dingo kept a distance but was not deterred.</p> 
  <p>A spokesperson said QPWS rangers will attempt to identify the dingo involved, and additional safety signage was installed in the area.</p>

  <p><strong>Misinformation warning ahead of federal election</strong></p> 
  <p>Voters have been warned to expect more disinformation being used at the upcoming federal election, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Australia’s <strong>Election Integrity Assurance Taskforce</strong> has urged voters to be wary of claims being spread online in the lead-up to the poll, while also expressing concern about the threat of foreign interference.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.aec.gov.au/media/2025/01-20.htm">In a report published ahead of the election</a>, the taskforce said the national poll could be undermined by cyber criminals in Australia and overseas – and that while foreign actors could seek to disseminate misinformation during the campaign, the bulk of it was likely to come domestically. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While disinformation directed covertly by a foreign power is foreign interference, most disinformation does not involve a foreign power.

  <p><strong>Cheap loans for farmers under green bank scheme</strong></p> 
  <p>Farmers will soon be able to take out loans discounted by the government-owned green bank to cover the cost of planting native trees and shrubs on their land to draw down carbon.</p> 
  <p>As <strong>AAP</strong> reports, the concessional loans courtesy of the <strong>Clean Energy Finance Corporation</strong> (CEFC) and <strong>Rabobank</strong> are intended to cover the upfront cost of planting native trees on their properties before the vegetation starts sequestering carbon dioxide and paying itself off via carbon credits.</p> 
  <p>The agribusiness financier will kick in 0.15% of the discount and the government-owned green bank 1%, with the latter committing $200m towards the endeavour.</p> 
  <p>CEFC head of natural capital, <strong>Heechung Sung,</strong> said environmental planting sequestration had not been as popular as the lower cost techniques, such as human-induced regeneration methods that involve letting pastures regenerate and running fewer cattle and sheep.</p> 
  <p>By providing concessional loans and leveraging Rabobank’s relationship with agribusiness clients to educate them on the opportunity, Sung is hopeful more farmers will take the leap and produce more of the high-quality environmental planting credits.</p> 
  <p>While farmers have no regulatory obligation to produce carbon credits, Sung said customers were demanding change and companies were under pressure to decarbonise their supply chains.</p>

  <p><strong>Australian dollar slides as traders react to Trump tariff comments</strong></p> 
  <p>The Australian dollar has been whipsawed as investors react to mixed messages concerning <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s plans to impose tariffs on its trading partners. </p> 
  <p>The Aussie rose 1.2% overnight to 62.60 US cents, and continued its ascent after Asian markets opened to trade just under 63 US cents by lunch time in Australia after Trump stopped short of imposing tariffs on his return to the presidency.</p> 
  <p>Instead, he directed federal agencies to evaluate US trade relationships with the potential targets of his tariffs, which are China, Canada and Mexico.</p> 
  <p>Given tariffs are widely seen as inflationary, any signs of a pull-back from the tough tariff rhetoric that marked the US election campaign should deflate the value of the US dollar. </p> 
  <p>But the Australian dollar, and other non-US currencies, then fell sharply after the US president told reporters he was thinking of imposing 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.</p> 
  <p>He said the action could come on 1 February, according to Reuters.</p> 
  <p>The Australian dollar dropped immediately to 62.1 US cents before recovering slightly, while global stock markets also shed value.</p>

  <p><strong>Vandalism and racist attacks in Sydney ‘have no place in our community’: Shoebridge</strong></p> 
  <p>Greens senator <strong>David Shoebridge</strong> says the vandalism and racism across Sydney this past week has “no place in our community”, after the latest attack on a childcare centre at Maroubra. In a post to X, he wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The vandalism and racism across Sydney over the past week, from Wiley Park to Dover Heights, and now the appalling attack on a childcare centre in Maroubra, have no place in our community.</p> 
   <p>The Nazi graffiti, fires, antisemitic, anti-Arab and racist attacks are despicable. Everyone deserves to be safe, these attacks make us all feel less safe and make it harder to reach the goal of peace with justice both here and abroad.</p>

  <p><strong>Canavan on net zero and Paris climate agreement</strong></p> 
  <p>Queensland Liberal National senator and known coal advocate, <strong>Matt Canavan</strong>, has never been one to shy away from his position on climate change and renewable energy.</p> 
  <p>This morning, as <strong>Donald Trump</strong> began signing a series of executive orders at his inauguration, Canavan reiterated his position against the Coalition’s policy to support net zero emissions by 2050. Canavan wrote in a post to X:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Net zero is dead, buried and cremated.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>As one of his first acts as president, Trump signed an order he would pull the US out of the Paris agreement once more.</p> 
  <p>Last November, the climate change minister, <strong>Chris Bowen</strong>, declared the global agreement – to curb emissions and keep the rise in temperatures to below 2C above preindustrial levels – was working as it had brought the world back from “the brink of catastrophic 4C warming”. Canavan said on X:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is no reason Australia should remain in Paris when China, India, Indonesia, and now the US, are not.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Perth-based conglomerate <strong>Wesfarmers</strong> is winding down its e-commerce platform, <strong>Catch</strong>, after years of underperformance by the once promising online retailer.</p> 
  <p>Wesfarmers said in a statement that Catch’s e-commerce fulfilment centres will be transferred to Kmart Group, which houses the Kmart and Target businesses. Wesfarmers managing director <strong>Rob Scott</strong> said in a statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The recent increase in competitive intensity in the Australian e-commerce sector has affected Catch’s financial performance and growth prospects. </p> 
   <p>We thank the Catch team for their hard work improving the operating performance of the business and building valuable capabilities for the group. <strong>Where possible, opportunities for redeployment within the group will be offered to affected team members.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Wesfarmers bought Catch, known for its online Catch of the Day deals, from its founders in 2019 for $230m as part of its expansion into digital retail. But revenue soon started to drop as shoppers moved their business elsewhere, including Wesfarmers’ revamped Kmart stores. </p> 
  <p>Wesfarmers said it would provide an update to shareholders on the wind down at a strategy briefing in May.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The state government’s continued support for the expansion of fossil fuel projects, including extending the North West Shelf gas processing facility at Woodside’s Burrup Hub, directly contributes to the escalating climate crisis.

  <p><strong>No more warnings for misbehaving telcos as government increases penalties for breaches</strong></p> 
  <p>Misbehaving telecommunication companies will no longer be warned before being slapped with new multimillion-dollar fines for breaching their obligations to customers.</p> 
  <p>As <strong>AAP</strong> reports, the federal government has scrapped the two-step process that can lead to major fines for telcos that breach industry standards or codes of conduct.</p> 
  <p>Currently, the <strong>Australian Communication and Media Authority</strong> must first issue a warning to encourage the company to comply no matter how serious the breach. If there is further noncompliance then the agency can act to issue a fine.</p> 
  <p>Under the changes, the agency can act quickly to hold the companies to account and will no longer be tied to issuing a warning before cracking down on serious breaches.</p> 
  <p>To align telcos with other sectors like energy and banking, the maximum penalties for breaches of industry codes and standards will also increase from $250,000 to $10m. Courts will also be able to determine the fine amount based on the financial turnover of the telco and the scale of the breach to ensure the penalty is proportionate to the harm caused.</p> 
  <p>A <strong>Carriage Service Provider registration scheme</strong> will also be established to increase the visibility of telecommunication retailers in the market. The scheme also means the enforcement agency can stop providers from operating in the market when they’ve been found to pose “unacceptable risk to consumers or have caused significant consumer harm”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Australia among top five countries for trust in scientists</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Most people trust scientists and believe they should engage more in policymaking, a survey of nearly 72,000 people in 68 countries has found.</p> 
  <p>Out of the countries surveyed, <strong>Australia</strong> ranked equal fifth with <strong>Bangladesh</strong> for trust in scientists, behind <strong>Egypt, India, Nigeria </strong>and<strong> Kenya</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Study co-author <strong>Dr Mathew Marques</strong>, of La Trobe University, said in western countries people with rightwing political views trusted scientists less than those with leftwing political views, with Australia as an exception:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Unlike in North America and many western European countries, in Australia having a right-wing versus left-leaning political orientation didn’t seem to matter. <strong>This could mean political polarisation around science is not as much of an issue in Australia as it is for specific scientific issues like climate change.</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Study co-author <strong>Dr Zoe Leviston</strong> of the Australian National University said most people believed scientists should spend more time trying to improve public health outcomes, reduce poverty, and develop clean energy technologies, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>68% of Australians agree or strongly agree that scientists should communicate their findings to politicians, while 80% believe scientists have a responsibility to communicate about science with the general public. Globally, 78% of respondents perceive scientists to be qualified, while 57% perceive scientists to be honest.</em></p>

  <p><strong>More details on graffiti and fire at Sydney childcare centre</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>AAP</strong> has more details on the targeting of the Only About Children centre in Maroubra in Sydney’s east overnight.</p> 
  <p>The centre was allegedly set on fire shortly after midnight, while the words “Fuck the Jews” were sprayed in black paint on a wall.</p> 
  <p>The site is a block away from Maroubra synagogue, and the attack marks the latest in a string of alleged antisemitic arson and graffiti incidents in the city’s east, which is home to a large Jewish community.</p> 
  <p>Before their press conference, the prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese,</strong> and NSW premier, <strong>Chris Minns</strong>, both attended the site.</p> 
  <p>The ground floor of the childcare centre was well alight by the time firefighters arrived on the scene, NSW police said. The blaze was put out but the building sustained extensive damage. There were no reports of injuries and the property was empty at the time.</p> 
  <p>Scorch marks could be seen around broken windows of the childcare centre hours later and the burnt smell of the overnight firebombing was still evident nearby.</p>

 <div class="block-elements">

  <p><strong>McKenzie says ‘Australia not the target’ of Trump’s tariff agenda</strong></p> 
  <p>Nationals senator <strong>Bridget McKenzie</strong> also spoke with the Today show about <strong>Donald Trump</strong> after his inauguration, and argued “Australia is not the target” when it comes to his tariff agenda.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As we know, the Wall Street Journal is obviously reporting, now [Trump is] going to review the trade situation and then look at what sort of tariff changes need to be made.</p> 
   <p>We need to make sure that our foreign affairs ministry, our trade minister and our ambassador are deeply engaged in that review process to make sure our national interest is upheld.</p>

  <p><strong>Rishworth says Australia will work ‘incredibly closely’ with Donald Trump</strong></p> 
  <p>The social services minister, <strong>Amanda Rishworth</strong>, says the Australian government will be working “incredibly closely” with US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> – after his inauguration early this morning.</p> 
  <p>Speaking with the Today show, Rishworth said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I have to say from Australia’s perspective, we want to make sure that we’re working very closely with him. This, of course, is the most closest global partner we have in America, and the most important strategic ally. So we as a country will be working incredibly closely with him.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked how worried she is about the establishment of tariffs, the minister said “we think that we can have a very constructive relationship when it comes to this”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Importantly, the Australian-US trade relationship is one that is mutually beneficial. So in fact, the US has a trade surplus with Australia.</p> 
   <p>So we’ll be working in our national interest. We think that we can have a very constructive relationship when it comes to this. And <strong>the prime minister no doubt will be putting forward just how mutually beneficial that this trade relationship is</strong>, which I think is important to recognise.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The government has announced $262m in another round of funding for local defence industry, to develop Australia’s Aukus submarine supply chain capacity.</p> 
  <p>Labor says the funding will support about 125 businesses across the country, to build industry capacity, and help get domestic products into US and UK supply chains.</p> 
  <p>The Aukus agreement, signed in August last year, officially came into force over the weekend, which will see US Virginia-class submarines transferred to Australia from the 2030s.</p> 
  <p>The defence minister, <strong>Richard Marles</strong>, said in a statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are continuing to build and invest in an Australian submarine industrial base capable of supporting our future nuclear-powered submarine fleet and underpinning a strong local economy over the coming decades … <strong>This is a further demonstration that Aukus is happening now.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Mysterious grey debris which closed Sydney beaches similar to that found last year</strong></p> 
  <p>The Northern Beaches council says early test results show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/14/mystery-balls-close-nine-northern-sydney-beaches-after-fatbergs-washed-ashore-in-2024">mysterious grey ball-shaped debris which closed nine beaches</a> are similar to those which washed up on eastern suburbs beaches last year.</p> 
  <p>The council is waiting on the full analysis of the testing it commissioned but the preliminary results show traces of hydrocarbons and other materials which appear to be consistent with some of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/09/nsw-regulator-chose-to-reveal-content-of-sydneys-mystery-beach-balls-on-day-of-us-election">chemicals found in debris at other eastern suburbs beaches</a> last year.</p> 
  <p>Those balls were revealed by testing coordinated with the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/09/nsw-regulator-chose-to-reveal-content-of-sydneys-mystery-beach-balls-on-day-of-us-election">consistent with human-generated waste</a>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Australia has not received any explicit assurance from president-elect <strong>Donald Trump</strong> that Australia will not suffer any adverse tariff actions ahead of the inauguration, but <strong>Anthony</strong> <strong>Albanese</strong> told the ABC he is “confident” the two countries can work through economic issues.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I had a very constructive discussion with the incoming president when I wished him well on his election. I made the point to President Trump that the United States has enjoyed a trade surplus with Australia since the Truman presidency.</p> 
   <p>It’s been there for a long time, and the United States is, of course, a major investor here in Australia, and the relationship between our two economies is so important. So I’m very confident that we will work these issues through, because they’re in the interests of both Australia and the United States.</p>

  <p><strong>Laura Tingle</strong>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>But no explicit assurance at this stage, by the sounds of things?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Albanese:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Well, to be fair, he hasn’t been through the inauguration yet, but very clearly it was a positive discussion that we had. <strong>He said that we will have a perfect relationship,</strong> and I expect that the relationship between Australia and the United States will remain strong.</p>

  <p><strong>Albanese welcomes hostage release</strong></p> 
  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese,</strong> has welcomed the release of Israeli hostages, and wants to see more aid into Gaza “as quickly as possible”.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to ABC’s 7.30 program Monday evening, Albanese said “this is a fragile situation, but it is a step forward.”</p> 
  <p>The government continues to be concerned about the escalation of antisemitism here in Australia, he said, especially serious attacks such as the fire that was deliberately lit at the Adass synagogue in Melbourne and the attempted fire at the synagogue in Newtown.</p> 
  <p>Asked about the calls for a national cabinet meeting about the rise in antisemitism, Albanese said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The important discussions that are taking place, the ones between the security and police agencies every day, and we’re also speaking with the premiers and chief ministers right around the country. We had a coordinated report through with the New South Wales acting premier and the Victorian premier, along with the AFP commissioner, because that is where the events, these incidents of violence and of criminal activity, have been concentrated.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked about <strong>Peter Dutton’s</strong> proposal for tougher anti-terror laws in response, including mandatory jail time of six years for anyone who attacks a place of worship, Albanese said it had the potential to be counterproductive.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m <strong>Martin Farrer</strong> with the top overnight stories and then it’ll be <strong>Emily Wind</strong> with the main action.</p> 
  <p><strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong> was among the parade of tech billionaires and influential business figures in Washington DC to mark the inauguration of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>. The media tycoon was spotted at a church service on the morning of the event – as well as the Amazon founder, <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>, Meta’s <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong>, Apple’s <strong>Tim Cook</strong>, Google’s <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong> and Fifa’s <strong>Gianni Infantino</strong> – and in the select audience at the inauguration itself.</p> 
  <p>Hours before Trump was sworn in, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> told 7.30 that he had not received any explicit assurance from his camp that Australia would not suffer any adverse tariff actions. But Albanese said he was “confident” the two countries can work through economic issues. More coming up.</p> 
  <p>Australians are feeling more optimistic in 2025 about the fortunes of the economy and their families, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/21/2025-australia-election-polls-albanese-peter-dutton-approval-ratings">our latest Essential poll shows</a>, delivering Albanese a welcome boost. The prime minister’s approval was strongest among young voters, with 54% of those aged 18-34 giving the prime minister a positive rating, compared to only 36% of those over 55.</p>
