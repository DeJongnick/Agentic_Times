<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has decimated the US Department of Education, firing more than 1,300 employees in a single day in what looks to be the first step toward abolishing the agency entirely.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/us-education-department-layoffs">mass dismissal</a> – delivered by email after most staff had left for the day on Tuesday – has slashed the department’s workforce by half. Along with voluntary departures and probationary firings, the agency that started 2025 with 4,133 staff now operates with an estimated 2,100 employees two months into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s presidency.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/president-trump-administration-news-updates">Trump administration briefing: education department to be halved as Trump walks back Canada tariffs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Today’s reduction in force reflects our commitment to efficiency,” Linda McMahon, the US education secretary, <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-initiates-reduction-force">said in a statement</a> on Tuesday, insisting that student loans, Pell grants and special education funding would continue uninterrupted. Department officials characterized the eliminated positions as unnecessary administrative roles.</p> <p>Civil rights enforcement has been particularly devastated, with regional offices in New York, San Francisco and Boston either closed entirely or stripped to minimal staffing. These units were already buried under backlogged discrimination investigations following campus protests last year.</p> <p>The cuts came just one day after the department <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment">warned 60 universities</a> they face “potential enforcement actions” for alleged violations of federal civil rights laws protecting students from antisemitic discrimination – part of a broader push that recently saw the administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/trump-administration-cancels-columbia-university-funding">cancel $400m</a> in funding to Columbia University over what it called “continued inaction” on harassment of Jewish students. A prominent Columbia student activist with a green card, Mahmoud Khalil, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/columbia-mahmoud-khalil-wife-statement">was arrested</a> by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) without charge over the weekend and now faces deportation for his role in last year’s pro-Palestinian demonstrations.</p> <p>“We will not stand by while this regime pulls the wool over the eyes of the American people,” Sheria Smith, the president of the government employees’ union representing department workers, said in a statement.</p> <p>Some school leaders across the country are also alarmed by the implications of the department’s downsizing. Alberto Carvalho, the Los Angeles unified school district superintendent, warned of “catastrophic harm” if the cuts affect federal funding streams.</p> <p>“We receive in excess of $750m earmarked for poor students, English-language learners, students with disabilities and connectivity investments,” Carvalho said in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/la-schools-superintendent-closing-doe-bring-catastrophic-harm/story?id=119715623">a video statement</a>. The LA unified school district is estimated to be the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_215.30.asp">second-largest</a> in the country.</p> <p>Greg Casar, the Congressional Progressive caucus chair from Texas, meanwhile accused the administration of blatant class warfare.</p> <p>He <a href="https://x.com/ArthurDelaneyHP/status/1899841384896397723">told reporters</a>: “Trump and Musk are stealing from our children to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.” He called for Senate Democrats to reject the government funding bill that they’ll be voting on this week.</p> <p>Responding to reporter questions on Wednesday, Trump attacked Department of Education employees. “Many of them don’t work at all. Many of them never showed up to work,” the president said in the Oval Office. “We want to cut, but we want to cut the people that aren’t working or not doing a good job. We’re keeping the best people.”</p> <p>The purge aligns with Trump’s campaign pledge to abolish the department entirely – a promise that resonated with the parents’ rights movement that emerged during pandemic school closures. Constitutional experts note that while Trump cannot unilaterally dissolve the agency without congressional approval, his administration appears to be rendering it functionally obsolete.</p> <p>Just last week, McMahon confirmed on Fox News that Trump plans to sign an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/donald-trump-executive-orders-signed-list">executive order</a> targeting the department’s closure, despite polls showing roughly two-thirds of Americans oppose such a move.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/trump-administration-teacher-training-blocked">Judge blocks Trump administration plan to cut millions for teacher training</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The administration is already preparing to scatter the department’s functions across the federal government. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/us/politics/trump-education-department-firings.html">New York Times reports</a> that officials visited the treasury department on Monday to discuss transferring student loan operations, while McMahon has floated moving civil rights enforcement to the Department of Justice and disability services to the Department of Health and Human Services – mirroring recommendations from the conservative Project 2025 blueprint.</p> <p>The cuts bear the unmistakable influence of the world’s richest man, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, who leads Trump’s so-called government efficiency initiative. McMahon acknowledged “regular meetings” with Musk’s team, praising them for identifying “waste” in the department.</p> <p>Department headquarters remained closed on Wednesday following the mass terminations, with officials citing security concerns.</p>
