<p>In the time it takes to read this article, Australia’s highest-paid chief executives will earn hundreds of dollars. An average worker would make around one dollar.</p> 
<p>While many executives took pay cuts at the peak of pandemic lockdowns, there’s been little restraint in the years since, even as cost-of-living pressures weigh on their employees.</p> 
<p>Chief executive pay increased strongly in 2023-24, an analysis of remuneration reports shows, with many executives receiving double-digit rises in their pay packets.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, average weekly earnings increased by just 4.6% over the financial year.</p> 
<p>Guardian Australia used published CEO pay to assess how much more the heads of Australia’s best-known companies earn than regular workers, from baristas to barbers.</p>

<p>Macquarie Group’s chief executive, Shemara Wikramanayake, earned $29.4m last financial year, a modest drop from the prior period but still an extraordinary sum even by executive standards.</p> 
<p>Wikramanayake made 294 times the average-earning Australian in 2023-24, according to Guardian Australia’s analysis.</p> 
<p>As a global investment bank, Macquarie is a performance-obsessed company that rewards executives who drive profits, which means divisional heads often make more than the CEOs of well-known Australian companies.</p> 
<p>Last year, several Macquarie executives earned more than $10m, according to statutory remuneration tables included in its annual report.</p> 
<p>The statutory figures include base pay, as well as the accumulating short- and long-term incentives and various bonuses.</p> 
<p>The ASX 200 had a robust year, rising almost 8% in 2023-24, led by the technology and financial sectors, which helped inflate the value of incentives and bonuses.</p> 
<p>Insurers profited during a period of rising premiums, which helped Nick Hawkins, the chief executive of Australia’s largest general insurer, IAG, record a 78% increase in statutory pay to $5.23m.</p>

<p>Frank Calabria, the head of the electricity retailer Origin Energy, earned $6.7m, up 13.5% on the prior year, in a period marked by steep rises in electricity prices for consumers.</p> 
<p>The chief executive of Coles, Leah Weckert, earned $4.7m in 2023-24 in her first full year heading the major supermarket chain. This was up from $3.3m the previous year, but well below the $10m-plus pay packets that her predecessor, Steven Cain, earned at the end of his tenure.</p>

<p>Chief executives in Australia’s largest companies take home on average 50 times the pay package of a typical worker, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/12/australian-ceos-average-wage-workers">according to an analysis</a> from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI).</p> 
<p>In the early 1990s, top bosses earned about 17 times average earnings.</p> 
<p>Ed John, the executive manager of stewardship at ACSI, said short-term bonuses can be too easy to obtain and that boards need to ensure incentives reflect strong long-term performance.</p> 
<p>“It’s important that boards and investors don’t become too cyclical,” said John, referring to bonuses that get paid when a company’s shares rise in line with the broader market.</p> 
<p>“They need to make sure that strategies are being delivered beyond just share price up or share price down.</p> 
<p>“Are targets actually being met, and how are they being met?”</p> 
<p>Australia’s highest-earning chief executives earn tens of thousands of dollars in the eight or so hours it takes to read an average-length book.</p> 
<p>But rest assured, there’s always someone who earns more.</p> 
<p>Tesla shareholders <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/13/tesla-shareholders-approve-elon-musk-pay">recently approved</a> a $US45bn ($66bn) pay deal for chief executive Elon Musk.</p>
