<p>Law enforcement officials investigating a homicide at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/burning-man-festival">Burning Man festival</a> in Nevada have identified the victim, federal authorities announced on Wednesday.</p> <p>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which manages the Black Rock Desert national conservation area where the festival is held each year, said in a statement that the man who was killed on Saturday had been identified as Vadim Kruglov of Russia.</p> <p>Officials launched a murder investigation over the weekend after a festival attendee found an “obviously deceased” man “lying in a pool of blood” on Saturday, the final night of the event, and alerted police. The incident occurred between 8pm and 9.15pm, according to the BLM, as the festival was setting fire to a wooden effigy, known as the burning man.</p> <p>Police cordoned off the scene as they investigated and interviewed “several participants in the immediate area”, said Jerry Allen, the Pershing county sheriff. Allen had asked for the festivalgoers’ help in identifying the victim and for accounts from people who may have seen anything between 8pm and 9.30pm.</p> <p>“We are also currently seeking information regarding any suspect identifiers for any person who would commit such a heinous crime against another human being,” Allen said. “At this time, no information is too small to disregard, so do not hesitate to contact my office.”</p> <p>Kruglov, who had reportedly been living in Washington, was identified by his fingerprints, the sheriff’s office told the <a href="https://www.rgj.com/story/news/2025/09/03/burning-man-homicide-victim-identified-as-vadim-kruglov-37/85952607007/">Reno Gazette Journal</a>. A friend shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOIs9KtkaBU/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">social media</a> that Kruglov had “poured his soul into our community: building the camp, creating an art installation, always ready to help others, and being kind and responsive to everyone”.</p> <p>“His energy and contribution will forever remain part of the Burn’s history,” the post said.</p> <p>The sheriff’s office <a href="https://www.pershingcountynv.gov/25%20BMF%20Homicide.pdf?t=202508311927090">said</a> the killing appeared to be a “singular crime”, but said Burning Man participants should always be vigilant.</p> <p>The Burning Man Project said it is “doing everything we can to assist the sheriff’s investigation so the perpetrator can be caught and brought to justice”.</p> <p>“Burning Man Project extends our deepest condolences to Mr Kruglov’s loved ones as they prepare to return him home to Russia,” said Marian Goodell, the CEO of the Burning Man Project. “We also extend our compassion to our wider community of participants, volunteers and staff alike. Together, we strive to uphold the values at the heart of the Burning Man community.”</p> <p>This year’s festival has been beset with unusual events, including especially powerful <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/25/burning-man-weather-dust-storm">dust storms</a> that destroyed artwork as well as the famous “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/27/the-burning-man-orgy-dome-welcome-to-the-latest-festival-disaster">orgy dome</a>”, and a woman, who <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-29/baby-girl-born-at-burning-man">has said she was not aware</a> she was pregnant, giving birth at the festival.</p>
