<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/14/busta-rhymes-david-bowies-hunky-dory-is-the-illest-music-ever">Busta Rhymes</a> has been accused of physical assault and an abusive work environment by his former assistant.</p> <p>The 53-year-old rapper, whose real name is Trevor Smith, is the focus of a <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/busta-rhymes-lawsuit-eastern-district-new-york.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed by Dashiel Gables who claims he was punched in the face for being on the phone in January.</p> <p>At the time Rhymes <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/16/us-news/rapper-busta-rhymes-accused-of-assaulting-assistant-in-brooklyn/">turned himself in</a> and earlier this week, Gables filed an action alleging wage and hour violations, assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p> <p>In a statement sent to the Guardian, Rhymes responded: “I have been made aware of the claims made by Dashiel Gables, and I completely and categorically deny these allegations. For a very brief period, Dashiel assisted me, but it did not work out. Apparently, Dashiel has decided to respond to being let go by manufacturing claims against me in an attempt to attack and damage my reputation. I look forward to proving these allegations false, and am preparing a countersuit, which I am confident will expose this for what it is – an attempted shake-down by a disgruntled former assistant. Ultimately, I am certain the truth will prevail.”</p> <p>Gables started working for Rhymes in 2024 for $200 a day and during his tenure, claims that the star would degrade him, scream and spit at him and make unreasonable demands to himself and other employees, often making him work 18-hour days without overtime.</p> <p>In January 2025, Gables alleges that while in the lobby of the rapper’s residence, the pair were engaged in an argument. Gables’ daughter called and he ignored it, sending her a text message instead. Rhymes reportedly screamed at him and then punched him twice.</p> <p>Gables was hospitalised and filed a police report and Rhymes faced three assault charges. “While plaintiff tolerated a great deal of abuse while working for Busta Rhymes, he could not tolerate the repeated physical assault and was unable to return to work,” the lawsuit reads.</p> <p>He then claims as a result of the assault and the police report, he was “frozen out of the hip-hop music industry” and faces “substantial future lost wage damages” as a result.</p> <p>“I worked my heart out for Busta,” Gables said in a statement sent to the Guardian. “Long hours, day and night, weekends, you name it. He bullied me from day one. He regularly insulted me, called me names and slurs, screamed at me in front of other people … But I stuck around, because I needed the work and I thought things would get better. But instead, he punched me twice in the face.”</p> <p>In 2008, Rhymes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jan/24/urban.internationalcrime">pleaded guilty</a> to charges of assault and drink-driving after he was accused of beating and kicking his former driver during a pay dispute while also attacking a fan at a festival.</p> <p>In 2015, he was also <a href="https://www.etonline.com/news/169440_busta_rhymes_arrested_for_throwing_lean_body_at_gym_employee">arrested</a> for throwing a drink at a gym employee.</p> <p>Rhymes, whose hits include Gimme Some More and Break Ya Neck, recently made an appearance in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/30/the-naked-gun-review-liam-neeson-spoof-reboot">The Naked Gun</a> reboot and was honoured with a star on the Hollywood walk of fame.</p>
