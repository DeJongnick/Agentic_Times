<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/us-education-department-layoffs">US Department of Education</a> intends to lay off nearly half of its workforce, the department has announced. The layoffs of 1,300 people were announced by the department on Tuesday and described by the education secretary, Linda McMahon, as a “significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system”.</p> <p>In a post on X, McMahon said: “Today’s [reduction in force] reflects our commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.”</p> <p>After the most recent round of layoffs, the department’s staff will be roughly half of its previous 4,100, the agency said <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-education-initiates-reduction-force">in a statement</a>. According to the department, another 572 employees had already accepted “voluntary resignation opportunities and retirement” over the last seven weeks. The newly laid-off employees will be placed on administrative leave at the end of next week.</p>  <h2>US education department to lay off 1,300 people as Trump vows to close agency</h2>  <p>The announcement that the US Department of Education intends to lay off nearly half of its workforce has been met with swift condemnation from Democratic and progressive officials. The Texas representative Greg Casar wrote in a post on X that those in charge were “Stealing from our children to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.”</p> <p>Trump campaigned on a promise to close the Department of Education, claiming it had been overtaken by “radicals, zealots and Marxists”. At McMahon’s confirmation hearing, she acknowledged that only Congress had the power to abolish the agency but said it might be due for cuts and a reorganization.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/us-education-department-layoffs"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump walks back 50% Canada tariffs after tit-for-tat day</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> announced he was doubling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">tariffs</a> on Canadian steel and aluminum from 25% to 50% as a retaliation for the province of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/10/ontario-canada-trump-tariffs">Ontario’s imposition of a 25% surcharge</a> on electricity exports to several US states – and then walked back the decision after Ontario relented hours later.</p> <p>Tuesday was marked by chaos as the US and Canada escalated their trade war.
