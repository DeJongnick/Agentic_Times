The paper said part of this agreement involved exchanging data from under-sea cables which came from Africa and Afghanistan into France.&nbsp;</p> <p>Le Monde said that the disclosure of this data exchange might suggest that at least some of the indignation shown by French authorities at the recent revelations that the NSA recorded data from more than 70m French phone calls in one 30-day period late last year, could have been “feigned”.</p> <p>But a highly placed intelligence source told the paper that even with an exchange of data, they “categorically denied” the DGSE could have transferred the data on 70.3m phone transactions to the NSA.&nbsp;The DGSE refused to comment to Le Monde.&nbsp;</p> <p>Asked about the claims that telephone data collected in France was shared by French intelligence services with the NSA, a spokesman for the French foreign ministry said Paris's concern was “the nature and scope” of American phone-surveillance “on French territory.”</p> <p>He added: “It was on that point that the French authorities demanded explanations from their US counterparts...” He said: “Concerning the surveillance activities of our own intelligence agencies, they are strictly defined by the law.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Paul Hamilos</strong> in Madrid also filed more detail on the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/30/spain-colluded-nsa-spying-citizens-spanish-el-mundo-us">apparent collusion of the Spanish authorities with the NSA.</a></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The suggestion that the Spanish intelligence agency was working with the NSA will confirm the suspicions of many in Spain who believe that the government has not only failed to protect its own citizens' privacy, but was actively supportive of US surveillance inside the country.</p> <p data-inview-name="12th para">Although there are strong anti-privacy laws in Spain, and judicial oversight is required before a phone can be tapped, there are concerns that these laws are applied less than rigorously.</p> <p>The US has offices for the CIA and the NSA in Madrid.</p> <p>On Monday, Amnesty International called on the Spanish government to "reflect on its total failure to protect its own citizens' privacy".</p> <p>The prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, announced on Wednesday that the director of the Spanish national intelligence centre (CNI), Félix Sanz Roldán, would be called to appear before the official secrets committee to explain the activities of the NSA and the CNI. Unlike in the US, however, this meeting will be held behind closed doors.</p> <p>The latest document, published by El Mundo on Wednesday, shows the NSA to be watchful of any information gathered by countries outside the top tier of allies, which together with the US are known as the "five eyes".</p> <p>According to the Spanish newspaper's report, the NSA says any co-operation with countries outside this group is to be carefully evaluated, and they should be reliable allies, capable of protecting any classified information from the US itself.</p> <p>A further document seen by El Mundo reportedly explains how that cooperation between the NSA and foreign intelligence agencies increases the number of foreign-language speakers available to it, so as better to understand any communications they uncovered.</p> <p>Not every line in the document is hard intelligence work, though. At one point, an NSA agent apparently writes that the Spanish agents were exceptionally helpful when they collaborated, not just at work, but also in their downtime. In Madrid, lunch apparently always took place at 2pm; the US agents were given an apparently enjoyable bus tour of the sights of Madrid; and one dinner was accompanied by opera singers. The only disappointment came during one trip to Spain, when it rained all the time, despite the Spanish agents having promised unlimited sunshine.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2013-10-30T14:02:25.496Z">at 2.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5270faffe4b01566f5a394ad" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2013-10-30T12:43:43.992Z">12.43pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Boris defends the Guardian</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>London mayor Boris Johnson appears to be sparring for another fight with the prime minister by defending the Guardian's reporting of Snowden's disclosures.</p> <p>The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/10/30/boris-johnson-london_n_4176482.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003&amp;ir=UK">Huffington Post quotes him saying</a>:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I personally defend the Guardian's right to publish interesting information such as [the fact] that Angela Merkel's phone was bugged by Barack Obama.

But they've now gone on and printed further material which is damaging.</p> <p>I don't want to have to use injunctions or D notices or the other tougher measures. I think it's much better to appeal to newspapers' sense of social responsibility. But if they don't demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for government to stand back and not to act.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/nov/21/snowden-leaks-and-public/">Writing in the New York Review of Books</a>, Rusbridger argued that press scrutiny was vital at a time when oversight of the security establishment was so inadequate and out of touch.</p> <p>He wrote:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In the absence of newspapers to find, analyze, and explain this sort of thing, we have to rely on parliamentary and congressional oversight committees or secret, one-sided courts to do the job for us. In the US we are very much in the hands of Senator Dianne Feinstein and, in the UK, Malcolm Rifkind, a former defense secretary. Neither is, to put it mildly, a child of the digital age. I may be doing Feinstein and Rifkind a disservice, but I suspect they would have struggled to understand the documents [about private web encryption capacities] that Jeff [Larson, a Web developer and reporter at ProPublica]&nbsp;deciphered, with or without my drawing to help them. There are echoes, a hundred years later, of the Whitehall bureaucrats trying to get their heads around Marconi’s wireless signals.</p> <p>Snowden’s documents show that the&nbsp;NSA&nbsp;and&nbsp;GCHQ&nbsp;employ extremely talented engineers who are ever more inventive in trying to dream up ever more exotic ways of keeping tabs on countless millions of people. To question, still less write about, their methods invites the standard response that one is giving away the game to the enemy. The spooks insist they work within the law. They will patiently explain the difference between a haystack—which they must be allowed to store—and a needle, which they can search for only under controlled circumstances.</p> <p>No one is in any doubt that their work is essential. We need capable intelligence agencies. Liberal democracies do have determined and resourceful enemies. There is plainly a tension between the secrecy required in much intelligence work and the transparency that, in all else, democracy demands. Careful, responsible journalism is also necessary.&nbsp;<em>The Guardian</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Washington Post</em>, ProPublica, and&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;have gone to exceptional lengths to edit the Snowden material with caution. In private—but inevitably not in public—people familiar with the nature of the documents concede this ...</p> <p>The reason this overall issue matters is that, as technology develops, the police and intelligence agencies (and others) will always want more, and bigger, haystacks—and the ability to keep them longer. And the ability to create astonishingly powerful algorithms to find the needles.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rusbridger also ridiculed the British government's decision to force the Guardian to destroy laptops containing some of the leaked material. Government officials overseeing the destruction of the machines (with an electric drill and an angle grinder) realised the futility of the operation but failed to see the irony of the decision, he said:&nbsp;</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The government men said they were “painfully aware” that other copies existed, but their instructions were to close down the&nbsp;<em>Guardian</em>&nbsp;operation in London by destroying the computers containing information from Snowden. At some level I suspect our interlocutors realized that the game had changed ...</p> <p>Thee government officials who lectured us appeared blissfully blind to the irony that the only organization that had provably lost control of the data was not a newspaper, but the NSA. One official rolled his eyes at the thought of 850,000 people having access to it.</p> <p>But one has to ask why, if this was of such overwhelming importance, it took the state’s best security people five weeks to arrive at <em>The Guardian</em>’s offices. And why—nearly three months later—no one from the official world has “made safe” the <em>New York Times</em> cache of documents obtained from <em>The Guardian</em>, never mind contacting Greenwald, Poitras, ProPublica, or <em>The Guardian</em>’s New York office.</p> <p>A more plausible answer is that the British intelligence services simply find it extremely difficult to deal with journalists. Which, in itself, is illustrative of the wider problem of balancing surveillance with civil liberties. How on earth do you reconcile something that must be secret with something that begs to be discussed?</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-5270d7fae4b08c7e086ff1af" class="block is-summary" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2013-10-30T10:38:26.660Z">10.38am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Welcome to our hub for all Edward Snowden, NSA and GCHQ-related developments around the world.
