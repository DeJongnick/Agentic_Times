<p>A manhunt is under way for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/27/porepunkah-shooting-suspect-dezi-freeman-victoria-police-ntwnfb">Dezi Freeman</a>, a 56-year-old so-called “sovereign citizen” accused of killing two police officers and injuring another in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria">Victorian</a> town of Porepunkah, which is home to about 1,000 people.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/aus_shooting_satellite/giv-3255447399MU7frA4/" > <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/aus_shooting_satellite/giv-3255447399MU7frA4/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Here’s what we know so far:</h2> <ul> <li><p>About 10.30am on Tuesday, 10 police were attending a rural property in Porepunkah to execute a search warrant when they were fired upon.</p></li> <li><p>Two officers were killed and another was wounded. The officers killed were detective leading senior constable <strong>Neal Thompson</strong>, 59, and senior constable <strong>Vadim De Waart</strong>, 35.</p></li> <li><p>Thompson, who was on the verge of retirement, joined Victoria police in 1987 and spent seven years in general duties at Collingwood police station before working as a detective at the major fraud squad and the state crime squad. De Waart had only recently arrived in Wangaratta when the shooting occurred. He started his policing career at the Victoria Police Academy in late 2018 and worked for three years at St Kilda police station before joining the public order response team as a senior constable in April 2023.</p></li> <li><p>The police officer who was wounded has had surgery. He was in a stable condition at the Alfred hospital in Melbourne on Wednesday morning.</p></li> <li><p>According to the chief commissioner of Victoria police, <strong>Mike Bush</strong>, the officers were<strong> </strong>“met by the offender, and they were murdered in cold blood”.</p></li> <li><p>On Wednesday, Bush named the suspect as 56-year-old <strong>Dezi Freeman</strong>, or<strong> Desmond Filby</strong>, whom he described as “heavily armed” and said he “understands bushcraft well”. He said Freeman had been able to run into the bush near the property alone immediately after the shooting.</p></li> </ul> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <ul> <li><p>Bush said it was believed Freeman was armed with multiple firearms, including long arms. He said police were still examining the scene to understand whether he took any additional weapons from police. The area around the town, about 300km north-east of Melbourne, is steep and mountainous.</p></li> <li><p>On Wednesday afternoon police released a new image of Filby and a description of him as Caucasian, 183cm tall, with medium build, short dark hair and brown eyes.</p></li> <li><p>Police said he was last seen wearing “dark green (khaki) tracksuit pants, dark green rain jacket, brown Blundstone boots and reading glasses”.</p></li> <li><p>Police have deployed hundreds of specialist resources, including air and ground, to find him.</p></li> <li><p>Bush described the search area as “very wide”, with Freeman likely to “know that area better than us”. He said there had been no sightings of him.</p></li> <li><p>The Victorian premier, <strong>Jacinta Allan, </strong>said Wednesday evening there were “huge resources” being put on the ground in North East Victoria. New South Wales police have also offered support.</p></li> </ul>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2Fvic_map.png&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2F250826VicMapShooting_loop.mp4" data-alt="map of Victoria showing location of Porepunkah"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2Fvic_map.png&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2F250826VicMapShooting_loop.mp4">Interactive</a> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/27/porepunkah-shooting-suspect-dezi-freeman-victoria-police-ntwnfb">Freeman has a history of association with pseudolaw</a> and “sovereign citizen” ideas. Bush would not confirm this but said he was known to police before the shooting.</p></li> <li><p>The Porepunkah community was being urged to stay indoors on Wednesday until Freeman was apprehended.</p></li> <li><p>Bush said the team who went to Freeman’s property was made up of local officers and members of the sexual offences and child abuse team: “It’s a large area, so it required a large number of staff to search the area and also search for technology.”</p></li> <li><p>It was not a “hostage situation”, Bush said, as Freeman’s partner and children had attended a police station on Tuesday evening. He said police had spoken with Freeman’s partner.</p></li> </ul> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/27/the-porepunkah-shooting-has-left-us-with-many-questions-one-of-them-is-how-we-confront-sovereign-citizenship">From Facebook groups to shoot-outs with police: inside the sprawling ecosystem of ‘sovereign citizens’ | Ariel Bogle</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><p>On Tuesday Bush described the suspect’s address as a semi-rural property with a bus on site, which housed the alleged offender, his partner and children.</p></li> <li><p>The local council closed all facilities “effective immediately”, and Porepunkah primary school was in lockdown for a period on Tuesday.
