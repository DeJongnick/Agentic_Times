<h2>Extraordinary Portraits </h2> <p><strong>7.30pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>Bill Bailey presents a surprisingly moving art show that follows the creation of portraits of remarkable people. Clare was diagnosed with cancer at 25 and now, five years later, she has been told it is incurable. Still, she channels her upbeat energy into raising awareness of young people living with cancer. Artist Oriane Pierrepoint works to capture Clare on canvas, and the work will be included in an exhibition as part of Bradford’s 2025 UK city of culture programme. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Monty Don’s British Gardens</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>From the warm and wet gardens of south-west England to the idealised gardens of the English landscape movement, notably Capability Brown’s exquisite artificial landscapes, there’s elegance and exoticism galore in Monty Don’s series finale, beginning at Rousham House in Oxfordshire – “mainly because I love it!” <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Death in Paradise</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong></p>    <p>Is it really possible to stab someone to death while they’re midair on a gameshow zipline? According to this perennial, ludicrous murder-mystery drama, it is. In fact, it might even be the death-packed sunny whodunnit’s hammiest episode yet. <em>Alexi Duggins</em></p> <h2>Uncanny</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>Giving the same childhood thrill as a ghost story being told around a campfire, this episode sees Danny Robins meet a shop manager who says her staff are terrified of the presence of a man who watches their every move. Will Danny find a backstory that provides some spooky answers? <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Susan Calman’s Cruise of a Lifetime</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong></p> <p>Tell me more, tell me more: Greece is the word, as cruiser Calman sets sail on the Aegean Sea aboard a gigantic passenger ship nimble enough to reach a different port every day. That means dazzling white beaches, dancing on top of bars and gamely trying to conceal a lifelong hatred of olives. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>The Graham Norton Show</h2> <p><strong>10.40pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>Norton recently admitted that Robert De Niro’s anecdote had to be cut the last time he was a guest because it was so long – will the actor bring it up as he returns to flog his new political thriller Zero Day? Mikey Madison, Alan Carr, Holly Willoughby, Elton John and Brandi Carlile also join in. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>The Bikeriders (Jeff Nichols, 2023), 11.25am, 8pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</strong></p>    <p>Even by Hollywood standards, you’d be hard pressed to find a film as poorly treated as The Bikeriders. First bumped from schedules due to strikes, the film was then shopped around to other studios before it limped into cinemas last summer. And yet The Bikeriders is great. A 1960s motorcycle outlaw drama by Jeff Nichols (of Mud and Midnight Special renown), it features Tom Hardy and Jodie Comer, along with newly minted star Austin Butler, all doing brilliant work. Treat this as an opportunity to right a historic wrong. <em>Stuart Heritage</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>FA Cup football</strong><strong>: </strong><strong>Man United v Leicester City</strong><strong> </strong>7.30pm, ITV1. Opening tie of the fourth round.</p>
