<h1>Morning Mail: Nationals accused of serving tobacco lobby on vaping; supermarkets face massive fines; 1,300 die in hajj heat</h1>

<p>Good morning. Parliament is back this week and should take a crucial vote on the government’s anti-vaping restrictions. The Australian Medical Association has hit out at the Nationals for taking the advice of the tobacco lobby over health experts, saying the junior Coalition partner’s push for vapes to be regulated the same way as cigarettes is “a tax grab that shows a complete disregard for the health of Australians”.</p> 
<p>After a flood of consumer and supplier complaints about their soaring profits, supermarkets may face billions in fines for breaches of the grocery code of conduct as Labor commits to pushing through reforms proposed by Craig Emerson’s independent review.</p> 
<p>And the results of an international survey suggest that only 60% of Australians accept that human activity is driving ongoing “climate disruption”.</p>
