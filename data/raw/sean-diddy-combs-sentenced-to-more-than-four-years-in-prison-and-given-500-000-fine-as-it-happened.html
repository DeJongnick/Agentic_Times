The judgment came just minutes after Combs had pleaded with Judge Arun Subramanian that he took full “accountability and responsibility” for his actions, and stating that he was a changed man who would, if released, devote himself to his family and community.</p>    <p>The sentence down came with barely a noise in the courtroom. Combs’ family members and supporters had been warned by a court clerk to keep any expression of their feelings in check.</p> <p>After the sentence was delivered, Combs appeared surprised to find two court marshals behind him, ready to lead him back to Metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn, where he has been incarcerated since his arrest 13 months ago.</p> <p>Outside the courtroom, there was a palpable sense of deflation as neither prosecutors nor Combs’s defense had got the result they wanted. A trial that had heard graphic accounts of sexual abuse, which the defendant had claimed was consensual, ended in a kind of whimper. The sentence handed down – four years, two months - was 10 months less than a sentencing panel recommended and less than half of the 135 months, or 11 years, prosecutors requested.</p> <p><em>Read the

The jury did, however, convict him on two charges of transporting people for prostitution. Judge Arun Subramanian now holds the task of deciding the penalty. Proceedings are set to begin at 10am eastern time.</p> <p>Combs was accused of pressuring two former partners into drug-laced sexual encounters involving hired escorts. A conviction on the most severe counts could have put him in prison for life.</p> <p>When he was acquitted of those allegations, he dropped to his knees in prayer. His lawyer said he had “been given his life back”.</p> <p>But the guilty verdicts he did receive still each carry a maximum of 10 years in prison under the Mann Act, which forbids crossing state lines to facilitate prostitution. Prosecutors describe the conduct as grave offenses, while the defense has dismissed the charges as “fallback” counts that never should have gone forward.</p> </div>   </div>
