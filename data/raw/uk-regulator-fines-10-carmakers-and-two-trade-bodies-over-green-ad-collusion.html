<p>Ten leading car manufacturers – plus two automotive trade bodies – have been fined more than £77m by a UK regulator after admitting breaking competition law in relation to advertising their green credentials.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an investigation after a tipoff from Mercedes-Benz, which allowed the German marque to avoid financial penalties despite also being involved in the cartel.</p> <p>Its rivals – BMW, Ford, Jaguar Land Rover, Peugeot Citroën, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Renault, Toyota, Vauxhall and Volkswagen – “illegally agreed” not to compete when advertising what percentage of their cars can be recycled at the end of the car’s life, the CMA found.</p> <p>The regulator added that the carmakers, with the exception of Renault, also agreed not to share information with their customers about the percentage of recycled material used in their vehicles. </p> <p>Two trade associations, the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) and the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), were also involved in facilitating the agreements.</p> <p>Failing to compete in this way is against competition rules and meant customers buying a car from these manufacturers were unable to fully compare the green credentials of vehicles when buying, the CMA said.</p> <p>Lucilia Falsarella Pereira, the agency’s senior director of competition enforcement, said: “Agreeing with competitors the prices you’ll pay for a service or colluding to restrict competition is illegal and this can extend to how you advertise your products. </p> <p>“This kind of collusion can limit consumers’ ability to make informed choices and lower the incentive for companies to invest in new initiatives.</p> <p>“Today’s fines show our commitment to taking action when competition law is broken.<strong> </strong>In accordance with our leniency policy, we’ve given discounts to those who came forward with information and cooperated at an early stage, which helps to get the swiftest outcomes.”</p> <p>After launching its investigation, the CMA was approached by the SMMT, Stellantis – the owner of Opel, Peugeot Citroën and Vauxhall – and Mitsubishi requesting leniency, which resulted in their fines being reduced. </p> <p>Under the CMA’s leniency policy, a business involved in a cartel can receive lower penalties in return for assisting the CMA with its investigation.</p> <p>The CMA added that most manufacturers took part in this practice from May 2002 to September 2017, with Jaguar Land Rover joining in September 2008. </p> <p>The agreement was set out in a document called the “ELV Charta” – sometimes referred to as a “gentleman’s agreement” – and sought to “avoid a competitive race” among the manufacturers in relation to advertising claims of this kind­.</p> <p>The European Commission also launched a parallel investigation in March 2022. It fined 15 car manufacturers plus the trade body ACEA €458m (£383m) for participating in a cartel regarding end-of-life vehicle recycling across the trading bloc.</p> <p>The 10 manufacturers subject to the UK fines were contacted for comment by the Guardian. </p> <p>A spokesperson for Renault said: “The infringing practices date back to 2002 and ended up in 2018, at a time when the structuring of the ELV (end of life vehicle) recycling sector was still nascent, as was environmental communication. The practices do not financially harm consumers.”</p>
