  <p><strong>Tasmanian police continue search for missing light plane</strong></p> 
  <p>Tasmanian police say searching off the north-east coast of Tasmania and Flinders Island has not located any sign of a missing light plane or its occupants, <strong>Gregory Vaughn</strong>, his partner, <strong>Kim Warner,</strong> and their dog. They were reported missing almost two weeks ago.</p> 
  <p>The plane has not been sighted since it departed George Town airport at 12.45pm on 2 August.</p> 
  <p>Improved weather and visibility on Thursday allowed a Westpac rescue helicopter to conduct sweeps in Tasmania’s north east and over the Furneaux group of islands, but no wreckage or debris was spotted.</p> 
  <p>No decision has been made on suspending the search.</p> 
  <p>The missing plane is a small two-seater Bristell S-LSA in a distinctive green colour, pictured below.</p>

  <p><strong>ASX closes breaking eight-session hot streak</strong></p> 
  <p>Australia’s share market has hit a fresh intraday record, but couldn’t find the buyers to top its best close as the materials sector broke an eight-session hot streak, <strong>AAP reports.</strong></p> 
  <p>The S&amp;P/ASX200 hit 8,899.1 during the session, but finished 39.6 points, or 0.45% higher, to 8,866.7 as the broader All Ordinaries rose 39.4 points, or 0.43%, to 9,142.5.</p> 
  <p>Seven of 11 local sectors finished higher, led by a 1.2% rebound in financials as they recovered from Wednesday’s CBA sell-off and a rally in utilities stocks after Origin soared almost 6% on strong earnings.</p> 
  <p>Raw materials finished in the red for the first time since 1 August, as iron ore prices rolled over and weighed on large cap miners.</p> 
  <p>The Australian dollar is buying 65.49 US cents, up from 64.32 US cents on Wednesday at 5pm.</p>

  <p><strong>‘Strong relationship’ between PM, Treasurer, Gallagher says</strong></p> 
  <p>Gallagher is asked if there is tension between the prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, and the treasurer, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>. She said it’s important for the PM, the treasurer and the finance minister to work very closely together.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have some role in deciding or looking at how to fund or looking at how to say no between the three of us, we all have a role to play there. So it’s an important relationship, and it’s a strong relationship. And we get a lot of things done.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said it was an equal role across the three of them in discussions, and it is a “very constructive relationship, and it’s an important relationship”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’re all deeply involved in making sure that we deliver on those commitments we took to the last campaign and deliver on the ones that we had underway before the election.</p>

  <p><strong>Roundtable outcome not decided in advance, Gallagher says</strong></p> 
  <p>Gallagher is asked about leaked Treasury documents suggesting pre-decided outcomes from the roundtable next week if they’re all agreed to before the roundtable has occurred.</p> 
  <p>She says “not at all” but says they’re ideas and issues that have been raised – around the national construction code and cutting environmental red tape, for example – but nothing has been decided yet.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I can certainly tell you - and I operate at a pretty high level - that nothing has been predetermined or pre-decided. Issues have definitely been raised … along with the ones reported by the ABC. </p> 
   <p>My department has provided me advice with issues that have been raised with me, like around procurement, for example, which is one of those issues that’s raised fairly constantly with me by the private sector. I see it as part of the normal preparation and planning for the roundtable. </p> 
   <p>I think it’s going to be a really interesting and exciting opportunity to pull everyone together in a room and start talking all of these things through.</p>

  <p>Asked what she thinks the low-hanging fruit that the roundtable can address, Gallagher said the roundtable needs to happen first to consider what the outcomes are.</p>

  <p><strong>Work needed before universal childcare, Gallagher says</strong></p> 
  <p>The finance minister, <strong>Katy Gallagher</strong>, has said the prime minister has a priority of moving towards universal childcare. She told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing there is a need to build the workforce out first to provide that work.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Even if you went out tomorrow and said, ‘This is what we’re providing,’ you wouldn’t have the workforce or the centres to provide that care. And so that’s why, in the last budget, we had money set aside to help build more centres, particularly in areas where the market isn’t building them.</p> 
   <p>But also, how do we support – through wages and improvement in wages – people considering early education and care as a job? And also, within that, how do we support skill development, professional development, within that profession, similar to how we’ve seen other professions like nursing professionalised so that you actually think you’ve got a career in that, as opposed to … not huge opportunities unless you become trained at a teacher level?</p> 
   <p>We’ve got to do all of those bits of work before you can start saying that you can deliver universality.</p>

  <p><strong>Woman charged with manslaughter over death of baby during home birth</strong></p> 
  <p>A 36-year-old woman who was working as a midwife will face court on Thursday charged with manslaughter following the death of a baby during a home birth near Newcastle last year.</p> 
  <p>Police allege that the woman - who had privately practiced as a midwife - attended a home in October, 2024 to assist a woman with a home birth and allege over the following two days the midwife did not act upon signs of complications and requests by the woman to attend hospital.</p> 
  <p>The woman giving birth attended John Hunter hospital, where the baby was delivered by emergency caesarean. Police allege that the mother and baby suffered significant medical complications as a result of the incident and the baby died in hospital on 10 October 2024.</p> 
  <p>The 36-year-old midwife was charged on Thursday morning with manslaughter and reckless grievous bodily harm. She was refused bail to appear before bail division court 2 today.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Australian federal police allege that<strong> </strong>a man<strong> </strong>accused of having child abuse material on his device at Sydney airport had AI-generated child abuse material found among the images.</p> 
  <p>The 58-year-old NSW south coast man has been charged with three child abuse material offences including allegedly possessing more than 1,000 illicit images and videos involving minors as young as one.</p> 
  <p>The man was initially arrested on 3 August 2025 after Australian Border Force officers allegedly found child abuse material on his device after he was selected for baggage examination at Sydney airport.</p> 
  <p>An AFP examination of the man’s device allegedly found AI-generated child abuse material that featured the man.</p> 
  <p>Following a search warrant executed at the man’s home on 8 August, a USB and desktop computer was seized. Police alleged the devices contained more than 1,000 images and videos of child abuse material, as well as bestiality material.</p> 
  <p>The man has been charged with one count possessing child abuse material obtained using a carriage service, one count of producing child abuse material, one count of possessing child abuse material, one count of possessing bestiality material, and one count of failing to comply with bail acknowledgement.</p> 
  <p>He is next expected to appear in Parramatta local court on 30 September, 2025. AFP detective acting superintendent <strong>Luke Needham</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Online simulations, fantasy, text-based stories, animations and cartoons, or material which is created using AI are all illegal. Producing and possessing this material, even by AI, normalises this behaviour and contributes to the harm of children.</p> 
   <p>The AFP and its partners will not rest until alleged perpetrators are apprehended and put before the courts.</p>

  <p><strong>Asic takes Mercer Super to court over alleged investigation comms failures</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian Securities and Investment Commission (Asic)</strong> has alleged superannuation fund <strong>Mercer Super</strong> failed to tell the regulator about investigations into serious member service issues, including incorrect insurance premium refunds for dead members, it has alleged in new proceedings launched today in the federal court.</p> 
  <p>Asic alleges that between October 2021 and September 2024, Mercer Super had inadequate systems in place to comply with the reportable situations regime. Asic alleges Mercer Super failed to report seven investigations at all, and another investigation reported more than a year late.</p> 
  <p>Asic’s deputy chair, <strong>Sarah Court,</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We allege a pattern of longstanding and systemic failure by Mercer Super to comply with the law.</em></p> 
   <p><em>These aren’t just technical breaches. Allowing investigations into significant issues to drag on for months or, in some cases, over a year without reporting them to ASIC demonstrates a lack of care for customers and can put more at risk.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asic is seeking declarations and penalties from the court. Mercer Super said in a statement it acknowledges the action, has cooperated with Asic during the investigation and is currently reviewing the claim.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We note that Asic has expressly stated in its pleading that it does not allege that [Mercer Super] set out to deliberately mislead Asic in respect of the matters set out in the claim.</p>

  <p>Picklum out-pointed American rival <strong>Caitlin Simmers</strong> to win the women’s competition in a statement result before her Fiji world title charge. The Australian had already secured the No 1 seeding for the World Surf League finals later this month by reaching the final in pumping Teahupo’o swell.</p>

  <p><strong>Two men charged on allegations of trying to fix football matches</strong></p> 
  <p>A football team raised the alarm after two men allegedly approaching a Queensland player in an attempt to fix matches for financial gain, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p><strong>Queensland police</strong> have extradited the men, aged 55 and 45, from Sydney and charged them after a months-long investigation into alleged attempted sports match-fixing at Gold Coast-based football games.</p> 
  <p>Police allege that on 12 May and 20 June, two employees of an offshore investment group acted as “player agents” and approached a football player on the Gold Coast in a “coordinated effort” to match fix in exchange for payment.</p> 
  <p>Match-fixing is the act of deliberately manipulating the outcome of a sports event for illicit financial gain, often involving betting or bribery.</p> 
  <p>Detective Ch Insp <strong>Melissa Anderson</strong> said there is no evidence that a game was compromised, but<strong> </strong>alleged it was an attempt at match-fix.</p> 
  <p>Police became aware of the alleged<strong> </strong>attempt after Football Australia made a complaint. The men have been charged with one count each of procuring a person to engage in match-fixing pecuniary benefit. They appeared before court today.</p>

  <p>234 children were in custody in NSW in June, an increase of 34% since the same month in 2023, the <a href="https://bocsar.nsw.gov.au/research-evaluations/2025/nsw-custody-statistics-quarterly-update-jun-2025.html#:~:text=Youth%20detention%3A,are%20on%20remand%20(71.8%25).">state’s crime statistics bureau said</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>AAP</strong> reports it’s a reversal in a trend of declining numbers of children in detention, but the figure is still lower than it used to be, according to the bureau’s executive director, <strong>Jackie Fitzgerald</strong>. More than 300 children were in custody in June 2015. Fitzgerald noted:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Over the longer term, we have had much higher rates of kids in custody than we have now.</p>

  <p>About 8% of kids in NSW are Indigenous, but the statistics bureau noted that in June, 140 Aboriginal young people were in detention, making up nearly 60% of the youth detention population.</p> 
  <p>The majority of children currently in NSW jails have not been convicted, with only 66 children in custody as a result of a sentencing. More than 70% of the children in jail are on remand while they go through the court process.</p>

  <p><strong>Nine says statement from top Hamas official actually came from his office</strong></p> 
  <p>Nine newspapers have clarified that a statement attributed directly to a top Hamas official actually came from a spokesperson in his office and that the man himself is currently in jail.</p> 
  <p>It came after the prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, said it should be “a warning to the media of being very careful about the fact that Hamas will engage in propaganda”.</p> 
  <p>Nine reported on Wednesday that the Hamas co-founder and senior official <strong>Sheikh Hassan Yousef</strong> welcomed Australia’s decision to recognise Palestine, praising Australia’s “political courage” and calling on other countries to “follow Australia’s example”.</p> 
  <p>But a statement on social media service Telegram, attributed to Hamas – which Guardian Australia has not independently verified – said the terror group “denies the issuance of any statement by Sheikh Hassan Yousef, detained in the occupation jails since October 19, 2023, on the Australian position regarding the recognition of the Palestinian state” and that Yousef had “no means of communication with any local or international press outlets”.</p> 
  <p>Nine clarified on Thursday that their earlier statement, attributed to Yousef, <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/albanese-dismisses-hamas-propaganda-applauding-recognition-20250814-p5mmuu.html">had been provided by Yousef’s political office</a> in the occupied West Bank “which issues statements on his behalf,” and that his spokesperson on Thursday “confirmed it had released the statement and that Yousef was still in jail”.</p> 
  <p>Outlets, including Guardian Australia, had earlier referenced the Nine reporting and the quotes attributed to Yousef.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Two Norwegian nationals have been jailed for attempting to smuggle 80kg of cocaine into Australia in 2023.</p> 
  <p>A man, 53, was sentenced on Wednesday by the Newcastle district court to nine years’ and 11 months’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of four years and 11 months. His accomplice, a 35 year-old man, was already sentenced by the same court in March this year, to 10 years’ and two months’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of five years and nine months.</p> 
  <p><strong>NSW police</strong> had received an anonymous tip-off that a bulk carrier from Brazil, due to arrive in the Port of Newcastle, was transporting illicit drugs.</p> 
  <p>The pair were arrested on shore in January 2023 after witnesses on a ferry reported seeing them in the water of Newcastle harbour. They were each charged and pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to possess a large commercial quantity of a border controlled drug.</p> 
  <p>Police divers retrieved six waterproof duffle bags hidden in the hull of the carrier, with 82 packages weighing about 80kg total discovered inside which tested positive for cocaine.</p> 
  <p><strong>Australian Federal Police</strong> (AFP) divers later found two seabobs – underwater scooters – fastened to a pier pylon in the Hunter River in Newcastle. AFP Det Supt <strong>Peter Fogarty</strong> said the cocaine, which had an estimated street value of $26m, equated to about 400,000 street-level deals.</p>

  <p><strong>Victoria could save nearly $500m over 10 years by scrapping greyhound racing, estimates show</strong></p> 
  <p>The Victorian government could save almost half a billion dollars if it follows Tasmania in phasing out greyhound racing in the state, according to independent analysis.</p> 
  <p>A policy costing by the <strong>Parliamentary Budget Office</strong> (PBO), to be released on Thursday, estimates the government would save $451.6m between 2025-26 and 2035-36 if it stopped subsidising greyhound racing and closed the industry.</p> 
  <p>The figure is based on an estimated $687.4m drop in government spending on the industry over the decade, offset by a $235.8m loss in revenue, as Victorians would no longer be able to bet on greyhound races held in the state.</p> 
  <p>The analysis said the government “increased ongoing support” to the entire Victorian racing industry, which includes thoroughbred and harness racing, in 2024.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Albanese government confirmed it will permit salmon farming to continue in Macquarie Harbour in Tasmania, despite concerns from conservationists about the risks to the endangered Maugean skate.</p> 
  <p>The environment minister, <strong>Murray Watt,</strong> wrote to three environment groups on Wednesday notifying them of the widely expected decision, which follows the passage of amendments to Australia’s nature laws to protect the salmon industry earlier this year.</p> 
  <p>The groups, including the <strong>Bob Brown Foundation</strong> and the <strong>Australia Institute</strong>, had asked the government in 2023 to reconsider a 2012 decision to allow salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour without an assessment under Australia’s environmental laws. Watt said all relevant information had been carefully considered before reaching his decision:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The Albanese government remains committed to the protection of the Maugean skate, including through our funding of oxygenation measures in Macquarie Harbour.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Eloise Carr, </strong>director of the Australia Institute Tasmania,<strong> </strong>said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Minister Watt is trying to put an end to this issue through this decision, but it’s not going away. Whether the changes to the EPBC (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation) Act apply to Macquarie Harbour remains an open question.</p>

  <p><strong>Labor taps former journalist as pick for Kiama seat vacated by Gareth Ward</strong></p> 
  <p>NSW Labor has nominated the former journalist <strong>Katelin McInerney</strong> to run as its candidate in a state byelection in Kiama that will be held on Saturday, 13 September</p> 
  <p>The byelection follows the resignation of the seat’s former MP, <strong>Gareth Ward</strong>, who is currently in jail awaiting sentence after being convicted of one count of sexual intercourse without consent and three indecent assault charges.</p> 
  <p>Ward had held the seat since 2011 – originally as a Liberal, but he won the seat as an independent in 2023 – despite the charges hanging over him. Labor is playing down expectations, with the NSW premier, <strong>Chris Minns,</strong> saying in a statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have to be realistic about the challenge ahead. This will be a tough seat for Labor to win – but Katelin knows her community, she understands their priorities, and she will work tirelessly to deliver for them.</p>

  <p>The Liberals have not yet announced their candidate but opposition leader Mark Speakman said Wednesday he thinks it is important to give people a choice.</p> 
  <p><strong>Katelin McInerney</strong> said of her selection:</p>

  <p>Pane, who was a member of the stakeholder advisory board, described the interim report as “political talking points”, and the assessment of vendors’ privacy practices appeared to be a “tick-box compliance” of checking privacy policies rather than a thorough examination.</p> 
  <p>Pane said there was concerning evidence that personal data, including biometric data, could be held by the age assurance companies for access by law enforcement or regulators. He said:</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The unemployment rate has <strong>dropped to 4.2%</strong> in July, partially reversing a surprise jump to 4.3% in the month before.</p>

  <p><strong>Australia-US relationship drifting, Ley says</strong></p> 
  <p>The opposition leader, <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>, said the lack of meetings between the prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, and US president, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, showed the relationship between Australia and the US is “drifting”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Many in the room today are reflecting the critical juncture at this time in history and the importance of the alliance with respect to that with the strategic rise of China, with the conflicts in the Middle East, with the geo-strategic circumstances the way they are, this means the alliance is more important than ever and it is not right for it to be drifting the way it is and it is a call to action for our prime minister and our government to step in and do more.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Ley met with members of the US congress today, and said she raised that US secretary of state, <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, is a “good friend of Australia” but would not say whether any of the members of congress raised Australia’s position on recognition of Palestine as a cause for concern.</p>

  <p><strong>Hamas ‘cheerleaders’ for PM, Ley says</strong></p> 
  <p>The opposition leader, <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>, is holding a press conference in Adelaide</p> 
  <p>Ley claimed while the PM has said he is not a “cheerleader for Hamas” in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/11/australia-will-recognise-palestinian-statehood-but-what-will-that-mean-for-people-in-gaza-ntwnfb">recognising a Palestinian state</a>, “Hamas is a cheerleader for him”.</p> 
  <p>She told reporters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When you have terrorists cheering on your foreign policy, you know that you have got it wrong. Now, we know that the prime minister said he made this decision because Hamas did not support it.</p> 
   <p>Hamas did not support his decision, but instead we see Hamas coming out in full-throated praise of the prime minister. He must reverse this decision because when terrorists are cheerleaders for your foreign policy, you need to think again and reverse that position.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>For context, the prime minister has repeatedly said Hamas would be excluded from any future Palestinian government, and said the terror group was “manipulating facts for their own propaganda”.</p>

  <p>An Australian household of four now spends $240 on groceries a week, on average, an 11% jump from last year, according to data from <strong>Canstar Blue</strong>.</p> 
  <p>That figure represents the biggest annual increase in the last five years, the group said. The figure was $216 a week on average in 2024, $207 in 2023 and $203 in 2022.</p> 
  <p>Canstar said that total puts the grocery budget for a small family at $12,480 a year, on average.</p> 
  <p>The group surveyed 2,800 shoppers, who rated different supermarkets across a series of categories, including price, customers service and value for money. More than 80% of respondents said they had changed their shopping habits over the last year to try to keep grocery costs down.</p>

  <p><strong>More on Atlassian billionaire Scott Farquhar’s thoughts on AI and Australian art</strong></p> 
  <p>Australia should adopt US-style copyright law to allow artificial intelligence to suck up all creative content or risk harming investment in the industry in Australia, according to Atlassian co-founder, <strong>Scott Farquhar</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Farquhar, the <strong>Tech Council of Australia </strong>CEO, told ABC’s 7.30 program on Tuesday: “all AI usage of mining or searching or going across data is probably illegal under Australian law and I think that hurts a lot of investment of these companies in Australia”.</p> 
  <p>This is because, he said, Australia doesn’t have fair use exemptions coded into copyright law like the US does.</p> 
  <p>Farquhar’s claim overlooks that this is not a settled issue in the US, and could have devastating effects on creative industries.</p>

  <p><strong>Origin Energy’s</strong> underlying profits have jumped by $300m to nearly $1.5bn for the year because it paid less tax on its gas production arm, offsetting falling earnings from electricity and gas.</p> 
  <p>The energy provider, which operates the Eraring coal-fired power station, reported sliding earnings in its annual report this morning.</p> 
  <p>Electricity pre-tax profit slipped $224m as retail prices fell and coal costs rose, while lower wholesale prices cut natural gas profits. That dragged underlying earnings down to $3.4bn from $3.5bn across the business.</p> 
  <p>Origin also sold less gas for less cash via its natural gas production joint venture, <strong>Australia Pacific LNG</strong> – the biggest gas producer on Australia’s east coast. That business segment paid Origin nearly $800m in dividends in the year to June, after paying $1.4bn the year prior – but this time, the segment had already paid tax.</p> 
  <p>That cut Origin’s annual tax bill by nearly $360m in the year to June.</p>

  <p><strong>Victorian Greens slam ‘backroom’ deal on ethics committee appointments: ‘Like letting the fox guard the henhouse’</strong></p> 
  <p>The Victorian Greens leader, <strong>Ellen Sandell</strong>, criticised a “backroom deal” between Labor and the Liberals she says has prevented any crossbenchers from being appointed to the parliament’s new ethics committee.</p> 
  <p>The creation of the committee was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/28/victorian-watchdog-to-investigate-allegations-of-bullying-sexual-assault-and-harassment-in-parliament">key part of the parliamentary workplace standards and integrity bill</a>, which was developed in response to an investigation by state’s integrity bodies into branch-stacking in the Labor party, as well as a 2021 review of workplace standards.</p> 
  <p>The committee is meant to promote integrity, oversee MPs’ codes of conduct and rebuild public trust but Sandell says this is undermined by its makeup:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This so-called ethics committee will be the only joint committee in the entire parliament with no crossbench representatives, controlled by the two parties with the longest track record of rorts.</p> 
   <p>It’s a calculated move so Labor and Liberal MPs can keep writing their own rules around MP behaviour, and avoid any scrutiny. It’s like letting the fox guard the henhouse. This Labor-Liberal backroom deal is nothing more than a protection racket.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Telstra’s profits have bounced back 31% after mobile phone plan users paid out a couple more dollars each than they had the year prior.</p> 
  <p>Telstra raked in an extra $235m from its mobile business in the year to June, a 4.7% rise in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.</p> 
  <p>The company sold an extra 760,000 mobile services and now operates 24.9m plans. A third of those are postpaid users, who paid up an average of $54.15 each a month, a dollar more than they did in June 2024.</p> 
  <p>The company provided 56,000 fewer post-paid plans than it had a year earlier after closing 64,000 inactive accounts. Nearly 60,000 customers quit their prepaid plans and another 17,000 saw their services disconnected when the 3G network closed, though the remaining prepaid plan users paid Telstra over 8% more on average than they had the previous year.</p> 
  <p>The company announced net profit of $2.3bn in its annual report this morning, much higher than the $1.8bn it reported last year when it was having trouble with one of its consulting subsidiaries, Telstra Enterprise.</p> 
  <p>Telstra committed a further $800m spend on improving 5G performance and other mobile coverage, and said its Sydney-Canberra capital intercity fibre network will be extended to Melbourne by December.</p> 
  <p>It paid out a final dividend of 9.5 cents per share, as it did in its interim result earlier this year, and announced it will buy back up another $1bn worth of shares, having bought $750m already.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ley criticises leak of Treasury advice before productivity roundtable</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The opposition leader, <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>, sharply criticised the Labor government after the ABC received <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-14/leaked-treasury-advice-outcomes-productivity-round-table/105648510">a leaked document from Treasury</a> that includes a number of recommended outcomes for the productivity roundtable, which isn’t scheduled to take place until next week.</p> 
  <p>The ABC published details of the pre-written list of ideas that could come from the roundtable, including a freeze on the National Construction Code and measures to speed up housing approvals. A spokesperson for the treasurer said the list’s preparation was standard procedure, and the government was not “pre-empting ideas” but “preparing for them as you would expect”.</p> 
  <p>Ley, however, claimed the leaks demonstrated the productivity roundtable was just an exercise that is “being choreographed”. She told Channel 9’s Today this morning:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s all been lined up. Statements are ready to go out. People are going there in good faith, and they want to see outcomes. They want to see us growing the economic pie, and they want to see Australians pay less tax and be rewarded for their effort. And I fear that none of those things are actually on the agenda at this productivity roundtable.</p> 
   <p>Meanwhile, there’s a growing list of broken promises. Your energy bills would come down. In fact, they’re going up … But tax is really the main thing on this productivity roundtable.</p>

  <p><strong>Billionaire Atlassian co-founder says benefits of AI models outweigh concerns about fair use of artists’ work</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Scott Farquhar,</strong> the billionaire co-founder of Atlassian and the chair of the Tech Council of Australia, said the benefits of artificial intelligence language models outweigh concerns about the use of artists’ work in an interview with ABC’s 7.30 last night.</p> 
  <p>Farquhar has advocated for an “urgent” overhaul of Australia’s copyright rules, saying they are out of step with other countries and training AI language models could unlock “billion of dollars of foreign investment into Australia”. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/06/arts-and-media-groups-demand-labor-take-a-stand-against-rampant-theft-of-australian-content-to-train-ai">many artists have rejected</a> that suggestion and said they should be compensated instead, saying allowing the models to do so would lead to “rampant theft” of intellectual property.</p>

The Productivity Commission is considering it</a> </p> 
  </aside> 
  <p>7.30’s Sarah Ferguson asked how about how “right now, AI companies are just gobbling up all of that material for free. That’s what the artists are calling theft. Do you think that should stop?” Farquhar replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think that the benefits of the large language models and so forth that we’ve got outweigh those issues …</p> 
   <p>We have to work out what is fair use for these AI models. I don’t think it is nothing, that they can’t do anything. …</p> 
   <p>If someone had used my intellectual property to compete with me, then I think that is an issue, directly with me. If they’d used all the intellectual property of all the software on the world to help people write software better in the future, I think that is a fair use.</p>

  <p><strong>EV drivers could soon face road user charges</strong></p> 
  <p>On Monday the federal treasurer, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, flagged the possibility electric car drivers being hit with a road tax as more people switch to battery-powered vehicles.</p> 
  <p>And we are reporting elsewhere today that <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> has signalled that next week’s productivity summit will tackle the issue of charging EV drivers to use the roads.</p>

  <p>Money collected by the <a href="https://www.pbo.gov.au/about-budgets/budget-insights/budget-explainers/fuel-taxation-australia">fuel excise helps fund the federal budget</a> and is not directly allocated to roads, but some motoring groups have<a href="https://www.mynrma.com.au/about/media/press-releases/2022/replace-fuel-excise"> urged governments to adopt road pricing</a> as EV uptake grows.</p> 
  <p>Last week, the <strong>AAA</strong> released Australia’s first independent testing of the battery range in electric vehicles. The federally funded program, designed to give consumers more accurate information, focused on cars made by Tesla, BYD, Kia and Smart.</p> 
  <p>The extended range variant of the BYD Atto3 had the largest discrepancy, <a href="https://realworld.org.au/vehicles/2023-byd-atto-3/">according to the AAA</a>, with a real-world range of 369km, 23% lower than the 480km achieved in laboratory testing. The Smart #3 had the lowest, with only a 5% difference.</p> 
  <p>The Tesla Model 3 had a real-world range 14% lower than the lab test. Tesla’s Model Y and the Kia EV6 both had a real world range 8% lower.</p> 
  <p>Despite showing a gap between lab and real-world results, the AAA and electric vehicle industry representatives said the results should reduce range anxiety among consumers looking to buy an EV.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Electric Vehicle Council</strong> industry body’s head of legal, policy and advocacy, <strong>Aman Gaur,</strong> said the AAA’s results should “give confidence that EVs have more than enough range for everyday Australians”.</p>

  <p><strong>Battery EV sales reach record high</strong></p> 
  <p>The number of battery electric vehicles sold in Australia hit a record high in the three months to 30 June, with <strong>sales increasing by 63%</strong> when compared to the first quarter of 2025.</p> 
  <p>Data compiled by the nation’s peak motoring body shows 29,244 battery electric vehicles were sold in the latest three month period, up from 17,901 registered sales.</p> 
  <p>Battery electric vehicles accounted for 9.3% of all new cars sold during this period, according to the Australian Automobile Association (AAA), up from 6.3%.</p> 
  <p>The number of internal combustion engine cars increased from 205,911 to 226,306 during this period. But the market share of petrol and diesel cars remained steady at 72% thanks to the increase in electric and hybrid sales.</p> 
  <p>“In the first half of 2023, battery electric vehicles outsold hybrids nationally, but since then hybrids have outsold battery electric vehicles in eight consecutive quarters,” the AAA research said.</p> 
  <p>Medium sized SUVs remain Australia’s most popular car and represent almost a quarter of all new light vehicles sales. About 20% of these were battery electric vehicles.</p> 
  <p>A total of 314,185 new cars were sold during the three month period, up from 284,538 in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Almost half of Australians experience cybercrime, study finds</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Nearly half of Australians experienced some form of cybercrime last year, with the federal government urging people not to reuse online passwords and make sure they have multi-factor authentication on devices.</p> 
  <p>Some Australians are getting more confident in identifying online crime, which is leading to focus less on protective behaviours, with a whopping 22% of people experiencing identity crime</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian Institute of Criminology</strong> said online abuse, identity theft, malware and scams were the most common forms of online crime experienced last year. Their new report, Cybercrime in Australia 2024, was released this morning finding 9.5% of Australians were victims of fraud or online scams.</p> 
  <p>Another 26.8% experienced online abuse or harassment, 21.9% were victims of identity crime, and 20.6% encountered malware attacks.</p> 
  <p>“While some types of cybercrime declined compared with 2023, the report found protective behaviours – such as using strong passwords and security updates – remain worryingly low,” said Tony Burke, the minister for home affairs and cybersecurity.</p> 
  <p>The AIC report found only 50% of people used unique passwords for their online accounts, down from 53% the year before. Only 58% of people used multi factor authentication to login.</p> 
  <p>“Respondents were more confident in their knowledge of technology in 2024 than in 2023, which may lead them to place less importance on protective behaviours,” the AIC said.</p> 
  <p>Burke said Australians should take more care.</p> 
  <p>“Remember these three simple steps to stay safe online – always install the latest software updates, use unique passphrases, and enable multifactor authentication wherever it’s available,” he said.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m <strong>Martin Farrer</strong> with the top overnight stories and then my colleague <strong>Nick Visser</strong> will be in the hot seat.</p> 
  <p>Almost half of Australians experienced some form of cybercrime last year, according to a study by the Australian Institute of Criminology, with close to 22% of people experiencing some sort of identity crime. In response, the federal government is urging people not to reuse online passwords and make sure they have multi-factor authentication on devices. More details in a minute.</p> 
  <p>The number of battery electric vehicles sold in Australia hit a record high in the three months to 30 June, with sales increasing by 63% when compared with the first quarter of 2025. Figures from the AAA shows 29,244 battery electric vehicles were sold in the latest three-month period, up from 17,901 registered sales. It comes as we report this morning that the government is ready to introduce road charging for EV drivers to make up for the decline in revenue from petrol sales. More coming up.</p>
