<p>Never before has a Nobel peace prize – or indeed any prize, decoration or gold star – loomed so large over a US president and their foreign policy.</p> <p>Since his return to the White House, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> campaign to influence the Norwegian Nobel committee<strong> </strong>has been anything but subtle – but with just hours to go before the award is announced, it has gone into overdrive.</p> <p>As news broke of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/gaza-ceasefire-deal-first-phase-trump-peace-plan">landmark peace agreement</a> that could end the war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war">Gaza between Israel and Hamas</a>, his allies took to the airwaves in a last-ditch effort to win him the award that he has openly coveted for years.</p> <p>“Everybody has been talking about: ‘Will he get the Nobel peace prize?’” said Brian Mast, a Republican congressman of Florida, on Fox News Thursday morning. “Those … academics and elites sitting in Norway, that board of people that decide it, they need to give President Trump the Nobel peace prize.”</p> <p>“I’m not certain that the board in Norway that looks at this believes in peace through strength … they believe in peace through pandering,” he said.</p> <p>Soon, Eylon Levy, a former Israeli government spokesperson, went on camera and said: “You know there is very little that Israelis agree on but there’s one point of consensus this morning: President Donald Trump deserves that Nobel peace prize.”</p> <p>And it was clear that Trump was watching. Minutes later, the US president went on Truth Social, his social media platform, to thank both men by name.</p> <p>While Trump has played down his chances to win the prize, he has been active behind the scenes, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/trump-nobel-prize-norway">phoning Jens Stoltenberg</a>, Norway’s finance minister, in Oslo this summer to tell him he wanted to discuss the “Nobel peace prize … and tariffs”. He regularly brings up the award; usually as he makes the tenuous claim to have ended six or seven wars since his return to the White House.</p> <p>“If I were named Obama, I would have had the Nobel prize given to me in 10 seconds,” Trump said last year during the presidential race.</p> <p>The obsession has become a running joke among foreign diplomats seeking to lobby their interests, including at a regular breakfast among European ambassadors where a common topic is how to keep Trump engaged in the support of Ukraine.</p> <p>“Anytime he is talking about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/trump-claims-to-have-ended-six-wars-is-that-true">solving seven wars</a>, he is really sending a message: give me the Nobel,” said one senior European diplomat based in Washington.</p> <p>The Nobel peace prize was believed to be a key motivator in his recent efforts to broker a ceasefire in Ukraine, influencing a rare summit with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> in Alaska that was seen as a major gamble if it was interpreted as appeasing the Kremlin.</p> <p>Ultimately, Putin was unmoved and Trump appeared to lose interest in ending Russia’s war in Ukraine.</p> <p>“Once he figured out that was too hard, we’re back to Gaza,” the diplomat said.</p> <p>Trump’s new push for a peace deal to end the war kicked into gear during last month’s UN general assembly, where he met with Arab leaders and then approved a 20-point peace plan that he announced during a White House summit with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> in late September.</p> <p>The timeline for the award has played an active role in trying to reach a deal this week, as officials have regularly said they believed a peace deal would be ready by Friday – the same day as the Nobel committee announces its choice.</p> <p>Doron Hadar, a former negotiator, told the Washington Post on Thursday that the “Friday morning deadline is shaping the timeline, the announcement of the Nobel Committee in Oslo.</p> <p>“Everyone understands this timeline, and that’s why I believe that by [Thursday] evening, there will already be a declaration that the sides have reached agreements,” he said, according to the outlet.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/08/trump-nobel-peace-prize-sidney-blumenthal">Need I list all the reasons why Trump shouldn’t get a Nobel peace prize? | Sidney Blumenthal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a delicious bit of irony, the Norwegian committee told Agence-France Presse that it had held its final meeting on Monday – two days before Trump announced the first phase of the peace deal on Truth Social.</p> <p>But amid the naked ambition behind Trump’s push for peace in Gaza, even those who have been highly critical of the war have hailed the deal as a major achievement.</p> <p>“This is definitely a morning for celebration,” wrote Gershon Baskin, an Israeli peace activist and hostage negotiator. “The war is ending. The killing and destruction will stop.”</p> <p>Later, he added: “In conclusion of these first thoughts: President Trump deserves the Nobel peace prize.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 October 2025.
