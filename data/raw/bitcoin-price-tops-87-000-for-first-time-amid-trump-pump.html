<p>The price of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin">bitcoin</a> has risen above $87,000 for the first time as it benefited from traders’ hopes that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> will favour cryptocurrencies when he returns to the White House.</p> <p>Bitcoin reached a record high of $87,198, before slipping back slightly on Monday. The price has more than doubled from about $37,000 12 months ago.</p> <p>The election has also affected traditional currency markets, individual stocks – most notably Elon Musk’s electric car company, Tesla – and broad US equity markets, as investors bet on deregulation and tax cuts from Trump.</p> <p>Trump has in the past called bitcoin a “scam against the dollar”, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/31/bitcoin-2024-conference-donald-trump">he changed his tune on cryptocurrency</a> during the US presidential election campaign, courting the crypto community and appearing at industry events. That has created an expectation of a relaxation of rules to make it easier for retail savers to invest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies – although Trump has not specified any policies.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2024/nov/11/kremlin-denies-reports-of-trump-putin-ukraine-war-call-us-politics-live">Kremlin denies reports of Trump-Putin call over Ukraine – US politics live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Trump trade has spread throughout the world’s markets since his victory became clear, with the dollar gaining in value as investors await a high-spending US government.</p> <p>The dollar rose by 0.6% on Monday against a trade-weighted basket of currencies, with the euro dropping to its lowest since May. One euro bought less than $1.06 on Monday, compared with $1.12 at the end of September. The pound also fell by 0.4% against the dollar, to trade below $1.29, close to its lowest level since August.</p> <p>In China investors are bracing for steep new tariffs. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index dropped by 1.5% on Monday, which some investors said represented an underwhelming response to China’s economic stimulus programme, announced last week.</p> <p>While the debt swap programme, aimed at shoring up local government finances, was worth about 10tn yuan (£1.1tn), economists at Deutsche Bank said that it “disappointed market expectations as it lacked direct fiscal stimulus and targeted measures to improve the housing market”.</p> <p>Prices have also risen since the election for other cryptocurrencies such as ethereum and dogecoin, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/01/elon-musk-insider-trading-dogecoin-lawsuit">meme coin previously backed by Elon Musk</a>, the chief executive of Tesla and owner of X who has become a vocal Trump supporter and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/07/trump-victory-adds-record-wealth-richest-top-10">whose wealth rose by $26.5bn</a> shortly after the election result was confirmed.</p> <p>Tesla’s share price rose by almost 9% as investors hoped for the government to let carmakers accelerate autonomous car technology. Dan Ives, a prominent tech analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he believed that the “Trump White House win will be a gamechanger for the autonomous and AI story for Tesla and Musk over the coming years”.</p> <p>Musk is not the only crypto backer with Trump’s ear. Trump even went as far as giving his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/17/trump-crypto-world-liberty-financial">backing in September to a cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial</a>, run by his family, a move that could leave him open to criticisms over potential conflicts of interest if he moves to deregulate digital assets. His son, Donald Trump Jr, has said cryptocurrency offers an alternative to a banking system that he alleges is tilted against conservatives.</p> <p>Ronald Temple, the chief market strategist at Lazard, an investment bank, said Trumphad promised to fire Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities Exchange Commission, “on day one” of his presidency.</p> <p>“Gensler has advocated more stringent regulation of cryptocurrencies through much of his term” at the head of the US’s key financial regulator, Temple added.</p> <p>The share prices of listed cryptocurrency companies also appear poised to benefit. The crypto exchange Coinbase has jumped by 40% since the election result, and its share price was up by another 20%. Microstrategy, a software company whose founder led huge purchases of bitcoin, was up 26%.</p> <p>Matt Simpson, a senior market analyst at City Index, described the moves on crypto markets as a “Trump pump” as traders bet that the president-elect will usher in a period of cryptocurrency adoption.</p> <p>The price of bitcoin correlated to Trump’s vote share in opinion polls during the election campaign against the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. It was below $70,000 on election day last Tuesday, but has gained nearly a fifth in value since then. Some market watchers believe the price could top $100,000 this week.</p>
