  <p><strong>European leaders have praised President Donald Trump for agreeing to allow US military support for a force they are mustering to police any future peace in Ukraine – a move that vastly improves the chances of success for an operation that could prove essential for the country’s security.</strong></p> 
  <p>The leaders said Trump offered American military backup for the European “reassurance force” during a call they held with him ahead of his planned summit with Russian president Vladimir Putin on Friday, AP reported. They did not say what the assistance might involve and Trump himself has not publicly confirmed any support.</p> 
  <p>The effectiveness of the operation, drawn up by the coalition of about 30 countries supporting Ukraine, hinges on the deterrent effect of US air power or other military equipment that European armed forces do not have, or have only in short supply.</p> 
  <p>No US troops would be involved, but the threat of American air power, if needed, behind the European force would likely help to dissuade Russian troops from testing Europe’s resolve.</p> 
  <p>Senior Russian officials have repeatedly rejected the idea of European peacekeepers in Ukraine, even though a traditional UN-style peacekeeping force is not being planned.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump says Putin 'wants to get it done,' as he once again floats another meeting with Zelenskyy</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is speaking to Fox News Radio right now, and he has just said that he thought <strong>Russian president Vladimir Putin “wants to get it done” at tomorrow’s summit in Alaska.</strong></p> 
  <p>Asked if <strong>his threats of sanctions may have influenced Putin’s decision to agree to a meeting</strong>, he said:</p> 
  <p><strong>“Everything has an impact,”</strong> as he added that secondary <strong>tariffs against India “essentially took them out of buying oil from Russia.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“Certainly, when you lose your second largest customer and you’re probably going to lose your first largest customer, I think that probably has a role,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Trump got also asked if he was ready to provide “economic incentives” to Russia to stop fighting in Ukraine, but he declined to say, explaining he wouldn’t “want to play my hand in public.”</p> 
  <p>He <strong>repeatedly said that Russia had “a tremendous potential,”</strong> with value in “oil and gas, a very profitable business.”</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Trump stressed he was primarily interested in making progress</strong> <strong>with Putin, and he would then immediately call Zelenskyy to “get him over to wherever we are going to meet.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“We have an idea of three different locations,” he said, adding “including the possibility, because it would be by far the easiest, of staying in Alaska.”</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>If it’s a bad meeting, I’m not calling anybody.</strong> I’m going home.</em></p> 
   <p><em>But if it’s a good meeting, I’m going to call President Zelensky and the European leaders.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Addressing the reports he could hold a joint press conference with Putin, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“I’m going to have a press conference. I don’t know if it’s going to be a joint. We haven’t even discussed it. I think it might be nice to have a joint, and then separates.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But he then added that he would hold a press conference in any scenario, even if the talks collapse.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In other news across Europe, the situation in <strong>Serbia </strong>merits renewed attention as <strong>large groups of pro-government supporters, most wearing masks, confronted groups taking part in long-running anti-graft protests run by student movements</strong>, AFP reported.</p>

  <p>AFP noted that the worst violence was reported in parts of <strong>Belgrade</strong> and <strong>Novi Sad</strong>, where the protest movement first began, with dozens injured and arrested.</p>

  <p>The mix of old-guard loyalists and younger financial power-brokers points to<strong> Putin’s aim of wooing Trump’s ear and dangling financial incentives for siding with Moscow on Ukraine.</strong> </p> 
  <p>Notably, alongside a cadre of veteran diplomats, <strong>Putin is bringing two prominent economic advisers.</strong> </p> 
  <p>The presence of finance minister <strong>Anton Siluanov</strong> is particularly striking: he has overseen Russia’s response to sweeping western sanctions, the lifting of which the Kremlin has repeatedly set as a central condition for any peace deal.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Climate change exacerbating severity of fires across Europe, experts say</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Europe environment correspondent</em></p> 
  <p>The deadly fires come as <strong>southern Europe suffers intense heat that has broken temperature records across the continent</strong> – made worse by fossil fuel pollution that traps sunlight and heats the planet – and which has dried out vegetation.</p> 
  <p><strong>“It’s obvious that climate change is exacerbating the severity of fires,”</strong> said <strong>Eduardo Rojas Briales</strong>, a forestry researcher at the Polytechnic University of Valencia and former deputy director general of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. “But it’s not responsible to wait for greenhouse gas emissions to drop … as the sole approach to addressing the problem.”</p> 
  <p>He called for <strong>additional policies such as ensuring dead plant material is kept at manageable levels, creating gaps in vegetation,</strong> for instance through reversing rural abandonment, <strong>and using prescribed burning.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>“There is no alternative but to build landscapes … that are truly resilient to fires,”</strong> he said.</p> 
  <p>A report published Thursday by XDI, a climate risk analysis group, found that t<strong>he climate crisis has doubled the risk of infrastructure damage from forest fires in France, Italy, Greece, Romania and Bulgaria</strong> since 1990. It predicted risk would increase further still in future.</p> 
  <p><strong>“We’re all asking ourselves, how much worse can it get?,</strong>” said Karl Mallon, XDI’s head of science and technology. </p> 
  <p><strong>“According to our latest analysis, a lot.”</strong></p>

  <p>Brussels said it has today sent two planes stationed in France from its <strong>“rescEU” programme</strong> designed to protect citizens with teams from the Netherlands and Estonia deployed to support national efforts.</p> 
  <p>The civil protection mechanism allows firefighting personnel and vehicles and aircraft from other countries to be deployed in countries of need with the bill picked up in Brussels.</p> 
  <p>“<strong>The mechanism has been activated 16 times this year, already equal to the total number of activations of the whole summer season last year,</strong>” said an EU spokesperson.</p> 
  <p>The EU said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“During the past week, <strong>Greece</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong>, <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, <strong>Montenegro</strong> and <strong>Albania</strong> activated the mechanism to help deal with forest fires – many of which are occurring simultaneously across Europe.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>Greece </strong>activated the Mechanism on 12 August. In response, the two Swedish rescEU helicopters currently in Bulgaria are expected to be deployed. Prepositioned firefighters from Czechia, Moldova and Romania also took part in the efforts to put out the fires.</em></p> 
   <p><em>In <strong>Bulgaria </strong>six countries - Czechia, Slovakia, France, Hungary, Romania, Sweden - mobilised aircraft via the Mechanism including the rescEU helicopters stationed in Sweden.</em></p> 
   <p><em>In <strong>Albania,</strong> the Commission mobilised rescEU aerial assets from Croatia, Bulgaria, Italy and Czechia and Slovakia.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>“In Montenegro,</strong> the Commission mobilised rescEU assets stationed in Czechia, Croatia and Italy. Serbia, Hungary and Bosnia and Herzegovina also deployed aircraft means as part of bilateral offers, and Austria offered ground firefighting teams.”</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">What to expect from Alaska summit? — snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Defence and security editor<br>Speaking to BBC News, from Kyiv</em></p> 
  <p><strong>I don’t think Putin is going to be in a mood to compromise very much in Alaska.</strong></p> 
  <p>I think <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will be doing very well to get any further concessions out of Putin, because it’s the little tactical successes on the frontline that just make Russia keep thinking, ‘we can grind our way to a victory there’.</p> 
  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/ukraine_sitrep_130825/giv-32554gRCPTlOEVB6w/" data-alt="A map of Russian advances in Ukraine"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/ukraine_sitrep_130825/giv-32554gRCPTlOEVB6w/">Interactive</a> 
  </figure> 
  <p>There’s very little expectation in Ukraine of any kind of sort of goodwill from <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, or any kind of compromise, or anything that leads to compromise. <strong>The two sides are miles apart.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Russia continues to make these maximalist demands of territory.</strong> The latest demand appears to be all of <strong>Donetsk</strong> province, about 9000 square kilometres, in return for a ceasefire, … including the significant cities of <strong>Kramatorsk</strong> and <strong>Sloviansk</strong>. Zelensky already said he can’t agree to that.</p> 
  <p>The idea that Trump can force Vladimir Putin into a dramatically different way of thinking, I don’t think there’s a lot of optimism around that.</p> 
  <p><strong>What we are likely to see is a lot of theatre</strong> and perhaps Putin will try to be smooth as possible to minimise the differences, <strong>but the reality is that I would be very surprised to see any significant or meaningful progress.</strong></p> 
  <p>We might see commitment to further meetings, but I’m really not confident we’re going to see much more than that.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Alaska meeting presents 'viable chance to make progress' if Putin is serious, UK says after Starmer-Zelenskyy talks</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Trump-Putin summit in Alaska presents “a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,”</strong> Downing Street said in a statement after Starmer’s meeting with Zelenskyy in London.</p> 
  <p>The UK prime minister and the Ukrainian president discussed yesterday’s consultations with Trump, saying <strong>“there had been a powerful sense of unity and a strong resolve to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,”</strong> the readout said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Security guarantees part of discussions with UK, Zelenskyy says after meeting Starmer</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In a short statement after his meeting with UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, Ukraine’s <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> said they <strong>discussed “in considerable detail the security guarantees that can make peace truly durable</strong> if the United States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killings and engage in genuine, substantive diplomacy.”</p> 
  <p>The pair also <strong>discussed “mechanisms for weapons supplies,”</strong> with Zelenskyy urging Starmer to join the growing list of countries funding new weapons for Ukraine through Nato’s new <strong>Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List</strong> scheme.</p> 
  <p>They also discussed <strong>Ukraine’s plans to “increase production volumes” of drones,</strong> with the country “urgently needing financing for this.”</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>Drones play a decisive role on the frontline</strong>, and Ukraine’s capabilities to produce them are exceptional. Therefore, investment in such production can truly influence the situation at the strategic level. We are working with the UK and all our partners on this.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The leaders also <strong>talked about their bilateral partnership</strong> agreed earlier this year, Zelenskyy said.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Separately, <strong>the EU has said it sees no justification for China to sanction two Lithuanian banks in retaliation against the bloc’s sanctions on two Chinese banks</strong> as part of the 18th package of sanctions on Russia.</p> 
  <p>“<strong>We don’t believe those countermeasures have any justification</strong> and therefore we call on China to remove them now,” said EU spokesperson <strong>Olof Gill.</strong> </p> 
  <p>He said t<strong>he EU was continuing discussions with China about the sanctions</strong> on the banks which came into force on 9 August. </p> 
  <p>China took countermeasures against two banks in the European Union, in response to the bloc placing two Chinese financial institutions on a Russia-related sanctions list, its commerce ministry said on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>Effective immediately, Lithuanian banks <strong>UAB Urbo Bankas</strong> and <strong>AB Mano Bankas</strong> were banned from carrying out transactions and cooperation with organisations and individuals within China, the ministry’s statement said.</p>

  <p>Separately, <strong>the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/finland-president-alexander-stubb-6c0a474a?st=vWEgnt">highlighted</a> the importance of another leader playing a critical role in getting US president Trump to understand the European position</strong> a bit better.</p> 
  <p>Finnish president <strong>Alexander Stubb</strong> has “formed an unexpected bond” with Trump, WSJ said, after meeting with the US president for golf, <strong>with the pair regularly chatting on the phone ever since.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Playing golf with Trump “vaulted the little-known Stubb into a back-channel role with the US president,”</strong> WSJ said, making him “a key conduit for European officials seeking to influence” the US position ahead of this Friday’s high-stakes summit with Putin.</p> 
  <p>“People know that we Finns don’t have a hidden agenda, and <strong>we’re also quite blunt.</strong> I can communicate what Europeans or Zelensky think to Trump, and then I can communicate what Trump thinks to my European colleagues,” he told WSJ.</p> 
  <p>Influential Republican senator <strong>Lindsey Graham</strong> is said to speak with Stubb even twice a day, confirming to the paper that <strong>they would regularly text each other,</strong> “getting insight about what’s going on, giving advice.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Germany's Merz gets measured praise for Ukraine diplomacy, but Nato's Rutte gets most credit</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Berlin</em></p> 
  <p>German chancellor <strong>Friedrich Merz’s stab at heading up Ukraine diplomacy has received measured praise at home</strong>, with a perception that Donald Trump’s declarations after Wednesday’s video conference sounded slightly less alarming to European ears than before. </p> 
  <p>News outlet <strong>Der Spiegel</strong> has <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/friedrich-merz-und-wolodymyr-selenskyj-in-berlin-als-der-nato-chef-das-wort-ergreift-scheint-trump-ein-licht-aufzugehen-a-f77be7dc-0550-498f-89dc-733306930b98">a multi-sourced play-by-play from the call</a> initiated by Merz in which it <strong>credits the much-criticised Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, with making the penny drop for Trump on a key point.</strong></p> 
  <p>Rutte <strong>received flak in June</strong> after a Nato summit at which he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/27/critics-react-europe-donald-trump-nato-mark-rutte">showered the US president with compliments over his actions on Iran and bizarrely referred to him as “daddy”.</a></p> 
  <p>More recently <strong>he raised eyebrows</strong> by acknowledging even before Friday’s summit that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nato-secretary-general-rutte-trump-putin-summit-testing/story?id=124520882">Ukraine may ultimately have to accept de facto Russian control over parts of its occupied territory as part of a future peace agreement</a>.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Spiegel said participants hailed Rutte’s constructive role in the talks with Trump on Wednesday</strong>, using clear, direct language to explain that if Russia were allowed to permanently control cities in the eastern Donbas as part of a land swap, it would open up “a motorway to Kyiv” for Russian troops to take control of the capital. </p> 
  <p><strong>Participants recounted watching the “light go on” for Trump,</strong> who then reportedly conveyed he did not intend to negotiate territorial concessions.</p> 
  <p>Spiegel quoted <strong>members of Merz’s team as saying that they were “relieved” by the “very constructive” tone taken by Trump and his vice-president JD Vance.</strong></p> 
  <p>“<strong>The Ukrainian delegation</strong>, which was present in the room when Merz and (president Volodymyr) Zelenskyy spoke with Trump on the phone, <strong>is said to have applauded loudly at the end of the conversation,</strong>” Spiegel said.</p> 
  <p><strong>German officials had sought to impose discipline on participants to accommodate Trump’s limited attention span:</strong> “A clear structure was planned for the approximately one-hour telephone call: Merz would present his case concisely, the others would respond briefly, and there would be no lengthy monologues,” the officials told Spiegel. </p> 
  <p><strong>Zelenskyy</strong> was also <strong>strongly encouraged “not to allow himself to be provoked”</strong> by the Americans to avoid any repeat of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/zelenskyy-trump-white-house-meeting-fox-news">February’s disastrous Oval Office clash</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>“Zelenskyy followed this advice,”</strong> participants told Spiegel. </p> 
  <p>Merz’s aides hailed the fact <strong>Trump reiterated some of their key points:</strong> the meeting in Alaska was only a kind of preliminary discussion, and only after that could proper peace negotiations take place, in which the Ukrainian president would also have to participate.</p> 
  <p>The Europeans had previously told Trump <strong>Putin would only budge if the US increased the pressure.</strong> </p> 
  <p>“<strong>Trump listens to whoever talks to him last:</strong> for now, this little psychological trick seems to be working,” Spiegel said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Kremlin looks to go beyond 'peace deal,' hopes for reset in US-Russia relations — snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The new details of the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska suggest the Kremlin is seeking to go beyond talks over a “peace deal” in Ukraine</strong> and is looking for a comprehensive reset of US-Russia relations.</p> 
  <p>The two sides have met several times since Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, with bilateral talks led by the US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Riyadh. This <strong>broader agenda appears to be on the table again</strong>, with Russia keen to stress the benefit of joint commercial opportunities.</p> 
  <p><strong>Russia has previously indicated it wants to cooperate with the US in a number of areas.</strong> They include trade, minerals, oil, and the Arctic. In return for deals with US oil majors, say, it is likely to demand the lifting of sanctions on key Russian businesses and oligarchs.</p> 
  <p><strong>Any weakening by Trump of US sanctions on Russia will dismay Ukraine and its European allies.</strong> </p> 
  <p><strong>They will also be anxious about a joint Trump-Vladimir Putin press conference.</strong> At their last infamous appearance together in Helsinki in 2018, Trump said Russia had not interfered in the 2016 US presidential election – which it had.</p> 
  <p>One interesting figure in Russia’s delegation is <strong>Kirill Dmitriev</strong>, an investment banker and the head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. Dmitriev – a fluent English speaker – has escorted <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong>, Trump’s special envoy, on his several trips to Moscow. </p> 
  <p><strong>Dmitriev is the Kremlin’s Witkoff whisperer.</strong> His job is to convince the White House that Russia is serious about “peace” in Ukraine and that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the obstacle to it.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Big hug from Starmer for Zelenskyy in another show of solidarity, but Kyiv has no illusions about Trump - snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Speaking on BBC News</em></p> 
  <p><strong>It’s interesting seeing those images</strong>, because you’ll remember <strong>after </strong><em><strong>that</strong></em><strong> Oval Office meeting, the first place that President Zelensky came to was London, and there was a big demonstrative hug by Keir Starmer</strong>, the prime minister, of Zelensky, a sort of show of solidarity after a bruising encounter with Trump and JD Vance.</p> 
  <p><strong>I don’t think Zelensky can trust Donald Trump.</strong> <strong>The Ukrainians</strong>, since that disastrous episode, <strong>have been doing everything they can to basically … fix relations with America,</strong> with Washington, and that strategy has played out, and we have to sort of see where they are tomorrow.</p> 
  <p>But I think <strong>if Trump ends up, after his meeting with Putin, blaming Zelenskyy for the war,</strong> suggesting he is the problem, the obstacle to peace, the obstacle to a ceasefire and meaningful progress, <strong>no one in Kyiv will be surprised by that.</strong></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Sam Jones</strong><em> in Madrid, </em><strong>Helena Smith</strong><em> in Athens and agencies</em></p> 
  <p><strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/12/thousands-evacuated-in-spain-amid-deadly-wildfires-and-new-heatwave">heatwave-fuelled wildfires</a></strong> that have killed three people in Spain over recent days, devouring thousands of hectares of land and forcing thousands of people from their homes, <strong>are</strong> <strong>a “clear warning” of the impact of the climate emergency, the country’s environment minister has said.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking on Wednesday morning, as firefighters in Spain, Greece and other Mediterranean countries continued to battle dozens of blazes, <strong>Sara Aagesen said the 14 wildfires still burning across seven Spanish regions were further proof of the country’s particular vulnerability to global heating.</strong></p> 
  <p>Aagesen said that <strong>while some of the fires appeared to have been started deliberately, the deadly blazes were a clear indicator of the climate emergency</strong> and of the need for better preparation and prevention.</p> 
  <p>“The fires are <strong>one of the parts of the impact of that climate change</strong>, which is why we have to do all we can when it comes to prevention,” <a href="https://cadenaser.com/nacional/2025/08/13/aagesen-carga-contra-el-negacionismo-climatico-y-apuesta-por-la-profesionalizacion-total-de-los-servicios-de-extincion-del-fuego-cadena-ser/">she told Cadena Ser radio</a>.</p> 
  <p>“<strong>Our country is especially vulnerable to climate change.</strong> We have resources now but, given that the scientific evidence and the general expectation point to it having an ever greater impact, we need to work to reinforce and professionalise those resources.”</p> 
  <p><strong>The Spanish government on Wednesday said it has asked the European Union for its help,</strong> in particular for two water-bombing planes. “We officially asked tonight” for the assistance, interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Cadena Ser.</p> 
  <p>Neighbouring <strong>Portugal deployed more than 2,100 firefighters and 20 aircraft against five big blazes</strong>, with efforts focused on a fire in the central municipality of Trancoso that has raged since Saturday.</p> 
  <p>Strong gusts of wind had <strong>rekindled flames overnight and threatened nearby villages</strong>, where television images showed local people volunteering to help firefighters under a thick cloud of smoke.</p> 
  <p><strong>In Greece, which requested EU aerial assistance on Tuesday, close to 5,000 firefighters were battling blazes fanned by gale-force winds nationwide.</strong> Authorities said emergency workers were waging a “a titanic battle” to douse flames still raging through the western Peloponnese, in Epirus farther north, and on the islands of Zakynthos, Kefalonia and Chios, where thousands of residents and tourists have been evacuated from homes and hotels.</p> 
  <p>Local media reported the wildfires had decimated houses, farms and factories and forced people to flee. Fifteen firefighters and two volunteers had suffered burns and other injuries including “symptoms of heatstroke”, the fire service said.</p> 
  <p><strong>Turkey has been battling severe <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2025/jun/30/wildfires-rage-across-turkeys-izmir-province-video-report">wildfires since late June</a>.</strong> A total of 18 people have been killed, including 10 rescue volunteers and forestry workers who died in July.</p> 
  <p><strong>In southern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/albania">Albania</a> a wildfire caused explosions after detonating buried second world war-era artillery shells.</strong> Officials said on Wednesday an 80-year-old man had died in one blaze south of the capital, Tirana.</p>

  <p><strong>What is happening in Spain now goes far beyond discomfort.</strong> More than 1,500 deaths have <a href="https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20250806/verano-deja-por-ahora-mas-1500-muertes-atribuibles-calor-42-mas-2024/16689435.shtml">already been linked</a> to heatwaves this summer alone. Public-sector workers are collapsing from heatstroke on our city streets. Entire communities in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/12/tres-cantos-wildfire-spain-destruction">Madrid suburbs</a> have been devastated by wildfires. </p> 
  <p>On Monday, <strong><a href="https://elpais.com/clima-y-medio-ambiente/2025-08-12/avisos-rojos-en-andalucia-y-pais-vasco-por-la-ola-de-calor-que-el-lunes-registro-443-grados-en-huelva.html">198 weather stations</a> recorded temperatures of 40C or higher.</strong> Following a record-breaking July, the first 20 days of August will probably be the <a href="https://elpais.com/clima-y-medio-ambiente/2025-08-13/la-aemet-preve-que-los-primeros-20-dias-de-este-agosto-sean-los-mas-calidos-en-espana-desde-que-hay-registros.html">warmest on record</a>. Alongside housing, the climate crisis is Spain’s most visible and most persistent problem: every summer reminds us of this. <strong>You can’t ignore it, or escape it; so why are Spain’s politicians still so reluctant to tackle the climate emergency?</strong></p> 
  <p>Fighting global heating is a worldwide challenge, but <strong>protecting populations against the consequences</strong> – with an awareness that Europe is <a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/why-are-europe-and-arctic-heating-faster-rest-world">heating faster</a> than other continents – <strong>must also be a national and a local priority.</strong> </p> 
  <p><strong>Within Spain, the climate crisis too often becomes an excuse for superficial, party-political feuds.</strong> In the population at large, there has been years of broad popular consensus, but contrast that with Spain’s politicians, for whom the issue has become increasingly partisan, with the right and the left fighting over totemic policies about cars and bikes.</p> 
  <p>Even <strong>Spain’s centre-left coalition government</strong>, led by Pedro Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE), <strong>has taken only modest steps to reduce emissions from industry and transport</strong>. And as they do on other issues, the socialists rush to point the finger at regional and local governments run by the conservative People’s party (PP), supported in some cases by the far-right Vox, which has pushed <a href="https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2024/11/19/673b68e9fc6c8359428b4570.html">falsehoods and conspiracy theories</a> about the climate crisis.</p> 
  <p>It is true that <strong>Spain’s regional and local governments</strong>, powerful and well funded, <strong>also bear great responsibility</strong>: for protecting the most vulnerable from extreme heat, adapting public spaces, planting trees and ensuring there is sufficient shade and water fountains. One urgent necessity is the creation of “cool banks”, especially for people in overcrowded and overheated homes, those with health vulnerabilities, the very young and the very old. Valencia has a network of these <a href="https://climaienergia.com/es/red-de-refugios-climaticos-de-valencia/">climate shelters</a>, while <a href="https://www.barcelona.cat/barcelona-pel-clima/en/specific-actions/climate-shelters-network">Barcelona has mapped out</a> hundreds of public spaces where people can escape the heat, from libraries to museums.</p> 
  <p><strong>But too many local governments are still failing to provide respite.</strong> Madrid is among the worst offenders. Public cooling centres are <a href="https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/somos/madrid-falla-respuesta-calor-escasea-refugios-climaticos-urbanos-zonas-verdes-son-asignatura-pendiente_1_12348301.html">almost nonexistent</a>, and shopping centres remain the most common refuge. The capital’s conservative regional and local governments have been passive or even hostile towards public demands to reduce dangerous heat levels in neighbourhoods, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/15/madrid-hottest-cities-earth-trees-chopped-down">too few green spaces</a> and too many cars. When Madrid’s city hall does spend money, it often misses the point: the most absurd example is Puerta del Sol, the central square that after months of renovation work still feels like a concrete frying pan all summer. Only after protests did the city council finally install a few flimsy shades, at a <a href="https://www.eldiario.es/madrid/somos/ayuntamiento-madrid-coloca-toldos-millon-medio-euros-dar-sombra-puerta-sol_1_12394079.html">cost of €1.5m</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>The most dramatic consequences of the climate crisis make headlines around the world:</strong> the tragic deaths of workers in vulnerable jobs, picking fruit or cleaning streets, and wildfires killing people, destroying homes and even a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/12/thousands-evacuated-in-spain-amid-deadly-wildfires-and-new-heatwave">Roman-era mining site</a> – now a burned-out Unesco world heritage site. But across Spain, the signs are everywhere: crops ruined by hail, high-speed trains disrupted, and neighbourhoods baking in the heat.</p> 
  <p>The frustrating question is <strong>why our politicians are still shrugging off this reality</strong>, as though it were just an inconvenience. How many broken records and how many heatwave deaths will it take to change this?</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>And in the last few minutes, <strong>the Spanish authorities reported a third fatality in wildfires in the country </strong>this week, after a 36-year-old man died after suffering extensive burns while battling a fire in <strong>Castile and León.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Today, we mourn a new death of a person who was part of the firefighting operation in the province of Leon, more specifically in the Valderia region,” <strong>Nicanor Sen Vélez</strong>, prefect for Castile and Leon, <a href="https://x.com/NicanorSen/status/1955890830603939916">wrote on X</a>.</p>
