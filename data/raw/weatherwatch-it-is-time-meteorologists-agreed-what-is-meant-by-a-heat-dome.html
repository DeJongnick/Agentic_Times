<p>Some forecasters attributed the recent warm weather to a “heat dome”. This sounds like a technical term, but the expression is not used in scientific circles and some question whether it should be used at all.</p> <p>Loosely speaking, a heat dome occurs when a stationary mass of high-pressure air forms over a region. This has a doming effect, blocking more warm air from rising, which raises pressure and temperature further.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/23/heat-dome-high-temperatures-warning">A 2016 Guardian piece discussed</a> how the term “heat dome” was starting to be used by American forecasters describing extreme conditions. One science editor complained that the new term was employed “with a kind of breathlessness that implies there is something unusual and catastrophic going on”. Others thought that it was helpful in describing the mechanism causing especially high temperatures.</p> <p>In 2019 the Met Office <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/news-and-media/media-centre/weather-and-climate-news/2019/hot-spell-to-come-190719">described “heat dome” as “not a meteorological term that is recognised professionally”</a>. But the expression took off, particularly in media discussions of the June 2021 Pacific north-west heatwave. In 2022 the American Meteorological Society <a href="https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Heat_dome">added “heat dome” to its glossary of terms</a>.</p> <p>Technically correct or not, <a href="https://wxguys.ssec.wisc.edu/2024/07/01/heat-dome/">“heat dome” is here to stay</a>. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025AMS%E2%80%A610548839L/abstract">A recent paper by the American Meteorological Society argues</a> that the best course for meteorologists would be to agree a rigorous definition and get the media to use it correctly.</p>
