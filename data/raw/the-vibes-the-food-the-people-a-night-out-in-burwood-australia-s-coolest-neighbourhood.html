<p>What makes a neighbourhood cool?<strong> </strong>Sitting on the benches between a train station and a Hungry Jack’s, shooing away pigeons, I’ve come to find out. Burwood – where I got my first job, struggled through maths tutoring and passed my learner’s driving hazard perception test (twice) – has recently been named Australia’s coolest suburb and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/25/burwood-sydney-north-melbourne-among-world-coolest-neighbourhoods-time-out">16th coolest in world</a>. But why?</p> 
<p>With $100 in hand, Guardian Australia executive producer Stephen Byrne and I go in search of answers.</p>

<h2>4pm: festival in the park</h2> 
<p>Fate has brought us to Burwood on Korea Day, and the park on the suburb’s main road is pulsing.</p> 
<p>A few dozen food stalls have been set up, and we are immediately hit by the smell of spice and frying garlic. </p> 
<p>Pumping music and an enthusiastic voice booms over loudspeakers, followed by laughter and applause. We find the source of the noise on a wide lawn where families gather around, watching children compete in physical challenges. The atmosphere is so alive <strong>– </strong>as<strong> </strong>are the many ibises flocking around bins nearby. </p>

</ul> 
<p>As the sun begins to set, we exit on to Burwood Road to behold the behemoth monument, national treasure and bringer of suburban life: Westfield.</p> 
<p>It’s a bit dirty isn’t it, Stephen says. Blasphemy.</p> 
<h2>5pm: a feast (and magic show) in Chinatown</h2> 
<p>Our next stop is Burwood Chinatown night markets, which are only a few years old and set up outside the two-storey indoor-outdoor labyrinth that is Burwood Chinatown – the suburb’s cover girl.</p> 
<p>Standing under bright lights between tiny kitchens, we chat with passersby. Some are shocked to hear Burwood has been welcomed into an international cool club, but mostly they’re proud.</p> 
<p>A young man who grew up nearby says: “The vibes, the food, the people, you can’t really get this anywhere else right?”</p> 
<p>He’s not wrong about the food. Surrounded by options, I’m overwhelmed, and he suggests I try banh xeo taco (also<strong> </strong>a favourite of our video producer and occasional food critic Bertin Huynh). I order two crisp Vietnamese crepes served handheld like tacos – one soft-shell crab, another pho bo stir. Next door is a vegetarian pancake place everyone talks about, so I grab one of those too. I also spot a Turkish stall serving baklava, which I legally have to eat every time I see it, so I pick some up for dessert.</p> 
<p>En route to a spot on the upstairs balcony, we stop to chat to a vendor<strong>, </strong>15-year-old Dimi who runs the House of Lim kitchen with his dad, and is also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dimi.heryxlim/">the Australian junior champion of magic</a>! Out of thin air, a deck of cards materialises; Dimi asks me to pick a card, hides it in the deck and places a different card in my hand. Then he taps the card in my hand and it turns into the first card I picked. His final trick is a serve of fully loaded special chicken noodles and broth.</p> 
<p>We splay the spoils across a table and feast. A tangy “secret sauce” freshens the tacos, while the vegetable pancakes are flaky and moreish. The noodles are rich, spicy and comforting. I keep the baklava for the road.</p> 
<h2>7pm: life up, down and around the main street</h2> 
<p>After sundown, Burwood Road’s shopfronts light up in fluorescent shades of red, purple, pink and green.</p> 
<p> Burwood is thronging with people moving between restaurants and dessert bars. I spot a few highly recommended joints – Xi’an Eatery, My Aunt’s Handmade Noodles, Apandim Uyghur restaurant, Royal Treasure Seafood restaurant and 1915 Lanzhou Beef Noodles, which has a queue down the block.</p> 
<p>A kind man sees me eye a glorious-smelling lamb shop and offers me a skewer he just bought for himself. Two teens who said hello earlier wave and tell me they’ve headed back to Burwood after an afternoon in the city.</p> 
<p>Shop workers, firefighters, locals and visitors <strong> </strong>stop us to chat. Maybe it’s my magnetic aura and dazzling smile! Or maybe it’s the massive video camera, Stephen says.</p> 
<p>We visit Ice Kirin for tea-infused mochi gelato. A subtle oolong peach for me and stronger-tasting matcha for Stephen. Here we befriend a man who travels<strong> </strong>an hour each week just to hang out in Burwood.</p> 
<p>“It’s about … the food,” he says. “You just learn something new every time you come. There’s always something you can try.”</p> 
<p>Somehow four hours have passed and it’s already 8pm. We’ve walked through <a href="https://www.emeraldsquare.com.au/">Emerald Square</a>, the older <a href="https://www.burwoodplaza.com.au/">Burwood Plaza</a> and are back on the main street. Our night is coming to an end, but not just yet. In a bright studio next to a small church on the main road we spy photo booth karaoke – Hama Film x Kono Karaoke Burwood. With a $5 note you can sing your heart out for 10 minutes behind soundproof glass.</p> 
<p>We hop into the booth next to a mother and her young son dressed up in a smart suit and sunglasses, and end the night on an Abba high.</p> 
<p>On the walk back to the train station, I realise my shock at Burwood’s cool status was misplaced.</p> 
<p>I remember part of <a href="https://www.timeout.com/travel/coolest-neighbourhoods-in-the-world-2025">Time Out’s criteria</a>: “Places that represent the soul of our cities.” Burwood certainly has it.</p>
