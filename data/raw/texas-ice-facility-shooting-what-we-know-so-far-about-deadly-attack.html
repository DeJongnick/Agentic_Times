<p>A gunman fired at a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/dallas">Dallas</a> immigration field office on Wednesday, killing one detainee and critically wounding two more, before killing himself in what authorities called an indiscriminate attack on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement</a> (Ice).</p> <p>Here’s what we know about the attack so far:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>One detainee has been killed, with two others in critical condition</strong><strong>.</strong> The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said previously that two detainees had been killed and one injured, but issued a corrected statement.

The DHS later added that the shooter “fired indiscriminately” at the Ice facility, “including at a van in the sallyport where the victims were shot”. All three victims were inside the van at the time the gunman opened fire.</p></li> <li><p>The Dallas field office where the shooting occurred is used for short-term processing of people in custody. The victims may have been recently arrested by Ice. The facility is along Interstate 35 East, south-west of a large commercial airport serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, and just blocks from hotels catering to airport travelers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Despite the fact that no federal agents were wounded in the shooting, the Texas governor, </strong><strong>Greg Abbott</strong><strong>, called the attack an “assassination”.</strong> For her part, Noem said that “these horrendous killings must serve as a wake-up call to the far left that their rhetoric about Ice has consequences”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump instantly politicized the shooting,</strong> claiming in <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115261106680507707">a social media post</a> that it “is the result of the Radical Left Democrats constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to ‘Nazis.’” </p></li> <li><p><strong>The </strong><strong>vice-president, JD Vance, claimed without evidence that the shooting was carried out by “a violent left</strong><strong>wing extremist” who was “politically motivated to go after law enforcement”.</strong> While the FBI has said that authorities recovered shell casings with “anti-Ice messaging” near the shooter, officials have neither confirmed a motive nor corroborated Vance’s claims about the shooter’s ideological background.</p></li> </ul>
