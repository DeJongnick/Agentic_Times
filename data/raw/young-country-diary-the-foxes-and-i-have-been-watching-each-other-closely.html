<p>I have been watching a family of foxes through my bedroom window for a long time now. Today I decided to record 15 minutes of one of the fox’s days. It went like this: 12:30pm – the fox is asleep, 12:40pm – the fox is still asleep (foxes are mainly nocturnal animals and sleep up to 10 hours during the day), 12:52pm – the fox wakes up and walks out of sight, probably to go through some bins or steal our garden gloves, 12:54pm – the fox jumps on top of the shed, 12:54pm – the fox is asleep again.</p> <p>Many urban foxes find shelter around people’s gardens. This can include under sheds, in bushes, behind bins or in their own burrows, called earths. In spring, baby foxes are born, and when we’re gardening they stare at us through the bushes, or quickly pass through when our backs are turned. I know I should clap and scare them away, but the cubs grow up bold, and it’s peaceful sometimes to pull up weeds and pretend you can’t see the amber eyes watching you.</p> <p>The baby foxes have now grown up. They’re about seven months old, meaning it’s time to leave home and have cubs of their own. The parents sometimes become aggressive to drive them away, encouraging them to go and set up new territories.</p> <p>My mum sees the foxes as pests, which I don’t blame her for, considering they poop everywhere and leave a mess. If you don’t want a fox around in your garden or allotment, make sure you clear away any leftover pet food or snacks. If they still come, make sure your bins are sealed shut! As for me, I will keep watch from my bedroom window.<br><strong>Julia, 14</strong></p> <p>• Read today’s other YCD, by Jasper, eight: ‘<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/25/young-country-diary-bright-or-dull-fungi-are-my-wonders-of-the-woods">Fungi are my wonders of the woods</a>’</p> <p>• The Young Country Diary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/27/nature-lovers-guardian-young-country-diary-writers">submission form</a> is still open for autumn articles, closing at 10pm on Sunday 2 November</p>
