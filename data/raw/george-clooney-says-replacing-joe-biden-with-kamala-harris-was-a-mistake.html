<p>George Clooney has said he feels it was a “mistake” for Kamala Harris to replace Joe Biden in the 2024 US presidential election, adding that he had no regrets about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html">New York Times opinion piece</a> in which he called on the Democrats to find a new presidential nominee.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/extended-interview-george-clooney/">Speaking on CBS’ Sunday Morning</a>, the actor and activist, who is a prominent financial donor to the Democratic party, said he would write his op-ed again if given the chance, and that he wished the Democrats had held a new primary to elect a presidential candidate. Instead, Harris was nominated by a virtual vote of party delegates.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/07/george-clooney-says-his-children-have-a-much-better-life-being-raised-in-france">George Clooney says his children have a ‘much better life’ being raised in France than LA</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We had a chance,” Clooney said. “I wanted there to be, as I wrote in the op-ed, a primary. Let’s battle-test this quickly and get it up and going. I think the mistake with it being Kamala is she had to run against her own record. It’s very hard to do if the point of running is to say, ‘I’m not that person’. It’s hard to do and so she was given a very tough task.</p> <p>“I think it was a mistake, quite honestly. But we are where we are. We were gonna lose more House seats, they say. So I don’t know. To not do it would be to say, ‘I’m not gonna tell the truth’.”</p> <p>Clooney’s op-ed, headlined <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html">“I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee”</a>, was a prominent example amid a growing wave of dissent among Democrat voters about Biden’s ability to continue as US president, after he performed poorly during his first presidential debate with Donald Trump.</p> <p>“We are not going to win in November with this president,” Clooney wrote at the time. “On top of that, we won’t win the House, and we’re going to lose the Senate. This isn’t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I’ve spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.”</p> <p>In July, Biden’s son <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/21/hunter-biden-interview-channel-5">Hunter Biden gave a profanity-laced, three-hour interview </a>to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBbkt2vYC4M&amp;t=75s">US outlet Channel 5</a> in which he attacked Clooney for writing the op-ed.</p> <p>“Fuck him!” Hunter Biden said of Clooney. “Fuck him and everybody around him. I don’t have to be fucking nice.”</p> <p>He questioned why anyone listened to Clooney, saying: “What do you have to do with fucking anything? What right do you have to step on a man who’s given … his fucking life to the service of this country and decide that you, George Clooney, are going to take out basically a full-page ad in the fucking New York Times.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/28/jay-kelly-review-even-a-george-clooney-sizzle-reel-cant-save-this-dire-noah-baumbach-effort">Jay Kelly review – even a George Clooney sizzle reel can’t save this dire Noah Baumbach effort</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked by CBS if he saw Hunter Biden’s reaction, Clooney laughed wryly and said, “Yeah, I saw it”. Asked what he made of it, he said, “I could spend a lot of time debunking many of the things he said … but the reality is, I don’t think looking backwards like that is helpful to anyone. Particularly to him. I don’t think it is helpful to the Democratic party. So I’m just going to wish him well on his ongoing recovery and I hope he does well and just leave it at that.</p> <p>“I have many personal opinions about it but I don’t find it to be helpful to have a public spat with him.”</p> <p>Since her failed presidential bid, Harris has been critical of Biden’s initial decision to run for a second term. In her book 107 Days, published in September, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/kamala-harris-memoir-joe-biden-election">she wrote</a> that she was “in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out” because “I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty, even if my only message was: don’t let the other guy win.”</p>
