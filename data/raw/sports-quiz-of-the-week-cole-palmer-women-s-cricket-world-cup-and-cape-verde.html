    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:A - Manchester United have the biggest ground in the country (74,879) followed by Tottenham (62,850), West Ham (62,500) and Liverpool (61,276) fourth., 2:D - It all depends on whether Pakistan reach the final. If they don’t make it, the game will be held in India. If they do, it will be moved to Sri Lanka., 3:C - The Chelsea and England player can now sell his own merchandise – including toys, mobile phone covers, food, stationery, energy drinks and much more. He is not allowed to sell wine though, as the winemaker Château Palmer objected to his trademark request., 4:D - Argentina were technically the home team for the fixtures and decided to maximise revenue by playing the game at Twickenham. There were more than 70,000 supporters in attendance and tickets did not come cheap., 5:B - He bunny​-hopped his way to the top. “When you are in the small sports, like bike trials, it’s very hard to make a living, so we have to find solutions to make money or to find sponsors,” he says. “My idea was to make more content and appeal to a larger public. And it was also a good idea to show what the sport is and do something crazy we haven’t done before.", 6:A - Wigan won the final last year (and the year before). , 7:A - Ipswich had not won the East Anglian derby since 2009. , 8:B - “It’s completely crazy,” said the Milan midfielder Adrien Rabiot. “There’s a lot of talk about schedules and player health, so this seems truly absurd. It’s crazy to travel so many miles for a match between two Italian teams in Australia.” Luigi de Siervo, the chief executive Serie A, hit back at Rabiot, telling him to “respect his employer”. , 9:B - They beat the Norwegian team Valerenga 1-0 thanks to a penalty from Maya le Tissier., 10:C - Reichard did not receive a re-kick as no one noticed at the time. , 11:B - Donald Trump is hosting a UFC event at the White House next June., 12:A - At the Prix de l’Arc de ­Triomphe. Daryz beat Minnie Hauk in a photo finish, winning £2,402,900 in the process. , 13:D - Just 46 more to go. "I'm still passionate about this," he said. "People, especially my family, say: ‘It’s time for you to stop. You’ve done everything. Why do you want to score a thousand goals?’ But I don’t think so. I think I’m still producing good things. I’m helping my club and the national team, so why not keep going?" , 14:A - Cape Verde need to beat Eswatini (formerly known as Swaziland) on Monday to book their place at the tournament., 15:C - It was less than 2% in the first season of the Premier League, in 1992-93, but has shot up in recent years. </p>
