<p>Ocean Vuong’s second novel is a&nbsp;416‑page tour of the edgeland between&nbsp;aspirational fantasy and self-deception.&nbsp;It opens with a long slow pan over the fictional small town of East Gladness, Connecticut, beginning with ghosts that rise “as mist over the rye across the tracks” and ending on a bridge where the camera finds a young man called Hai –“19, in the midnight of his childhood and a lifetime from first light” – preparing to drown himself. There’s an almost lazy richness to the picture: the late afternoon sun, the “moss so lush between the wooden rail ties that, at a certain angle of thick, verdant light, it looks like algae”, the junkyard “packed with school buses in various stages of amnesia”.</p> <p>His poetic credentials established, the author of the bestselling autofictional <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-ocean-vuong-review">On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous</a> gives narrative its head. Instead of jumping from the bridge, Hai crosses it, to be adopted on the&nbsp;other side by 82-year-old Grazina, a woman suffering&nbsp;mid‑stage prefrontal lobe dementia. He will become her proxy grandson; they will be each other’s support in a crap world. It will be a disordered but productive relationship.</p> <p>Grazina, born in Lithuania, “an old country, far away”, lives on a street known locally as the Devil’s Armpit, takes 14 pills a day, and always eats Stouffer’s Salisbury Steak for dinner. She needs a carer; Hai, a pillhead in remission but longing to be back in the arms of opioids, needs a more constructive narrative of himself. Between them they invent a role-playing game to bring her down from the destabilising hallucinations and insomniac panics of her disease. Then, as she sleeps, he quietly ransacks her cupboards for prescription medicines.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>This is a huge novel in terms of where it directs our attention: from gay self-discovery to the uses of fiction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some of the themes of On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous echo through into this novel. We recognise the familial landscapes of the Vietnamese immigration to the US; the need to manage partly assimilated, dangerously unprocessed generational tensions; the sense of life as the pursuit of a second chance. Complex relations between story and backstory also feature, but at a less demanding scale, producing less of a dense lyrical flicker at the sentence level, more of a traditional juggle with larger narrative elements. This is a huge novel in terms of where it directs our attention: from gay self-discovery to the uses of fiction; from the industrial farming of animals to the drive to write yourself free of the parental experience.</p> <p>As well as chosen family, The Emperor of Gladness is also about the brutality of work. Hai takes a job at HomeMarket, a fast-casual diner chain out on Route 4. There, beside “smoking vats of vibrant, primary-coloured side dishes” precooked “nearly a year ago in a laboratory outside Des Moines”, he makes more new friends. BJ, the manager, “six foot three with a buzz cut fade and shape-up”, whose ambition is to become a pro wrestler under the pseudonym Deez Nuts; Russia, “a cuter version of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings”, who is actually of Tajikistani origins; Maureen the cashier, an ageing conspiracy theorist who relieves her arthritic knees each evening with a pack of mac and cheese from the freezer. Soon, they are his family too. Family outings include a visit to a slaughterhouse where the barbaric conditions are genuinely difficult to read, and an evening of wrestling at Hairy Harry’s dive bar: experiences and situations which move steadily towards surrealism as the novel comes to its climax.</p> <p>BJ’s crew are “just like the people anywhere else in New England. Weatherworn and perennially exhausted or pissed off or both.” The take-home from their state being that, whatever else, the HomeMarket chain offers a tacky but undeniably sensual experience to the customer; and a living, however minimal, for the crew. Where they converge, these two basic socioeconomic goods encourage the emergence of a third: a genuine if brief glow of gladness cast over a life of hopeless situations. Versions of this glow become the real subject of the story. Dwellers in precarity must provide themselves with a narrative future. Some are better at it than others. For Hai – who once told himself the story of “wanting to be a writer” – such support fictions aren’t maintenance-free: after every defeat, every incursion of reality, they have to be repaired and revised. It’s hard labour, carried out in addition to his daily struggles to&nbsp;manage Grazina’s illness and earn a living. He’s not good at it.</p> <p>We’re all writers now, Vuong seems to suggest. A cheap dinner eaten at HomeMarket under the kitsch but somehow menacing light of a Thomas Kinkade fantasy painting – “<a href="https://thomaskinkade.com/collections/beside-still-waters-by-thomas-kinkade">Beside Still Waters</a>”, “Victorian Family Christmas” – is a story of reward. Two Dilaudid pills, crushed and snorted, are a story about time out. Any economic aspiration at all is so clearly a fiction. This condition is depicted with the authenticity of experience. At the same time Vuong takes it apart with patience and an ear for dialogue: “I like Nasa – the real kind, not make-believe like Star Trek,” he has Hai’s cousin Sony – named after the TV – say. “My mom likes make-believe, but I hate it. It makes things wobbly.” Heartbreaking, heartwarming yet unsentimental, and savagely comic all at the same time, The Emperor of Gladness is about just how wobbly things can become.</p> <p>• The Emperor of Gladness by Ocean Vuong is published by Jonathan Cape (£20).To support the Guardian buy a copy at <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-emperor-of-gladness-9781787335400?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article">guardianbookshop.com</a>.
