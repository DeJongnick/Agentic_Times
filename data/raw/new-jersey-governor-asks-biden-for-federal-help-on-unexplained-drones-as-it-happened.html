Here’s more, from the AP:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas, launching one of the first challenges in the U.S. to shield laws that Democrat-controlled states passed to protect physicians after Roe v. Wade was overturned.</p> <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Collin County, and it was announced Friday.</p> <p>Such prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the U.S. even since state bans started taking effect. Most abortions in the U.S. involve pills rather than procedures.</p> <p>Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, said a challenge to shield laws, which blue states started adopting in 2023, has been anticipated.</p> <p>And it could have a chilling effect on prescriptions.</p> <p>“Will doctors be more afraid to mail pills into Texas, even if they might be protected by shield laws because they don’t know if they’re protected by shield laws?” she said in an interview Friday.</p> <p>The lawsuit accuses New York Dr. Margaret Daley Carpenter of violating Texas law by providing the drugs to a Texas patient and seeks up to $250,000. No criminal charges are involved.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-675c9a408f08ded9b2a38b38" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-12-13T20:36:28.808Z">8.36pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump backs repeal of daylight saving time</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In yet more <strong>Donald Trump</strong> policy news, the president-elect just weighed in on daylight saving time, saying <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113647254141876924">on Truth Social</a> he will support undoing it:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The Republican Party will use its best efforts to eliminate Daylight Saving Time, which has a small but strong constituency, but shouldn’t!

But that’s exactly what’s happening with the news that Herschel Walker, the former University of Georgia star running back, <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-news/herschel-walker-strikes-heisman-pose-during-his-uga-convocation-ceremony/CS72TXKSPFGBJGWZZU3GK5SEIE/">is graduating this week</a> with a bachelor’s degree from the University of Georgia at the age of 62.</p> <p>Like a lot of people, Walker had planned to get his degree long ago, but, as he explained, “life and football got in the way.” In his case, “life” meant a lot – starting with getting married and signing a multimillion-dollar contract to play for Donald Trump’s New Jersey Generals in the short-lived USFL. From there, he moved to Texas to play for the Dallas Cowboys before becoming a sort of journeyman – playing for three more NFL teams and eventually returning to Dallas to play for the Cowboys once again.</p> <p>…</p> <p>Despite Washington Republicans’ most aggressive defense during the campaign’s frenzied final weeks, Walker lost to Warnock in a runoff and quickly disappeared from public view. He put his house in Atlanta on the market, cut off contact from most of his political staff and, for all anybody knew, returned to Dallas where he’d started out.</p> <p>But then, more than a year after the campaign ended, came a picture. It was Walker, tucked into a tight desk-and-chair combo, snapped in a classroom during summer school classes on UGA’s main campus in Athens. A call to the registrar’s office <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/back-to-school-herschel-walker-is-taking-classes-at-uga-after-senate-defeat/FIOUWSIRTNEUDJ52YAR33LETUU/">confirmed</a> that he had quietly reenrolled as an undergraduate at UGA’s College of Family and Consumer Sciences where he began more than 40 years earlier. Yes, at the age of 62, Walker was a college student again.</p> <p>It’s important here to say that this was no publicity stunt. There were no press releases to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution nor quiet tipoffs from Walker or his team. He simply seemed to be back in Athens to take care of long unfinished business.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-12-13T18:04:07.733Z">at 6.04pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-675c6efd8f08ded9b2a38a57" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-12-13T17:30:31.924Z">5.30pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Kash Patel, whom Donald Trump nominated to replace Christopher Wray as director of the FBI, has locked down the support he needs from Republicans on a key Senate committee, the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hugo-lowell">Hugo Lowell</a> reports:</em></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, has broadly locked down support from Republicans on the Senate judiciary committee, paving the way for his confirmation to the role after the current director announced his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/11/fbi-director-christopher-wray-resign">intention to resign</a> when the president-elect takes office in January.</p> <p>The idea of securing support from the judiciary committee, according to two people familiar with the matter, is that if the committee reports out his nomination perhaps unanimously, it would make it politically harder for any skeptical <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> to oppose him later.</p> <p>Trump’s aides working on the controversial nominations all see the same handful of senators as potential hurdles, the people said: Mitch McConnell, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins – longtime senators with whom Trump has little leverage and are difficult to control.</p> <p>In Patel’s case, his team would make the argument that McConnell, as an institutionalist, should trust the judiciary committee if it reports out the nomination, the people said.

He is the right choice to advance the interests of our full caucus.</p> <p>Throughout his sixteen years on the Committee, Rep. Connolly has been a courageous and formidable force fighting against extremist GOP conspiracy theories and advancing thoughtful, commonsense legislation.
