<p>Good morning.</p> <p>The House has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/05/matt-gaetz-ethics-report-house-vote">voted against publishing the ethics committee’s report</a> into allegations of sexual misconduct and potential illegal activities by the former Florida Republican representative Matt Gaetz.</p> <p>The lower chamber of Congress, where Republicans now have a majority of 220 against the Democrats’ 215, voted 206-198 to block its release. The long-awaited report examines allegations that Gaetz was involved in illicit drug use, misuse of campaign funds and sexual misconduct with a 17-year-old girl, as well as allegations of obstructing the investigation.</p> <p>Gaetz, who was a potential Trump administration nominee, has consistently denied the claims. He withdrew after it became obvious he would not pass a confirmation hearing.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>On what grounds was it blocked?</strong> Gaetz resigned from the House on 13 November, when Trump picked him for attorney general – and the Mississippi Republican Michael Guest, the committee chair, said the panel’s investigative authority ended then.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Senior Biden aide commits to giving Ukraine avalanche of military assistance</strong></h2>    <p>The Biden administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/05/biden-administration-ukraine-military-assistance-russia-sanctions">will provide an 11th-hour tranche of support to Ukraine’s beleaguered army</a> before handing over to Donald Trump in January, offering it substantial military assistance and fresh sanctions against Russia, according to a background briefing from a national security council spokesperson.</p> <p>In a meeting on Thursday, the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, met the head of the office of the Ukrainian president, Andriy Yermak,<strong> </strong>and pledged to provide hundreds of thousands of additional artillery rounds, thousands of rockets and hundreds of armored vehicles by mid-January, according to the briefing shared with the Guardian.</p> <p>The US is also committing to train new troops outside Ukrainian territory, as well as $20bn in loans.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What will Trump do?</strong> His team is reportedly developing a peace proposal for Ukraine, sidelining its ambitions for Nato membership and potentially handing Russia significant territory.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Thousands flee Homs in central Syria as rebel forces push on</strong></h2>    <p>Thousands of people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/dec/06/middle-east-crisis-thousands-people-flee-homs-central-syria-rebel-forces-israel-gaza-latest-updates?page=with:block-6752a4b98f08d291b2199891#block-6752a4b98f08d291b2199891">fled Homs in central Syria overnight</a>, a war monitor and residents said, as insurgents drove their offensive against government forces farther south, a week after the surprise attack that seized Aleppo within three days.</p> <p>The rebels, led by the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/05/islamist-rebels-seize-strategic-city-of-hama-from-syrian-regime-forces">captured the Syrian city of Hama</a>, 40km (25 miles) north of Homs.

Since a coordinated criminal uprising in February toppled Haiti’s government and freed thousands of prisoners, nearly 4,000 have been killed. But to the director Eliezer Guérismé, theater is “an act of rebellion and resistance” in the face of the adversity that surrounds them. To the actor Jenny Cadet, keeping the show going despite the horrors just beyond the theater’s walls is vital: “Our therapy, as actors and people of the stage, is to keep creating.”</p> <h2><strong>Climate check: Despite 2024’s ‘greenlash’, the fight against climate breakdown can still be won.
