<p>Tom Wilkinson, professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Southampton, says there is some truth to this age-old saying. When you get a respiratory viral infection, otherwise known as a cold, your immune system is activated, he explains. Your ability to fight it off depends on how strong your system’s responses are – and you need to be fuelled up in order to respond well.</p> <p>“Activated immune cells are among the most metabolically demanding –&nbsp;they take a lot of energy from the body,” Wilkinson says. That means you ideally need to be consuming nutrient-dense, calorie-rich foods. He&nbsp;refers to an <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323262-300-eat-to-treat/">experiment</a> in which randomised volunteers were either given a liquid meal or starved for 24&nbsp;hours. Those who were fed displayed a&nbsp;more robust immune system.</p> <p>“Going on a diet as you’re developing a cold is probably not the best idea,” he advises. It’s especially important to keep up your calorie intake if your immune system is compromised. Also, if you are frail or&nbsp;malnourished, “you may have an increased requirement for nutrients”.</p> <p>As for starving a fever? One theory is that this could be a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20131203-feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever#:~:text=There%20have%20been%20suggestions%20that,on%20the%20BBC%20World%20Service.&amp;amp;text=All%20content%20within%20this%20column,way%20concerned%20about%20your%20health.">mistranslation</a>, Wilkinson says, and the original phrase was “feed a cold, stave off a&nbsp;fever”, as proper nourishment may help prevent secondary infections.</p> <p>“We do often lose our appetite when we have a fever,” he adds, although the “jury is out” as to whether this indicates a positive response. “<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn1777-feed-a-cold-starve-a-fever-may-be-right/">Some evidence</a> suggests that starvation may have an effect on&nbsp;immune responses, but that’s not proven. I wouldn’t suggest that you start starving yourself.”</p> <p>The takeaway? Your immune system needs energy and nutrients to&nbsp;work efficiently, so eat a balanced diet.&nbsp;And hydration is important, too,&nbsp;Wilkinson says: “There’s lots of evidence that it improves outcomes.”</p>
