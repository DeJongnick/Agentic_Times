<p>Tristen Cannell, a garden specialist at Stanmore public school in Sydney’s inner west, said she didn’t expect the newest members of her weekly gardening lessons to be so vocal.</p> <p>“They critique my lessons and will make these honking noises as we’re talking,” she said of the ibis population, which increased dramatically after the creation of the school’s now award winning aquaponics system. “There’s nothing worse than being heckled by a bird while you’re teaching,” she said.</p> <p>In its second year, the National Kitchen Garden awards celebrates innovative kitchen gardens in schools and early childhood centres across Australia. Developed by Stephanie Alexander’s Kitchen Garden foundation,<strong> </strong>this year’s awards had over 400 entries for nine categories. Winning schools received a prize pack worth $4,000, including a $1,000 grant to enhance kitchen and garden infrastructure, planter kits, cookery books and a two-year membership to the foundation.</p> <p>Plant and food experts Alexander, Alice Zaslavsky, Clarence Slockee and Thanh Truong sat on the judging panel.</p> <p>“Each of the winners has created something remarkable, and together they show how a kitchen garden can transform not only a school, but an entire community,” said Alexander, who started the Kitchen Garden foundation in 2004 to teach young people about healthy and sustainable living through gardening classes.</p>    <p>Stanmore public school’s garden won for its student-led,<strong> </strong>water efficient design. Initially, students’ ideas were “bigger than Ben Hur”, but Cannell encouraged them to reuse the old desks and tote trays left around the school.</p> <p>In their design, rainwater is circulated between two old bath tubs through a solar-powered pump. One bathtub contains fish, with wastewater fed to the herbs growing above. The water is then cleaned and fed back to the fish. “We did know that having water in the garden would increase biodiversity … we were just unsure how much it was going to change things,” said Cannell.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/08/growing-change-a-different-kind-of-school-garden-program-is-improving-student-outcomes-in-tasmania">Growing change: a different kind of school garden program is improving student outcomes in Tasmania</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Michelle Slatter, preschool director of Fairview Park in South Australia which won the community impact award for it’s ‘Grow Free’ cart, said: “We’re just really thrilled that there’s something out there that recognises the positive impact of being in the garden.” What began as a pantry containing produce from their garden quickly evolved into a little library and space for community members to drop off their excess plant cuttings or produce. The school enlisted the help of its local men’s shed to construct the cart.</p> <p>Students check the cart before and after kindergarten to see what has been dropped off, said Slatter. This has taught them the benefits of sharing with their community, while also encouraging many of them to try new foods. “There were so many of them that had never tried zucchini before, and then because we grew it, we all tried it,” said Slatter.</p> <p>Thanks to the garden at Woodbridge primary school in Perth, fussy eaters have broadened their palates, says the school’s education assistant and kitchen garden coordinator Jean Muthukumaraswamy.</p> <p>“Parents come to me and say ‘I can never get them to eat green things at home, how are you doing this?’” says Muthukumaraswamy. </p> <p>Teacher Belinda Condo and Muthukumaraswamy co-created Grub Club, a cooking club that uses produce from the school’s garden to make fortnightly treats. They won for their impact on student wellbeing.</p> <p>“It’s a safe haven for all students of all year levels and various academic and social needs,” said Condo.</p> <p>In the kitchen everyone is a given responsibility, so there is a sense of achievement when students finish a recipe, Muthukumaraswamy said.</p> <p>“It’s lovely to have them in a situation where there are different age groups mingling and helping one another.”</p> <p>Students from pre-primary to year six are included in Grub Club and kale smoothies and spinach pikelets are two of their greatest hits.</p>    <p>Stanmore’s Cannell said being outdoors is important for children<strong> </strong>because it allows them “to step back and notice the small things like ‘Oh, our snow peas are starting to grow’”. </p> <p>“There’s no pressure on them to create those things … the snow peas just grew.”</p> <p>“Using all of the senses is a great grounding practice – smelling the lavender, tasting the mint, helping regulate each student and settling their emotions,” said Muthukumaraswamy.</p> <p>All three schools were first time entrants and winners. “As I sent it off, I thought, ‘Oh, what are our chances?’” said Muthukumaraswamy. </p> <p>Slatter will use the prize money to add an irrigation system to Fairview Park’s garden, which has been difficult to maintain over summer without an automatic watering system. She is excited about growing more produce for the cart and solidifying it as a community hub.</p> <h2>National Kitchen Garden award winners, 2025</h2> <ul> <li><p>Beyond the School Gate, award for community engagement – Fairview kindergarten, SA</p></li> <li><p>Down to Earth, award for healthy soil management – John Colet school, NSW</p></li> <li><p>First Nations Foods, award for use of indigenous knowledge systems and plants – West Coast Steiner school, WA</p></li> <li><p>Flower Power, award for flower growth – Bundaberg Special school, Queensland</p></li> <li><p>Recipe of the Imagination, award for inventive cooking – East Devonport primary school, Tasmania</p></li> <li><p>Sustainable Solutions, award for sustainable garden and kitchen practices – YMCA Childrens centre, ACT</p></li> <li><p>The Art of Kitchen Gardening, award for creativity around the garden – Lucknow kindergarten, Victoria</p></li> <li><p>Water Wise Design, award for water efficient gardening – Stanmore public school, NSW</p></li> <li><p>Wellbeing Champions, award for improved student wellbeing – Woodbridge primary school, WA</p></li> </ul> <p>• This article was corrected on Wednesday 17 September.
