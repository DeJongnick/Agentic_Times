<h2>What are microplastics?</h2> 
<p>Microplastics are <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9920460/">tiny particles of plastic</a>.</p> 
<p>The usual <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9920460/">definition</a> is anything under 5mm in length or about the diameter of a grain of rice.</p> 
<h2>Where do microplastics come from?</h2> 
<p>Microplastics may be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/antioxidants-fruits-flowers-microplastics">created and intentionally added</a> to consumer products, such as the tiny beads in face and body scrubs, or formed when larger plastic items degrade over time.</p> 
<p>Primary microplastics are manufactured at that size – for instance, in industrial exfoliants or commercial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/19/microplastics-which-beauty-brands-are-safe-to-use">cosmetic products</a> containing microbeads.</p> 
<p>Secondary microplastics come from the breakdown of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/03/levels-of-microplastics-in-human-brains-may-be-rapidly-rising-study-suggests">larger plastic materials</a> such asdisposable water bottles, packaging, straws, car tyres or toys.</p>

<h2>Are microplastics bad for you?</h2> 
<p>Microplastics are everywhere, but their health hazards within the human body are largely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/10/air-drinking-water-dust-food-how-to-reduce-exposure-microplastics">unknown</a>. However, the prevalence of microplastics in human organs is cause for concern among researchers. Studies suggest they could increase the risk of various conditions such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/21/microplastics-brain-pollution-health">oxidative stress or cardiovascular disease</a>.</p>

<p>Stephanie Wright, an environmental toxicologist at Imperial College, London, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/10/air-drinking-water-dust-food-how-to-reduce-exposure-microplastics">told the Guardian</a> that despite a lack of epidemiological and in-human data, “reducing particle exposure in general (including microplastic) is likely to be beneficial”.</p> 
<p>Animal studies have linked microplastics to fertility issues, various cancers, a disrupted endocrine and immune system, and impaired learning and memory.</p>

<h2>Do microplastics ever leave your body?</h2> 
<p>It is not known how long microplastics remain in the body before being excreted. But microplastics have been found in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/22/microplastics-found-in-human-stools-for-the-first-time">human poop</a>, meaning that at least some of the plastic ingested is excreted, while some microplastics have accumulated within bodily organs. Studies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/22/microplastics-revealed-in-placentas-unborn-babies">have also shown</a> that microplastics can be passed from pregnant people to the placenta.</p> 
<h2>Are microplastics the same thing as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pfas">Pfas</a>?</h2> 
<p>No. Microplastics are tiny shards and specks of plastics less than 5mm in diameter. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/jan/03/pfas-forever-chemicals">Pfas, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances</a>, is an umbrella term for a family of thousands of chemicals prized for their indestructible and non-stick properties.</p> 
<p>Pfas can take hundreds, if not thousands, of years to break down after they are thrown away, and can leak into soil or water and remain there for centuries.</p> 
<p>But like microplastics, Pfas are ubiquitous and potentially pose health hazards.</p>

<h2>Where have microplastics been found?</h2> 
<p>In short: everywhere.</p> 
<p>People consume the tiny plastic particles in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/05/people-eat-at-least-50000-plastic-particles-a-year-study-finds">food</a> (including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/seafood-microplastic-contamination-study">seafood</a>), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/06/plastic-fibres-found-tap-water-around-world-study-reveals">water</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/sep/30/those-fancy-tea-bags-nylon-microplastics-in-them-are-macro-offenders">tea</a> and by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/27/revealed-microplastic-pollution-is-raining-down-on-city-dwellers">breathing them in</a>.</p>

<p>These tiny shards of plastic have been found in air, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/10/air-drinking-water-dust-food-how-to-reduce-exposure-microplastics">dust</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/microplastics-found-in-every-sample-of-water-taken-during-ocean-race">remote</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/20/plastic-pollution-mariana-trench-deepest-point-ocean">deep ocean environments</a>, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/nov/16/microplastic-pollution-changing-weather-climate">clouds</a>, in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/microplastics-found-for-first-time-in-antarctic-ice-where-krill-source-food">ice of Antarctica</a> and on the summit of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/20/microplastic-pollution-found-near-summit-of-mount-everest">Mount Everest</a>.</p> 
<p>Their spread has prompted researchers to call for further study, and actions to reduce plastic pollution.</p> 
<h2>Can microplastics be removed from water?</h2> 
<p>According to one review study, independent testing in many countries found microplastics in virtually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/01/microplastics-epa-monitoring">all drinking water samples tested</a>, and other <a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/FSW_2411_TinyParticlesBigProblems.pdf">research</a> estimated the average person ingests about 4,000 particles in drinking water annually. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jun/05/microplastics-found-in-every-sample-of-water-taken-during-ocean-race">Ocean</a> and lake sampling has also found microplastics, sometimes at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/aug/17/great-lakes-water-microplastic-pollution-contamination">levels “unsafe for wildlife”</a>.</p> 
<p>Because microplastics are so small, it’s challenging to remove them. Wastewater filtering practices do <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/06/we-are-living-on-a-plastic-planet-what-does-it-mean-for-our-health">capture some of the particles</a>. Researchers have explored innovative ways of doing so. For example, in 2021, a team of researchers engineered a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/apr/28/scientists-find-way-to-remove-polluting-microplastics-with-bacteria">bacterial biofilm</a> that could trap microplastics for easier removal – though it was just a preliminary experiment. Another research team created a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/10/microplastics-pollution-sponge-cotton-squid-bone">sponge from cotton and squid bone</a> that removed up to 99.9% of plastics in testing, though again, not at scale.</p>

<h2>How to avoid microplastics in your clothing</h2> 
<p>Plastic is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/feb/12/the-hidden-plastics-in-our-clothes-and-how-to-avoid-them">everywhere in fashion</a> – including pleather, or vegan leather, and harder to spot instances, such as microplastics that shed from synthetic fabrics.</p> 
<p>Polyester and nylon, both common plastics, make up almost 70% of all material used in clothing. Microfibers, which typically shed from synthetic materials, are a significant contributor to microplastic pollution.</p> 
<p>Here’s how to avoid plastic in clothing:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>Always check the garment care label</strong>, looking to avoid common culprits such as nylon, acrylic and elastane. Look up unfamiliar fabric types online and prioritize brands that use natural materials.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>For buttons used on clothing</strong>, look for those made from corozo nut or wood, and for hooks and eyes made from metal. Zips are often set in plastic fabric, so if you want to avoid microplastics, avoid garments with zips where possible.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>The materials that create stiffness and reinforcements</strong> in clothing often contain plastic, such as padding in a bra. But the simpler the piece, the easier it is to avoid plastic.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Clothing lining</strong> often contains polyester and nylon. Look for silk or viscose rayon.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Sequins and beads are almost always plastic.</strong> Sequins can be made from recycled Pet, but these can still break into microplastics. Avoid purchasing these to begin with or be sure to mend items regularly so that plastic trims don’t fall off.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Vegan leather and faux fur</strong> contain synthetic components and shed microplastics. Real leather – including the abundance of vintage leather pieces – is an incredibly durable and repairable material that should last for years, if well cared for.</p></li> 
</ul>

<h2>How to avoid microplastics in your kitchen</h2> 
<p>The highest exposures to microplastics are likely to come from packaged and processed food and drinks, says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/10/air-drinking-water-dust-food-how-to-reduce-exposure-microplastics">Wright,</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jul/10/air-drinking-water-dust-food-how-to-reduce-exposure-microplastics">the environmental toxicologist</a>. The risk of microplastic shedding increases when plastic is exposed to heat.</p> 
<p>Avoid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/01/how-to-avoid-microplastics">heating anything in plastic</a> or drinking hot liquids that were exposed to plastic, such as the lining of a disposable coffee cup. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/01/how-to-avoid-microplastics">recent study</a> found that when hot liquid is poured into a single-use coffee cup, it can shed trillions of bits of plastic.</p> 
<p>The good news for consumers is that almost every plastic kitchen product – including coffee makers and tea bags –<strong> </strong>has a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/02/kitchen-toxic-chemicals-pfas-how-to-avoid">safer wood, glass, silicone or stainless steel</a> alternative.</p>

<p>When it’s time to replace a spatula, try wood, stainless steel or silicone instead. Avoid plastic cutting boards and instead opt for one from a single piece of wood that has not been glued (as glue can contain formaldehyde) and is unfinished or treated with a safe finish, such as beeswax or fractionated coconut oil.</p> 
<p>When it comes to storing food,<strong> </strong>opt for glass containers. Instead of plastic wrap, look for unbleached paper or paper that uses soy wax.</p>

<h2>What to do about plastic pollution</h2> 
<p>The World Economic Forum ranked pollution among its <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2025/">10 biggest global risks</a>. Just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/17/plastic-recycling-myth-what-really-happens-your-rubbish">9% of virgin plastic gets recycled</a>, according to a 2017 scientific paper. The remaining plastic is either incinerated or accumulated in landfills, where it could then leak into the environment.</p> 
<p>The most consequential action to contain the “global plastics crisis” would be a cap on plastic production, said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/article/2024/jul/09/microplastics-health-crisis">Dr Philip Landrigan</a>, an anti-plastic advocate. While some plastics are essential for use in the fields of engineering or medicine, Landrigan calls for a curb on “stupid plastics” – or single-use throwaway items.</p> 
<p>As of 2023, single-use plastics accounted for 40% of the more than 400m tonnes of plastic produced each year. Production is only <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/about/news/press-releases/2022/06/global-plastic-waste-set-to-almost-triple-by-2060.html">increasing</a>, with a 2022 report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimating production is on track to almost triple by 2060.</p>
