<p>I know that welsh rarebit isn’t a cheese toastie, but if Lauren O’Neill (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/07/cheese-toasties-comfort-food">Grate expectations: cheese toasties are having a moment, and I’m all for it, 7 April</a>) wants to try the ultimate in cheese-and-bread-based meals, she really should visit the International Welsh Rarebit Centre in Defynnog, near Brecon. Rarebits with chorizo, rarebits with kimchi – and, of course, the unbeatable classic welsh.<br><strong>Lillian Adams</strong><br><em>Grosmont, Monmouthshire</em></p> <p>• I was reminded by Margaret Squires’ letter (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/08/the-buzz-about-living-the-good-life">8 April</a>) of being asked by the doctor who was present at the delivery of my son, in a Bristol hospital, if he could take the placenta home to put on his roses. I said that he could. I hope his roses did well.<br><strong>Muriel Adams</strong><br><em>Caerleon, Gwent</em></p> <p>• Amazing to see an editorial on the Pennine Way (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-pennine-way-a-pioneer-of-long-distance-soul-therapy">9 April</a>) that doesn’t mention Alfred Wainwright, who first walked it in 1938 (trespassing along the way), who funded pints at the terminus for those completing the trek, and who published the best guide to the route.<br><strong>Phil Constable</strong><br><em>Darlington</em></p> <p>• Your editorial mentions a number of authors who have written about walking. One book on the Pennine Way that I really found helpful was I Belong Here by Anita Sethi, in which she explores how walking the route has therapeutic value for&nbsp;mental wellbeing.<br><strong>Ahmet Bulutoglu</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• While Andrew Vincent provided a cogent argument that the mining of authors’ work is nothing new (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/06/mining-of-authors-work-is-nothing-new-ai-is-just-doing-what-creative-humans-do">Letters, 6 April</a>), I’m pretty sure I’ve read it somewhere before.<br><strong>Pete Bibby</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
