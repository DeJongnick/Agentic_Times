 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We will be wrapping the live blog for the 24th day of Trump’s second term. But we will return to chronicle what unfolds in a Valentine’s Day edition of US politics live on Friday.</p> 
  <p>Here is a look at some of the day’s developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Representative <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong> and <strong>Antonio Delgado</strong>, New York’s lieutenant governor, called on New York city’s mayor, <strong>Eric Adams</strong>, to resign on Thursday after Adams changed city policy to cooperate with federal immigration agents in an apparent quid pro quo for the dropping of federal corruption charges against him.</p></li> 
   <li><p>More than 200,000 federal workers could be fired, after the office of personnel management directed federal agencies to lay off all their probationary employees.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> admitted that he did not know if Elon Musk had met India’s prime minister, <strong>Narendra Modi</strong>, in his private capacity as a businessperson or as a representative of the US government.</p></li> 
   <li><p>At a joint press conference, Modi said that India was “fully prepared” to take back the estimated 725,000 Indian citizens who are living in the US without legal status.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The acting US attorney for the southern district of New York, conservative lawyer <strong>Danielle Sassoon</strong>, sent a scathing resignation letter to the Department of Justice after she was asked to drop federal charges against New York’s mayor for what she called improper political reasons.</p></li> 
   <li><p>A federal judge put on hold Trump’s executive order banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth, after finding the policy “seems to deny that this population even exists, or deserves to exist”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong> was confirmed and sworn in as health secretary, despite grave reservations from Democrats and scientists over his anti-vaccine activism. He thanked God for Trump and went on to trash the United States Agency for International Development, which was set up by his uncle, John F Kennedy.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump announced he signed a memorandum ordering reciprocal tariffs, asking his trade advisers to calculate new tariff levels for all countries.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Top New York Democrats call for mayor Eric Adams to resign after permitting Ice agents to operate on Rikers Island</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Two of New York’s leading Democrats, Representative <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong> and <strong>Antonio Delgado</strong>, the state’s lieutenant governor, called on New York city’s mayor, <strong>Eric Adams</strong>, to resign on Thursday after Adams changed city policy to cooperate with federal immigration agents carrying out Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy.</p> 
  <p>Adams <a href="https://x.com/emmagf/status/1890150672819224986">announced</a> on Thursday that he would issue an executive order to allow US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents to operate on Rikers Island, undermining the city’s 2014 sanctuary laws that banned immigration agents from the jail complex.</p> 
  <p>Adams said that he had acted after meeting Trump’s border czar, <strong>Tom Homan</strong>, on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>The move was unpopular with immigrants rights groups. “Allowing ICE access to Rikers Island, where New Yorkers – including noncitizens entitled to the presumption of innocence and their day in court – are detained, is an egregious violation of NY’s commitment as a sanctuary city and undermines constitutional due process protections,” New York’s Legal Aid Society said in <a href="https://x.com/LegalAidNYC/status/1890201816052428915">a statement</a>.</p> 
  <p>Both Ocasio-Cortez and Delgado focused on the fact that Adams seemed to acting as a part of a quid pro quo arrangement with Trump, cooperating with the crackdown in return for federal corruption charges against him being dropped.</p> 
  <p>“New York City deserves a Mayor accountable to the people, not beholden to the President,” Delgado <a href="https://x.com/DelgadoforNY/status/1890192765147099283">posted</a> on social media. “Mayor Adams should step down.”</p> 
  <p>Ocasio-Cortez called the revelation, in a resignation letter from the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, that lawyers for Adams had explicitly offered to cooperate in the crackdown on undocumented immigrants in exchange for having the charges dropped, “explosive”.</p> 
  <p>The prosecutor, <strong>Danielle Sassoon</strong>, wrote in a footnote to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25526537-sassoon-bondi-letter/">her letter</a> that acting deputy attorney general <strong>Emil Bove</strong> – who was previously Trump’s criminal defense lawyer – had confiscated notes on a meeting with the Adams legal team she attended that made the political nature of the deal clear.</p> 
  <p>“I attended a meeting on January 31, 2025, with Mr. Bove, Adams’s counsel, and members of my office. Adams’s attorneys repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with the Department’s enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed. Mr. Bove admonished a member of my team who took notes during that meeting and directed the collection of those notes at the meeting’s conclusion,” Sassoon wrote.</p> 
  <p>“Mayor Adams is putting the City of New York and its people at risk in exchange for escaping charges,” Ocasio-Cortez <a href="https://x.com/AOC/status/1890182890073604437">wrote</a> in response to Sassoon’s letter. “As long as Trump wields this leverage over Adams, the city is endangered. We cannot be governed under coercion. If Adams won’t resign, he must be removed.”</p> 
  <p>Later on Thursday, Homan <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1890201026382463322">appeared on Fox</a> to discuss the crackdown and told host Laura Ingraham that he had sent an email to the acting deputy attorney general to ask if Ocasio-Cortez was “impeding our law enforcement efforts” by using social media to advise citizen and non-citizen New Yorkers to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DF_PqWSx5xZ/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">know their rights</a> when confronted by immigration agents. “Maybe AOC’s going to be in trouble now,” Homan said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Federal agencies ordered to fire all probationary employees</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The office of personnel management has directed federal agencies to lay off all their probationary employees, who generally have less than a year on the job and don’t have full civil service protection, <a href="https://apnews.com/live/trump-presidency-updates-2-13-2025#00000195-0107-d9df-a79f-bba7b6660000">the Associated Press reports</a>.</p> 
  <p>The notification, sent on Thursday afternoon, was confirmed to the news agency by a person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.</p> 
  <p>The move expands on previous directions from OPM, which told agencies earlier this week that probationary employees should be fired if they weren’t meeting high standards.</p> 
  <p>The mass firing of federal workers could affect more than 200,000 workers.</p> 
  <p>Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal workers, pledged in <a href="https://x.com/jbendery/status/1890189233299812373">a statement</a> to “fight these firings every step of the way” and pursue “every legal challenge available”.</p> 
  <p>“This administration has abused the probationary period to conduct a politically driven mass firing spree, targeting employees not because of performance, but because they were hired before Trump took office” Kelley said.</p> 
  <p>“Employees were given no notice, no due process, and no opportunity to defend themselves in a blatant violation of the principles of fairness and merit that are supposed to govern federal employment,” the union president added.</p> 
  <p>“The probationary period is a continuation of the job application process, not an entitlement for permanent employment,” an OPM spokesperson said in a statement <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-administration-federal-agencies-fire-probationary-employees-rcna192149">sent to NBC News</a>.</p> 
  <p>“Agencies are taking independent action in light of the recent hiring freeze and in support of the president’s broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government to better serve the American people at the highest possible standard.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump and Modi dodge questions about Musk's meeting with Indian leader</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>At the Trump-Modi news conference, India’s prime minister was asked if he had discussed business in his meeting earlier in the day with Elon Musk, the billionaire who is playing a leading role, if not the leading role, in the second Trump administration.</p> 
  <p>Modi had shared <a href="https://x.com/narendramodi/status/1890100201496748210">an image</a> of the meeting with Musk at Blair House, where visiting leaders stay, on X, the social media platform owned by Musk. The image showed the unusual scene of a row of Indian officials facing off with Musk’s entourage, which included three of his small children.</p> 
  <p>Modi dodged the question, saying just: “I have known him for a very long time. I was not even Prime Minister at the time, when I first met him, I was chief minister, and today he came to meet me, along with all his family, with his children, and so we had a nice discussion”.</p> 
  <p>In the Oval office earlier, Trump was asked about the nature of the meeting. “When Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Modi”, a reporter asked, “did he do so as an American CEO or did he do so as a representative of the US government?”</p> 
  <p>“I don’t know” Trump replied. “They met, and I assume he wants to do business in India”.</p>

  </figure> 
  <p>“So how is Mr Modi supposed to know if he’s meeting with a CEO or with a representative of your government?” the reporter asked Trump.</p> 
  <p>“Well, he’s meeting with me in a little while, so I’m going to ask him that question” Trump replied, confusingly.</p> 
  <p>The exchange seemed to undermine <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1890128233095381119">Trump’s claim</a>, in response to another reporter’s question, that he was personally checking to make sure Musk had no conflicts of interest in his dual role as a “special government employee” and the world’s richest man.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Modi says India is 'fully prepared' to take back any Indians living in the US without legal status</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Standing across from Donald Trump in the White House, Indian’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, was asked by an Indian reporter to comment on the US “push to curb illegal immigration”.</p> 
  <p>According to a simultaneous translation, <a href="https://x.com/WashObserver/status/1890185029608960206">he replied</a>: “We are of the opinion that anybody who enters another country illegally has absolutely no right to be in that country.”</p> 
  <p>“Any verified Indian who is in the US illegally,” Modi added, “we are fully prepared to take them back.”</p> 
  <p>The prime minister did, however, express sympathy for children who were brought to the US and others “lured by big dreams”.</p> 
  <p>Last week, a US military plane carrying 104 deported Indian migrants <a href="https://apnews.com/article/indian-illegal-immigrants-deportation-from-united-states-eb43d6fb6ba1f78febdd78b77bd36196">arrived in India</a>, as part of the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented migrants.</p> 
  <p>That was, however, just a tiny sliver of the estimated 725,000 Indians who were living in the US without legal status in 2022, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/">a Pew Research Center study</a>.</p> 
  <p>India, Pew found, was the third largest source of unauthorized immigrants in the US, after Mexico and El Salvador.</p> 
  <p>As of November, the Indian Express <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/deportation-shadow-falls-on-over-20000-undocumented-indians-9792124/">reported</a>, there were 20,407 undocumented Indians either facing final removal orders or are currently in detention centers of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).</p> 
  <p>Indian outlets were <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/world/us-news/story/normalizing-indian-hate-how-indian-americans-are-fighting-back-in-us-vivek-ramaswamy-jd-vance-marko-elez-2678327-2025-02-11">appalled</a> by the fact that Trump’s vice-president, JD Vance, whose wife is an Indian American, had advocated the re-hiring of a young engineer working for Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” who had posted racist comments about Indians, including “normalize Indian hate”, on the social media platform X.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump announces extradition of accused Mumbai terror attack plotter</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>At the start of his just completed White House news conference with Narendra Modi, Donald Trump said that Tahawwur Rana, a Canadian of Pakistani descent, would be sent to India to face charges related to the terrorist attack in Mumbai on 26 November 2008. </p> 
  <p>“I am pleased to announce that my administration has approved the extradition of one of the plotters, and one of the very evil people of the world, having to do with the horrific 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack, to face justice in India”, Trump said. </p> 
  <p>Rana is a former military doctor who served in the Pakistani army. He moved to Canada in 1997 and became an immigration service businessman. After gaining Canadian citizenship in 2001, Rana moved to Chicago.</p> 
  <p>Rana was sentenced to 14 years in US federal prison in 2013 for providing material support to overseas terrorist groups, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistani group that killed more than 160 people in Mumbai in 2008. </p> 
  <p>In 2011, jurors convicted Rana of providing support for Lashkar-e-Taiba, and for supporting a plot to attack a Danish newspaper that printed cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2005. The Denmark plot was never carried out. Rana was cleared of the more serious charge of helping to plot the Mumbai attacks. The government’s main witness was David Coleman Headley, who had pleaded guilty to laying the groundwork for the Mumbai attacks. </p> 
  <p>The US supreme court had turned down Rana’s appeal against extradition last month.</p>

  <p><strong>An Associated Press reporter was just blocked from attending the Trump-Modi news conference in the White House, continuing the administration’s attempt to strong-arm the global news collective into changing its decision to not call the Gulf of Mexico by the new name Trump has given it: the Gulf of America.</strong></p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/newsguy.bsky.social/post/3li3s4sbzh22k">a statement</a>, AP executive editor Julie Pace called the move, “a deeply troubling escalation of the administration’s continued efforts to punish the Associated Press for its editorial decisions”.</p> 
  <p>“It is a plain violation of the first amendment … an incredible disservice to the billions of people who rely on the Associated Press for nonpartisan news,” Pace wrote.</p> 
  <p>One odd aspect of the ban is that it seems to apply to AP reporters but not AP photographers, who continue to be allowed to cover Trump in the White House.</p> 
  <p>Here, for instance, is an AP photo of Trump in the Oval Office on Thursday, where he appears to have ordered his staff to keep a drawing of the “Gulf of America” on an easel behind his desk, so that it appears in news photographs, including those captured and distributed by the Associated Press.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump falsely claims top federal prosecutor in New York, who refused to drop charges against mayor Eric Adams, was fired</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>During a brief exchange with reporters in the Oval Office, alongside Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, Donald Trump was asked about the dramatic resignation of Danielle Sassoon, the acting US attorney for the southern district of New York.</p> 
  <p>Sassoon, a conservative lawyer and a member of the Federalist Society who once clerked for supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, offered her resignation on Wednesday in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25526537-sassoon-bondi-letter/">a scathing letter</a> to Pam Bondi, the new attorney general, in which she explained that she could not, in good conscience, comply with an order from acting deputy attorney general, Emil Bove, to drop corruption charges against New York mayor Eric Adams, in return for the mayor’s help in executing Trump’s immigration policies.</p> 
  <p>Trump told reporters that Sassoon did not resign, but was fired.</p> 
  <p>That is not true. Multiple news organizations, including ABC News, obtained copies of <a href="https://x.com/KFaulders/status/1890138237366100083">Bove’s letter</a> accepting Sassoon’s resignation on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>“The reasons advanced by Mr Bove for dismissing the indictment are not ones I can in good faith defend as in the public interest and as consistent with the principles of impartiality and fairness that guide my decision-making,” Sassoon wrote in her letter.</p> 
  <p>“Mr Bove proposes dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws, analogizing to the prisoner exchange in which the United States freed notorious Russian arms dealer Victor Bout in return for an American prisoner in Russia.”</p> 
  <p>She added: “Such an exchange with Adams violates commonsense beliefs in the equal administration of justice, the Justice Manual, and the Rules of Professional Conduct. Adams has argued in substance – and Mr Bove appears prepared to concede – that Adams should receive leniency for federal crimes solely because he occupies an important public position and can use that position to assist in the administration’s policy priorities.”</p>

  <p>A handful of protestors donning green bandanas have gathered at Foley Square in downtown Manhattan ahead of an immigration rally in response to Donald Trump’s anti-immigration crackdowns.</p> 
  <p>Some are holding handwritten signs that say “Melt Ice” – a reference to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Another person is holding a sign with a message to New York City’s mayor Eric Adams who has in recent months taken on a hardened stance against immigration.</p> 
  <p>“Immigrants are not your get out of jail card!” the sign read, in reference to Adams’ own federal charges of corruption which the newest Trump-appointed justice department has ordered prosecutors to drop.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump hails 'great friendship' with Modi</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Donald Trump is hosting at the White House the Indian PM Narendra Modi, who has heaped praise on him in hopes of avoiding the additional tariffs that the new administration has slapped on other countries in its opening weeks.</p> 
  <p>Trump and Modi greeted each with a hug in the lobby of the West Wing before meeting on Thursday afternoon in the Oval Office. Trump called Modi a “great friend” hours after signing an order to increase tariffs to match the tax rates that other countries charge on imports, which affects American trading partners around the world, including India.</p> 
  <p>“We have great friendship, he and I and our countries, and I think it’s only going to get closer,” Trump said.</p> 
  <p>The Indian leader was looking to improve relations with Washington and the West overall, which have been frosty lately after Modi refused to condemn Russia for its war on Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>“The world had this thinking that India somehow is a neutral country in this whole process,” Modi said, praising Trump for speaking with Russia and Ukraine’s leaders on Wednesday. “But this is not true. India has a side, and that side is of peace.”</p>

  <p><strong>Speaking to reporters earlier in the Oval office, Donald Trump appeared to cast doubt on the fact that Senator Mitch McConnell had polio as a child.</strong></p> 
  <p>McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, mentioned his childhood illness to explain his vote against Robert F Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist, as health secretary. “I’m a survivor of childhood polio”, McConnell said. “In my lifetime, I’ve watched vaccines save millions of lives from devastating diseases across America and around the world. I will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures”.</p> 
  <p>Asked about McConnell’s vote in the Oval office before Kennedy’s swearing-in, Trump first cast doubt on the senator’s mental competence, and then scoffed at the idea that he had survived polio. </p> 
  <p>When Kaitlin Collins of CNN said, “he had polio, obviously,” Trump replied, “I don’t know anything about, ‘He had polio’. He had polio” in a sarcastic tone that implied McConnell might have been lying about having had the illness in his youth.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Top prosecutor, justice department officials resign over order to drop charges against New York mayor Eric Adams</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The top federal prosecutor in New York City and two justice department officials have resigned after being ordered to drop charges against the city’s mayor <strong>Eric Adams</strong>, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>Adams was last year indicted on charges related to accepting bribes from Turkish officials. The decision to drop the charges was reportedly made by <strong>Emil Bove</strong>, a former defense attorney for <strong>Donald Trump</strong> who is now acting deputy attorney general at the justice department. Here’s more about the resignations, from Reuters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Manhattan US attorney Danielle Sassoon, the Trump administration’s recent pick to temporarily lead the office prosecuting New York mayor Eric Adams, resigned her post on Thursday without giving a reason, a spokesperson for the office said.</p> 
   <p>John Keller, the acting head of the justice department’s public corruption unit, also resigned, two people familiar with the matter said. Kevin Driscoll, a senior official in the department’s criminal division, has also resigned, one of the people said.</p> 
   <p>The resignations come after acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove on Monday ordered Sassoon to drop corruption charges against Adams, a Democrat who has forged ties with Donald Trump, in what former prosecutors called a sign of political interference.</p> 
   <p>According to a person briefed on the matter, Sassoon refused to comply with the directive to dismiss the case, and Trump’s administration then directed Keller’s office to do so. Keller resigned rather than comply, the person said.</p> 
   <p>The justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A federal judge has put on hold <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s executive order banning gender-affirming care for transgender youth, after finding the policy “seems to deny that this population even exists, or deserves to exist”, the Associated Press reports.</p> 
  <p>Trump signed the order shortly after taking office, which threatened to revoke federal funding from facilities that provide treatments like hormone therapy and puberty blockers. The ruling by judge <strong>Brendan Hurson</strong>, an appointee of <strong>Joe Biden</strong> based in Baltimore, came in a challenge to the order filed by families of transgender and non-binary youth, and supporting advocacy groups.</p>

  <p><strong>In a new post on Truth Social, Trump elaborated on his new executive order on reciprocal tariffs, saying that other taxes like value-added tax (VAT) are “far more punitive than a tariff”. </strong></p> 
  <p>“It is fair to all, no other Country can complain and, in some cases, if a County feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff, all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us,” Trump wrote. </p> 
  <p>Trump said that the reciprocal tariffs will “immediately bring Fairness and Prosperity back into the previously complex and unfair System of Trade”. </p> 
  <p>The president’s announcement is a dramatic departure from how trade in the US has worked for decades. It amounts to a dismissal of international bodies like the World Trade Organization, which helps countries negotiate trade policies.</p> 
  <p>Trump said that cabinet members secretary of state Marco Rubio, secretary of commerce nominee Howard Lutnick, treasury secretary Scott Bessent and US trade representative Jamieson Greer will work to calculate the new tariffs on a country-by-country basis.</p>

  <p><strong>Though Trump announced new reciprocal tariffs on Thursday, nothing new is going into effect – yet.</strong></p> 
  <p>It will probably take some time to know exactly what changes the Trump administration will make in response to Trump’s new reciprocal tariff order.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s economic advisers told reporters today, after Trump’s announcement, that they will be coming up with new numbers country by country.</p> 
  <p>Howard Lutnick, Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, said the administration will finish crunching the numbers by 1 April, according to the Reuters.</p> 
  <p>The president said his priorities are the most “egregious” examples of unfairness in trade, including countries that have big trade surpluses and high tariff rates.</p> 
  <p>An administration official, who spoke without attribution, said that Trump “is more than happy to lower tariffs if countries want to lower tariffs”.</p> 
  <p>But the administration said they would be considering things beyond tariffs, which means they could consider other taxes countries put on foreign goods. Peter Navarro, Trump’s trade adviser, spoke out on Thursday against the European Union’s value-added tax (VAT) as the “poster child” for what the administration sees as an unfair tax, the New York Times reported.</p>

  <p><strong>Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat of Massachusetts, attacked her Republican colleagues for confirming Robert F Kennedy Jr as the next secretary of health and human services.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Putting Kennedy in charge of the nation’s public health is a huge mistake,” Warren said in a new statement. </p> 
  <p>“When dangerous diseases resurface and people can’t access lifesaving vaccines, all Americans will suffer. And thanks to his serious, unresolved conflicts of interest, RFK Jr’s family could continue getting richer from his anti-vaccine crusade while he’s in office.”</p> 
  <p>Warren raised serious concerns about Kennedy’s potential conflicts of interest during his confirmation hearings, but every Senate Republican, except for <strong>Mitch McConnell </strong>of Kentucky, still supported his nomination.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Polio survivor Mitch McConnell says he opposed Kennedy over vaccine views</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Former Republican Senate leader<strong> Mitch McConnell</strong> said he refused to vote for the confirmation of <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr </strong>as health secretary over his skepticism of vaccines.</p> 
  <p>“I’m a survivor of childhood polio. In my lifetime, I’ve watched vaccines save millions of lives from devastating diseases across America and around the world. I will not condone the relitigation of proven cures, and neither will millions of Americans who credit their survival and quality of life to scientific miracles,” said McConnell, the lone Republican to vote against confirming Kennedy.</p> 
  <p>“Individuals, parents, and families have a right to push for a healthier nation and demand the best possible scientific guidance on preventing and treating illness. But a record of trafficking in dangerous conspiracy theories and eroding trust in public health institutions does not entitle Mr. Kennedy to lead these important efforts.”</p> 
  <p>This is the second time in as many days that McConnell has opposed one of Trump’s nominees. Yesterday, he voted against confirming <strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong> as director of national intelligence, again the sole Republican to do so.</p>

  <p>US presidents in recent years have tried to cultivate a positive relationship with India, viewing it as a counterweight to China in Asia. That dynamic will undoubtedly hang over Trump and Modi’s meeting, but so, too, will Trump’s plans for tariffs on all kinds of imports. </p>

  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> said on Thursday that the US should “delete entire agencies” from the federal government as a part of his extraordinary strategy under the Trump administration to make huge cost cuts with the stated goal of boosting efficiency.</p> 
  <p>Musk made the latest suggestion on a video call to the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in response to a question about what changes he planned to execute under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s direction.</p> 
  <p>“I think we do need to delete entire agencies, as opposed to leave part of them behind,” said Musk, adding: “If you don’t remove the roots of the weed, then it’s easy for the weed to grow back. But if you remove the roots of the weed, it doesn’t stop weeds from ever going back, but it makes it harder.”</p>

  <p><strong>Back at the judiciary committee, the Democratic ranking member Dick Durbin is giving his own lengthy counterargument as to why Kash Patel should not be confirmed as FBI director.</strong></p> 
  <p>Durbin singled out Patel’s book Government Gangsters, where he said the nominee laid out a list of government officials that he would investigate.</p> 
  <p>“Mr Patel clearly lacks the temperament to lead the FBI. Don’t take it from me – read his own words,” Durbin said.</p> 
  <p>“In this book, Mr Patel published an enemies list of 60 people whom he calls ‘members of the deep state’, whatever the hell that is, and accuses of being ‘corrupt actors of the first order’. This list includes many distinguished public servants, both Democrats and Republicans alike. What they share in common is the misfortune of having crossed paths with Patel.”</p> 
  <p>Durbin has accused Patel of orchestrating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/kash-patel-fbi-nominee-agency-purge">the firings of senior FBI officials</a>, and planning to let go of more. He closed with this:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Mr Patel’s directives have already thrown the bureau into chaos. Senior executives who collectively have hundreds of years of experience have been forced out. Thousands of line agents across the country are living in fear of losing their jobs simply because they did the job they were assigned to do. How does any of this make America safer? The American people need an FBI Director focused on keeping the public safe from terrorism, drug trafficking and violent crime, not petty personal grievances.</p>

  <p><strong>At its hearing to advance Kash Patel’s nomination out of committee, judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley is making the case for his candidacy to be FBI director.</strong></p> 
  <p>“The FBI has fallen into really old habits and is long overdue for massive reform. Mr Patel is the man to do it, and that’s why he’s being attacked so viciously right now,” Grassley said, continuing:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Before we even had a hearing, committee members called Mr. Patel by these adjectives: dishonest, untrustworthy, lacking in character, a wolf at the door, a conspiracy theorist, a staunch political loyalist. Lastly, a nightmare.</p> 
   <p>Since his nomination was announced, committee Democrats have sent at least 11 letters to 11 different agencies and parties demanding records and urging investigation into Mr. Patel. Each letter breathlessly accuses Mr. Patel of something new, often citing “highly credible” anonymous sources that don’t fit the facts. Some accused him of not following hostage rescue protocol. Others suggest that he is secretly directing FBI personnel decisions, and some accused him of promoting conspiracy theories. The purpose of this campaign is quite obvious. Throw everything at the wall and hope something sticks. I’m not falling for it, and I don’t believe the American people will likewise.</p>

  <p>Amid the daily troubling news coming from the <strong>United States</strong> are the ongoing and increasingly damaging efforts by <strong>President Donald Trump</strong>, supported by secretary of state <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> and <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/what-is-usaid-donald-trump-elon-musk-foreign-aid-freezes">shut down</a> the US Agency for International Development (USAid). Musk<strong> </strong>has called it a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-elon-musk-federal-government">criminal organization</a>” and said that it was “time for it to die”. The agency website is down, so little official information is available. But in the week since funding to the agency was frozen, and the majority of staff placed on leave, thousands of public health and development programmes worldwide have been thrown into turmoil, and now face an uncertain future.</p> 
  <p>USAid is the main federal agency that works to provide foreign aid assistance to the poorest countries and people in the world. On Friday, a US judge prevented about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/judge-temporarily-blocks-usaid-leave">2,000 USAid employees</a> from being placed on leave, and ordered the reinstatement of about 500 more. But Trump and Musk appear to want to move forward with a plan that would see its global workforce reduced from about 10,000 staff and contractors, <a href="https://www.devex.com/news/trump-will-double-usaid-staff-numbers-to-600-up-from-300-yesterday-109330">to just over 600</a>.</p> 
  <p>It’s hard to overstate how disruptive this has already been to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/04/deaths-predicted-amid-the-chaos-of-elon-musks-shutdown-of-usaid">humanitarian work worldwide</a>: most programmes have just been shut overnight with staff laid off, drugs and food left in warehouses, and patients and others not able to access services. The people affected live in some of the most vulnerable countries like Ukraine, Jordan, Ethiopia, Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Afghanistan.</p>

  <p>A group representing <strong>China’s</strong> steel industry has warned that a new 25% tariff on imports of the product into the <strong>United States</strong> would have an “adverse impact” on the sector, Chinese state media reported Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Donald Trump signed executive orders on Monday slapping new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium, due to come into effect on 12 March.</p> 
  <p>“The US move is essentially an act of trade protectionism,” the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA) said in a statement published by state broadcaster CCTV, Agence France-Presse reports. “In the short term, the impact on [China’s] steel exports is limited,” the CISA said in the report.</p> 
  <p>“But in the long term, the US move could lead other countries to follow suit, thereby reducing [(China’s] steel export competitiveness,” it added.</p> 
  <p>Despite being the world’s top producer of steel, China last year accounted for only a small proportion of US steel imports.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">‘No to ethnic cleansing’: over 350 rabbis sign US ad assailing Trump’s Gaza plan</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>More than 350 rabbis, alongside additional signatories including Jewish creatives and activists, have signed an ad in the New York Times in which they condemn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-plan-to-take-over-gaza-strip-netanyahu-visit">Donald Trump’s proposal</a> for the effective ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza.</p> 
  <p>The ad, which was signed by rabbis including Sharon Brous, Roly Matalon and Alissa Wise, as well as Jewish creatives and activists including Tony Kushner, Ilana Glazer, Naomi Klein and Joaquin Phoenix, says: “Trump has called for the removal of all Palestinians from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>. Jewish people say no to ethnic cleansing!”</p> 
  <p>The ad follows Trump’s proposal to “take over Gaza” and leave 2 million Palestinians who have survived Israel’s deadly onslaught against the narrow strip with “no alternative” but to leave their homes.</p> 
  <p>Trump has called on Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries to take in Palestinians – a proposal that has been met with widespread <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/trump-resumes-sending-2000-pound-bombs-to-israel-undoing-biden-pause">criticism</a> from Arab countries and other allies while being condemned as an ethnic-cleansing plan.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Robert F Kennedy Jr has mass appeal despite his extreme ideas. This theory explains why</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>“Back at home in the United States, the newspapers are saying that I came here today to speak to about 5,000 Nazis,” Robert F Kennedy Jr <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DfW8k6BRXA">told a large crowd in Berlin</a>. Estimated at 38,000 people, the crowd was a mix of hippies, anti-war types, Green party voters and anti-vaxxers, rubbing shoulders with a smattering of skinheads. It was late August 2020 and a group called Querdenken had rallied this motley crew together in defiance of Covid-19 restrictions.</p> 
  <p>“Governments love pandemics,” Kennedy said. “They love pandemics for the same reason they love war – it gives them the ability to impose controls that the population would otherwise never accept.”</p> 
  <p>Last month, in Senate confirmation hearings for his appointment as the US secretary of health and human services, Kennedy was questioned on having previously compared the Center for Disease Control’s work to <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1884661971691213146">that of “Nazi death camps”</a>, calling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/17/robert-f-kennedy-jr-covid-condemned">Covid-19 a bioweapon</a> genetically engineered to target black and white people while sparing Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, and blaming school shootings on antidepressants. “He has made it his life’s work to sow doubt and discourage parents from getting their kids life-saving vaccines,” <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1884620025773887730">said the Democratic senator Ron Wyden</a>. “It has been lucrative for him and put him on the verge of immense power.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Peace push 'not a betrayal' of Ukraine, US defence secretary Hegseth insists</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>US defence secretary Pete Hegseth has been speaking to reporters before today’s Nato defence ministers meeting in Brussels, where he denied that Donald Trump’s peace push with Vladimir Putin was a “betrayal” of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Hegeseth said that the Russian aggression on Ukraine was “a factory reset for Nato,” and a moment of “realisation that this alliance needs to be robust, strong, and real.”</p> 
  <p>“That is why president Trump has called for increased defence spending across the board for Nato, for European countries to recognise this is an urgent, real threat to the continent and this aggression needs to be a wake up call,” he said.</p> 
  <p>He said that standing up to Russian aggression is “an important European responsibility.”</p> 
  <p>Confronted by reporters with suggestions that the rapid push to peace and talks with the Russian president who annexed Crimea in 2014 and invaded Ukraine in 2022 could be seen as amounting to a betrayal of Ukraine, Hegseth insisted “That is your language, not mine. Certainly not a betrayal.”</p> 
  <p>“There is no betrayal; there is a recognition that the whole world and the US is invested in peace, in a negotiated peace,” he says.</p>

  <p><strong>Denver Public Schools became the first US school district Wednesday to sue the Trump administration challenging its policy allowing ICE immigration agents in schools.</strong><br><br>Colorado’s largest public school district argued in the federal lawsuit that the policy has forced schools to divert vital educational resources and caused attendance to plummet, Associated Press reports.<br><br>“DPS is hindered in fulfilling its mission of providing education and life services to the students who are refraining from attending DPS schools for fear of immigration enforcement actions occurring on DPS school grounds,” the lawsuit states.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Senate expected to vote on Robert F Kennedy Jr's bid to be health secretary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Senate is expected to vote today on the confirmation of Robert F Kennedy Jr – a prominent lawyer and vocal vaccine critic – as the nation’s health secretary, controlling $1.7tn in spending for vaccines, food safety and health insurance programs for roughly half the country.<br><br>Despite several Republicans expressing deep skepticism about his views on vaccines, Kennedy is expected to win confirmation.</strong></p> 
  <p>Writing for CBS News, Kaia Hubbard <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-nomination-hhs-secretary-senate/">noted</a> that “Kennedy’s path to confirmation was once considered among the most fragile of president Trump’s nominees,” but the Senate has cleared the final hurdle to a vote on his appointment 53 to 47 along party lines.</p> 
  <p>Last week Republican Sen Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, despite having expressed doubts about Kennedy Jr’s votes on vaccines, supported the appointment at the committee stage, and Republican Sen Susan Collins from Maine, who has expressed some disquiet about Trump nominations, also vowed to support Kennedy Jr.</p> 
  <p>During the pandemic, Kennedy Jr, 71, devoted much of his time to a nonprofit that sued vaccine makers and harnessed social media campaigns to erode trust in vaccines as well as the government agencies that promote them. He has said he is “uniquely positioned” to revive trust in public health agencies.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">75,000 federal workers sign up for Trump's buyout as judge clears path for workforce cuts</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>About 75,000 federal workers accepted the offer to quit in return for being paid until 30 September, according to McLaurine Pinover, a spokesperson for the office of personnel management, Associated Press reports.</strong></p> 
  <p>She said the deferred resignation program “provides generous benefits so federal workers can plan for their futures,” and it was now closed to additional workers.</p> 
  <p>A federal judge on Wednesday removed a key legal hurdle stalling president Donald Trump’s plan to downsize the federal workforce. The Boston-based judge’s order in the challenge filed by a group of labor unions was a significant legal victory for the Republican president after a string of courtroom setbacks.</p> 
  <p>American Federation of Government Employees National president Everett Kelley said in a statement that the union’s lawyers are assessing the next steps.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Today’s ruling is a setback in the fight for dignity and fairness for public servants. But it’s not the end of that fight. Importantly, this decision did not address the underlying lawfulness of the program.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said the union continues to maintain that it is illegal to force citizens to make a decision, in a few short days, without adequate information, about “whether to uproot their families and leave their careers for what amounts to an unfunded IOU from Elon Musk.”</p> 
  <p>In a “factsheet” <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-works-to-remake-americas-federal-workforce">issued by the White House</a> earlier this week, the Trump administration claimed that “excluding active-duty military and Postal Service employees, the federal workforce exceeds 2.4 million” people, and that “only 6% of federal workers report to work in-person on a full-time basis.”</p>
