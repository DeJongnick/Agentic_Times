    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:C - Eleven of their 16 goals have been from set pieces. They have scored more goals from corners (seven) than from open play (five)., 2:B - Jemimah gave a brilliant post-match interview, too. “Towards the end I was just quoting scripture from the Bible because I had no energy, I was very tired,” she said. “I was quoting one scripture which says, ‘just stand still and God will fight for you’, and that’s what I did. I stood there and he fought for me.”, 3:C - There will only be one game on Boxing Day – which falls on a Friday this year – but a full set of fixtures on the weekend. , 4:B - The game is at Soldier Field, where Ireland beat New Zealand 40-29 in 2016. It was their first win against the All Blacks in 111 years of trying. , 5:D - The 50-year-old has been racking up goals and appearances for the last 32 seasons. His goal for Kings Park Rangers on Saturday means he has scored in the top 10 tiers of English football. “I’ve just loved scoring goals,” he said. “Each one is as special as the next one. I’ve always tried to celebrate any goal I score – whether I was in training, playing on the park or in school when I was young.”, 6:B - Nawaqanitawase played union for Australia at the last Rugby World Cup and he played sevens at the Olympics in Paris last year. , 7:D - They were involved in all three goals in the game: Rashford set up Barcelona’s goal, and Bellingham set up one and scored the other for Real Madrid. , 8:C - Littler did not seem too upset, posting online: “Back to bed it is.” , 9:B - The goal was set up by 39-year-old James Milner and scored by 18-year-old Charalampos Kostoulas (who was born five years after Milner made his Premier League debut). , 10:C - To be fair to Pollard, he is game. He has fought (and lost) 16 times this year. His one victory was against Louis Smithson, who later avenged that defeat. , 11:B - Ronaldo has scored three times against United – twice for Real Madrid and once for Juventus. , 12:A - O’Callaghan was in a league of her own at the event in Toronto., 13:B - This is not his first time captaining the team, as you no doubt remember. , 14:B - The LA Dodgers are the reigning champions and are aiming to become the first team to win back-to-back titles since 2000., 15:A - The match finished 2-2 so at least the fans were treated to some entertainment in the middle of their 914-mile round trip., 16:B - Meanwhile, the third Test will be played at Headingley Stadium in Leeds.</p>
