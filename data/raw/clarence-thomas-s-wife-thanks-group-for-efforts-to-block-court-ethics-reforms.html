<p>Ginni Thomas, the far-right activist wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, has thanked a religious liberties group for its efforts to block reforms of the court aimed at reining in the justices’ ethical breaches, including those of her husband.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/ginni-thomas-email-scotus-ethics-reform-first-liberty-institute?utm_source=comms&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=comms">new recording</a> obtained by the investigative website ProPublica and the watchdog Documented discloses a July email in which Ginni Thomas thanked First Liberty Institute for fighting to oppose supreme court reforms. She specifically referred to White House proposals from Joe Biden designed to rein in wayward justices on the country’s highest court, of which her husband is the prime example.</p> <p>“I cannot adequately express enough appreciation for you guys pulling into reacting to the Biden effort on the supreme court. Many were so depressed by the lack of response by R[epublican]s and conservatives,” she said.</p> <p>Writing in all caps, she added: “YOU GUYS HAVE FILLED THE SAILS OF MANY JUDGES. CAN I JUST TELL YOU, THANK YOU SO, SO, SO MUCH.”</p> <p>The email was read out by the head of First Liberty Institute, Kelly Shackelford, on a 31 July call with donors to the group. He said the email had been written by Ginni Thomas that same day.</p> <p>Two days previously, Biden had called for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/29/biden-us-supreme-court-reforms">sweeping changes</a> to the court, including term limits for the nine justices and a code of ethics that would be enforced by an outside body. Under current arrangements, the justices are liable to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/nov/13/us-supreme-court-ethics-code">voluntary code</a> which they individually police themselves.</p> <p>In an op-ed piece in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/29/joe-biden-reform-supreme-court-presidential-immunity-plan-announcement/">Washington Post</a>, the US president explained why he thought a tougher code of ethics was now necessary. He pointed to “scandals involving several justices” that had damaged public confidence in the court, including “undisclosed gifts to justices” and “conflicts of interest connected with Jan 6 insurrectionists”.</p> <p>Biden did not mention names, but Clarence Thomas has been implicated in both types of ethically questionable behaviour. ProPublica has exposed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/nov/13/us-supreme-court-ethics-code">lavish international travel</a> that the justice enjoyed courtesy of the Republican mega-donor Harlan Crow.</p> <p>A conflict of interest relating to the 6 January 2021 storming of the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump has also been revealed by the House committee investigating the insurrection. It showed that Ginni Thomas was deeply implicated in efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the lead-up to January 6, writing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/ginni-thomas-donald-trump-mark-meadows-texts-election">several messages</a> to the then White House chief of staff Mark Meadows as the conspiracy unfolded.</p> <p>When the supreme court was asked to adjudicate on Trump’s request that White House records – which, it was later found, included Ginni Thomas’s messages – should not be disclosed to the House committee, only one justice sided with Trump: Clarence Thomas.</p> <p>First Liberty Institute is an influential player in rightwing judicial circles. With income of $25m, it has regularly argued cases before the supreme court calling for greater involvement of religion in the public square.</p> <p>The Republican speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, used to work as a lawyer for the group and has called Shackelford a mentor.</p>
