<p>Donald Trump’s decision to extend a truce in the trade war with China for another 90 days triggered a stock market rally across the globe on Tuesday.</p> <p>The US president signed an executive order on Monday night <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/trump-china-tariffs-deal-deadline">extending the deadline for higher tariffs on China</a> until 10 November and avoiding a rates cliff edge. Beijing responded the following morning that it would suspend additional tariffs on US goods for a further 90 days.</p> <p>Trump had previously threatened to put tariff rates as high as 245% on Chinese imports into the US after the deadline passed, while Beijing had threatened retaliatory tariffs of 125%.</p> <p>In response to the reprieve, markets in Japan and Australia hit record highs on Tuesday, as expectations grew that Washington and Beijing could secure a trade agreement during the fresh hiatus, which extends current baseline rates of 30% on Chinese goods into the US and 10% on American products going the other way.</p> <p>Tokyo’s Nikkei share index rose 2.5% to 42,867.69 points on Tuesday, while the Australian ASX 200 index closed up 0.41%, to a new high of 8,880. Its momentum was helped by the Reserve Bank of Australia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/12/rba-interest-rates-decision-relief-for-borrowers-as-reserve-bank-cuts-cash-rate-to-36">cutting its main interest rate to a two-year low of 3.6%</a>.</p> <p>In China, the Shanghai composite index rose by 0.5%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index remained broadly flat.</p> <p>Stock markets in Europe also opened higher on Tuesday morning. In the UK, the FTSE 100 index of blue-chip multinationals closed up 0.2% while the French Cac 40 rose 0.5%. </p> <p>US markets were also up, helped by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/inflation-cpi-trump-tariffs">better-than-expected inflation data</a>. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.9% in early trading and was on track to top its all-time high set two weeks ago, while the Dow was up 1% and the tech-focused Nasdaq climbed 1.1% and was also heading toward a record.</p> <p>Economists have warned that Trump’s trade war regime, especially against China, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/05/donald-trump-tariffs">could seriously damage the global economic outlook</a>, as it could lead to higher costs, disrupt supply chains and reduce international trade.</p> <p>Mark Haefele, of the Swiss bank UBS, said the trade truce represented “an encouraging step toward finding an agreement between Washington and Beijing that would avoid a significant disruption in global trade flows”.</p> <p>“We think the additional time could yield concessions from both sides on several unresolved issues, including fentanyl flows, rare-earth controls, tech export curbs, and Russian oil purchase,” he said.</p> <p>Oil prices also rose on Tuesday amid hopes the trade war could de-escalate. Brent crude futures rose by 0.4% to $66.90 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose by 0.4% to $64.20.</p>
