<p>If this were a movie, the scriptwriters would be shoo-ins for an Oscar, the plot centred on a dominant team who overcame the heartbreak of losing two back-to-back Rugby World Cup finals to complete an eight-year redemption arc and become world champions again at last.</p> 
<p>Before Saturday’s final, England had lost once in 63 games and that blot on their record stained everything. But no more. They are world champions for a third time and this one may taste all the sweeter for being played out in front of a world-record crowd of 81,885. The result will have apermanent effect on the sport in England.</p>

<p>It was just a few years ago when the Red Roses would run out to a few thousand fans who had stayed behind after the men had played. Now, they are turning a profit for the Rugby Football Union and securing silverware in the process. The celebrations do not stop at Twickenham, with an event at Battersea power station on Sunday.</p> 
<p>Ellie Kildunne’s brilliant individual attacking sizzle will rightfully be in the spotlight once again with her efforts making the difference at times, but Alex Matthews and Sadia Kabeya must share some of the acclaim. The No 8 is ever-consistent in an England shirt and showed up on the biggest stage with two tries, while Kabeya, the player of the match, fronted up in defence.</p> 
<p>Canada were expected to start fast and it looked like it until they knocked on to set up the first scrum. Both finalists boast an impressive set-piece, but England ate them up in the first instance. Back and forth went possession, but a lost lineout allowed Canada to pounce and the first blood went the way of Asia Hogan-Rochester.</p> 
<p>England responded well and after winning penalty advantage, Kildunne danced and twisted to the line in another phenomenal solo effort. For the next period it was all about the hosts, though they fumbled two attacks as the showpiece continued to be closely fought. However, just as the catch and drive undid them in the 2022 final, it was responsible for their next try through Amy Cokayne.</p> 
<p>Tatyana Heard intercepted when Canada looked to be creating a promising attack and while Canada’s defensive set rendered plenty of penalties, they did prevent England from scoring. That was until Matthews, who won the World Cup in 2014, sniped when England went through phases after another impressive scrum.</p>

<p>Canada were in desperate need of points, but despite continually knocking on the door, England’s defence was impressive, particularly through their captain, Zoe Aldcroft. Canada won a penalty with Sophie de Goede adding three points. At half-time the score stood at 21-8 after England had a try ruled out because of obstruction in the lineout.</p> 
<p>Livin’ on a Prayer by Bon Jovi was the soundtrack and “we’re halfway there” never felt more suitable for England’s supporters. Whoever scored first in the second 40 would land a psychological blow and the victor of that particular element were England through Abbie Ward.</p>

    <p>The New Zealand wing Braxton Sorensen-McGee ran in two tries as the Black Ferns finished third at the World Cup with a 42-26 victory over France in the playoff for bronze.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The 18-year-old star Sorensen-McGee, the tournament's leading try scorer, produced her 10th and 11th tries of this World Cup in a comfortable win at Twickenham for the deposed champions.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>New Zealand were taken apart 34-19 by Canada in the semi-finals and France faced the backlash, although <i>Les Bleues</i> had their moments, especially in the second half.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Black Ferns had built a 26-7 lead by the interval with Ruahei Demant, Sylvia Brunt, Renee Holmes and Laura Bayfield crossing, rewarding their ambition in attack.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>France staged a fightback with Léa Champon, Gaby Vernier and Emilie Boulard going over, but Sorensen-McGee's finishing instincts ensured there was no danger of an upset. <b>PA Media</b></p>

<p>With England’s prop Hannah Botterman receiving a yellow card for a dangerous tackle, Canada took advantage with Hogan-Rochester going in again. The Red Roses were under pressure, but a huge scrum got them out of trouble.</p> 
<p>Scrums were England’s get out of jail free card on more than one occasion in the closing minutes and Matthews crossed the line to reward that success and seal the World Cup triumph.</p> 
<p>England had received more plaudits before the trophy lift with John Mitchell winning coach of the year. Canada’s De Goede won player of the year.</p> 
<p>Fireworks toasted the new world champions as Aldcroft raised the trophy high. It felt like a turning point for not only this England team, but the sport as a whole. Before the final one question taunted England: could they convert their dominance into victory? They answered that defiantly and are on top of the world again.</p>
