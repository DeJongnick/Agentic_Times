she will continue to make a strong contribution to our public life.</p> </blockquote> <p>Abbott earlier today published a column entitled “Mass Immigration Across the Anglo-Sphere Must Cease”. Price today doubled down on her own campaign against “mass migration” leading up to and after her resignation, while refusing to back Sussan Ley’s leadership or apologise for her comments about Indian migrants.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-10T09:16:53.133Z">at 10.16am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68c136568f084b00adb68013" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-10T08:56:35.903Z">9.56am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Price says controversy will ‘make our party stronger’</strong></p> <p><strong>Jacinta Nampijinpa Price</strong> has called for the Liberals to grow from the internal divide sparked by her remarks on immigration, to “reverse Australia’s decline and advance Australia”.</p> <p>As we <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/sep/10/australia-news-live-nampijinpa-price-littleproud-pacific-albanese-indian-immigration-sussan-ley-coalition-liberal-labor-koala-park-nsw-ntwnfb?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68c132df8f084b00adb67ff1#block-68c132df8f084b00adb67ff1">reported earlier</a>, Price hit out at some of her Liberal colleagues in her resignation statement for having “disregarded” her points about “Labor’s mass migration agenda” to instead “indulge agenda-driven media commentary”.</p> <p>The Northern Territory senator had kinder words for her colleagues in the shadow portfolios of defence, <strong>Angus Taylor, Phillip Thompson </strong>and<strong> Darren Chester</strong>, who she said “are doing a sterling job in holding the Albanese Government to account”.</p> <p>Price said the “disappointing episode” could still help the Liberals grow:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I will learn from it.

planned on Saturday, with the possibility for each group to confront one another.</p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>These protests have a mixture of extremist right wing ideology and left wing and opposing views, and due to the violence that we saw on the streets of Melbourne two weeks ago, and our intelligence pointing towards these groups again [being] intent on coming together and clashing, police have had no choice but to put together a significant police response to make sure that we’re protecting community safety and keeping these groups apart.</p> </blockquote> <p>Papworth says the four protests were organised by umbrella groups Save Australia, Australia Unites Against Government Corruption, the Black Peoples Union and the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism as well as “other left wing aligned issue motivated groups”.</p> <p>He says the National Socialist Network may also be involved:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We can’t discount the fact that,
