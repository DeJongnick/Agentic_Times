 <h2 class="block-title">Wall Street's worst day since 2020</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Ouch! Wall Street has suffered its worst day since the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.</strong></p> 
  <p>As the closing bell rings out across the New York Stock Exchange, a brutal wave of selling has driven the main indices to their worst one-day falls in around five years.</p> 
  <p>The S&amp;P 500 index is down 4.9% at the close, which Reuters flags is the biggest one-day drop since June 2020.</p>

  <p>The scale of the selloff, wiping trillions of dollars off the value of US companies, highlights just how alarmed investors are by the tariffs announced by Donald Trump last night, and the fears they could lead to a recession.</p>

  <p>With recession fears bubbling, asset management firm <strong>Schroders </strong>is among those cutting its US growth forecasts.</p> 
  <p><strong>Johanna Kyrklund,</strong> Group Chief Investment Officer at<strong> Schroders, </strong>explains why:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Certainly, Trump’s opening salvo points to higher tariffs than we were expecting, and our economic forecasts are being adjusted downwards with an expectation of around 1% US GDP growth for 2025.</p> 
   <p>This leads us to reduce our weight in equities, and we see value in government bonds as a hedge against the risk of recession for the first time in this cycle. We continue to like gold as it benefits from both weaker growth and the more structural risk posed by rising debt levels.</p> 
   <p>Going forward the reaction of the rest of the world will be critical. The countries on the list will have to make their decision either to retaliate and escalate the war – or to contemplate reducing their trade imbalance with the US. How long this will take will also matter for the market.</p> 
   <p>But let’s also try and tease out some positives. Trump’s framework, laid out on a physical chart, is clear. One might dispute the approach – of using each country’s trade deficit with the US – but by applying the principle of imposing 50% of the calculated rate they have laid out a clear framework for negotiation. This might feel like a game of snakes and ladders, but at least we are starting to understand the rules. That gives markets a basis for pricing these risks.</p>

  <p>This could be an interesting issue to adjudicate on. The new tariff of 20% means goods from Europe will cost US importers a fifth more than before. But that doesn’t justify raising the price paid by consumers by 20%, given other costs – such as wages, transport – won’t have also risen in line with tariffs.</p>

  <p>It is clear that market sentiment is fragile, and today’s losses might not be the end of the selling, warns <strong>Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at City Index and FOREX.com.</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Critics argue that the US administration is playing a high-stakes game, where short-term economic pain may outweigh any long-term gains. Should global economic growth falter due to escalating trade tensions, American exporters could find themselves in a precarious position, negating any perceived benefits of improved trade terms.</p> 
   <p>UBS analysts estimate that if these tariffs are made permanent, US inflation could surge to 5%, driven by soaring import costs. This creates a precarious situation for the Federal Reserve. Higher inflation could demand further rate hikes, but with economic growth already under pressure, tightening monetary policy risks exacerbating the downturn. </p> 
   <p>The spectre of stagflation—weak growth paired with rising prices—now looms large. If retaliatory measures escalate the trade war further, concerns about a prolonged economic slowdown will intensify</p>

  <p>US stock markets have tumbled on Thursday as investors parsed the sweeping change in global trading following Donald Trump’s announcement of a barrage of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-new-tariffs-liberation-day">tariffs</a> on the country’s trading partners.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“For a president who used to use Wall Street as his own personal scorecard, today’s market assessment of his tariff plans has been damning. Around $2.2 trillion has been wiped off the value of global stock markets at the time of writing, with the US bearing the brunt of the tariff induced sell-off and the Nasdaq set to experience its largest daily drop since March 2020.</p> 
   <p> “Comparisons will be made to 2020’s global pandemic and 2008’s financial crash, but looking forward we must consider that ‘Liberation’ may ultimately end in recession.</p> 
   <p> “Companies like Apple, which relies on its complicated global supply chain and on positive consumer sentiment, slumped a whopping 8% as investors pondered exactly how badly the tech company’s bottom line will be thwacked by this White House policy. Other tech companies from Dell to HP suffered double digit declines, along with retailer Target, Nike, and perhaps most ironically, the quintessential American brand Ralph Lauren was one of the biggest fallers on the S&amp;P 500 today.</p>

   <p>“Within Europe, U.K. hit much by lower tariff increases (10% versus EU’s 20%). In terms of headline tariff hikes, the UK is Europe’s winner.”</p>

  <p><strong>Nearly $300bn has been wiped off Apple’s value today, amid the stock market turmoil.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Apple’s</strong> shares are currently down 9%, which by my maths cuts its market capitalisation to around $3.07 trillion, down from $3.367tn last night.</p> 
  <p><strong>Apple</strong> will be hurt by the new US tariffs on imports from China, Taiwan, India and Vietnam, as much of its manufacturing and supply chain is based in the Asia-Pacific region.</p> 
  <p><strong>Ben Barringer, </strong>global technology analyst at <strong>Quilter Cheviot, </strong>told clients:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>“Apple</strong> makes 90% of its products in China, with 10% in other Asian countries such as Vietnam and India. These countries are facing the harshest tariffs, so we can expect iPhones and Apple Watches to go up in price, while hitting the profits of the company significantly. Switching production to the US is neither easy, nor cheap.</p> 
   <p>The tariffs are also likely to create demand destruction, which means cutbacks on software and cloud spending. <strong>Alphabet</strong>, will see a double whammy with digital advertising also cut back on in a tougher economic environment – with <strong>Meta</strong> also being hit in this regard.</p>

   <p>“Donald Trump might demand we eat chlorinated chicken and beef reared using growth hormones – but British consumers say no.

   <p>“British exports will be affected by these tariffs, which could harm producers of world class wine, spirits, cheeses and other goods. The best thing the public can do to support these farmers and producers is to buy British.</p> 
   <p>“Ministers would do well to remember that it is the job of British farmers to feed the nation, whilst at the same time being exemplars of sustainable farming practices. We can only do that with a strong and healthy farming sector. Unfortunately, recent government policies – such as changes to inheritance tax – have left the industry considerably weaker.

American businesses could find themselves fighting a multi-front economic war with their own government on tariffs and everyone one else trying to protect their patents and services. </p> 
   <p>“Another question that large economic powers could pose in response to these unilateral tariff actions could be around global capital mobility - going right to the core of globalisation.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Newsflash: Stocks are tumbling on Wall Street at the start of trading, as New York traders give their verdict on the new trade war unleashed by the White House last night.</strong></p> 
  <p>As the opening bell rang out across the New York stock exchange, the <strong>Dow</strong> <strong>Jones</strong> <strong>industrial</strong> <strong>average</strong>, which tracks 30 of the largest US companies, promptly plunged by 1,137 points, or 2.7%, to 41,087 points.</p> 
  <p><strong>Nike</strong> is the biggest faller, sliding by over 10%, while <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Goldman</strong> <strong>Sachs</strong> have both dropped by around 6%.</p> 
  <p>The broader <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> share index is sliding down too – it’s down 3.3% in early trading.</p> 
  <p>The tech-focused <strong>Nasdaq </strong>is being hammered, down 4.5%.</p> 
  <p>This follows heavy losses in Asia-Pacific markets earlier today, where Vietnam’s main share index slumped by 6.8% after Vietnamese goods were hit with a new 46% tariff.</p> 
  <p>European markets are deep in the red too, with the UK’s <strong>FTSE</strong> <strong>100</strong> index is now down 1.6% or 138 points, at 8469 points.</p> 
  <p>Markets have been shaken by Donald Trump’s new tariffs, which are widely expected to hurt the outlook for global growth and inflation.</p> 
  <p><strong>Chris Iggo</strong>, chief investment officer for Core Investments at <strong>AXA</strong>, explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The sweeping tariff package came in at the high end of expectations and, according to analysts, will increase the effective tariff on imports to the US to between 20% and 25%.</p> 
   <p>Some analysts suggest that US economic growth could be reduced by 1% to 2% while inflation will move higher. This will be seen as a stagflation for the US economy. Tariffs on goods from the rest of the world should reduce export growth and will be a negative growth shock, with Asia and Europe most affected given the size of the proposed tariff rates.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Tensions is mounting on Wall Street as investors brace for stock trading to begin.</strong></p> 
  <p>Yesterday’s announcement of new global tariffs by Donald Trump was made just after the US stock market closed on Wednesday, so traders will be itching to respond.</p> 
  <p>The futures market suggests US stocks will suffer heavy losses; the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> share index is currently down by a hefty 3.7% in pre-market trading.</p> 
  <p>Confidence in the US stock market has been dented in recent weeks by fears of a global trade war.</p> 
  <p>Today, <strong>Capital</strong> <strong>Economics</strong> have slashed their forecast for the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong>’s end-of-year close, to 5,500 points, down from 7,000 points previously.</p> 
  <p>Their chief markets economist, <strong>John Higgins</strong>, says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is roughly 10% below its closing peak on 19<sup>th</sup> February and not far from where it may open today after some initial fall-out from the tariff news.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Higgins</strong> adds that there are two reasons for this “significant” downgrade:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The first is yesterday’s announcement of greater tariffs on US imports than we had assumed. In such circumstances, we no longer think the economic backdrop will be sufficiently conducive to a rally in equities. The second is a recent shift in the AI narrative, which has shaken our conviction that big-tech will drive up the index.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Newsflash: Ratings agency Fitch has cut its credit rating on China.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Fitch</strong> has downgraded China’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to ‘A’ from ‘A+’, with a stable outlook.</p> 
  <p><strong>Fitch</strong> says it acted due to China’s rising debts, and deteriorating public finances:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The downgrade reflects our expectations of a continued weakening of China’s public finances and a rapidly rising public debt trajectory during the country’s economic transition. In our view, sustained fiscal stimulus will be deployed to support growth, amid subdued domestic demand, rising tariffs and deflationary pressures.</p> 
   <p>This support, along with a structural erosion in the revenue base, will likely keep fiscal deficits high. We expect the government debt/GDP to continue its sharp upward trend over the next few years, driven by these high deficits, ongoing crystallisation of contingent liabilities and subdued nominal GDP growth.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This does not appear to be a direct response to Donald Trump’s decision to impose a new 34% tariff rate on China.</p> 
  <p><strong>Fitch</strong> says it has not yet calculated the impact, explaining:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While the 2 April reciprocal tariff announcements are not yet incorporated into our forecasts and there is uncertainty about their impact, there is headroom at the current rating to accommodate the likely implications for economic growth and fiscal metrics.</p>

  <p><strong>Paul Diggle,</strong> chief economist at <strong>Aberdeen, </strong>suggests the White House may not be displeased by the market reaction.</p> 
  <p><strong>Diggle</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>So far, the administration appears far more tolerant of market weakness than in Trump’s first term. Indeed, low bond yields and a weaker dollar may be actively helpful market moves give the administration’s preferences.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Diggle </strong>also warns that yesterday’s “dramatic” announcements may not represent “peak tariffs”. </p> 
  <p>He adds:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We still think additional sector specific tariffs are coming, including on semiconductors, copper, lumber and pharmaceuticals.</p> 
   <p> Indeed, these products were mentioned in the executive order, specifying that the reciprocal tariff policy does not apply to them, therefore leaving open that specific rates will be coming soon. On the other hand, that does seem to mean that sector-specific tariffs and reciprocal tariffs aren’t additive.</p> 
   <p>Additionally, the Executive Order provides the President with the right to modify tariff rates in the event of retaliatory measures, meaning rates on some trade partners could be pushed higher still.</p> 
   <p>There is still scope for US tariffs to eventually settle at a lower level, and this is probably still a widespread expectation.</p> 
   <p>The 10% global baseline is likely a floor, but structuring the reciprocal tariff as an additional rate on top of that at least leaves some chance of it then coming down.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Energy sector fears Trump tariffs could hurt suppply chains</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Britain’s energy sector is digesting the impact of Donald Trump’s new tariffs.</strong></p> 
  <p>A senior energy industry executive told the Guardian: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“No one is quite sure what this will mean for the global supply chains. </p> 
   <p>There is an environment of uncertainty about investment. There are a lot of people being cautious - they’re not making a decision either way about anything. They’re saying, ‘let’s stop, take a breath, and see what happens’.</p> 
   <p>If you want economic growth that’s not a good thing, and the Chancellor and the Prime minister will no doubt be worrying about that. But there’s a lot that is within the control of the government which can encourage investments if they get the right frameworks and regulation in place. The only country that can screw that up for the UK, is the UK.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>And seperately, <strong>RenewableUK’s </strong>deputy chief executive <strong>Jane Cooper </strong>has warned that Trump’s tariffs risk pushing up prices for consumers and harming industry.</p> 
  <p>Cooper says: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“Tariffs and trade disputes risk pushing up prices for consumers and harming industry, so the priority must be resolving this dispute and developing a UK trade strategy that strengthens our energy security and reduces risks to the UK supply chain. These tariffs, combined with the US Government’s recent moves to halt the development of offshore wind, will mean American and UK companies will miss out on opportunities to trade, invest and collaborate in innovative clean technology.</p> 
   <p> “While trade in goods for renewables between the US and UK is relatively limited, we are concerned at the wider impact these tariffs could have on the supply chain in the UK and across Europe. Many of our manufacturers operating in the UK - and collectively employing thousands of people here - also have factories in the EU, so President Trump’s announcements will have a far-reaching impact across our sector”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">European lunchtime summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>After a volatile morning on Europe’s financial markets, here’s a quick recap of the situation.</strong></p> 
  <p>The US dollar has tumbled today as investors fear that Donald Trump’s new trade war could trigger a recession.</p> 
  <p>The dollar is down around 2% against a basket of other currencies, a sizeable selloff, after investors were startled by the scale of the tariffs announced by the US president last night.</p> 
  <p>The dollar is now down at a six-month low, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/03/business-news-live-updates-trump-tarrifs-asian-markets-nikkei-asx-wall-st-dow-jones-dollar-euro?page=with%3Ablock-67ee5ad08f0848e9ebbccd8b#block-67ee5ad08f0848e9ebbccd8b">Deutsche Bank warning its clients to “beware a dollar confidence crisis”.</a></p> 
  <p><strong>Deutsche</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded and this is imposing a significant cost on unhedged dollar holdings. Beyond that, developments since the start of the year make us worried about a broader undermining of confidence in the US economic outlook and the medium-term desirability of dollar allocations.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>European stock markets have had a rough morning. Banks and miners have fallen on fears of an economic downturn. Luxury goods stocks are also lower, an anticipation that their exports to the US will be hurt by new tariffs.</p> 
  <p>Here’s the situation:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>FTSE 100</strong>: down 130 points or -1.5% at 8477 points</p></li> 
   <li><p>Germany’s <strong>DAX</strong>: down 496 points or 2.2% at 21,894 points</p></li> 
   <li><p>France’s <strong>CAC</strong>: down 195 points or 2.5% at 7,662 points.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>That followed a sharp plunge in shares across the Asia-Pacific, where Japan’s <strong>Nikkei</strong> lost 2.7%.</p> 
  <p>The sell-off came after China was hit with a 34% fee, in addition to a 20% tariff on all Chinese imports already in place, while the EU will now be levied at 20% and Japan at 24%. Trump said America had been “looted, pillaged and raped” by its trading partners: “In many cases, the friend is worse than the foe.”</p>

  <p><strong>Raphael Olsyzna-Marzys,</strong> international economist at <strong>J. Safra Sarasin Sustainable Asset Management, </strong>says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The US effective tariff rate is set to rise to around 25%, the highest level since the start of the 20th century. This will have a large and direct negative impact on the US economy, pushing growth lower and prices higher. Global growth will also be weaker.</p> 
   <p>What happens next will depend on how countries respond, but we expect some escalation before any eventual de-escalation. Outside the US, the most significant impact will be on Germany and Asian economies. A deteriorating growth outlook is likely to push central banks to lower policy rates, but they will need to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations stay anchored. Still, we think that bond yields will fall further and continue to favour intermediate maturities. Current US equity valuations are not priced for a significant slowdown.</p> 
   <p>We still prefer UK equities, defensives over cyclicals and value overgrowth. Finally, the US dollar is likely to suffer from relative growth headwinds. Safe-haven currencies should do well in the near term.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Oooh. Deutsche Bank are now warning clients to “beware a dollar confidence crisis”.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>George Saravelos, Deutsche’s </strong>head of FX Research, fears that confidence in the US dollar, and America’s economy, is being undermined</p> 
  <p>This is a timely warning, as<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/03/business-news-live-updates-trump-tarrifs-asian-markets-nikkei-asx-wall-st-dow-jones-dollar-euro?page=with%3Ablock-67ee545a8f08d9ccf32774c4#block-67ee545a8f08d9ccf32774c4"> the US dollar has sunk by 1.7% so far today</a> as it weakens sharply against other currencies.</p> 
  <p><strong>Saravelos</strong> writes:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The safe haven properties of the dollar are being eroded and this is imposing a significant cost on unhedged dollar holdings. Beyond that, developments since the start of the year make us worried about a broader undermining of confidence in the US economic outlook and the medium-term desirability of dollar allocations.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Saravelos </strong>says this<strong> </strong>risks “a self-fulfilling unwind” of extreme US asset overweight positions from countries that have exported capital to the US over the last decade. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Most of the developed world belongs to this category. At the end of the day, the US has a large current account deficit, and the currency is reliant on capital inflows for stability. A drop in the dollar, a drop in US equities <strong>and </strong>a rise in term premium in US treasuries would be the strongest market signal that a process of US disinvestment is accelerating. A rise in term premia on US treasuries has not materialized yet, but it would be a very negative signal if it did.</p> 
   <p><strong>Our overall message is that there is a risk that major shifts in capital flow allocations take over from currency fundamentals and that FX moves become disorderly. We would caution that if the dollar decline accelerates, it would be a highly unwelcome development for global central banks. The last thing the ECB wants is an externally imposed disinflationary shock from a loss in dollar confidence and a sharp appreciation in the euro on top of tariffs. Expect pushback. We are in the midst of dramatic regime change in markets.</strong></p>

  <p>He flags there are growing fears that the trade war could lead to stagflation (rising prices but no growth) or a recession.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“While Trump claims the move will invigorate US manufacturing, many economists warn of potential negative impacts on the economy. The tariff offensive marks a significant economic turning point. With the US now enforcing what amounts to the steepest trade barriers in a century, the risks are more than just theoretical—they are visible in real time, and they are mounting.”<br><br>“The immediate concern is the US economy, where the average effective tariff rate is jumping nearly 19 percentage points. That’s a direct tax on consumption and corporate costs, especially for industries relying on imported materials. The result? Higher prices, tighter margins, weaker growth—and a heightened risk of recession. Economists warn that these tariffs could accelerate the arrival of stagflation, where inflation rises even as the economy stagnates or contracts.”<br><br>“Globally, the picture is just as concerning. China could lose up to 2.4 percentage points of GDP growth, according to recent forecasts, and the ripple effects could hit Europe, Asia, and emerging markets hard.

   <p>The bottom line is that uncertainty remains high — even without considering that some of these new tariffs might be cancelled or revised after a few days of negotiations. Rough estimates suggest the economic impact could be even greater than the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of the 1930s - a set of protectionist trade policies that raised import taxes and are widely believed to have worsened the Great Depression by triggering global retaliation and slowing international trade [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/03/business-news-live-updates-trump-tarrifs-asian-markets-nikkei-asx-wall-st-dow-jones-dollar-euro?page=with%3Ablock-67ee39008f0800d4cb06c7ec#block-67ee39008f0800d4cb06c7ec">see earlier post for more details</a>].</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">UK better placed to withstand tariff turmoil, say T. Rowe Price</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The UK economy will perform better than Europe this year, as the trade war drags the eurozone into recession, <strong>Tomasz Wieladek</strong>, chief European economist at <strong>T. Rowe Price, </strong>has predicted.</p> 
  <p><strong>Wieladek </strong>predicts the UK will see a rise in cheaper imports, as goods producers look to avoid US tariffs:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The UK will be least affected by the new policies. I believe the overall negative effect on the UK economy will only be about 0.2-0.5% this year. This is mainly because trade diversion to the US via the UK is likely to be now significant. Plants producing anything in the UK will be more competitive than in the EU, which will support some domestic investment.</p> 
   <p>The UK is a trade deficit country, and President Trump has just created significant excess capacity across the world. UK households will now benefit from much cheaper goods, raising disposable income. Most importantly, the UK government implemented a large fiscal stimulus package six months ago, just in time to absorb the tariff hit.</p> 
   <p>Despite the headwinds, the UK will do better in 2025 than the EU. A mild recession in the euro area in 2025 is now probable. The ECB will cut rates below the neutral rate to 1-1.5%.</p>

  <p><strong>The Spanish Wine Federation (FEV) has described Trump’s imposition of a 20% tariff on EU products as a “significant blow to Spanish wineries”, for whom the US is the second largest export destination, and the No 1 export destination when it comes to sparkling wines.</strong></p> 
  <p>The FEV’s director general, <strong>José Luis Benítez</strong>, said today:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“The tariffs announced by the US are completely unjustified in the specific case of wine, considering that the current tariff gap between the tariffs applied by the EU and the US is minimal.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Benítez</strong> warned that the measure would harm not only Spanish wine-makers but also US consumers, “who consume more wine than they produce”.</p> 
  <p>He also pointed out that the newly announced tariffs would be particularly damaging to small and medium-sized producers, which make up 99% of Spain’s wineries, as they have less capacity to diversify their exports and are more dependent on the main export markets. </p> 
  <p>The US market represents approximately 13% of Spain’s total foreign sales. In 2024, 97 million litres of wine were exported for a value of around €390m. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>While shares are sliding today, there’s a big rally into government bonds.</strong></p> 
  <p>The prices of US Treasury bills, UK gilts, German bunds, and other eurozone government debt are all rallying today.</p> 
  <p>This is pulling down bond yields (the rate of return on the debt), with 10-year UK gilt yields down 6 basis points at 4.581%.</p> 
  <p>That might, superficially, sound like good news for finance ministers, as it shows new borrowing will be cheaper.</p> 
  <p>The problem, though, is that bond prices are rising/yields are falling as investors fear the global trade war will lead to a global recession, prompring interest rate cuts.</p> 
  <p><strong>Kathleen Brooks</strong>, research director at <strong>XTB, </strong>says US trade policy has thrown “a grenade into the global economy”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Brooks</strong> explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The bond market is a big winner.</p> 
   <p>Yields are falling sharply everywhere. The UK and European 2-year yields are lower, as the market rushes to price in rate cuts from the ECB and the BOE, as central banks are likely to step up to ease some of the pain from the US’s new global trade policy. 10-year yields are also lower, for example the 10-year Gilt yield in the UK is down 6bps so far on Thursday.</p> 
   <p>The UK yield curve is flattening, which is a sign that bond investors are pricing in the chance of a recession. US yields are also lower, but not by the same amount as Europe, suggesting that bond investors could be worried about the inflationary impact on the US economy.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">US tariff calculations raise "serious concerns about policy credibility"</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>There’s some surprise this morning that the White House appears to have used a rather blunt tool to calculate its new reciprocal tariffs.</strong></p> 
  <p>Last night, Donald Trump brandished a board showing (he claimed) the tariffs which other countries were charging on the US. The new US tariffs have been set at half that rate.</p> 
  <p>However, rather than in-depth calculations, US officials have invented a formula based on the size of each country’s trade surplus.</p> 
  <p>Basically, the White House has taken the US’s goods trade deficit with each country and then divided it by the total amount of goods imported from that country.</p> 
  <p>[and then halved it, to get the new US tariff for each country, with a 10% minimum].</p> 
  <p><strong>Deutsche</strong> <strong>Bank</strong> have crunched the numbers, and confirm:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Put simply, the bigger the nominal trade deficit a country has with the US adjusted for the absolute size of that country’s imports, the bigger the tariff.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The BBC’s <strong>Faisal</strong> <strong>Islam</strong> has posted the formula:</p> 
  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1907672322988740999"> 
   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THREAD:<br><br>The so-called “reciprocal” tariff doesn’t reflect the tariffs charged elsewhere directly but essentially the size of a country’s trade surplus, which has been used as a proxy.

  </figure> 
  <p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> say this approach to calculating the tariffs “raises serious concerns about policy credibility, undermining the USD [the dollar].”</p> 
  <p>They draw three conclusions:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>First</strong>, the US administration is squarely focused on penalizing countries with larger trade deficits in goods (services are ignored). This determination is highly mechanical, rather than a sophisticated assessment of tariff and non-tariff barriers. It is also in line with the declaration of a national emergency on the trade deficit used as a legal justification for the tariffs.</p> 
   <p><strong>Second</strong>, there is a very large disconnect between communication in recent weeks of an in-depth policy assessment of bilateral trade relationships with different countries versus the reality of the policy outcome. We worry this risks lowering the policy credibility of the administration on a forward-looking basis. The market may question the extent to which a sufficiently structured planning process for major economic decisions is taking place. After all, this is the<a href="https://research.db.com/research/Article?rid=bf97b9d6-0f9e-11f0-abe2-b2b6d598a559-604&amp;kid=RP0001&amp;documentType=R&amp;wt_cc1=IND-1823-4112"> biggest trade policy shift</a> from the US in a century. Crucially, major additional fiscal decisions are lining up over the next two months.</p> 
   <p><strong>Third</strong>, the tariff calculation approach arguably makes for a more free-wheeling and open-ended nature to potential trade negotiations in coming months. It seems there are no specific and identifiable policy asks per se but ultimately a desire to reduce bilateral trade imbalances.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Scottish whisky and salmon industries are “disappointed” with President Trump’s decision to impose 10% tariffs on British imports but have backed Keir Starmer’s efforts to win concessions from the US.</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>Scotch</strong> <strong>Whisky</strong> <strong>Association</strong> said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“The industry is disappointed that Scotch whisky could be impacted by these tariffs. We welcome the intensive efforts by the UK government to reach a deal with the US administration, and we continue to support this measured and pragmatic approach towards a mutually beneficial resolution.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Tavish</strong> <strong>Scott</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Salmon</strong> <strong>Scotland</strong>, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“We have great confidence that Americans will continue to buy nutritious Scottish salmon, particularly when the country is reliant on imports to meet US consumer demand.</p> 
   <p>“Salmon producers want a business-like and stable trade relationship with the USA, so we support the UK government’s efforts to achieve that outcome through a calm and measured approach.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Both sectors rely very heavily on US sales, particularly at the luxury end of their markets. The US is their second largest foreign customer. Industry bodies had been briefed by UK government officials that Trump’s tariffs on the UK could hit 20% so are likely to be relieved they were half that.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>Scotland exports around £4bn worth of goods to the US, with whisky nearly a quarter of that trade at £971m last year. The US also bought £225m worth of Scottish salmon, which is the UK’s largest global food export by value, in 2024.</p> 
  <p>The tariffs will hit US businesses which rely on whisky and salmon. Kentucky bourbon makers sell their used barrels to Scotland for malt whisky maturation, so a fall in sales could hit that. High end US restaurants use premium Scottish salmon, airfreighted in from the UK.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">US tariff burden could be higher than under Smoot-Hawley</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Economists have calculated that the US tariffs would hit their highest level in over a century if the measures announced by Donald Trump last night are implemented in full.</strong></p> 
  <p>Capital Economics have calcualted that the effective tariff rate on all imports will rise from 2.3% last year to around 26%, leaving it at a 131-year high, once you add the new reciprocal tariffs to the earlier hikes on goods from China, and the product-specific tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos.</p> 
  <p>They told clients:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Stepping back, the main message from President Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement was that US tariffs were increased by more than even we had anticipated. Since election day, we have built our forecasts on an assumed that the US would impose a tariff of 60% on imports from China and 10% on imports from all other countries. That would take the effective US tariff rate to around 17%.</p> 
   <p>Instead, the system of reciprocal tariffs that was announced, together with the additional product-specific tariffs that appear imminent, will take the effective US tariff rate to just under 25%.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>That, according to this chart from Capital Economics, would take the effective tariff rate higher than under the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930.</p> 
  <p>The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was brought in early in the Great Depression, as a protectionist measure to help US companies. But it is generally accepted it worsened the slump, which followed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Crash,_1929">the Great Crash of 1929</a>, by weakening global trade.</p> 
  <p>As <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Eric</strong> <strong>Golson</strong>, Associate Professor of Economics at the <strong>University</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Surrey</strong>, recently explained:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>History has shown that trade wars come with long-term economic pain. The Great Depression was exacerbated by an international tariff war, with global trade plummeting by 66% between 1929 and 1933, crippling American businesses and driving unemployment to catastrophic levels.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>UBS</strong> have also calculated that the“US weighted average import tariff is back to pre-WW I levels”.</p> 
  <p>They told clients:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Combining all the tariffs, we believe <strong>the weighted average tariff for the US has increased to 24%</strong>, from just 2.5% at the start of the year, a 21.5pp increase, and equivalent to a $715bn increase in dollar terms.</p>

   <p>A baseline 10% tariff is the starting point, with 20% tariffs set to land on imports from the EU, and much steeper duties imposed on countries in Asia with China facing 34% duties. There will also be 25% tariffs slapped on foreign made cars sold in the US.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Jonathan Reynolds: tariffs are a disappointment</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>British business minister Jonathan Reynolds has warned the tariffs announced by Donald Trump last night is a threat to the UK, because of the damage it will cause to global trade.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking to Times Radio this morning, <strong>Reynolds</strong> explained that anything that disrupts the global trading system is a threat to the UK.</p> 
  <p>And even though <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/02/trump-hits-uk-with-10-tariffs-as-he-ignites-global-trade-war">the UK was hit with a smaller tariff than many other countries</a> – 10%, rather than the EU’s 20% - <strong>Reynolds</strong> said he was “disappointed” to be tariffed at all.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Any barrier to trade, particularly between the UK and our major trading partner, which the US is, is a disappointment to me. It’s a challenge.</p> 
   <p>“So, I recognise that the UK is in a better position than a lot of other countries from what was announced last night, but I was still disappointed.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Reynolds </strong>said the UK should ignore calls to trigger a larger trade war by retaliating. Instead, he said the British government woud stay calm and to talk to the US, and continue the work towards reaching an economic deal.</p>

   <li><p><strong>China was hit with a 34% fee, in addition to a 20% tariff on all Chinese imports already in place, while the EU will now be levied at 20% and Japan at 24%</strong>.

 <h2 class="block-title">How did the Trump White House calculate the tariffs?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Many people have been asking how the Trump administration worked out its tariffs, while many countries have been arguing the numbers bear no relationship with reality.</p> 
  <p>New Zealand’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/03/business-news-live-updates-trump-tarrifs-asian-markets-nikkei-asx-wall-st-dow-jones-dollar-euro?page=with%3Ablock-67edce0c8f08188975c6435a#block-67edce0c8f08188975c6435a">trade minister insisted</a> his country did not apply a 20% tariff to US imports, as suggested by Washington, while Australia’s prime minister, Anthony Albanese, insisted the US tariffs had “no basis in logic” and that “a reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10%.”</p> 
  <p>One journalist claims to have discovered the answer, and analysts are suggesting he is likely correct.</p> 
  <p>“They didn’t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country’s exports to us,” financial writer James Surowiecki wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1907559189234196942">post</a> on X.</p> 
  <p>“So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64%, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us.”</p> 
  <p>Then that number was divided in half as Trump said he was being “kind”. He also said the tariff calculations included “currency manipulation and trade barriers”.</p> 
  <p>An <a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations">explanation</a> of the calculations later posted on the office of the US trade representative appeared to confirm that the administration had used trade deficits divided by imports.</p> 
  <p>Mike O’Rourke, chief marketing strategist at Jones Trading, was quoted by CNN as saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While these new tariff measures have been framed as ‘reciprocal’ tariffs, it turns out the policy is actually one of surplus targeting ...</p> 
   <p>There does not appear to have been any tariffs used in the calculation of the rate. The Trump administration is specifically targeting nations with large trade surpluses with the United States relative to their exports to the United States.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Analysis: Liberation from what?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>For weeks, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and his aides sought to brand Wednesday as “liberation day” in America. Many in the US could be forgiven for wondering what exactly they’ve just been liberated from.</p> 
  <p>Trump likes to present the world as black and white. The US is either winning or losing. A policy, deal or plan is the best or the worst. A person, country or company is supporting or screwing you.</p> 
  <p>There is rarely space for nuance, time for complexity, or tolerance for inconvenient facts. The simplicity of this narrative is its power.</p> 
  <p>By Trump’s telling, the US is about to raise trillions of dollars for the federal government by taxing the world, not its citizens: a typically black and white choice.</p> 
  <p>But reality is often more complex than rhetoric. There are myriad shades of gray.</p> 
  <p>Import tariffs are not paid by other countries. They are paid by importers – in this case, US firms and companies – buying goods from overseas. These costs often trickle down through the economy, raising prices at every clink in the chain.</p> 
  <p>Trump promised lower prices. He is betting his tariffs won’t raise them too high, for too long.</p> 
  <p>“This is going to be a big moment,” he said on Wednesday. “I think you’re going to remember today.”</p> 
  <p>He may well be right.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Japan’s trade minister says Tokyo told Washington that sweeping new US tariffs that include a 24% levy on Japanese imports are “extremely regrettable”, according to AFP.</p> 
  <p>“I have conveyed that the unilateral tariff measures taken by the US are extremely regrettable, and I have again strongly urged [Washington] not to apply them to Japan,” <strong>Yoji Muto</strong> told reporters, adding that he spoke with US commerce secretary <strong>Howard Lutnick</strong> before Donald Trump’s announcement.</p> 
  <p>“I also explained in detail how the US tariffs would adversely affect the US economy by undermining the capacity of Japanese companies to invest in the United States,” said Muto.</p> 
  <p>“We had a frank discussion on how to pursue cooperation in the interest of both Japan and the United States that does not rely on tariffs,” Muto said.</p> 
  <p>Chief cabinet secretary <strong>Yoshimasa Hayashi</strong> also told reporters that the tariffs may contravene World Trade Organization (WTO) rules and the two countries’ trade treaty.</p> 
  <p>“We have serious concerns as to consistency with the WTO agreement and Japan-US trade agreement,” he told reporters.</p> 
  <p>Japan has also failed to win exclusion from 25-percent tariffs on auto imports due to come into force later on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Last year, vehicles accounted for around 28% of Japan’s 21.3 trillion yen ($142 bn) of US-bound exports, and roughly eight% of all Japanese jobs are tied to the sector.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">China urges US to ‘immediately cancel’ new tariffs, calls for 'dialogue’</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>China’s commerce ministry has called for Washington to “immediately cancel” sweeping new tariffs, warning they “endanger global economic development” and would hurt US interests and international supply chains.</p> 
  <p>“China urges the US to immediately cancel unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with trade partners through equal dialogue,” the ministry said, adding: “There is no winner in a trade war, and there is no way out for protectionism.”</p> 
  <p>Trump has hit China with particularly stinging tariffs of 34% in addition to already existing 20% tariffs on all Chinese imports.</p> 
  <p>Beijing also accused the United States of a “typical unilateral bullying practice”.</p> 
  <p>Trump has said his tariffs are “reciprocal” but many experts say his administration’s estimates for levies placed on US imports by other countries are wildly exaggerated.</p> 
  <p>“The US claims to have suffered losses in international trade, using so-called ’reciprocity’ as an excuse to raise tariffs on all trade partners,” Beijing said.</p> 
  <p>“This approach disregards the balance of interests achieved through years of multilateral trade negotiations and ignores the fact that the US has long profited significantly from international trade,” it added.</p>

  <p>A group of barren, uninhabited volcanic islands near Antarctica, covered in glaciers and home to penguins, have been swept up in Donald Trump’s trade war, as the US president hit them with a 10% tariff on goods.</p> 
  <p>Heard Island and McDonald Islands, which form an external territory of Australia, are among the remotest places on earth, accessible only via a two-week boat voyage from Perth on Australia’s west coast. They are completely uninhabited, with the last visit from people believed to be nearly 10 years ago.</p> 
  <p>Nevertheless, Heard and McDonald Islands featured in a list released by the White House of countries that would have new trade tariffs imposed.</p>

  <p>Developing nations in South-east Asia, including war-torn and earthquake-hit <strong>Myanmar</strong>, and several African nations are among the trading partners facing the highest tariffs set by US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs.</p> 
  <p><strong>Cambodia</strong>, a developing economy where 17.8% of the population live below the poverty line according to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is the worst-hit country in the region with a tariff rate of 49%.</p> 
  <p>In second place is the landlocked South-east Asian nation of <strong>Laos</strong>, a country heavily bombed by the US during the cold war, with 48%. According to the ADB, Laos has a poverty rate of 18.3%.</p> 
  <p>But the real target may be <strong>China</strong>.</p> 
  <p>“The administration thinks is that by targeting these countries they can target Chinese investment in countries like Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia,” said Dr Siwage Dharma Negara, a senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. “By targeting their products maybe it will effect Chinese exports and the economy.”</p> 
  <p>“The real target is China but the real impact on those countries will be quite significant because this investment creates jobs and export revenue.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Canadian exemption from tariffs 'like dodging a bullet into the path of a tank'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Canada’s exemption from Donald Trump’s global tariffs was “like dodging a bullet into the path of a tank”, say business leaders as other levies are poised to hit key industries that drive the country’s economy.</p> 
  <p>In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-new-tariffs-liberation-day">theatrical unveiling of tariffs</a> on countries with “unfair” practices on Wednesday afternoon, Canada was noticeably absent, alongside trade ally Mexico.</p> 
  <p>But speaking speaking to reporters on Parliament Hill, prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mark-carney">Mark Carney</a> said 25% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, as well as on automobiles, will come into effect within hours.</p> 
  <p>Canada would “fight these measures with countermeasures” he said, ahead of a meeting with cabinet ministers. “In a crisis, it’s important to come together. It’s essential to act with purpose and with force and that’s what we’ll do.”</p> 
  <p>Already, Canada had put a 25% tax on C$30bn ($21bn) worth of US goods in response to Trump’s tariffs. Among the products targeted are spirits, wine and orange juice – items meant to inflict targeted economic pain. The federal government has repeatedly pledged to keep its retaliatory measures until the US lifts all levies on Canadian products.</p> 
  <p>The prime minister is expected to outline the next stages of Canada’s response on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association posted on social media the result was “like dodging a bullet into the path of a tank”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Republican senators join Democrats to block tariffs on Canada</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Several Republican senators have joined Democrats to pass a resolution that would block Donald Trump’s tariffs on Canada, a rare rebuke of the president’s trade policy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trump-new-tariffs-liberation-day">just hours after</a> he announced plans for sweeping import taxes on some of the country’s largest trading partners.</p> 
  <p>In a 51-48 vote, four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and both Kentucky senators, the former majority leader Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul – defied Trump’s pressure campaign and supported the measure. </p> 
  <p>Democrats used a procedural maneuver to force a vote on the resolution, which would terminate the national emergency on fentanyl Trump is using to justify tariffs on Canada.</p> 
  <p>While Trump’s sweeping new tariffs, introduced in a White House Rose Garden ceremony on Wednesday, did not include additional levies on Canada, the Senate vote amounted to a significant bipartisan condemnation of the president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trumps-tariff-war-a-timeline-of-key-announcements-and-events">escalating global trade war</a> with allies and enemies alike.</p> 
  <p>“Tariffs will hurt our families. Canada is not an enemy,” the Democratic senator Tim Kaine, the bill’s sponsor, said in a floor speech on Wednesday. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Let’s not label an ally as an enemy. Let’s not impose punishing costs on American families at a time they can’t afford it. Let’s not hurt American small businesses. Let’s not make our national security investments in ships and subs more expensive.</p>

   <p><em>President Trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. A reciprocal tariff would be zero, not 10%. The administration’s tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations’ partnership. This is not the act of a friend.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Analysis: Trump's wall of tariffs likely to exacerbate economic slowdown</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Donald Trump is finally making good on his campaign promises to “build that wall” – but instead of steel fencing along the Mexican border, it will be constructed from tariffs, and will enclose the entire United States.</p> 
  <p>In his pugnacious and typically rambling speech on the White House lawn on Wednesday, Trump set out plans for across-the-board import taxes, ranging from 10% to more than 40%.</p> 
  <p>The president promised “liberation”, yet the immediate impact is more likely to be rising prices for US shoppers and corrosive uncertainty for firms, exacerbating an economic slowdown that may already be under way.</p> 
  <p>Outside the wall, countries will be affected according to how dependent their economies are on exports to the US – and how exposed they are to the global trading system. For some, it is likely to be devastating.</p> 
  <p>The precise effects of sweeping tariffs on this historic scale are hard to predict. One factor is how rival economies will respond: retaliatory tariffs tend to make a bad situation worse, though they may make short-term political sense (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/canada-liberals-polls-mark-carney">Mark Carney’s poll ratings</a> in Canada).</p> 
  <p>Another question is whether the dollar may appreciate, somewhat softening the blow for US importers. That may limit the effect on prices, which would otherwise be expected to rise as the cost of importing products and materials increases.</p> 
  <p>The main challenge in assessing the exact impact of the plans, though, is that Trump’s statement did not mark the end of the period of profound economic uncertainty that began when he arrived in the White House – quite the opposite.</p>

  <p>Australian prime minister <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> has voiced confusion about the tariffs levied on Norfolk Island, which is an Australian territory.</p>

  <p>Analysts in Seoul said Trump’s extensive rollout of tariffs was harsher than expected, casting a cloud over the export-reliant economy.</p> 
  <p>“For the domestic economy, a significant blow will be inevitable,” said Park Sang-hyun, an economist at iM Securities.</p>

  <p>The US is New Zealand’s fastest growing export market, becoming its second largest in 2024, ahead of Australia and after China. New Zealand exports to the US surpassed NZD $9b in 2024, driven by meat, dairy and wine. The new tariff could mean a NZD $900m bill for New Zealand exporters.</p> 
  <p>McClay said the imposition of tariffs was not unexpected but it would have an impact on New Zealand exporters, some of which may look to other markets. McClay said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Tariff rates anywhere upon New Zealand exporters is not a good thing … but New Zealand exporters are very nimble, and they are very able and very competitive.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>New Zealand would not be looking to retaliate with tariffs on the US, McClay said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That would put up prices on New Zealand consumers, and it would be inflationary.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">How will the EU react?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Strongly. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/01/eu-has-a-strong-plan-to-retaliate-on-trump-tariffs-says-von-der-leyen">EU has already announced a string of tariffs</a> it plans to introduce on US imports targeting steel and aluminium in kind, as well as textiles, leather goods, home appliances, house tools, plastics and wood.</p> 
  <p>Sources say it is also considering nuclear options, including tariffs on revenues generated in the EU by big tech firms and social media.</p> 
  <p>This could be seen as highly provocative and would put Trump’s allies, such as <strong>Elon Musk</strong> and <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>, in the crosshairs. It would also test the unity of the EU, with Ireland expected to argue against more punitive measures because of the dominance of the US tech sector in Dublin.</p> 
  <p>Any action by the EU – which is targeted with a 20-percent tariff rate – “should be proportionate, aimed at defending the interests of our businesses, workers and citizens,” said Irish prime minister <strong>Micheál Martin</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Italian prime minister <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong> on Wednesday called the new US tariffs on the EU “wrong”.</p> 
  <p>The EU’s preference is to negotiate so it has decided to delay countermeasures to open a space for talks. <strong>Maroš Šefčovič</strong>, the European commissioner for trade and economic security, has already met the US commerce secretary, <strong>Howard Lutnick</strong>, and, although Šefčovič reportedly came home last week “empty handed”, he is operating the Brexit playbook, hoping to build a personal relationship that will provide credit in the bank when they get down to talks.</p> 
  <p>EU chief <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> is expected to give a reaction on behalf of the European Commission – which handles trade issues for all 27 countries in the European Union – at around 0300 GMT on Thursday – that’s in three hours – during a visit she is making to Uzbekistan.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump tariff rate 'last seen around 1910'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The US tariff rate on all imports has rocketed to 22% from just 2.5% in 2024 under the new global levies imposed by President Donald Trump, Fitch Ratings’ U.S. economic research chief said on Wednesday. Reuters reports:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“That rate was last seen around 1910,” Olu Sonola, Fitch’s head of US economic research, said in a statement after Trump’s announcement for a global baseline import tax of 10%, but much higher rates for many trading partners.</p> 
   <p>“This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy,” Sonola said. “Many countries will likely end up in a recession. You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Opening summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hello and welcome to our live coverage of reaction to the latest Trump tariffs, which were more aggressive than expected against major US trading partners and which sent shockwaves through global markets.</p> 
  <p>“This is the worst-case scenario that the market was expecting and that’s enough to potentially send the US into a recession,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors.</p> 
  <p>Speaking in the White House Rose Garden against a backdrop of US flags on what he called “Liberation Day”, Trump slapped sweeping 10% tariffs on imports from around the world.</p> 
  <p>He also unveiled particularly stinging tariffs of 34% on China, 20% on the European Union and 24% on Japan, saying they were “nations that treat us badly.”</p> 
  <p>He also hit some of the world’s poorest countries and those struggling with wars and natural disasters: Myanmar, which is embroiled in civil war and which was struck last week by a devastating earthquake, was hit with tariffs of 44% while Sri Lanka was hit with rates of 44%, Bangladesh a rate of 37%, Cambodia 49% and Syria 41%.</p> 
  <p>“For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,” Trump said.</p> 
  <p>Wall Street was closed when Trump made his announcement but the S&amp;P index was down 1.5% in after-hours trading. The dollar fell 1% against the euro as he was speaking, but then recovered.</p> 
  <p>US stock futures fell on the announcement, with S&amp;P 500 E-minis down 3.5%, while the euro was down 0.3%. Markets in Asia are beginning to open now. We’ll bring you all the latest developments as they happen.</p> 
  <p>In the meantime, here’s what you need to know:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>The 10% universal tariff will go into effect on 5 April while the reciprocal tariffs will begin on 9 April.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Special exceptions were made for Canada and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico">Mexico</a>, though the countries were previously targets of proposed broad tariffs. The White House said that goods covered by an existing trade deal with Canada and Mexico will continue to see no tariffs.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump said the US would charge half of the fees he feels trading partners unfairly impose on the US because the US people are “very kind”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump zeroed in on the industry-specific tariffs countries have placed on American exports. In his speech, Trump criticized policies like the EU’s ban on imported chicken, Canadian tariffs on dairy and Japan’s levies on rice.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The new tariffs come on top of a lineup of levies that Trump has already implemented: an additional 20% tariff on all Chinese imports and a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. There is also a 10% tariff on energy imports from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Sweeping auto tariffs of 25% that Trump announced last week are also due to take effect at 12:01 am (0401 GMT) on Thursday.</p></li> 
   <li><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned nations not to impose countermeasures, saying on Fox News: “If you retaliate, there will be escalation.”</p></li> 
   <li><p>Leaders around the world criticised the tariffs, with Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese calling them “totally unwarranted” and his Italian counterpart, Giorgia Meloni, a close Trump ally, saying they were “wrong”.</p></li>
