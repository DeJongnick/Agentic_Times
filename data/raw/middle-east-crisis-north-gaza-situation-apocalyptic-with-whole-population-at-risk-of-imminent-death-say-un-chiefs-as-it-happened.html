At least 43,259 people have been killed in the year-long war in Gaza, according to the territory’s health ministry on Friday, including 55 deaths in the last 24 hours.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The death toll from an Israeli raid in the north of the occupied West Bank has risen to four, according to Palestinian health officials.</strong> The Ramallah-based health ministry said two people were killed by gunfire and two by bombing in the two-day military raid, which ended yesterday. The operation in the Nur Shams refugee camp heavily damaged the offices of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa. </p></li> <li><p><strong>The Israeli military said on Friday it killed senior Hamas official Izz al-Din Kassab in an airstrike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. </strong>Hamas mourned his death, but said he was not a member of its decision-making political office.</p></li> <li><p><strong>At least 2,897 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Lebanon since last October,</strong> according to the latest figures from Lebanon’s health ministry on Friday. The toll includes 30 people killed on Friday. A further 13,150 people have been injured in Lebanon.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israel’s air force continued to bombard Beirut’s southern suburb of Dahiyeh overnight,</strong> destroying dozens of buildings in several neighbourhoods, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said on Friday. Israel has recently intensified its airstrikes on the north-eastern city of Baalbek and nearby villages, and parts of southern Lebanon. </p></li> <li><p><strong>The US asked Lebanon to declare a unilateral ceasefire to revive stalled talks to end hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah,</strong> according to a report later denied by the Lebanese prime minister, <strong>Najib Mikati. </strong>Reports said the US envoy, <strong>Amos Hochstein,</strong> had communicated the proposal to Mikati this week. Mikati’s office said his government’s stance was clear on seeking a ceasefire from both sides and implementation of UN security council resolution 1701, which ended the last round of conflict between Israel and Lebanon in 2006.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A Hamas official said it received a proposal for a short-term truce in Gaza and rejected it for not including a lasting ceasefire. </strong>“The proposals do not include a permanent cessation of aggression, nor do they entail the withdrawal of the Israeli army from the Gaza Strip or the return of displaced persons,” the official, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, told AFP.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The World Health Organization said on Friday that a second round of child polio vaccinations in northern Gaza would begin on Saturday,</strong> after Israeli bombing in the area halted the drive. Separately, the WHO said it is deeply concerned about rising attacks on health care workers and facilities in Lebanon.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A former Israeli intelligence official told CNN there is a “high possibility” that militia groups in Iraq will be used by Iran to carry out a potential retaliatory strike against Israel. </strong>It comes after an Axios report that claimed Israeli intelligence suggested Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days, possibly before the US presidential election on 5 November.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Iran’s supreme leader, said Tehran is likely to increase the range of its ballistic missile. </strong>Kharrazi also indicated that Iran’s nuclear doctrine could change if the nation faced an existential threat. Kharrazi said that Iran has the capability to make a nuclear weapon, but a “fatwa” (ruling) by supreme leader <strong>Ali Khamenei</strong> currently prohibits it.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6725238d8f0869c6d52e468c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-01T18:56:10.772Z">6.56pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The UN’s secretary general, <strong>António Guterres,</strong> has said that the killing of journalists in <strong>Gaza,</strong> which has taken place at levels that are unprecedented in any conflict, was “unacceptable”.</p> <p>“The voices of journalists must be protected and press freedom must be safeguarded,” he said on the sidelines of a UN seminar in Geneva, Al Jazeera reported.</p> <p>In a statement to mark International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists on Saturday, Guterres said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Recent years have seen an alarming rate of fatalities in conflict zones – in particular in Gaza, which has seen the highest number of killings of journalists and media workers in any war in decades.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67251f9c8f080a1fc5f94a5c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-01T18:37:54.123Z">6.37pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Hamas</strong> has confirmed the death of senior official <strong>Izz al-Din Kassab, </strong>after the <strong>Israeli</strong> military<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/nov/01/middle-east-crisis-live-netanyahu-says-ability-to-counter-threats-from-lebanon-key-to-any-ceasefire-deal?page=with:block-67250da18f080a1fc5f94905#block-67250da18f080a1fc5f94905"> said</a> it had killed him in an airstrike in Khan Younis.</p> <p>The group mourned the death of Kassab in a statement on Friday, adding that he was killed along with another Hamas official, <strong>Ayman Ayesh,</strong> in an Israeli attack on their car in Gaza.</p> <p>Hamas sources told Reuters that Kassab was a local group official in Gaza but not a member of its decision-making political office.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-11-01T18:38:07.582Z">at 6.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67251a7c8f080a1fc5f949b4" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-01T18:16:58.649Z">6.16pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>A former <strong>Israeli</strong> intelligence official said there is a “high possibility” that militia groups in <strong>Iraq</strong> will be used by <strong>Iran</strong> to carry out a potential retaliatory strike against Israel.</p> <p><strong>Miri Eisen, </strong>a fellow at the International Institute for Counter-Terrorism, told CNN on Friday:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This would be a way for Iran to retaliate without being held directly responsible, at least in their thinking.</p> </blockquote> <p>It comes after an Axios<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/10/31/israel-iran-planning-attack-iraq"> report</a> that claimed Israeli intelligence suggested Iran is preparing to attack Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days.</p> <p>The Israeli military is “still assessing the decision-making process in Iran” to determine if and when a retaliation will take place,” an Israeli military source told CNN.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67250a0d8f080a1fc5f948de" class="block is-summary" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-01T17:49:40.198Z">5.49pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Summary of the day so far</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>It’s approaching 8pm in Tel Aviv, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> and Beirut.

Lebanon’s prime minister on Wednesday expressed hope that a ceasefire deal was imminent.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Hochstein and McGurk, met the Israeli prime minister on Thursday to talk about a ceasefire proposal for Lebanon</strong>.

In one Bekaa village, eight people were killed from the same family. In northern Israel, seven people were killed by rocket fire from Lebanon, including four Thai agricultural workers.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Israeli army’s evacuation call for several areas of south Lebanon on Thursday included a Palestinian refugee camp</strong>. Among the areas listed was Rashidieh camp, which houses thousands of Palestinian refugees. Israel issued its second evacuation order for the city of Baalbek and two surrounding villages in the Bekaa valley on Thursday afternoon, carrying out a series of airstrikes on the village of Durous a few hours later. The evacuation orders had prompted a mass exodus of residents from the city, which is home to a Unesco world heritage site.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Israeli attacks killed at least one child in Lebanon each day and injured 10 others, the UN children’s agency (Unicef) said. </strong>Citing the Lebanese health ministry, Unicef said 166 children have been killed since October 2023, while at least 1,168 have been injured.
