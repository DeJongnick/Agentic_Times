decades later.</p> <p>A judge has called for more evidence about the woman’s mental health and history of violent offending after noting she later downplayed the tragedy involving her own child, describing it as “one mistake”, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> <p>In the latest incident, the woman approached the nine-year-old girl and her grandmother while they were sitting at a bus stop in Sydney’s south-west in December 2022, grabbing the girl by the arm and attempting to pull her away.</p> <p>The grandmother, who was assaulted during the incident, fought the woman off before the latter fled into a nearby unit complex.</p> <p>The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to attempting to take a child, common assault and resisting arrest.</p> <p>During a sentence hearing in Sydney’s Downing Centre district court on Wednesday, Judge <strong>David Wilson</strong> raised concerns about the woman’s risk to the community if she were to be released.</p> <p>The woman has a history of schizophrenia and has previously been hospitalised for drug-induced psychosis, the court was told.</p> <p>Wilson raised issue with the now 49-year-old’s response to the death of her daughter in October 2003, over which she pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to five years in jail.</p> <p>The woman placed her daughter in the scalding hot bath which left her with serious burns to about 75% of her body.</p> <p>Wilson adjourned Wednesday’s sentence hearing to organise further evidence about the woman’s ongoing mental health and facts regarding her

Australians aged 55 or over are neither poor enough to qualify for effective and accessible housing assistance nor wealthy enough to secure housing independently as they age, a new report from Swinburne has revealed.</p> <p>This significant gap in Australia’s housing system has been deemed the “missing middle”: a group that is supposed to be enjoying retirement but is instead struggling to access safe, affordable housing.</p> <p>About 60% of the cohort are living in private rentals where they face barriers to making needed modifications, such as installing handrails to support them. They are also receiving commonwealth rent assistance and lack sufficient superannuation, so are struggling financially in the private market.</p> <p>About 25% are living in mortgaged homes, which exposes older purchasers living on fixed incomes to mortgage stress.</p> <p>The executive officer at the Housing for the Aged Action Group (which funded the research), <strong>Fiona York,</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>Every day, we hear from older people who fall into this gap – and we find it very difficult to assist them. Precarious housing is leaving large numbers of older people vulnerable to a housing crisis, yet they remain completely absent from any targeted policy solutions.</em></p> <p><em>A diversity of solutions is needed. The research raises further questions about what can be done to intervene early to prevent homelessness for the half a million older people currently at risk.</em></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-10-16T06:22:20.840Z">at 7.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-670f4b738f08ff54487be054" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-10-16T05:20:28.691Z">6.20am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Israel should heed US calls on Gaza humanitarian aid,</strong> <strong>Coalition says</strong></p> <p><strong>Simon Birmingham</strong>, the shadow foreign affairs minister, says Israel should “heed” the US’s calls to allow additional humanitarian aid to be sent into Gaza or face a possible suspension of military aid by mid-November.</p> <p>Speaking with the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, he said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Nobody could quibble or doubt the commitment the US has shown to supporting Israel and its legitimate fight to remove the terrorist threats of Hamas and Hezbollah from its doorstep, and indeed the Coalition has been rock solid in our position there.</p> <p>The US [is] equally providing practical support for Israel’s defence, notably against missile strikes from Iran … The humanitarian situation in Gaza is real and clearly US intelligence and analysis is far deeper than what I would have available to me, and given the strength of messages that US administration is giving to Israel, I think they are messages that should be heeded, should be enacted upon and it is critical to see that humanitarian assistance flow into Gaza in accordance with those requests.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-10-16T05:26:46.295Z">at 6.26am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-670f47388f08ff54487be038" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-10-16T05:07:10.709Z">6.07am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Human remains found in Victorian bushland in search for Jake Bradford</strong></p> <p>Police in regional Victoria have located suspected human remains as part of their investigation into the disappearance of <strong>Jake Bradford</strong>.</p> <p>In a statement, Victoria police said the remains were yet to be formally identified and were found in remote bushland in the town of Dollar on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>Detectives travelled to the site this morning and a postmortem would be carried out on the remains.</p> <p>Bradford, 21, from Rosebud, was reported missing by his mother on 29 January 2023.</p> <p>Investigators believe he was last seen when he became involved in an altercation in the Dollar area on or about 24 January 2023.</p> <p>In March 2023, a 25-year-old Korumburra man was charged with murder and was remanded to appear at the supreme court of Victoria in February.</p> <p>Det Acting Supt <strong>Mark Burnett</strong> from the force’s serious crime division said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Our heartfelt thoughts are with Jake’s family and friends today, on what would have been Jake’s 23rd birthday.
