<h2>Pick of the week<br>Mistresses</h2> <p>Jameela Jamil and Dr Kate Lister host <a href="https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Mistresses-with-Jameela-Jamil-Dr-Kate-Lister-Audiobook/B0FDGSP5T2">this podcast</a> dedicated to the untold tales behind “history’s so-called sidechicks”, with interludes from TikTok’s History Gossip, AKA Katie Kennedy. If you prefer a more strait-laced approach then this isn’t the show for you: it’s a tongue-in-cheek riot, kicking off with Louis XIV’s paramour Madame de Montespan, and her fall from grace via a poisoning scandal. <em>Hannah J Davies</em><br><em>Audible, all episodes out now</em></p> <h2>Trapped History</h2>    <p>“People are trapped in history and history is trapped in them,” said James Baldwin. This podcast aims to tease out those often unspoken histories, and is now on its fifth series. It begins with <a href="https://trappedhistory.com/helen-bamber">a frank conversation</a> with broadcaster Nihal Arthanayake on the work of human rights campaigner Helen Bamber. <em>HJD</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p> <h2>Shadow World: The Grave Robbers</h2> <p>In this <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002f9bn">troubling series</a>, journalist Sue Mitchell – who has previously investigated power of attorney arrangements for the Shadow World series – meets families who have had their inheritances pilfered by gangs using fake wills. Stealing from strangers’ estates is, it seems, the tip of the iceberg for the criminals running such scams. <em>HJD</em><br><em>BBC Sounds, first episode out now, then weekly from Wednesday 9 July</em></p> <h2>The Making of a Fugitive</h2>    <p>It isn’t heartstoppingly tense true crime, but if you’re interested in the psychology of why criminals do the things they do, then BBC Radio Wales’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds">podcast</a> will likely appeal (Richard Harrington narrates). Why go on the run? And how bad is it, really? As one former conman attests, “the truth is – it was really awesome”. <em>HJD</em><br><em>BBC Sounds, episodes weekly</em></p> <h2>State of Terror</h2> <p>Twenty years ago this week, fear and panic rippled across London, and the UK at large, following four suicide bombings in the capital. This <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live/bbc_radio_fourfm">new series</a> sees the BBC’s Dominic Casciani consider how 7/7 changed the face of counterterrorism – and how it must change once again to keep up with developing threats. <em>HJD</em><br><em>Monday 7 July, 11am, Radio 4</em></p>
