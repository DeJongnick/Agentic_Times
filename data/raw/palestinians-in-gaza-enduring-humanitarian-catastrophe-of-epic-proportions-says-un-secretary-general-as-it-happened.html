 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>At least 60,034 Palestinian people have been killed and 145,870 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.</strong> At least 113 Palestinian people were killed and 637 others injured in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said, despite the Israeli military pause in parts of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> Strip.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Famine is “now unfolding” in Gaza, with thousands of children malnourished and hunger-related deaths on the rise among the youngest, a UN-backed monitor <a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ipcinfo/docs/IPC_GazaStrip_Alert_July2025.pdf">has said in an alert.</a></strong> The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said that airdrops over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> will not avert the “humanitarian catastrophe” unfolding across the territory.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A trickle of aid into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> Strip must become an ocean, the UN secretary-general António Guterres said, adding that the IPC famine alert “confirms what we have feared”, that Gaza is on the brink of famine.</strong> “The facts are in – and they are undeniable,” <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165517">he said in a statement</a>. “Palestinians in Gaza are enduring a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions. This is not a warning. It is a reality unfolding before our eyes.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Britain will recognise the state of Palestine in September unless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the “appalling situation” in Gaza and meets other conditions, </strong>British prime minister Keir Starmer told cabinet on Tuesday according to a government statement.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>David Lammy, the British foreign secretary, spoke at the UN conference on a two-state solution for the Middle East. </strong>He said “the two-state solution is in peril”. He says Arthur Balfour, a previous British foreign secretary, signed the declaration that paved the way for the foundation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump and Keir Starmer will have “failed humanity” if they do not act to stop the famine in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, Oxfam has said. </strong>An spokesperson for the charity described the escalating crisis as a “humanitarian catastrophe” and added that “urgent, forceful diplomacy” is required.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), has reacted to the IPC famine alert.</strong> <a href="https://x.com/UNLazzarini/status/1950156798314303672">In a post on X</a>, he said the famine is “entirely man-made”, adding that the only way to “reverse this catastrophe is to flood Gaza with a massive scale up of aid”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Awdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian activist and journalist who helped make the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, has been killed during an attack by Israeli settlers in the south Hebron hills.</strong> The attack on Monday was captured on video, which appears to show an Israeli settler, Yinon Levi, who was put under sanctions by the US president, Joe Biden, then removed from the sanctions list by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, firing his gun wildly at the time of the killing.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>German chancellor Friedrich Merz said that two of the country’s aircraft could fly aid airdrop missions from Jordan to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> as soon as Wednesday, calling the help a small but important signal. </strong>“This work may only make a small contribution to humanitarian aid, but it sends an important signal: We are here, we are in the region,” said Merz at a press conference alongside Jordan’s King Abdullah in Berlin.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The European Commission has proposed partially suspending <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> from its flagship £80bn Horizon science research programme over what officials called a “severe” humanitarian crisis in Gaza. </strong>It comes amid worldwide condemnation of Israel’s actions in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> including demands by Donald Trump that it must do more to stop the “real starvation”. On Tuesday, the leading international authority on food crises, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, said the “worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out” in Gaza.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>France will airdrop aid into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> “in coming days”, a diplomatic source has told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency.</strong> “France will carry out airdrops in the coming days to meet the most essential and urgent needs of the civilian population in Gaza,” the source said as they urged for “an immediate opening by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> of the land crossing points”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Dutch government has imposed travel bans on two far-right Israeli politicians, national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, both central figures in Benjamin Netanyahu’s fragile coalition.</strong> They will no longer be allowed to enter the Netherlands, which accuses them of repeatedly inciting violence against Palestinian people and calling for an “ethnic cleansing” of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> strip.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Gaza has teetered on the brink of famine for two years, but recent developments have “dramatically worsened” the situation, including “increasingly stringent blockades” by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>.</strong> A formal famine declaration, which is rare, requires the kind of data that the lack of access to Gaza and mobility within has largely denied. The IPC has only declared famine a few times — in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan’s western Darfur region last year.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> on Monday told Israel to allow “every ounce of food” into Gaza as he acknowledged for the first time that there is “real starvation” in the region.</strong> During a visit to Britain, the US president contradicted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> after the Israeli prime minister claimed it was a “bold-faced lie” to say Israel was causing hunger in Gaza.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Gaza’s health ministry said on Monday that hospitals in the Strip had recorded 14 new deaths in the past 24 hours due to famine and malnutrition.</strong> This brought the total number of deaths due to malnutrition to 147, including 88<strong> </strong>children, since the start of the war in 2023.</p></li>

  <p><strong>The UK and Jordan have air-dropped 20 tonnes of aid to Gaza in recent days, David Lammy has said.</strong></p> 
  <p>“We have to have those trucks get in,” the foreign secretary told reporters in New York. “And our assessment is that 25 trucks went in, I think on Sunday, perhaps up to 35.</p> 
  <p>“Just in this last period, we have delivered 20 tonnes of aid with our Jordanian friends into northern Gaza in terms of air drops to alleviate the suffering and obviously to ensure that those air drops landed safely in a clear path.</p> 
  <p>“But that will not ease the suffering that we are seeing, the malnourishment that now is widespread, and the fear of starvation that is a global concern.</p> 
  <p>“And so the United Kingdom working with partners, and you’ve seen us working with our Arab partners, but obviously working alongside France and Saudi Arabia today, we are all attempting to bring an end to this suffering.”</p>

  <p><strong>David Lammy, the British foreign secretary, is speaking now at the UN conference on a two-state solution for the Middle East.</strong></p> 
  <p>He says “the two-state solution is in peril”. He says Arthur Balfour, a previous British foreign secretary, signed the declaration that paved the way for the foundation of Israel. The UK is proud of that.</p> 
  <p>But the declaration also said nothing would be done that would prejudice the rights of Palestinians, he says. That has not been upheld, he says.</p> 
  <p>He says the UN has passed many resolutions calling for a two-state solution. He recites the numbers of those resolutions, and says they cannot just be numbers on a page.</p> 
  <p>Hamas cannot be rewarded for the 7 October attack, he says.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>But Hamas are not the Palestinian people and there is no contradiction between support for Israel’s security and support for Palestinian statehood.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Indeed, the opposite is true.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Lammy goes on:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>The Netanyahu government’s rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It’s wrong morally and it’s wrong strategically. It harms the interests of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution.</em></p> 
   <p><em>And so it is with the hand of history on our shoulders that His Majesty’s government therefore intends to recognise the state of Palestine when the UN general assembly gathers in September here.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Lammy says it is the government’s intention to recognise the state of Palestine when the UN general assembly meets in September. He gets a round of applause – before he has mentioned the conditions.</p> 
  <p>Once the applause has died down, Lammy cites the conditions mentioned by Starmer.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>We will do this unless the Israeli government acts to end the appalling situation in Gaza, ends its military campaign and commits to a long sustainable peace based on a two-state solution.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Our demands on Hamas also remain absolute and unwavering.</em></p>

  <p>“He reiterated that there is no equivalence between Israel and Hamas and that our demands on Hamas remain, that they must release all the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, accept that they will play no role in the government of Gaza, and disarm.”</p>

   <p>This is the acknowledgement of a humanitarian catastrophe.

We must see an end to the genocide, opened borders, and the secure the release of hostages and detainees on both sides.</p> 
   <p>Airdrops and brief pauses for meagre deliveries of aid are nowhere near enough to prevent starvation and death on the scale the world is now witnessing. Only urgent, forceful diplomacy will achieve an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, break Israel’s siege, and allow lifesaving aid to flow freely and safely.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Death toll from Israeli attacks on Gaza surpasses 60,000, says health ministry</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>At least 60,034 Palestinian people have been killed and 145,870 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>At least 113 Palestinian people were killed and 637 others injured in the last 24 hours alone, the ministry said, despite the Israeli military pause in parts of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> Strip.</p> 
  <p>Gaza’s health ministry added in its Telegram post:</p>

   <p><em>World leaders have been variously divided, complicit, uncaring, and collectively ineffectual in stopping Israel’s campaign of erasure.

   <p><em>Air drops, and brief pauses for relative crumbs of aid, is nowhere near enough to prevent human death at an unimaginable scale.

   <p><em>NGOs say these steps may ease aid access, but with mass starvation already under way, far more is needed. In particular, humanitarian groups have called for a full ceasefire in order to get civilians the help they need.</em></p> 
   <p><em>“We have to go back to the levels we had during the ceasefire, 500-600 trucks of aid every day managed by the UN, including Unrwa, that our teams would distribute in 400 distribution points,” said Juliette Touma, the Unrwa director of communications.</em></p> 
   <p><em>She explained that aid agencies had previously walked Gaza back from the brink of starvation and that to do so again, an unimpeded flow of aid would be needed to “reverse the tide and trajectory of famine”.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Awdah Hathaleen, a Palestinian activist and journalist who helped make the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, has been killed during an attack by Israeli settlers in the south Hebron hills.</p> 
  <p>The attack on Monday was captured on video, which appears to show an Israeli settler, Yinon Levi, who was put under sanctions by the US president, Joe Biden, then removed from the sanctions list by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, firing his gun wildly at the time of the killing.</p> 
  <p>He was arrested later by Israeli police for questioning, though no charges have been filed against him.</p>

  <p>The killing comes amid an increasing wave of settler and Israeli military violence against Palestinians in the occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>. At least 1,009 Palestinians have been killed and more than 7,000 injured in the West Bank since October 2023.</p> 
  <p>Accountability for settlers who commit acts of violence against Palestinians is rare.</p> 
  <p>According to activists from the village of Umm al-Khair in the West Bank, where the shooting took place, the killing happened after a settler in a bulldozer drove through their land, destroying trees and property.</p>

  <p>The Dutch government has imposed travel bans on two far-right Israeli politicians, national security minister <strong>Itamar Ben-Gvir</strong> and finance minister <strong>Bezalel Smotrich</strong>, both central figures in Benjamin Netanyahu’s fragile coalition.</p> 
  <p>They will no longer be allowed to enter the Netherlands, which accuses them of repeatedly inciting violence against Palestinian people and calling for an “ethnic cleansing” of the Gaza strip.</p> 
  <p>Smotrich has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/29/israel-new-settlements-occupied-west-bank-palestinian-state">approved the expansion of West Bank settlements</a> and campaigned against humanitarian aid in Gaza, saying in May that he would allow “not even a grain of wheat” to enter the war zone.</p> 
  <p>He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/hamas-israel-hunger-war-in-gaza">said on 6 May</a> that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed, civilians will be sent to … the south to a humanitarian zone without Hamas or terrorism, and from there they will start to leave in great numbers to third countries”.</p> 
  <p>Ben-Gvir, a hardline Jewish settler from the occupied West Bank who has advocated for the deportation of all Arab citizens, has been an integral part of Netanyahu’s coalition since 2022, and has threatened to leave his side should the war in Gaza end.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s ambassador to the Netherlands, Modi Ephraim, will be summoned for a meeting with the Dutch foreign minister Caspar Veldkamp “to call on the Netanyahu government to change course,” and to “remind Israel to comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">What is the technical definition of famine?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Lizzy Davies is the Guardian’s European news editor</em></p> 
  <p>In 2004, the UN’s <a href="https://www.fao.org/europeanunion/eu-projects/ipc/en/">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> developed the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), as a <a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/">tracking tool for global hunger</a>. It has become the primary means of identifying famine, with a sliding scale from phase 1 (no or minimal food insecurity) to phase 5 (catastrophe or famine).</p> 
  <p>It <a href="https://www.ipcinfo.org/famine-facts/en/">defines a famine</a> as an extreme deprivation of food where “starvation, death, destitution and extremely critical levels of acute malnutrition are or will likely be evident”.</p> 
  <p>To meet the criteria, an area will have at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food, at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition, and two people for every 10,000 a day dying “due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease”.</p> 
  <p>If a number of households are experiencing famine conditions but not at the required level (20% of the population), or if local malnutrition or mortality levels have not reached the required thresholds for famine, those households will be put in the IPC phase-5 catastrophe category, even if the area as a whole is not in phase-5 famine.</p>

  <p>During a visit to Britain, the US president contradicted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> after the Israeli prime minister claimed it was a “bold-faced lie” to say Israel was causing hunger in Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Trump is under increasing pressure to intervene in the humanitarian crisis, with dozens of Palestinians having died of hunger in recent weeks in a crisis attributed by the UN and other humanitarian organisations to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>’s blockade of almost all aid into the territory…</p>

  <p>Asked whether he agreed with this assessment, Trump said: “I don’t know. Based on television, I would say not particularly, because those children look very hungry.”</p> 
  <p>He later added: “We can save a lot of people, I mean some of those kids. That’s real starvation; I see it and you can’t fake that. So we’re going to be even more involved.”</p> 
  <p>Asked what he would ask Netanyahu for next time they spoke, Trump said: “We’re giving money and we’re giving food, but we’re over here … I want him to make sure they get the food. I want to make sure they get the food, every ounce of food.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We are continuing our live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza as international pressure on Israel to allow more aid into the territory continues to grow amid reports of widespread starvation and malnutrition.</p> 
  <p><strong>Médecins Sans Frontières</strong> (MSF) has condemned the use of airdrops to deliver desperately needed aid to Gaza, calling the approach “futile” and “cynical”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Jean Guy Vataux</strong>, MSF’s emergency coordinator in Gaza, called for Israel to allow for the full access of humanitarian aid that he says is ready to be delivered across the border by road.</p> 
  <p>He warned that airdrops are “notoriously ineffective and dangerous” as they can’t carry much aid and can injure (or even kill) people when they are dropped.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://x.com/MSF/status/1949878720447095147">In a post on X</a>, Vataux wrote:</p>

   <p><em>All that is needed is for Israeli authorities to decide to facilitate its arrival - expedite the clearance procedures, allow the entry of goods at scale, and coordinate to permit safe collection and delivery. Only then can we begin to resolve the starvation we are seeing …</em></p> 
   <p><em>At the moment, two million people are trapped in a tiny piece of land, which makes up just 12 per cent of the whole Strip - if anything lands in this area, people will inevitably be injured.</em></p> 
   <p><em>On the other hand, if the airdrops land in areas where Israel has issued displacement orders, people will be forced to enter militarised zones – once again risking their lives for food.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Israel says more than 200 aid trucks were collected and distributed yesterday by aid agencies, and that an additional 260 trucks entered Gaza and are awaiting collection.</p> 
  <p>This is in addition to airdrops carried out by Jordan, the UAE and Israel, which parachuted aid packages into the territory for the first time in months over the weekend. Charities say this aid is totally inadequate for the needs of Gaza’s population. </p>
