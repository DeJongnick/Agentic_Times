<p>PFAS, sometimes called “forever chemicals”, are a group of thousands of chemicals that are used for their non-stick and water-resistant properties. They are used in everyday items like non-stick frying pans, waterproof mascaras, stain-resistant clothing and the packaging for takeaway food items. PFAS can take thousands of years to break down in landfills, and pose harms to human health. Reducing PFAS exposure is challenging but possible.</p> <p>Here’s our guide, compiled from across the Guardian’s reporting, to forever chemicals.</p> <h2>What are PFAS?</h2> <p>PFAS stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. It is an umbrella term for a family of thousands of chemicals that are prized for their indestructible and non-stick properties. There are at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/23/what-are-pfas-forever-chemicals-how-toxic-are-they-and-how-do-you-become-exposed">12,000 chemicals</a> that are considered PFAS.</p> <h2>Are PFAS the same thing as ‘forever chemicals’?</h2> <p>Yes. PFAS are referred to as “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/what-are-pfas-forever-chemicals-what-risk-toxicity">forever chemicals</a>” because they don’t naturally break down once the product containing the chemical is thrown away. They can take hundreds or even thousands of years to degrade, which means if they leak in soil or water, PFAS can remain there for centuries.</p> <h2>Are they the same thing as microplastics?</h2> <p>No, PFAS and microplastics are not the same thing. Microplastics are tiny shards and specks of plastics less than 5mm in diameter. However, like PFAS, the problem of microplastics is widespread: studies have found them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/21/microplastics-brain-pollution-health">in nearly every body part</a>, including the lungs, placenta, testicles, liver, kidneys, joints and blood vessels. The health hazards of microplastics in the body aren’t well known, but animal studies have shown a link to fertility issues and various cancers, among other things.</p> <h2>What are PFAS used for?</h2> <p>PFAS have been used in manufacturing and added to consumer products for decades. They are used across dozens of industries and in a huge range of consumer products because they are so effective at making items resistant to water, stains and grease. Your non-stick frying pan, for example, probably uses PFAS to make the “non-stick” coating.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/pfas-everyday-products-toxics-guide">PFAS can be found in</a> non-stick cookware, fire retardants, stain and water repellents, some furniture, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/26/water-resistant-products-toxic-pfas-study">waterproof clothes</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/07/pfas-forever-chemicals-children-textiles">children’s textiles</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/pfas-everyday-products-toxics-guide">pizza boxes</a> and takeout containers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/17/pfas-forever-chemicals-food-containers-study">food packaging</a>, carpets and textiles, rubbers and plastics, electronics and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/23/pfas-testing-forever-chemicals-household-water-cat">dental floss</a>.</p>    <p>However, they can take hundreds, if not thousands, of years to break down after they are thrown away – which means it’s possible they can leak into the soil or water and remain there for centuries.</p> <h2>Are PFAS harmful?</h2> <p>PFAS are everywhere. While there is concern about these chemicals, the biggest risk and strongest predictor of having high levels of PFAS in your body appears to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/25/what-are-pfas-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-forever-chemicals-surrounding-us-every-day">living in proximity to contaminated water</a>.</p> <p>Regular exposure to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/02/kitchen-toxic-chemicals-pfas-how-to-avoid#:~:text=Regular%20exposure%20to%20the%20galaxy,a%20good%20place%20to%20start.">galaxy of chemicals</a> we encounter in our daily lives potentially poses health hazards, but about 90,000 human-made chemicals now exist, and we simply don’t know how daily exposure to them affects our health.</p> <p>A shorthand for the properties of some PFAS is PBT: persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Some chemicals classed as PFAS have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/15/outdoor-clothing-brands-still-using-forever-chemicals-despite-health-risk">linked to health problems</a> including high cholesterol, fertility issues, immune system disorders, kidney disease, birth defects, some cancers and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/16/epa-pfas-emissions">a range of other serious health problems.</a></p> <h2>Are PFAS in water?</h2> <p>Yes. PFAS can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/25/what-are-pfas-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-forever-chemicals-surrounding-us-every-day">get into drinking water</a> through discharge from manufacturing plants, the use of certain firefighting foams at, for example, airports or military bases near water sources, or runoff from landfill sites.</p> <h2>How to avoid PFAS</h2> <p>It’s almost impossible to avoid PFAS – they lurk in almost every aspect of daily life. Avoiding them altogether is a challenge, but cutting down on their presence is possible with some broad rules. When it comes to making PFAS-free swaps, avoid just throwing away products immediately – instead, replace each product at the end of its life cycle. It may give you peace of mind to swap everything at once, but it can be harmful to the planet since PFAS can leak from products into the landfill. That spreads forever chemicals into the nearby environment.</p>    <p><strong>In the kitchen: </strong>For almost every <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/02/kitchen-toxic-chemicals-pfas-how-to-avoid">plastic kitchen product</a>, there is a safer wood, borosilicate glass or stainless steel alternative, though those come with caveats. Avoid non-stick coatings – they are one of the most common sources of forever chemicals. Be wary of marketing terms like “eco”, “green” or “nontoxic”, as they have no legal definition.</p> <p><strong>In your food: </strong>Although it’s not a settled question, food is probably the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/22/pfas-forever-chemicals-diet">largest exposure route for PFAS</a>. No food is totally safe from contamination because PFAS are used across thousands of consumer products and industrial processes, pollution is widespread and there are myriad entry points in the food system.</p> <p>Processed foods tend to have more PFAS than less processed foods, research suggests, and those who generally eat diets higher in fresh fruits and vegetables may have lower PFAS blood levels. One caveat is that some vegetables – especially leafy greens – take up the chemicals, and those grown near sources of PFAS pollution or in sewage sludge are likely to be contaminated.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/25/can-i-eradicate-toxic-forever-chemicals-from-my-home">They’re in pans, fruit, dust – and even tap water. But can I eradicate toxic forever chemicals from my home?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Takeout packaging like pizza boxes, plastic wrapping or bags can carry PFAS. Some people bring their own glass containers when eating out, to avoid the toxic packaging. A simple test can help detect forever chemicals in packaging materials. Apply a drop of olive oil on to the packaging: if it beads instead of spreading, that’s a sign of PFAS.</p> <p><strong>In your water: </strong>Drinking water can be filtered with a jug, but not all filters remove PFAS. The well-known brand <a href="https://www.epicwaterfilters.com/blogs/quick-drips/does-brita-filter-pfas">Brita removes around 66% of PFAS</a>; a <a href="https://www.zerowater.eu/zerowater-tested/">ZeroWater</a> filter claims to remove 94.9% of PFAS. Reverse osmosis filters can work to remove contaminants, but they are often bulky and expensive.</p> <p>Boiling water doesn’t remove PFAS, so to be hyper-vigilant use filtered water for coffee, tea or for cooking things like pasta. Some states require routine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/24/four-ways-avoid-pfas-water">water testing</a>, but there is no federal limit in drinking water. DIY kits are available, but it’s best to find a certified lab using the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/dwlabcert">EPA’s website</a>.</p> <p><strong>In your beauty products: </strong>PFAS are used in many beauty products as they help make products more durable, spreadable or waterproof. When buying products, look for those explicitly labeled “PFAS-free” or check the website for the brand. If the product has an ingredient list, try to avoid PTFE, a subgroup of PFAS, or ingredients that contain fluoro, as they are probably PFAS. Some beauty companies make products that are <a href="https://www.ewg.org/withoutintentionallyaddedpfaspfc">PFAS-free</a>.</p> <p><strong>In your clothing: </strong>The most likely PFAS culprits in this category are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/may/25/can-i-eradicate-toxic-forever-chemicals-from-my-home">waterproof or water-resistant items</a>, which are likely to use forever chemicals to repel water or stains. Generally speaking, wearing natural fibers is a good way to avoid PFAS.</p> <h2>Can PFAS be absorbed through the skin?</h2>    <p>A June study from the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2024/new-study-confirms-forever-chemicals-are-absorbed-through-human-skin-1">University of Birmingham</a> found PFAS can “permeate the skin barrier and reach the body’s bloodstream” and at higher levels than previously thought. It’s already known that PFAS can enter the body in other ways, such as by being ingested.</p>
