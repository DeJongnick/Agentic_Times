<p>A German court has convicted four former Volkswagen managers of fraud and given two of them prison sentences for their part in the “dieselgate” emissions test-cheating scandal that erupted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/sep/23/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-explained-diesel-cars">almost a decade ago</a>.</p> <p>The former head of development Heinz-Jakob Neusser received a suspended jail term of one year and three months from the court in the city of Braunschweig, according to the news agency Bloomberg.</p> <p>A former head of drive electronics, named only as Hanno J, was given a sentence of two years and seven months, German media reported.</p> <p>The heaviest sentence, of four years and six months, was given to the former head of diesel motor development Jens H, while the fourth defendant was given a suspended sentence of one year and 10 months. The defendants can appeal against the rulings.</p> <p>The scandal began in September 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of violation saying Volkswagen had rigged engine control software that enabled diesel cars to pass emissions tests while emitting far more pollution in actual driving.</p> <p>The company has paid more than $33bn (£24bn) in fines and compensation to vehicle owners. Two VW managers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/dec/06/oliver-schmidt-jailed-volkswagen-emissions-scam-seven-years">received prison sentences in the US</a>. The former head of the company’s Audi division Rupert Stadler was given a suspended sentence of 21 months and a fine of €1.1m (£920,000); his sentence is still subject to appeal.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/03/martin-winterkorn-ex-volkswagen-boss-at-heart-of-dieselgate-scandal-appears-in-court-for-first-time">Ex-Volkswagen boss goes on trial over ‘dieselgate’ scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The four found guilty on Monday, who have been on trial since 2021, were initially to have their cases heard alongside that of the former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/sep/03/martin-winterkorn-ex-volkswagen-boss-at-heart-of-dieselgate-scandal-appears-in-court-for-first-time">Proceedings against him</a> have been suspended because of his health issues, and it is not clear when he might go on trial.
