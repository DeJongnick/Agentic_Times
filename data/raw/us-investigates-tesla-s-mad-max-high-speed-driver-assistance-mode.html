<h1>US investigates Tesla’s ‘Mad Max’ high-speed driver assistance mode</h1>

<p>The US main transportation safety regulator said on Friday it was seeking information from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla">Tesla</a> about a new driver assistance mode dubbed “Mad Max” that operates at higher speeds than other versions.</p> 
<p>Some drivers on social media report that Tesla vehicles using the more aggressive version of its full <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/29/elon-musk-tesla-robotaxi">self-driving (FSD) system</a> could operate above posted speed limits.</p> 
<p>“We are going 75 in a 50, I feel like we are racing down the street right now,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCYklwKiExc">one YouTuber said.</a></p> 
<p>“NHTSA is in contact with the manufacturer to gather additional information,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said in a statement. “The human behind the wheel is fully responsible for driving the vehicle and complying with all traffic safety laws.”</p> 
<p>The NHTSA earlier this month opened an investigation into 2.9m Tesla vehicles equipped with its full self-driving system due to the dozens of reports of traffic-safety violations and crashes.</p> 
<p>The NHTSA said in opening the investigation it was reviewing 58 reports of issues involving traffic safety violations when using FSD, including 14 crashes and 23 injuries.</p>

<p>Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but last week reposted a social media post that described Mad Max mode as accelerating and weaving “through traffic at an incredible pace, all while still being super smooth. It drives your car like a sports car. If you are running late, this is the mode for you.”</p> 
<p>The NHTSA said earlier this month that FSD – an assistance system that requires drivers to pay attention and intervene if needed – has “induced vehicle behavior that violated traffic safety laws”.</p> 
<p>The agency said it had six reports in which a Tesla vehicle, operating with full self-driving engaged, “approached an intersection with a red traffic signal, continued to travel into the intersection against the red light and was subsequently involved in a crash with other motor vehicles”.</p> 
<p>Tesla says FSD “will drive you almost anywhere with your active supervision, requiring minimal intervention” but does not make the car self-driving.</p> 
<p>Autonomous driving is a crucial aspect of the electric auto behemoth’s business plan. Musk emphasized these efforts after a third-quarter report that saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/22/tesla-earnings-report-latest-drop-profits">record vehicle sales but a 37% drop in profits</a>.</p> 
<p>Tesla’s full self-driving, which is more advanced than its autopilot system, has been under investigation by the NHTSA for a year. In October 2024, the NHTSA <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/18/tesla-self-driving-car-investigation">opened</a> an investigation into 2.4m Tesla vehicles with FSD after four collisions in conditions of reduced roadway visibility. The Washington Post had previously reported the agency’s interest in the Mad Max mode.</p> 
<p>The NHTSA investigation is one component of wider friction between Musk and the Trump administration, where the tech billionaire used to play a central role. Musk’s ire is often directed towards heads of the agencies tasked with regulating his companies. Most recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/21/elon-musk-sean-duffy-nasa">Musk criticized Sean Duffy</a>, Trump’s transportation secretary and acting Nasa administrator, as knowing “absolutely ZERO about rockets &amp; spacecraft”.</p> 
<p>Musk’s comments came on the heels of Duffy announcing that Musk’s rocket company, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/20/nasa-moon-program-elon-musk-spacex">Space X, had “fallen behind”</a>, and that Nasa was opening up contracts for its crewed lunar Artemis program.</p>
