<p>Since declaring his support for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> in July of last year and subsequently spending more than $250m on his re-election effort, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> has rapidly accumulated political influence and positioned himself at the heart of the new administration. Now as prominent as the president himself, Musk has begun to make use of that power, making decisions that could affect the health of millions of people, gaining access to highly sensitive personal data, and attacking anyone who opposes him. Musk, the world’s richest man and an unelected official, has achieved an astonishing level of power over the federal government.</p> <p>Over the weekend, workers with Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) clashed with civil servants over demands for unfettered access to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/federal-employee-lawsuit-musk-doge">computer systems</a> of major US government agencies in a breakneck series of confrontations. When the dust settled, several top officials who opposed the takeover had been pushed out, and Musk’s allies had gained control.</p> <p>Musk, with the backing of Trump, is now working to shut down the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/usaid-officials-put-on-leave-musk-doge">US Agency for International Development</a> (USAid) – the world’s largest single supplier of humanitarian aid. He bragged on Sunday about “feeding USAid into the wood chipper”. He has also targeted several other agencies in an aggressive attempt to purge and remake the federal government along ideological lines, while avoiding congressional or judicial oversight.</p> <p>Many of Musk’s actions have taken place without forewarning or transparency, sowing chaos and confusion among the thousands of people employed at the agencies like USAid that he has gone after. Humanitarian organizations that rely on US funding have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/usaid-contractors-fire-staff-face-cash-crunch-trump-causes-chaos-aid-world-2025-02-04/">halted operations</a> and laid off staff, while government workers have been locked out of their offices. He is operating Doge as an unofficial government department with no congressionally approved mandate while he technically <a href="https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-donald-trump-doge-21153a742fbad86284369bb173ec343c">holds the position</a> of “special government employee”, which allows him to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/04/elon-musk-special-government-employee-meaning/">sidestep financial disclosures</a> and a public vetting process.</p>    <p>Musk has gleefully posted on X, the social media platform that he owns, throughout the chaos. He has accused USAid of corruption, and of being a “criminal organization” and “radical-left political psy op”, without any evidence. Why? He tweeted an explanation of simply doing Trump’s bidding: “All @DOGE did was check to see which federal organizations were violating the @POTUS executive orders the most. Turned out to be USAID, so that became our focus.” He said it was “time for it to die”.</p> <p>Musk also suggested that opposition to his team will be punished, reposting a letter sent to him from the Trump-appointed federal prosecutor for Washington DC, who vowed to “pursue any and all legal action against anyone who impedes your work or threatens your people”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/us-federal-workers-trump-elon-musk">‘It’s been madness’: US federal workers reeling over Trump-Musk takeover</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The New York Democratic senator Chuck Schumer wrote on Tuesday morning: “An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government. DOGE is not a real government agency. DOGE has no authority to shut programs down or to ignore federal law.” Musk responded that the reaction was “hysterical”.</p> <p>As other Democrats and government oversight groups began to respond to the breakneck series of actions from Musk’s team, on Tuesday the Tesla and SpaceX CEO continued to plow ahead with his cuts and told his supporters: “We’re never going to get another chance like this.”</p> <h2>Musk takes over federal agencies</h2> <p>Immediately following Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, the president issued an executive order establishing Musk’s “department of government efficiency”. Rather than create an entirely new entity, the order renamed the US Digital Service, which was previously tasked with updating government IT systems, and brought the rechristened bureau into the executive office of the president.</p> <p>Government accountability groups instantly saw red flags with its creation, filing <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/advocacy-groups-file-four-lawsuits-against-musk-led-doge">four separate lawsuits</a> that alleged Doge violated federal transparency laws while warning that the initiative was “slated to dictate federal policy in ways that will affect millions of Americans”.</p> <p>The concerns from watchdog organizations have borne out. Musk and employees of Doge have gained access to sensitive government systems in the treasury department and USAid in recent days, as well as exerted control over the office of personnel management (OPM) and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/elon-musk-general-services-administration.html">General Services Administration</a>, which handles federal real estate, with the goal of ending office leases. Two federal workers additionally sued on Tuesday for a temporary restraining order against Doge for allegedly operating an illegal server in OPM.</p>    <p>Attempts at blocking Musk’s team have resulted in several top agency officials being ousted. On Friday, the treasury department’s acting secretary, David Lebryk, resigned after refusing to grant Musk’s team access to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/politics/david-lebryk-treasury-resigns-musk.html">highly secure systems</a> that control about $6tn in annual payments to millions of Americans. The next day, two senior security officials at USAid attempted to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/usaid-officials-put-on-leave-musk-doge">stop Doge workers</a> from gaining physical access to restricted areas at the agency – resulting in a standoff in which a deputy for Musk threatened to call the US marshals. Both security officials have subsequently been put on administrative leave, and on Sunday night staff at USAid received emails telling them to not come into work the next day.</p> <p>The events unfolded swiftly and took place mostly outside of working hours, creating uncertainty over the weekend as to who was in charge and what authority the Doge team possessed. Many of the Doge team tasked with carrying out the overhauls of government agencies appear to have little to no experience in government and are extremely young. One of the engineers is as young as 19, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-associate-bfs-federal-payment-system/">Wired</a> reported, while a 25-year-old who previously worked at two of Musk’s companies gained access to treasury department payment systems.</p> <p>The Trump administration has maintained that all Musk’s actions have been legal and did not violate security protocols, although the details of what Doge employees are doing with access to government systems is still unclear. “No classified material was accessed without proper security clearances,” Katie Miller, a Doge spokesperson and wife of the far-right Trump administration official Stephen Miller, wrote on X.</p> <p>Musk has claimed that his actions are cutting unnecessary costs and will allow for more efficient government, but he has also suggested his taskforce is ideologically opposed to liberal initiatives such as refugee services and the promotion of trans rights. He has routinely engaged with far-right and conspiracy theory-promoting accounts on X while touting his dismantling of USAid, an agency that has become a target in recent years among hardline conservatives. The far-right Heritage Foundation thinktank specifically called for reforming USAid in its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/08/trump-project-2025">controversial Project 2025 report</a>, accusing it of spreading “climate extremism” and “gender radicalism”.</p> <h2>Musk acting with Trump’s backing</h2> <p>Trump has supported Musk’s aggressive approach to dismantling government agencies, confirming plans on Monday to shut down USAid and praising Musk as a “big cost cutter”. As backlash swelled and Democrats issued calls for action against Musk on Monday, Trump attempted to assuage some of the concerns and reassert that he was in charge.</p> <p>“Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “We’ll give him approval where appropriate and where not appropriate we won’t.”</p> <p>But there have been no public signs thus far that Trump has reined in Musk’s ambitions or prevented him from engaging in potential conflicts – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/13/elon-musk-conflict-of-interest">he has many</a>, as a number of his companies do extensive work with government agencies he now holds sway over. Several of Trump’s recent policy announcements also appeared to align with Musk’s worldview and personal grievances.</p>    <p>Trump declared on Monday that he would shut down all aid to South Africa, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/26/elon-musk-peter-thiel-apartheid-south-africa">Musk’s country of birth</a>, over what he alleged was a “massive human rights violation” in the form of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/03/donald-trump-cutting-funding-south-africa-land-confiscations-cyril-ramaphosa">a new land rights law</a>. Musk has repeatedly accused the South African government of racism against white people and falsely claimed that the government is allowing a “genocide” against white farmers.</p> <p>Another <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-launches-massive-10-to-1-deregulation-initiative/">executive order</a> from Trump on 31 January vowed to “unleash prosperity through deregulation” and declared that whenever a government agency issues a new regulation it must first remove 10 existing regulations. The order has echoed Musk’s longstanding calls for widespread deregulation of the federal government, which Musk reiterated in a livestream on Monday night on X, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/musk-regulation-spending">when he stated</a> “regulations, basically, should be default gone”. He described the current administration as “our best shot” at this deregulation and “the best hand of cards we’re ever going to have”.</p> <p>Musk has made sweeping and aggressive declarations about what else must change about the US government, indicating where he might strike next. He stated on Monday: “Activist judges must be removed from the bench or there is no justice,” and praised the representative Marjorie Taylor Greene for <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/03/marjorie-taylor-greene-hearing-npr-pbs">issuing calls for NPR and PBS</a> to testify at a hearing about their operations. Greene, who is head of a “delivering on government efficiency” group within the House oversight committee that aims to support Musk’s efforts, accused the public media organizations of ideological bias – citing a PBS report that Musk “gave what appeared to be a fascist salute” during a speech last month.</p> <p>It is uncertain what mechanisms may prevent further cuts by Musk. His immense influence coupled with his erratic behavior have made it difficult to quickly ascertain where the next axe may fall, such as on Monday when Musk <a href="https://apnews.com/article/irs-direct-file-musk-18f-6a4dc35a92f9f29c310721af53f58b16">claimed that a government agency</a> that worked on a free IRS tax filing system was “deleted” while giving no further information. The agency’s program was still online as of Tuesday.</p> <p>What is clear from Musk’s public statements is the intent to barrel ahead with accumulating more power over government agencies, while framing his crusade as an existential fight for the future of the country.</p> <p>“It’s now or never,” the billionaire tweeted on Tuesday. “Your support is crucial to the success of the revolution of the people.”</p>
