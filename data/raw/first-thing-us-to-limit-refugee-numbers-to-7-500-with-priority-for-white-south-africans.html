<p>Good morning.</p> 
<p>The Trump administration is going to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-refugee-restrictions-white-south-africans">restrict the number of refugees</a> it admits into the US next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans.</p> 
<p>The low number represents a dramatic decrease from last year’s ceiling, set under the Biden administration, of 125,000 people fleeing war and persecution.</p> 
<p>The announcement swiftly drew criticism from a large range of refugee organizations. </p> 
<p>“Since the US Refugee Program was created in 1980, it has admitted over 2 million people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors. Now it will be used as a pathway for white immigration,” said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What reason has been given for prioritizing white South Africans?</strong> The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law. The South African government has called the claims false. </p></li>

<h2><strong>California officials investigate after second shooting by ICE agents in a week</strong></h2> 
<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were involved in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/ice-agents-southern-california-shooting">a shooting in southern California on Thursday</a>, prompting a federal investigation.</p> 
<p>The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that ICE officers were conducting a vehicle stop in Ontario when another driver, who was not the target, approached. Officers ordered the driver to leave the area, according to the statement.</p> 
<p>“As the driver began to pull away, the car stopped and attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping,” Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS’s assistant press secretary, said in a statement.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What was the other shooting by ICE agents in LA recently?</strong> Last week, federal agents shot an LA man who livestreams immigration enforcement operations on social media. Officials said at the time that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok creator with a large following, had attempted to ram federal agents’ vehicles after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car.</p></li>
