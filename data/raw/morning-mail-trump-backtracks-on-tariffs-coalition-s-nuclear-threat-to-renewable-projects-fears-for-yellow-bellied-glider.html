<p>Good morning. Stock markets have surged after the US president, Donald Trump, announced a 90-day “pause” on his tariff plan so that most countries will now be hit with the base 10% rate (which Australia was already facing) rather than higher figures announced last week. However, China now faces increased 125% tariffs.</p> <p>In Australia, the Coalition’s nuclear plans would prevent the creation of more jobs in the renewable energy sector, according to new modelling.
