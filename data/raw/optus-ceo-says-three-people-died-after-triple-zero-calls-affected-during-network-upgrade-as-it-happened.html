  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The majority of emissions reduction between now and 2035 will come out of the electricity and energy transition. The good news is about that is it will also have the added benefit of being able to lower cost for households and businesses and still create economic growth for our country.</p> 
   <p>Yes, we looked at every sector of the economy and every technology available opportunities for abatement where we didn’t believe things would be available by 2035, we thought it would be too hard to deliver that out of the model. It is quite a conservative approach, with the aim of being in a position to surprise on the upside.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Labor senator <strong>Tony Sheldon</strong> says today’s interim report on university governance exposes the “widespread failures in transparency, accountability, and integrity across Australia’s public universities”.</p> 
  <p>Sheldon, the senate inquiry’s inaugural chair, took particular aim at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), which yesterday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/17/utss-teacher-education-program-set-to-close-as-university-reveals-plan-to-slash-over-1000-subjects">revealed a plan</a> to slash about 30% of its subjects and more than 130 staff as part of a restructure.</p> 
  <p>Sheldon, who has been a strong critic of the sector during his time as chair of the education and employment committee, said UTS had become “the embodiment of everything wrong with university governance”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They spent exorbitant sums on outside accountants to justify job cuts and course closures, splashed out on lavish international trips in the middle of a cost-cutting crisis, and pushed through restructures so extreme that a safety regulator had to intervene.</p> 
   <p>If our universities are to regain the trust of their communities, they must embrace transparency and accountability.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The vice-chancellor of UTS, <strong>Prof Andrew Parfitt,</strong> said UTS was focused on achieving a “sustainable future” and its commitment to public education and focus on the student experience were “paramount”.</p> 
  <p>Sheldon said the inquiry “exposed a culture of consequence-free rotten failure at the top of our universities”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There’s no other sector in the country where failure is rewarded so handsomely and with so little scrutiny. We need universities run with integrity, not secrecy, and this report is a warning shot to those who think the rules don’t apply to them. The recommendations send a clear message: public money comes with public accountability.</p>

  <p>The party announced that the proposed law would be introduced after Western Australia said it would make a similar move this week, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HannahForVicPark/posts/pfbid034yr3qM7TEchFaWGcpFKs49Vw2kKjPhNyTAD7YeJExFa2FwL2YzSik5QvTy9XPg3Xl">amending the state’s Cat Act</a> to allow local councils to make and enforce laws around containment.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sue Higginson</strong>, the Greens’ spokesperson for the environment, said in a statement the primary driver for the new laws was about “protecting our precious and threatened native species”, but also about owners “taking care of the animals that they have a responsibility to care for”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The failure of the NSW Government to act on cat containment is a tragedy for the environment, and is now a national embarrassment. We are now the only state that hasn’t addressed the extinction of native animals as a result of wandering pet cats …</p> 
   <p>This approach recognises that native animals and the cats that prey on them should be kept safe from one another, as well as giving enforcement powers to Councils that can be scaled up and down as necessary to prevent cats from wandering into neighbours’ yards, nature reserves or anywhere else where there is a problem.</p>

  <p><strong>David Pocock on the 2035 climate target and political will – Australian Politics podcast</strong></p> 
  <p>In a defining week for climate action, the Albanese government has unveiled a commitment to cut emissions between 62% and 70% of 2005 levels by 2035. But vocal climate advocate Senator <strong>David Pocock </strong>says a minimum of 75% is needed to “do our bit”.</p> 
  <p>Political editor <strong>Tom McIlroy </strong>speaks to the ACT independent about his pessimism over political leadership on climate ambition – despite the government’s own warnings against a lack of action.</p>

  <p><strong>Overhauling university governance ‘absolutely urgent’, Greens say</strong></p> 
  <p>The Greens deputy leader and higher education spokesperson, <strong>Mehreen Faruqi</strong>, said the interim report “makes the need for an overhaul of hefty VC and executive salaries and cleaning up university governance bodies crystal clear”.</p> 
  <p>The senator<strong> </strong>was a member of the inquiry into university governance and made further recommendations, including immediately repealing the former Coalition government’s job-ready graduates scheme.</p> 
  <p>Faruqi said it was “imperative” the government listened to the inquiry’s “damning evidence” and took staff and student recommendations seriously:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The depth and breadth of anxiety, stress, trauma and fear that staff are subjected to, and the lack of accountability and transparency that VCs and executives get away with without any repercussions or recourse cannot be tolerated any longer.</p> 
   <p>Overhauling university governance is absolutely urgent. Staff and students deserve to be key decision-makers at their universities, not overpaid executives, corporate appointees or private consultants that walk away with millions of dollars.</p>

  <p>University councils would retain responsibility for setting the vice-chancellors’ and senior executives’ pay within the range.</p> 
  <p>The average vice-chancellor pay is almost twice that of the prime minister, while a number of vice-chancellors with salaries of more than $1m a year also hold external paid positions.</p> 
  <p>The committee said it accepted the importance of universities remaining “competitive” for global talent, but continued:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The overwhelming volume of evidence received was strongly of the view that universities paying over 300 executives across the country more than the premier or chief ministers of their state was excessive, and out of step with community expectations of public institutions and international comparisons.</p>

  <p>Vice-chancellors’ million-dollar pay packets would be reigned in and universities forced to declare potential conflicts of interest under a series of sweeping recommendations by a Senate inquiry into university governance.</p> 
  <p>The committee’s interim report, released on Friday afternoon, found there was a “lack of trust” in universities that was undermining their reputation and mission to serve the public good.</p> 
  <p>It made a dozen recommendations to improve transparency and accountability in the beleaguered sector, including publishing the minutes of council meetings on university websites, publicly disclosing all spending on consultants and releasing a conflict-of-interest register for senior executives and council members.</p> 
  <p>The report also called for greater transparency of the composition of governing bodies, including a minimum proportion of members with higher education expertise and from staff and student backgrounds, and for strengthening the powers of the sector’s regulator.</p> 
  <p>The committee said it was “concerned that if these governance failures were not addressed, universities risked undermining their public missions, diminishing the international standing of Australian higher education and failing in their obligations as publicly funded institutions”.</p>

  <p>Australian scientists will set sail on a wet, wild and windy expedition to research whether bird flu has reached world heritage-listed islands in Antarctica, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>A group of experts will voyage to Heard and McDonald islands, 4,000 kms southwest of Western Australia, as part of the nation’s biggest campaign to the area in two decades.</p> 
  <p>The environment minister, <strong>Murray Watt</strong>, who joined the scientists in Hobart on Friday, said Australia was the only continent remaining free of the h5 strain of bird flu, despite it having spread globally.</p> 
  <p>H5 avian influenza is a highly contagious strain that mainly affects birds, but can also infect other animals. It rarely affects humans.</p> 
  <p>The Australian Antarctic Program head of division, <strong>Emma Campbell, </strong>said one of the main objectives of the voyage was to also assess the size and distribution of seabird and seal populations on the islands.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Former Liberal staffer <strong>Bruce Lehrmann’s</strong> alleged car theft victim, her husband, son and five police officers are expected to give evidence at a court hearing into the saga, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Lehrmann has denied stealing a Toyota Prado at remote Mountain River in southern Tasmania on 20 November 2024.</p> 
  <p>The 30-year-old and lawyer <strong>Zali Burrows</strong> appeared via phone before Hobart magistrates court on Friday.</p> 
  <p>Burrows said she would subpoena a media interview conducted by complainant <strong>Gail Oates</strong> that allegedly contained a different version of the incident than the one she told police.</p> 
  <p>The defence said they had received previously redacted statements, which included the name of someone else Oates believed might have taken the four-wheel drive.</p> 
  <p>“We may require more information in light of that,” Burrows told the court.</p> 
  <p>The yet-to-be-scheduled hearing would take four days, prosecutor <strong>Bunewat Keo</strong> said.</p> 
  <p>Oates, her husband and son would all give evidence, as would a friend of Lehrmann and a service station worker able to give context about what happened that night, Keo said.</p> 
  <p>Five police officers involved in the investigation would be called, and CCTV and police body-worn camera footage would be tendered.</p> 
  <p>Most of the evidence had been disclosed, bar a bank statement and maps to assist the court, Keo said.</p> 
  <p>Lehrmann’s bail was continued, and the matter was listed to return to court on October 31.</p>

  <p><strong>Queensland coalminer to cut jobs as prices fall</strong></p> 
  <p>Queensland coalminer <strong>QCoal Group</strong> will close one of its two underground sites at its Cook Colliery project in the Bowen Basin, blaming production costs, taxes, royalties and low coal prices.</p> 
  <p>It is the third coalminer operating in Queensland to announce job cuts this week, with the <strong>BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA)</strong> and <strong>Anglo American</strong> also revealing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/17/bhp-queensland-deputy-premier-labels-unaustralian-as-mining-giant-blames-job-cuts-on-coal-royalties-scheme">workforce changes</a>.</p> 
  <p>QCoal’s Cook Colliery project employs about 170 people, but it’s unclear on the exact number of expected job losses.</p> 
  <p>A QCoal spokesperson said consultation with workers was expected to take two weeks. The spokesperson said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Unfortunately Cook Colliery has been affected by high production costs, high taxes and royalties and low coal prices and its ongoing operation at its current levels is unsustainable.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>QCoal mines coking coal, used in steel, and thermal coal for energy production.</p> 
  <p>Coalminers recently emerged from a windfall period, marked by huge price rises after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Prices have now retreated to more normal levels.</p> 
  <p>Some of the miners have linked their decision to cut jobs to the Queensland government’s tiered royalty scheme, which was updated in 2022 to help the government retrieve higher rates during commodity price booms.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW police commissioner may be announced next week</strong></p> 
  <p>Earlier today, the NSW premier, <strong>Chris Minns</strong>, was again asked when the government will reveal the replacement for outgoing police commissioner <strong>Karen Webb</strong>, who announced her resignation in May.</p> 
  <p>Webb, who stepped down almost two years before her contract was due to end, has her final day on 30 September, although deputy commissioner <strong>Peter Thurtell</strong> is currently acting in her role.</p> 
  <p>Since Webb’s resignation, media reports have focused on the frontrunner and acting chief executive of the NSW Reconstruction Authority, <strong>Mal Lanyon</strong> – including a 2021 incident in which he was found collapsed near Goulburn’s “Big Merino” sculpture. </p> 
  <p>This month, Lanyon <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/top-cop-frontrunner-admits-inappropriate-action-during-nye-celebrations-20250916-p5mvkw.html">admitted</a> taking his wife and another couple aboard an operational police boat for New Year’s Eve in 2023, after a complaint to the police watchdog.</p> 
  <p>Asked whether the government has ruled out Lanyon over the incidents, Minns says “people do make decisions, sometimes they’re bad decisions, me included”, but says the final appointment will consider the “totality of someone’s career”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>My experience is that senior police, like our senior public servants in the big portfolios, are eminently professional and just focused on public service … You’ve got every right to highlight and scrutinize public servants. But from my position, if we’re only picking people who have got completely lilywhite records, then we’ll be missing out on a lot of people that can contribute to public life in NSW.</p>

  <p><strong>Ley says party doesn’t ‘believe in setting targets at all from opposition’ but says things would be different in government</strong></p> 
  <p>Returning to <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>’s press conference on climate earlier, the Liberal leader now says her party “don’t believe in setting targets at all from opposition”. </p> 
  <p>While the Labor government yesterday set its target of a 62-70% reduction in emissions by 2035, it seems the Liberal Party or Coalition may not set one of their own in return at this stage.</p> 
  <p>Ley had initially told the press conference “we don’t believe setting targets at all from opposition or from government”. However her team says she misspoke initially, in adding “government” to that answer. </p> 
  <p>We understand Ley came back to the press conference immediately after it ended and clarified that the Coalition don’t support setting targets from opposition but that “we do, of course, recognise the importance of targets in government when we have the full information in front of us, which we don’t have”.</p> 
  <p>Ley, under pressure from right-wingers in her ranks who have been increasingly lobbying to dump the Coalition’s still-current net zero by 2050 pledge, yesterday was quick out of the blocks to oppose the 62% to 70% target. </p> 
  <p>The obvious question was, what target would Ley’s Liberals and the National party support?</p> 
  <p>In another presser today, Ley shot down the concept entirely. Asked what she thought the target should be, the Liberal leader responded:</p> 
  <p>“We don’t believe in setting targets at all from opposition or from government, because the reality is that energy policy is not about a target that is never going to be reached and the 43% target is a perfect example of that,” she said in her initial answer, pointing to the government’s 2030 target.</p> 
  <p>“Energy policy is about visiting businesses like this one,” Ley continued, referencing the manufacturing business she was speaking from.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>And talking to people who work in the energy sector, who deliver the energy grid, who understand the actual realities of the energy economy, not setting a notional target and then expecting that everyone will agree with it even though you can’t demonstrate how you will get there or what it will cost.</p>

  <p><strong>Analysis: Australian lives – and deaths – not given even a moment of consideration as Queensland pill testing ban brought in</strong></p> 
  <p>According to experts, last night’s decision by Queensland parliament to ban pill testing will cost lives. A lot of them; more Australians die of drug overdoses than in car accidents.</p> 
  <p>Their deaths – past and future – warranted not an instant of parliamentary time.</p> 
  <p>The family of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/18/parents-josh-tam-teen-who-died-at-lost-paradise-music-festival-plead-queensland-government-not-to-ban-pill-testing">Queenslander </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/18/parents-josh-tam-teen-who-died-at-lost-paradise-music-festival-plead-queensland-government-not-to-ban-pill-testing">Josh Tam</a></strong>, whose death at a New South Wales music festival led to a coronial recommendation in favour of pill testing in that state, had publicly pleaded with the government to reconsider.</p> 
  <p>That plea was given not a moment’s formal consideration by parliament.</p> 
  <p>There is no law or structure preventing Queensland’s governments from ruling by decree via the state’s unicameral parliament.</p> 
  <p>On Thursday night the government did so by attaching amendments to ban pill testing to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/16/queensland-government-to-ban-pill-testing-in-move-criticised-by-health-advocates">an unrelated omnibus bill in parliament</a>.</p> 
  <p>No less than 11 Labor MPs tried to debate pill testing. Every one had their attempt ruled out of order.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sandy Boulton</strong>, one of the few to get a word in because she is an independent MP representing Noosa, slammed the process as “a form of gagging and not part of transparency”.</p> 
  <p>“If amendments [to bills] do not go through the appropriate process of committee scrutiny, Queenslanders are denied the right to have their say, and that is wrong in all ways,” she said. They did not.</p> 
  <p>At 9pm on Thursday the motion was finally “put”, which means all the amendments to the omnibus bill were voted on in one block. There was no opportunity for anyone to speak on the pill testing amendment.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A Victorian GP who treated triple murderer <strong>Erin Patterson</strong> and her victims after the deadly mushroom lunch has been slapped with conditions by the health regulator after speaking out about the case.</p> 
  <p>Dr <strong>Christopher Webster</strong>, a GP in Leongatha, south-east of Melbourne, was a witness in Patterson’s trial earlier this year.</p> 
  <p>After she was found guilty, Webster gave several media interviews about the case, including one in which he called Patterson a “crazy bitch”.</p> 
  <p>On Wednesday, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) placed <a href="https://www.ahpra.gov.au/Registration/Registers-of-Practitioners.aspx">conditions on his registration</a>.</p> 
  <p>According to Ahpra’s register of practitioners, Webster’s conditions include that he must complete:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>One-on-one education with an approved educator for a minimum of 8 hours and address the following topics: professionalism and ethics, professional communication, privacy and confidentiality, complying with your obligations under Good medical practice: a code of conduct for doctors in Australia and Social media: How to meet your obligations under the National Law.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The register also says that he must complete the one-on-one education within six months, and that once it is completed he must be mentored.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Another humpback whale has been caught in shark nets on the Sunshine Coast on Friday – the fifth to become ensnared this week.</p> 
  <p>The whale, which became tangled off Marcoola on Friday morning, has since been released, according to Griffith University’s <strong>Dr Olaf Meynecke</strong>. He said calm conditions were often associated with entanglements.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a very calm morning … the whales come pretty close to shore when it’s calm, when they feel the least danger. They come within a few hundred metres of the shore to rest.</p> 
   <p>If there’s more waves and wind, mothers and calves stay further away to avoid the risk of stranding.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Authorities are still working to release a mother humpback from shark nets near Hervey Bay. The animal has been entangled now for about six days. Most, but not all, of the nets have been removed. Separately, a mother and calf caught in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/18/whale-and-calf-entangled-in-shark-net-off-queensland-australia">nets off Noosa</a> were freed on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>Humpback whales are caught in shark nets every year, said Meynecke, but this was the first time involving five in a matter of days.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian Human Rights Commission</strong> has accepted a racial discrimination complaint against a Sydney restaurant for allegedly denying dine-in service to six Palestinians for wearing keffiyehs after last month’s Harbour Bridge march.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Racial Justice Centre</strong> (RJC) says the group complaint against Merivale-owned Jimmy’s Falafel has been accepted by the AHRC as an alleged breach of the Racial Discrimination Act. <strong>Sharfah Mohamed</strong>, lawyer at the RJC, says she welcomes the AHRC’s swift acceptance of the complaint.</p> 
  <p>The AHRC can only accept a complaint when it is “reasonably arguable” that the alleged conduct is unlawful discrimination. The commission will invite Merivale to respond before it facilitates and conducts conciliation between the parties.</p> 
  <p>A Merivale spokesperson previously told Guardian Australia that management made a decision to protect their staff that involved banning people carrying or displaying flags and placards inside the venue for a 20-minute period after people walking past its venues shouted “obscenities and violent rhetoric”. Merivale said the comments included“death to the IDF”, “death to all Zionist pigs” and “f***ing Zionist pigs and scum”.</p> 
  <p>The spokesperson said its staff understood the decision to include “political items of clothing”.”</p> 
  <p>If conciliation is unsuccessful, the complaint can take the matter to the federal court.</p> 
  <p>Guardian Australia has contacted Merivale for comment.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW opens fast-charging electric bus depot in Australian first</strong></p> 
  <p>The NSW government has announced the first conversion of a large Sydney bus depot to electric fast-charging technology as part of its efforts to electrify the state’s 8,000-strong fleet.</p> 
  <p>The Brookvale bus depot in the northern beaches has been fitted out with Australia’s first gantry-mounted charging system. A mechanical arm connects the buses to overhead power lines via a “pantograph”, similar to the system used to power trains. An electric bus recharges in 20 minutes to an hour, providing up to 300km of travel.</p> 
  <p>The NSW transport minister, <strong>John Graham</strong>, says the program has begun in the northern beaches, which has faced serious bus shortages:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The Northern Beaches experienced the worst of the bus driver shortage … and also lost high-capacity bendy buses when they had to be withdrawn from service for body work. Bus passengers here can look forward to a brighter, all-electric future.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>As of August this year, greater Sydney had 220 electric buses in operation. Brookvale, the first of Sydney’s 11 bus depots to be fitted out, has 13 electric buses in service, although the government says the 13 charging stations and eight plug in-chargers will support 229.</p>

   <p>The small number of charges highlights the complexity of investigating and prosecuting this form of abuse.</p>

  </blockquote> 
  <p>Fitzgerald said the true test of the legislation will come when a case that proceeds to trial for the first time allows “the courts to examine the evidence, interpret the law, and set important precedents for how coercive control is prosecuted in NSW”. She added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In the first 12 months, only three coercive control charges were finalised in court.</p>

  <p><strong>Only nine people charged during first year of NSW’s landmark coercive control laws</strong></p> 
  <p>Only nine people have been charged in New South Wales under the state’s landmark coercive control laws, despite there being nearly 300 recorded incidents. </p> 
  <p>The data, released today by the <strong>Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research</strong> (Bocsar), tracked the impact of the legislation – which criminalises coercive control in intimate partner relationships – in the year since it was introduced last July. </p> 
  <p>The legislation marked a significant shift in the way domestic violence was recognised in the state amid a nation-wide reckoning over how many women continue to be murdered by their intimate partners. </p> 
  <p>Bocsar found there were five distinct controlling behaviours on average in the 297 recorded incidents. The most common were harassment and monitoring or tracking. Meanwhile threats or intimidation, financial abuse (48%) and shaming or humiliation were recorded in around half of the incidents. </p> 
  <p>The rates were higher in the regions, with the Far West and Orana and Central West recording the highest in the state. Nearly half of those that alleged a coercive control incident had a recorded history with police of being victim-survivors of domestic violence. </p>

  <p><strong>Gout Gout misses out on 200m final but says better performances are ‘coming’</strong></p> 
  <p>The promising debut of <strong>Gout Gout </strong>on the international stage has come to an end after he was eliminated at the world championships in a competitive semi-final in Tokyo.</p> 
  <p>The 17-year-old finished fourth last night in his race behind winner Bryan Levell, and missed out on the two additional time-based qualification places on offer after running at 20.36sec.</p> 
  <p>Although <strong>Torrie Lewis</strong> couldn’t progress in the women’s 200m either, Australia’s middle distance runners and high jumpers found success in the National Stadium on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>In the men’s 200m, Gout’s time was marginally slower than the 20.23sec he ran in his heat, and was well off the 20.02sec he produced to lower his own national record in a meet in Czechia in June.</p> 
  <p>But he was positive afterwards, and said he would build on this experience. “Semi-finalist, and to go out there and compete against the big guys, I couldn’t be prouder of myself for sure,” the teenager said.</p>

  <p><strong>Nearly one in three single-parent households in Australia live in poverty, Hilda report shows</strong></p> 
  <p>A major national survey has revealed a “silent crisis” among Australian families, with nearly one-in-three single-parent households living in poverty.</p> 
  <p>The newly released statistical report on the long-running Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey found that, after adjusting for housing costs, 31.3% of single-parent families were living below the poverty line in 2023.</p> 
  <p>This group is nearly three times more likely to be in poverty than two-parent households, the survey showed.</p> 
  <p>The latest reported figure was down from a record high reported in 2022, but was still well above the 25% share of single-parent households in poverty a decade earlier and higher than the 28.3% in poverty in 2003.</p> 
  <p>Hilda’s co-director, <strong>Roger Wilkins</strong>, said the history of the survey revealed a worsening trend over the past 10 to 15 years as changes under the Howard and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/02/julia-gillard-single-parents-benefit">Gillard</a> governments forced single parents – predominately mothers – off parenting payments and on to <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-removing-parenting-payments-when-children-turned-8-harmed-rather-than-helped-single-mothers-204927">less generous unemployment benefits</a>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A so-called miracle cure for stroke is no more effective than a placebo, a study has found.</p> 
  <p><strong>AAP</strong> reports the treatment, known as <strong>perispinal etanercept</strong>, involves injecting an arthritis medication into the back of a patient’s neck and tilting them downwards so it travels towards their brain.</p> 
  <p>Unavailable in Australia, stroke survivors have flown to the United States to receive the treatment, often at great expense.</p> 
  <p>But a trial conducted by scientists from The Florey research centre has shown it offers patients no benefits above a dummy treatment.</p> 
  <p>Some 126 patients from Australia and New Zealand took part in the randomised trial, published in the peer-reviewed journal Neurology, with half receiving the treatment and half the placebo.</p> 
  <p>Neither group nor doctors knew which one they had until afterwards. In total, 52% of those who received the treatment reported feeling better 28 days later, compared to 57% of those who received the placebo.</p> 
  <p>The difference in the results is considered statistically insignificant.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Gradual electric vehicles uptake a ‘challenge’, says Bowen</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Bowen</strong> was asked on 7.30 last night about electric vehicle uptake in Australia and he admitted that reducing emissions from transport is a “challenge” that will “take quite a while” due to Australians’ slow uptake of electric vehicles.</p> 
  <p>The climate change minister admitted EV adoption had been gradual and was yet to significantly impact Australia’s emissions after announcing the government’s 2035 emissions reduction target of 62% to 70%.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s been a challenge, because … you buy a car today and it’s operating for 15 or more years, so it takes time to turn that around.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Reports released alongside the new target said electric vehicles would have to account for half of new cars sold between now and 2035, alongside dramatic transformation of the country’s energy grid, to even reach the lower end of the target.</p> 
  <p>Bowen acknowledged transport emissions were yet to slump despite tax breaks for EVs, new vehicle emissions standards and an increasing range of cars:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m not here to pretend to you that that has all of a sudden impacted on emissions yet. It’s going to take quite a while to have the full impact on our emissions.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>David Littleproud</strong>, the Nationals leader, rejected Bowen’s assertion in an interview with RN Breakfast, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I believe in climate change. I believe that man has made an impact on climate change. Just because I don’t believe in Chris Bowen’s plan doesn’t mean I’m a climate denier. …</p> 
   <p>We believe there’s ways to do it, but not necessarily Labor’s way.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Littleproud said he remained concerned about the cost behind the plan to lower emissions, adding the Nationals were working on their own effort to ensure “we’ve adapted to climate change and protected our economy”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What I intend to do is lead a party that will maturely work through this, look through all aspects of this, and say to the Australian people: we believe in climate change, but there is ways to achieve this, and it’s not just one way to achieve it.</p>

  <p><strong>Bowen says emissions reduction targets ‘no small thing’</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Chris Bowen</strong>, the climate change minister, maintained the government’s emissions reduction target was “no small thing”, saying he believes the plan is achievable “but ambitious”.</p> 
  <p>Bowen spoke to RN Breakfast this morning, addressing criticism from many in the environmental community that the target of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/18/what-is-a-climate-target-australia-2035-global-comparison">a reduction between 62% and 70%</a> by 2035 over 2005 levels was too low to rein in the worst effects of climate change. Bowen said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is no small thing ... And it certainly compares well internationally. Over the last 24 hours, Europe’s been considering a 63% to 70% cut, which shows on the same accounting basis as ours. So, that shows that we are right up there with the most ambitious countries in the world, as we should be, as we need to be. But also … it has to be achievable. …</p> 
   <p>With all due respect to those commentators who say we should be doing more, they don’t need to deliver – government does and the government has set out yesterday not only a target but a comprehensive plan to help us get there.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Julie Bishop</strong> has categorically denied allegations of bullying made against her during a Senate inquiry, issuing a 25 page right of reply, published on the Senate committee’s website.</p> 
  <p>The ANU chancellor had told the media and staff at a town hall meeting last week that she denied the allegations and she had first heard the allegations when they were aired at the inquiry.</p> 
  <p><strong>Liz Allen, </strong>an demographer at the ANU, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/12/academic-labels-julie-bishop-hostile-and-arrogant-at-inquiry-into-leadership-issues-at-anu-ntwnfb">made the allegations</a> while giving evidence to a committee investigating higher education governance.</p> 
  <p>In the letter, Bishop said the way the allegations were made raised “grave concerns”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The way the hearing … was used to ventilate serious allegations against me and other senior ANU officers raises grave concerns for a range of reasons – both individually and for the ANU.</p> 
   <p>I wish to state on the record that I categorically deny the allegations levelled against me during the hearing on 12 August 2025.</p> 
   <p>I cannot in good conscience publicly give testimony to the committee that may further compromise the workplace grievance process as well as other ongoing.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Bishop said her conduct has always been professional and she rejects the allegations that “I am ‘<em>hostile and arrogant</em>’ to staff, that I have ‘<em>godlike powers</em>, <em>unchecked</em>’ and the more general allegations that, under my chairmanship of council meetings, there is a ‘<em>culture of fear and intimidation</em>’ … that council is ‘<em>dysfunctional and toxic under the current regime</em>’, [or] that elected members are ‘<em>afraid</em>’”.</p>

  <p>A plane has crashed in dense bushland on the state’s south coast while returning to Sydney, sparking a search last night on foot by emergency services for the crash site and the lone pilot.</p> 
  <p>The pilot had taken the small recreational aircraft out on a solo trip earlier on Thursday, flying south from Bankstown airport in Sydney’s west, police said.</p> 
  <p>The pilot was flying back to Sydney but crashed in Budawang national park about 25km north of Batemans Bay, activating the plane’s emergency location transmitter.</p> 
  <p>Emergency services were called to the scene at 4.30pm on Thursday, with the state’s ambulance helicopter assisting police, fire and maritime services in locating the crash site from the air.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The climate change minister has declined to promise energy prices will fall, while acknowledging retail prices would determine the political success of the Albanese government’s new emissions target.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on ABC’s 7.30 last night, <strong>Chris Bowen</strong> said prices were “very important” to public support for the 2035 emissions reduction target of 62% to 70% but said the government had balanced climate change and living costs. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Australians do want to see climate action but they also care about cost of living because it’s right before them every day … [but] the fundamental fact is that what’s good for your pocket is good for the planet and vice versa.</p>

  <p>Bowen declined to guarantee that electricity prices would fall as the country adopted renewable energy or to specify a timeframe for Australians to see savings from solar and wind uptake. He instead pointed to government modelling showing lower prices were likely, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I can guarantee that renewables are the cheapest form of energy. … We’ve never pretended, in the face of international energy pressures, that all this happens easily or quickly but we also don’t walk away from the fact that renewables are the cheapest form of energy ever known to humankind.</p>
