<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’</a>s social media startup has announced plans to branch out into financial services including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/cryptocurrencies">cryptocurrencies</a>, drawing the president’s business empire further into crypto as his administration looks to boost the space.</p> <p>Shares in Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, owner of Trump’s Truth Social platform, jumped 15% during pre-market trading after it announced the launch of Truth.Fi, a financial technology brand Truth.Fi, in a brief statement.</p> <p>In a move likely to prompt fresh conflict of interest concerns, Trump Media, or TMTG, said it plans to invest up to $250m into investment accounts and “Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities”.</p> <p>The funds will be managed by the brokerage Charles Schwab, it said.</p> <p>The president has already faced criticism for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/21/trump-meme-crypto-coin-ethics">launching a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency meme coin</a> on the eve of his inauguration last week. Former government ethics officials and presidential experts said the venture amounted to a “shameful” conflict, as Trump had pledged to transform the US into the crypto capital of the world.</p> <p>Trump Media has struggled to build a social network that comes anywhere close to that created by Facebook and Instagram, owned by Meta Platforms; or X, owned by Elon Musk. But its status as a “meme stock” has helped it raise tens of millions since it went public on the stock market last year.</p> <p>The firm, which is majority-owned by Trump, plans to roll out “multiple investment vehicles” under its Truth.Fi brand this year, according to Wednesday’s announcement.</p> <p>“Truth.Fi is a natural expansion of the Truth Social movement,” claimed Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media. “We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we’re moving into investment products and decentralized finance.</p> <p>“Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by big tech and woke corporations.”</p>
