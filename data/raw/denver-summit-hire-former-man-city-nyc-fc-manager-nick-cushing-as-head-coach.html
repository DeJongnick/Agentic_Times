They have been backed by high-profile investors, including the American skiing icon Mikaela Shiffrin, who is from Colorado, and they have plans to move to a new 14,500-seat purpose-built stadium in 2028.<br><br>Cushing won six major trophies, including two Women’s FA Cups, three League Cups, and Manchester City’s sole women’s league title to date during his six-year spell at the helm of the English club. He left in 2020 to take up an assistant role at MLS side New York City FC, where he was elevated to head coach in 2022.

We have a passionate, committed fanbase and we have to put a team on the field that replicates that. Our team will play an attacking form of the game that excites our stadium and makes things difficult for our opponents. We want to create a winning team as well as a great experience for all of Colorado.”<br><br>Prior to Cushing’s appointment, the new club named Curt Johnson as their general manager. The former North Carolina Courage GM added: “In order to be successful right away, you need people that have experienced environments like this, have built organisations, and have had success. Nick brings world-class experience, a passion for player development, and a tactical vision that will excite Summit supporters. He’s won major trophies and is the right leader to guide us into our first season and beyond.”</p>
