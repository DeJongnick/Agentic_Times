Moscow’s forces captured the villages of Sredneye and Kleban-Byk along the 1,000km (620 mile) frontline in Donetsk, the Russian defence ministry said on Telegram on Saturday. The taking of Kleban-Byk would mark a further advance towards Kostiantynivka – a key fortified town on the road to Kramatorsk, the location of a major Ukrainian logistics base. Russia said on Friday its troops had captured three villages in Donetsk. Ukraine’s military did not acknowledge that any of the villages had changed hands. On Saturday, Ukrainian military officials said on Telegram its forces had stopped a Russian advance and recaptured the village of Zeleny Gai in Donetsk. The village was being subjected to new Russian attacks, a military statement said.
