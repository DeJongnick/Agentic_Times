Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the Women’s Rugby World Cup pool match between <strong>Australia and Samoa</strong> at Salford Stadium in Manchester.</p> <p>On paper, tonight’s match is the world No 6 against the team ranked No 15 in the world. These two nations have met once in a Test, way back in 2010, and Australia racked up an 87-0 victory! But World Cups aren’t won on paper and that was then and this is now.</p> <p>After smashing Wales at their last start, the Wallaroos may start favourite tonight. But the No 9-ranked Wales also stole the first Test of that series from the Wallaroos and Samoa have the firepower to cause an upset tonight and in the first round of a Rugby World Cup anything can happen. </p> <p>“We know Samoa will be a tough, physical side and we need to match it with them,” coach <strong>Jo Yapp</strong> told media yesterday. “There are no second chances at a World Cup and for us it starts with a good performance in our first match and building from there.”</p> <p>Indeed. Wallaroos coach Yapp has included 13 players with previous World Cup experience for what are her final Tests at the helm of Australia’s women’s rugby side. However, she has also rolled the dice on youth with fullback <strong>Caitlyn Halse</strong> set to become the youngest Australian to ever play at a Women’s Rugby World Cup.<br><br>Already the youngest player to ever debut for Australia, the 18-year-old will eclipse the previous World Cup record set by Millie Boyle in 2017 (19 years 82 days) when she runs out tonight. In fact, Halse is among 10 Wallaroos players debuting at this World Cup.</p> <p>Kick off tonight is 9pm AEST (11am GMT). We’ll be back with the teams shortly.</p> </div>   </div>
