 <h2 class="block-title">Scottish Labour accused of 'hypocrisy on stilts' after it plans vote on restoring winter fuel payments in Scotland</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Scottish Labour</strong> will force a vote designed to re-design the Scottish government’s winter fuel payments, despite them being cut because of a decision by the UK government, PA Media reports. PA says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Within weeks of taking office, chancellor Rachel Reeves set off a political firestorm by announcing the winter fuel payment would be means-tested, cutting spending and ultimately scuppering the Scottish government’s plan to offer its own universal counterpart.</p> 
   <p>But last week, Scottish Labour announced<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/19/farmer-protest-london-inheritance-tax-uk-politics-live-news-updates?page=with:block-673c8e478f084d1ac43acc37#block-673c8e478f084d1ac43acc37"> it would bring in re-designed payments</a>, which would lower the bar for those who would receive them if it won the 2026 Holyrood election.</p> 
   <p>And today the party announced it would seek to bring the payments back by forcing a vote in Holyrood during stage three of the social security (amendment) (Scotland) bill.</p> 
   <p>Amendments submitted by the party would require ministers to make regulations that would make all pensioners eligible for winter heating assistance, while also allowing for any payments made to be recovered if the recipient’s household income exceeds an amount set by ministers.</p> 
   <p>Currently, winter heating assistance – as described in the Social Security (Scotland) Act 2018 which the current bill is designed to amend – is “assistance (which may or may not take the form of money) given by the Scottish ministers under section 24 to an individual to meet, or help towards meeting, the individual’s heating costs during the winter months”.</p> 
   <p>The amendments would appear to make changes to the devolved benefit the Scottish government pushed back until next year after the chancellor’s announcement.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Commenting on the move, the Scottish government’s social justice secretary, <strong>Shirley-Anne Somerville</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is hypocrisy on stilts from Labour.</p> 
   <p>After betraying millions of pensioners by taking away their winter fuel payment, they now expect people to believe that they can be trusted to stand up for pensioners.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Minister defends ICC, but says if Netanyahu visited UK, British court would have to decide on enforcing arrest warrant</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Hamish Falconer</strong>, a Foreign Office minister, has said that if Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli PM, were to visit the UK, a court would ultimately decide if he should be arrested because of the international criminal court warrant against him over alleged war crimes in Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Falconer was responding to an urgent question from Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary, who has strongly criticised the ICC’s decision. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/25/uk-politics-live-assisted-dying-bill-labour-conservatives-starmer-reeves-badenoch?page=with:block-674474d68f087ff7bcc45230#block-674474d68f087ff7bcc45230">1.13pm</a>.)</p> 
  <p>Explaining what would happen, Falconer said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In line with this government’s stated commitment to the rule of law, we respect the independence of the ICC. We will comply with our international obligations.</p> 
   <p>There is a domestic legal process through our independent courts that determines whether or not to endorse an arrest warrant by the ICC, in accordance with the ICC Act of 2001. This process has never been tested because the UK has never been visited by an ICC indictee, if there were to be such a visit to the UK, there would be a court process and due process would be followed in relation to those issues.</p> 
   <p>There is no moral equivalence between Israel, a democracy, and Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, two terrorist organisations. This government has been clear, Israel has a right to defend itself in accordance with international law, that right is not under question, and the court’s approval of the warrants last week do not change that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Patel</strong> said the ICC “appears to be drawing a moral equivalence between Israel’s war of self-defence and Hamas terrorism” and she said the only beneficiaries of the decision were Hamas.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Falconer</strong> urged her to respect the ICC. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Diplomacy will continue, regardless of the process of the ICC, but I had understood it to be the common position of this house that the international rule of law is an important commitment.</p> 
   <p>The international criminal court is an important, the primary body, in enforcing these norms and the issues on jurisdiction and complementarity were heard by the pre-trial chamber, its three judges have issued their findings, and I think we should respect those.</p>

  <p>Government has to provide stability. And she says it has to remove the barriers that are in the way of growth.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The government has been criticised for the quality of the reports it has produced assessing the likely consequences of its employment rights bill. A <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/employment-rights-bill-impact-assessments">series of impact assessments </a>(IAs) were published last month. But the <strong>regulatory policy committee (RPC)</strong>, a body set up to scrutinise the quality of impact assessments, has published <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6740b7e829c74988c561ae1b/RPC_Opinion_-_Employment_Rights_Bill.pdf">a report</a> saying the work by the government for this is “not fit for purpose”. It says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The RPC has assessed eight of the 23 individual IAs as ‘not fit for purpose’ and six of these are in the ‘highest impact’ measure category in the summary IA. The overall assessment for the bill IA is therefore ‘not fit for purpose’. Given the number and reach of the measures, it would be proportionate to undertake labour market and broader macroeconomic analysis, to understand the overall impact on employment, wages and output, and particularly, the pass-through of employer costs to employees.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Commenting on the report, <strong>Andrew Griffith</strong>, the shadow business secretary, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Labour’s impact assessment for their radical trade union charter has been rated ‘not fit for purpose’ by the government’s own regulator.</p> 
   <p>But businesses up and down the country knew this already. Just like the national insurance Jobs’ Tax, this bill is the second wave of an attack on job creators.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> is paying tribute to Prescott now.</p> 
  <p>He says Prescott was the longest-serving deputy PM ever and “a politician for working people through and through”.</p> 
  <p>In many respects, Prescott was ahead of his time, Starmer says. He championed causes like tackling climate change, fighting regional inequality, supporting the minimum wage, improving public transport, and building council houses.</p> 
  <p>Prescott was “a skilled negotiator, sometimes with immense and perhaps surprising sensitivity”, Starmer says. He says Prescott had a talent for bringing people together who had different points of view. He was someone who was not in politics for himself, Starmer says. And he was someone who was a team player who would support a position in public, even if he had opposed it in private before the collective decision was taken.</p> 
  <p>UPDATE: <strong>Starmer</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Make no mistake, [Prescott] did things his own way, and forged his own path, and in doing so, he brought about some of the greatest transformation this country has ever seen, the linchpin of New Labour, because beneath the pugnacious exterior, John was a skilled negotiator, sometimes with immense and perhaps surprising sensitivity.</p> 
   <p>He had an incredible skill, which was the ability to bring people together from different starting points, whether that was his work on climate negotiations, or closer at home in his own party, to stand together in a better place. And that sums up another thing that the public, I think, sensed about John. He was not in it for himself.</p> 
   <p>He was a team player, and he was proud to play for Team Labour, that was never more evident than during the campaign season, when it was time to bring out the battle bus, which has become a tradition our deputy prime minister proudly continued this year, because the Prescott Express was a morale boost to any campaign.</p> 
   <p>It may have been arriving in a Tesco car park, but John was always met with a reception like Beatlemania and no wonder, the public were at the heart of John’s politics.</p> 
   <p>And it’s clear the public had a particular place in their heart for him too, and that was key to his popularity. And indeed, after the famous incident, it was the public who came out swinging for him.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Institute for Fiscal Studies proposes changes to inheritance tax extension to farms to make it fairer</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong> thinktank has published<a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/inheritance-tax-and-farms-0"> a paper</a> suggesting two changes to the government’s plans to extend inheritance tax to farms that it says would make them fairer. The IFS is broadly supportive of what the government is doing, but it accepts that the change in inheritance tax rules has disadvantaged elderly farmers who, if they knew this was coming, would have already given away their farms to their children. Summing up the IFS arguments, <strong>David Sturrock</strong>, one of the authors of the paper, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Inheritance tax [IHT] relief for agricultural and business assets favours those whose wealth is held in these forms rather than others. It also provides a tax incentive for agricultural land to be used by the wealthy as a way to avoid inheritance tax. That is unfair, inefficient and creates economic costs. </p> 
   <p>Those objecting to the change claim that paying IHT will have detrimental effects on food production or the environment. But if government wishes to promote food production or certain uses of land, there are much better ways of doing so than through an inheritance tax break. It is also objected, as a matter of principle, that this could result in families having to sell up and move on from farms that have been in the same family for generations. That is an argument against inheritance tax in general – it can have the same effect on family homes, for example – rather than a strong case for protecting certain forms of assets specifically. </p> 
   <p>The exact design of the tax change is important, and there are two mitigations which the government could consider. There is a good case for making unused portions of the new £1m allowance inheritable by a spouse or civil partner, as happens for the main inheritance tax allowances. In addition, current farm owners passing away in the next seven years (but after the new regime comes into force in April 2026) will not have had the opportunity to avoid inheritance tax by making lifetime gifts. If the government wished to give current farm owners the same opportunity to avoid inheritance tax as owners of other assets, it could, for example, make lifetime gifts of agricultural property made before a certain future date inheritance tax free, regardless of the timing of the death.</p>

  <p>Responding to the report, <strong>Tim Farron</strong>, the Lib Dem environment spokesperson, said</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The government hid behind the IFS to try and justify this disastrous policy. That very same organisation is now telling them that their own proposals need an overhaul.</p> 
   <p>It would be beggars belief for the government to continue to push forward with these stupid plans.</p> 
   <p>They need to swallow their pride, realise the damage this family farm tax will do and axe the tax.</p>

Referring to the Kemi Badenoch’s speech to the CBI, and her refusal to commit her party to reversing the rise in employers’ national insurance in the budget (see<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/25/uk-politics-live-assisted-dying-bill-labour-conservatives-starmer-reeves-badenoch?page=with:block-674483f78f086501868e94cb#block-674483f78f086501868e94cb"> 2.13pm</a>), a Labour spokesperson said:</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Badenoch says Tory policy review must go back to first principles, and not just involve minor tweaks</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Simon Jack</strong>, business editor of the BBC, asked Kemi Badenoch about her claim that there was an alternative to the budget plans. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/25/uk-politics-live-assisted-dying-bill-labour-conservatives-starmer-reeves-badenoch?page=with:block-674482b68f086501868e94bd#block-674482b68f086501868e94bd">2.03pm</a>.) If she did not agree with the taxes, what taxes would she raise instead? Or what services would she cut?</p> 
  <p><strong>Badenoch</strong> said she did not accept the premise of the question. She went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We need to stop looking at everything as if it’s just a ledger where there’s taxes raised and services delivered. Not everything that government does is public services. We can do things better. We can redesign things.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Badenoch suggested there was no need for government to set up a football regulator. Although this was just a “tiny thing”, it was an example of unnecessary, “burdensome” regulation.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That is why I’m not talking about which tax will tweak here or which service we’re going to cut there. We need to completely change the way we talk about how our economy works.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said she wanted “deep, real [policy] reviews, asking the right questions, not just a policy tweak here or there”. She went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

 <h2 class="block-title">Badenoch refuses to commit to reversing employers' national insurance rise in budget</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>During the Q&amp;A after her speech <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> would not commit to reversing the rise in employers’ national insurance in the budget.</p> 
  <p>Asked if she would give such a commitment, Badenoch said that, if a tax increase is not raising money, the Tories would reverse it. “One of the things that we’re going to have to do is rewire everything,” she said. But she said she would not “comment on every bit of micro-policy” now.</p> 
  <p>However, she did say the fact so many firms are complaining about the tax, and saying that it will make employing people on low wages unaffordable, meant that the government should “look again” at the plan. And that would be something the Tories would look at when they started work on their policy platform, she said.</p> 
  <p><em>UPDATE:</em> <strong>Badenoch</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Where we can see that a change that has been brought in in the budget ... will not raise any money, we will change that. What I’m not going to do is comment on every bit of micro-policy. There will be different budgets, there will be new things that occur, the system may change. </p> 
   <p>What I am starting with is principles, we believe that employer’s national insurance, while necessary to help us fund public services, is a tax on jobs.</p> 
   <p>The fact that so many organisations – especially those that have people who are on the lowest wages – are saying that this is becoming unaffordable means that we should look again, and that’s one of the first things that we’re going to be doing when we start our policy platform.</p>

   <p>We have got to be more precise when we talk about growth. It is not just about increased GDP. It is not even just about increased GDP per capita.

You can increase GDP per capita by getting more millionaires and billionaires to move to your country, but that won’t necessarily make everyone else better off. In fact, there are many studies that show even when nothing has changed, we are more likely to feel worse when we compare ourselves with those who are a lot wealthier than us. </p> 
   <p>I am talking about real growth, growth that people can see, growth that people can feel, seeing an improved environment around them, as well as having more money in their pockets to spend, knowing that we have enough money to provide security, to protect our families, but also to protect our country in increasingly dangerous times …</p>

  <p><strong>Badenoch</strong> says, as leader of the opposition, she wants to start by setting out principles, not policies.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>So what are our principles? I believe that we need to have free and fair competition, not monopolies, not rent seeking, not corporatism, but in genuine competition that allows new entrants in and those who are no longer productive to evolve or leave the economy. That is what free enterprise is about. </p> 
   <p>We Conservatives must be the party of business, not just big business, not just corporates, but small business, too. Every big business started out as a small business, and that is why I am so concerned that the burden on them is still increasing with taxes, corporation tax, employers’ national insurance and new regulations …</p> 
   <p>So I am here to show you that I understand businesses values. I am not here to represent business interests. That’s your job. I’m here to let you know the Conservative party shares your values. </p> 
   <p>I’m often criticised for talking about capitalism. Someone once told me that capitalism is old fashioned. I don’t think so. I think it is important that we explain what capitalism in a free market environment means. Capitalism is not a dirty word, wealth is not a dirty word, profit is not a dirty word. </p>

On Friday, the home secretary refused to say whether Mr Netanyahu would be detained if he travelled to the UK.

 <h2 class="block-title">No 10 defends Starmer saying spiking being made criminal offence even though it's illegal anyway</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Downing Street has defended Keir Starmer’s decision this morning to promote plans to make spiking a criminal offence (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/25/uk-politics-live-assisted-dying-bill-labour-conservatives-starmer-reeves-badenoch?page=with:block-67445c108f086501868e92f1#block-67445c108f086501868e92f1">11.16am</a>) – even thought it is already illegal.</p> 
  <p>Although No 10 said in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-pledges-joint-action-to-keep-women-and-girls-safe-at-night">its news release</a> that spiking will become “a new criminal offence”, not that it will become an offence for the first time, people following the news casually could be lulled into thinking the government is banning something that is currently legal. <strong>Starmer</strong> himself implied this earlier today when he posted this <a href="https://x.com/Keir_Starmer/status/1860956752524575054">on social media.</a></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Spiking will be made a criminal offence. </p> 
   <p>My government was elected to take back our streets, central to this mission is making sure women and girls can feel safe at night. </p> 
   <p>Perpetrators of spiking will feel the full force of the law.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked if this was misleading, the <strong>PM’s spokesperson</strong> told journalists at the lobby briefing this morning that the government was creating a new offence to “send a very clear signal” that offenders should expect punishment. He went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This new legislation will also empower victims to report offences and give them confidence that the justice system will support them.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>When it was put to him that Starmer’s tweet implied spiking was not already illegal, the spokesperson said the PM was referring to a new offence being created. </p> 
  <p>The spiking law is a good example of what the Economist’s Bagehot column described earlier this year as the “ban it harder” trend in British politics. “When it comes to tackling an injustice that is already against the law, the answer can be simple: ban it harder,” <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2024/02/14/ban-it-harder-an-unwelcome-new-trend-in-british-politics">Bagehot wrote</a>. On the subject of spiking in particular, the column said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Spiking, in which a victim’s drink is drugged in order to rob or assault them, is a terrifying crime. It was already prosecutable under seven separate offences before the Home Office proposed legal amendments in December 2023 to show “without any doubt, spiking is illegal”. But the reason why prosecutions are rare, and the true scale of spiking hard to define, is because hospitals do not routinely test for drugs in emergency wards. A new offence is unlikely to change that.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Foreign Office</strong> has announced a fresh wave of sanctions against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/14/russias-shadow-fleet-oil-tankers-grows-western-sanctions">Russia’s “shadow fleet” of oil tankers </a>which it is using to try to evade international restricitons on its oil importants.</p> 
  <p>In a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-imposes-new-wave-of-sanctions-choking-russian-oil-revenues-with-foreign-secretary-arriving-in-italy-for-g7">news release</a>, the Foreign Office said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Thirty ships in Russia’s shadow fleet, responsible for transporting billions of pounds worth of oil and oil products in the last year alone, have today been sanctioned by the UK. With half of the ships targeted today transporting more than $4.3bn worth of oil and oil products like gasoline in the last year alone, today is the largest UK package of its kind. </p> 
   <p>The move will further constrain the Kremlin’s ability to fund their illegal war in Ukraine and their malign activity worldwide, and brings the total number of oil tankers sanctioned by the UK to 73, more than any other nation - demonstrating the UK’s leadership on tackling the shadow fleet. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer dismisses online petition calling for general election, saying it's driven by people who never backed Labour anyway</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>This is what <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> told ITV’s Good Morning Britain when asked about <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/700143">the online petition</a> signed by 2 million people calling for an election on the grounds that “the current Labour government have gone back on the promises they laid out in the lead up to the last election”. Starmer said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Look, I remind myself that very many people didn’t vote Labour at the last election.</p> 
   <p>I’m not surprised that many of them want a rerun. That isn’t how our system works.</p> 
   <p>There will be plenty of people who didn’t want us in in the first place.</p> 
   <p>So, what my focus is on is the decisions that I have to make every day.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Calling for a general election now when we had one less than six months ago and when the government has a working majority of 163 is clearly bonkers. But the petition is attracting signatures because it is being strongly promoted by high-profile rightwinger provocateurs like <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1860731348962750677">the X owner Elon Musk </a>and the <a href="https://x.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1860678904710619545">Reform UK leader Nigel Farage</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> agrees that shoplifting is a terrible problem. And he says he will come back on the programme in the future to discuss how well he is doing this.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: The last time you were on this programme you said you would get your children a dog when you moved into No 10.</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> says he was in negotiations on that. But they have got a cat, he says, called Prince. But Prince has not yet met Larry, the Downing Street cat, he says (implying Prince does not leave the family flat). He says he is worried that Larry would win in a fight.</p> 
  <p>They end talking about Christmas, and cooking. Starmer says he does a lot of cooking, and that the dish his children like most is a pasta bake, with layers of sauce, with different cheeses. He likes to cook on a Saturday, he says. He says he is particularly proud of his tandoori salmon and tandoori Quorn.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">CBI chief says tax rises like those in budget should never be imposed on business by surprise again</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Rain Newton-Smith</strong>, the CBI chief executive, has given the government credit for “drawing the curtain on a near decade of instability at home”.</p> 
  <p>But, in line with the advance briefing, she also used her speech to the CBI conference this morning to argue that the tax rises in the budget will harm business. </p> 
  <p>She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What really defines growth is the decisions made in boardrooms up and down the country.</p> 
   <p>It’s CFOs [chief financial officers] asking, ‘can we afford to invest? Can we afford to expand? Can we afford to take a chance on new people?’</p> 
   <p>Well after the budget, the answer we’re hearing from so many firms is still ‘not yet’.</p> 
   <p>The rise in national insurance, the stark lowering of the threshold, caught us all off guard.</p> 
   <p>Along with the expansion and the rise of the national living wage – which everyone wants to accommodate – and the potential cost of the employment rights bill, they put a heavy burden on business.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She also said that tax rises like this should never be imposed on business by surprise again.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>From now on, we need to shift from consultation to co-design.</p> 
   <p>Tax rises like this must never again be simply done to business. That’s the road to unintended consequences.</p> 
   <p>Instead, we need an elevated partnership for a higher purpose.</p>

   <p>Yes, I would, but I would say always do it safely.</p> 
   <p>If you say something in the street that’s really worrying you, you should ring 999.</p>

  <p>In a statement released in advance, assistant chief constable Samantha Millar, the <strong>National Police Chiefs’ Council</strong> violence against women and girls strategic programme director, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Spiking is a complex offence to investigate as drugs can pass through the system quickly and there is often a lack of evidential opportunities, which is why quick reporting and early evidence gathering, including forensic testing, is key.</p> 
   <p>Police forces across the country have been working proactively to stop spiking from happening in the night-time economy and improve feelings of safety for women and girls. This includes regular, targeted patrols of busy town centres and visiting organisations, such as universities, to raise awareness of the symptoms of spiking.</p> 
   <p>Forces also work closely with bars, pubs and clubs to tackle spiking, and during the first national spiking police week of action in March, forces collectively visited over 1900 licensed venues to ensure that staff understood how to support victims.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>To coincide with the meeting, the <strong>British Transport Police</strong> says it is relaunching text-to-report number, 61016, which “is now free across all major networks, allowing women to discreetly contact British Transport Police for help if they are or someone else is being harassed on the train”.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning. There is plenty happening today. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, and Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, are both speaking at the CBI conference, where the CBI chief executive Rain Newton-Smith is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/nov/25/tax-rises-will-hit-growth-hiring-cbi-reeves-defends-budget-bank-of-england-interest-rates-pound-euro-dollar-business-live-news">warning about the impact of the budget on business.</a> Keir Starmer is hosting a meeting at Downing Street about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/thousands-of-bar-staff-in-england-and-wales-to-be-trained-to-spot-spiking">plans to protect women from spiking</a>. “My government was elected on a pledge to take back our streets, and we will never achieve this if women and girls do not feel safe at night,” he says. There will be tributes to John Prescott in the Commons this afternoon. But one issue is going to dominate the week, the vote on the assisted dying bill on Friday, and already that is a big topic of discussion.</p> 
  <p><strong>Jess Phillips</strong>, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, has been giving interviews this morning and she told the Today programme she is finding it impossible to predict if the bill will pass the second reading vote. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We do not know how this vote is going to go. I literally couldn’t call it for you at the moment …</p> 
   <p>Each week I think a different thing. Last week I thought it wouldn’t [pass]. This week I think it might. Honestly, I’ve learned over the years not to try and second guess parliament.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Phillips is not the only person finding the vote hard to call. <strong>Eleanor Langford</strong> from the i has been keeping a tally of how MPs intend to vote and <a href="https://x.com/eleanormia/status/1860777891207729170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1860777891207729170%7Ctwgr%5Efec2eceebb3eb2b58924624de11f78f5f189425e%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2Flive%2F2024%2Fnov%2F25%2Fvote-on-assisted-dying-bill-impossible-to-predict-says-minister">last night she published her figures on social media</a>.</p>

  <p>According to <strong>Janet Eastham</strong>’s <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/11/24/assisted-dying-bill-enough-support-pass-mp-driving-proposal/">story in the Daily Telegraph</a> today, supporters of the bill think it will pass – provided MPs who have said they support it are willing to vote for it.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A source close to the MPs campaigning in favour of legalisation told The Telegraph: “If all the MPs who have said they support the Bill turn out and vote for it, then it will pass.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>When MPs last voted on assisted dying, in 2015, the bill was easily defeated by 330 votes to 118. After the election many people assumed that the Labour landslide, and the drastic change in the composition of parliament, meant that there is now a majority for assisted dying. But in recent weeks there have been indications that opponents of the bill are gaining ground, in part because Wes Streeting, the health secretary, and Shabana Mahmood, the justice secretary (the two cabinet ministers who would have most responsibility for implementing assisted dying) have come out against it forcefully.</p> 
  <p>In interviews this morning Phillips said she would be voting for assisted dying, as she did in 2015. She also rejected the suggestion that Mahmood’s criticism of the bill could be disregarded because it was motivated by religion (something <strong>Charlie Falconer</strong>, the former Labour lord chancellor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/24/ministers-speaking-out-against-assisted-dying-false-impression-charlie-falconer">suggested yesterday</a>). Asked if it was wrong for Mahmood to impose her faith on others, <strong>Phillips</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>She will make the decision about how she votes on <em>assisted</em> dying on a matter of conscience, just exactly like I will. How she comes to that and what moral code she uses to come to that will be exactly the same as the moral code that I use to come to that decision as well …</p> 
   <p>I think that Shabana is making a decision on what she thinks is best for her constituents, like every constituency MP.</p>

  <p>I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.</p>
