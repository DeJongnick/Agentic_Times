<p>Following King Charles’s speech in Canada (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/27/king-charles-canada-parliament-speech-trump">27 May</a>), it is time to challenge the repeated claim by Donald Trump that Canada has been a freeloader on America with regard to defence. In the first world war, Canada lost around 61,000 people out of a population of 8 million. US combat deaths were 53,000 from 100 million. In the second world war, both nations lost similar proportions of their populations. </p> <p>Canada supplied quality and technical skills for the frontline, from the tunnellers of Vimy Ridge, portrayed in the Canadian parliament chamber, to the strategic bomber crews (40% Commonwealth) and the corvettes that protected American ships in the Battle of the Atlantic. </p> <p>In Britain, we benefited from Canadian generosity.
