<h1>Autumn budget 2017: Hammond announces stamp duty changes and slower growth - as it happened</h1>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In the spring, around the time Philip Hammond was preparing his first budget, some of those close to him suggested that the March budget was never intended to be that special because he was saving his big, structural changes for the autumn. Since then, the world has moved on somewhat and he came to the Commons today having made little impact with pre-budget announcements and with the expectation bar at what seemed like a Treasury all-time low. It felt as if he would be doing well not mess up.</p> 
  <p>And actually, by those criteria, he has succeeded. The budget was well received by his colleagues and, so far, nothing has fully unravelled. True, the Office for Budget Responsibility has exposed his main headline-grabbing measure, the abolition of stamp duty for first-time buyers for homes worth up to £300,000, as a £600m gimmick that will just push up prices. But, even though it would be nice to live in a world where bad policy always amounts to bad politics, sadly we don’t, and it is hard to see Hammond suffering any penalty for his home owner subsidy (apart from when he realises he has not got £600m to spend on something else). The Tory tribe (MPs and newspapers) will never complain about a tax cut, and it is not a measure that will be voted down in the Commons. (For example, we can’t even be sure Labour will vote against it.)</p> 
  <p>Otherwise, it was a mildly expansionist budget, with Hammond turning the taps on to the value of £9bn just as the UK is leaving the EU. The Tory Brexiters who view Hammond with suspicion will like the extra money for hard Brexit contingency planning. Hammond did a bit to allay concerns about universal credit. And there was some more money for the NHS. Not enough, NHS England say, and Hammond’s failure to even mention social care shows that this was not a budget with long-term ambition. But it will probably see him through. For now.</p> 
  <p>That’s all from us.</p> 
  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p>

  <p><strong>The reaction to today’s budget in the financial markets is quite muted.</strong></p> 
  <p>Although building firms have been hit by the threatened clampdown on land banks, the FTSE 100 actually ended the day up 0.1%. The pound also shrugged off the growth downgrades, it’s up half a cent against the US dollar and flat against the euro.</p> 
  <p>Why?</p> 
  <p>Because the OBR’s new downgraded <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/nov/22/autumn-budget-2017-philip-hammond-tax-spending-growth-deficit-politics-live?page=with:block-5a15800e77262906759b1792#block-5a15800e77262906759b1792">growth forecasts</a> basically tell the City what it already knew - the UK’s economy faces a challenging few years, and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/nov/22/autumn-budget-2017-philip-hammond-tax-spending-growth-deficit-politics-live?page=with:block-5a1595967b0a7b06af58fcfd#block-5a1595967b0a7b06af58fcfd">productivity puzzle</a> remains unsolved, despite the measures Hammond announced today.</p> 
  <p>The OBR hasn’t thrown in the towel completely on productivity. Its new forecasts are mid-way between the good old days before the crisis, and the sloth-like progress since. </p> 
  <p>But there’s still a lot of uncertainty about whether technology improvements will actually deliver productivity benefits in the years ahead. And without it, Britain will keep racking up debts...</p>

  <p>Richard Buxton, head of UK equities at investment manager Old Mutual, argues that little has changed economically today.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Hammond may have used a little sleight of hand (the reclassification of housing associations being an obvious example) to give himself a little headroom at this juncture.</p> 
   <p>In practice, however, he appears to have kept the vast majority of his powder dry, cognisant that there may well be a time, as Brexit approaches, when more radical action is merited.</p>

  <p>The history books may also record today as the moment that the government gave up making a profit on the bailout of Royal Bank of Scotland. Selling that stake will help cut the national debt by £15bn, but will also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/nov/22/autumn-budget-2017-philip-hammond-tax-spending-growth-deficit-politics-live?page=with:block-5a158f697b0a7b06af58fcbc#block-5a158f697b0a7b06af58fcbc">crystallise a lose of around £26bn (based on today’s share price</a>).</p>

  <p>Lib Dem leader<strong> Vince Cable</strong> urged caution after the budget revealed plans put a deadline on when the government will start selling its £24bn stake in Royal Bank of Scotland, by March 2019. Cable said the share price meant it was the wrong time to sell the shares at their current price. He told reporters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Today’s share price I believe is far below the acquisition price and we always argued in the coalition. Osborne accepted it was utterly wrong to start selling shares before you can recoup the basic taxpayer outlay and then you have to allow for a bit of inflation. </p> 
   <p>So that would be rather desperate I think. And we know there are these continuing legacy problems around RBS. This is not the time to sell the shares in RBS.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The former business secretary said the chancellor had been severely restricted by the downgrading of the growth figures and the unexpected rise in borrowing, which he estimated would cost every person £700 per year compared to pre-election forecast. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The chancellor talked about Britain being the sixth biggest economy in the world, as long as I can remember it was the fifth, but it is now the sixth. This is France overtaking the UK in the last year, India is fairly close behind.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Cable, who said he backed much of what the government was doing on skills and industrial strategy, also expressed concern about the £3bn allocated to Brexit preparations. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The fact they are having to pay that upfront on the possibility we will crash out is revealing and politically very damaging.</p> 
   <p>The £3bn does not deal with the massive economic dislocation of Brexit, which is multiple many times that. This is the physical infrastructure costs associated with the change in the regulatory regime, it’s a tiny fraction of the costs associated with Brexit.<br></p>

The budget for justice is now forecast to fall an initial £400m next year from £6.6bn in 2017/18 to £6.2bn in 2018/19, then to £6bn for 2019/20.

 <h2 class="block-title">Small print alert: Rollout of universal credit to be slowed down</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In his budget speech Philip Hammond announced a range of measures to help universal credit claimants. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>First, we will remove the seven day waiting period applied at the beginning of a benefit claim so that entitlement to universal credit will start on the day of the claim. We have looked at reducing the delay at the end of the first month assessment period. But to do so would mean compromising the principle of payments being made on the same day of the month. A key feature of the system which is very important for claimants in managing their budgets. So to provide greater support during the waiting period we will change the advances system to ensure that any household that needs it can access a full month’s payment within five days of applying.</p> 
   <p>We will make it possible to apply for an advance online. And we will extend the repayment period for advances from 6 months to 12 months. Any new universal credit claimant in receipt of housing benefit, will continue to receive it for two weeks. This is a £1.5bn package to address concerns about the delivery of the benefit.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But he did not tell MPs that the rollout of universal credit was being slowed down. That is revealed in the red book, which says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>To support these changes the government will roll out universal credit more gradually between February 2018 and April 2018, and roll-out to all jobcentres will be complete in December 2018. </p>

   <p>The government says it will make it easier for HMRC to prosecute Amazon and eBay for facilitating this activity.

   <p>Three new pilot schemes for rough sleepers simply doesn’t cut it. It is a disaster for those people sleeping on our streets, forced to beg for the money for a night shelter. They’re looking for action now from government to give them a roof over their heads.</p>

   <p>This system has been run down by 3 billion of cuts to work allowances, the two-child limit and the perverse and appalling rape clause, and caused evictions because housing benefit isn’t paid direct to the landlord.</p>

   <p>The chancellor has not been clear today - not for NHS workers, our police, firefighters, teachers, teaching assistants, bin collectors, tax collectors or armed forces personnel. Why does the government think its OK to under pay, over stress and under appreciate all those that work within our NHS?</p> 
   <p>We’ll wait for the small print on today’s announcement, but even what he’s said falls well short of the £6bn Labour would have delivered from our June manifesto.</p>

   <p>With this government delivering the worst rate of house building since the 1920s and 250,000 fewer council homes, any commitment would be welcome.</p> 
   <p>But we’ve been here before. The government promised 200,000 starter homes three years ago. Not a single one has yet been built in those three years. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Housing reforms: What the experts say</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><a href="https://rapleys.com/teammember/jason-lowes/"><strong>Jason Lowes</strong></a>, planning partner at property consultancy <strong>Rapleys</strong>, says the budget is no ‘magic bullet’ for Britain’s housing problems.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“While many in the property industry will be buoyed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/nov/22/autumn-budget-2017-philip-hammond-tax-spending-growth-deficit-politics-live?page=with:block-5a157dea77262906759b177a#block-5a157dea77262906759b177a">the reforms to Stamp Duty Land Tax for first time buyers</a> and Business Rates, the lack of progress on planning risks undermining what was, we were led to believe, intended to be a blockbuster housing Budget.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Jon Ostler</strong>, UK CEO of personal finance site<strong> <a href="https://t.co/Q2t4mub1E4">Finder.com</a></strong>, also thinks the government fell short:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“In order to truly help first-time buyers in the short term, the government would need to offer a far greater incentive. We can learn from our friends in Australia who offered significant grants to first-time buyers of between £4,000 and £10,000, this level of investment proved to make a real difference to the number of first homes bought.</p> 
   <p>As it stands, first-time buyers in the UK are going to have to rely on the delivery of the Governments house building investment and initiatives to deliver affordable housing, but this could take some time.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Campbell Robb</strong>, chief executive of the independent <strong>Joseph Rowntree Foundation</strong>, argues that Philip Hammond simply focused his help on the wrong people:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“The Government’s big spending commitments for stamp duty giveaways and tax cuts prioritised higher earning households, with little support for people who need it most.</p> 
   <p>“The Government could have demonstrated it was on the side of low income families by lifting the freeze and providing a clear plan to deliver 80,000 genuinely affordable homes a year in England, instead of more funding for people who can already afford to buy.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Small print alert: OBR still in the dark about Brexit</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Office for Budget Responsibility sound rather irked with the government over its failure to give more information about Brexit.</strong><br></p> 
  <p>The independent fiscal watchdog says it “once again” asked the government to provide detail on likely trade and migration policies after Britain has left the EU, and some clarity on what we might pay into the EU budget.</p> 
  <p>But the government refused to pay ball, and merely pointed the OBR at Theresa May’s speech in Florence two months ago, and a white paper on trade policy from February (!).</p> 
  <p>That, the OBR says, isn’t enough:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Given the uncertainty regarding how the Government will respond to the choices and tradeoffs it faces during the negotiations, we still have no meaningful basis on which to form a judgement as to their final outcome and upon which we can then condition our forecast. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p> So, today’s forecasts are based on Brexit occurring in March 2019, with two rather broad-brush assumptions:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>The negotiation of new trading arrangements with the EU and others slows the pace of import and export growth over the 10 years following the referendum. We calibrated this slowdown on the basis of a range of external studies of different possible trade regimes and assumed offsetting impacts from exports and imports on GDP growth.<br></li> 
   <li>The UK adopts a tighter migration regime following departure from the EU than that currently in place, but not sufficiently tight to reduce net inward migration to the desired ‘tens of thousands’.<br></li>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The<strong> Office for Budget Responsibility </strong>is damning about Philip Hammond’s proposal to abolish stamp duty for first-time buyers for homes worth up to £300,000. This is what it is saying.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The OBR says the stamp duty cut will push house prices up. </strong>It says it expects this policy to increase prices by 0.3%. Most of this effect will occur in 2018, it says.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We expect this to increase house prices by 0.3 per cent, an estimate consistent with our published price elasticities for stamp duty changes. Most of this effect is expected to occur in 2018. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>It says that the main gainers will be people who already own property, not first-time buyers.</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We assume that a temporary relief would feed one-for-one into house prices, but a permanent one will have twice that effect. On this basis, post-SDLT [stamp duty land tax prices] prices paid by FTBs [first-time buyers] would actually be higher with the relief than without it. Thus the main gainers from the policy are people who already own property, not the FTBs themselves.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>It says a Treasury review of <a draggable="true" href="http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/mortgageshome/article-1696608/First-time-buyer-stamp-duty-break-may-go.html">a temporary stamp-duty holiday for first-time buyers</a> announced by the Labour chancellor Alistair Darling in his final budget concluded that it was effectively a failure. </strong>Darling announced the move as a response to the financial crash. But the OBR says:</li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Eligibility criteria match those of the post-crisis ‘stamp duty holiday’, although then the relief stopped at £250,000. HMRC published an evaluation part way through that holiday. It concluded that the majority of the value of relief had fed through to higher house prices and that it ‘has not had a significant impact in terms of improving the affordability of residential property for FTBs. It is estimated that most of the buyers who benefited from the relief would have purchased property in its absence anyway (ie are deadweight).’ Confirmation that the relief would end was announced alongside the evaluation. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>It says the policy will produce a cliff-edge effect for homes worth just over £500,000.</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A rate of 5% will be charged on the value between £300,001 and £500,000. But FTBs buying a property for £500,001 or more will not benefit from the relief at all, so a purchase at that price would be liable to £5,000 more in SDLT than one at £500,000. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Small print alert: RBS share sales flatter debt figures</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Now this is interesting. The government’s deficit figures include £15bn from the sale of some of the taxpayers’ stake in Royal Bank of Scotland.</strong></p> 
  <p>That sales, over the next five years, allowed Philip Hammond to boast about cutting the national debt as a share of GDP from next year.</p> 
  <p>That claim was also dependent on the recent decision to move local housing associations in England off the public books.</p> 
  <p>That’s according to the OBR, which says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Despite the deterioration in our underlying forecast, the tax and spending giveaway, and extra lending through help to buy, the government has ensured that net debt still falls fractionally as a share of GDP in 2018-19 and by more beyond.</p> 
   <p>It has achieved this largely by announcing fresh sales of RBS shares and by passing regulations that ease local and central government control over housing associations in England. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>These charts show the details:</p> 
  <p>RBS’s shares are trading at 271p today, compared to the break-even price of 502p. So any sale could come at a hefty loss to the taxpayer, which rescued the bank from collapse in 2008.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Well, that wasn’t quite as boring as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pestonitv/posts/1951197335205002">some people were expecting</a>. Philip Hammond has a reputation for being rather humourless, but he injected far more jokes than is usual for a budget speech and he managed to conclude with a surprise stamp duty announcement likely to play well with the tabloid press. <br></p> 
  <p>Whether or not abolishing stamp duty for first-time buyers will actually bring down prices is an entirely different matter; if anything, it seems just as likely that it will allow sellers to increase prices. And in cash terms, it is not a huge giveaway. <br></p> 
  <p>The red book has just landed on my desk, and it shows that the measure will only cost the Exchequer around £600m a year over the course of this parliament. This was the headline-grabber at the top of a package of measures that otherwise sounded pragmatic but relatively unambitious. <br></p> 
  <p>Will this be enough for the budget to be judged as a success (by the low expectations set in advance)? It is too early to know, but it does seem possible.</p>

  <p><strong>The chancellor tried to distract us with some jokes, the stamp duty rabbit, and even a packet of cough lozenges from the PM.</strong><br></p> 
  <p>However the underlying message is that the UK economy is rather weaker than we thought back in March. Growth is going to slow steadily over the next three years – not what’s needed as the country faces the Brexit unknown.</p> 
  <p>The new growth forecasts mean the economy is now expected to grow at below its long-term trend growth until well into the next decade.</p> 
  <p>This chart shows the damage, which is caused by Britain’s weak productivity.</p> 
  <p>Growth:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>2017: 1.5%, down from 2% in March’s budget<br></li> 
   <li>2018: 1.4%, down from 1.6% <br></li> 
   <li>2019: 1.3%, down from 1.7% <br></li> 
   <li>2020: 1.3%, down from 1.9% <br></li> 
   <li>2021: 1.6%, down from 2.0% <br></li>

  <p>The good news is that Britain will borrow over £8bn less than expected this year, at £49.9bn, not the £58.3bn inked in before.</p> 
  <p>The bad news is that the deficit will shrink more slowly towards the end of this decade. On today’s forecasts, the annual deficit will still be 1.3% of GDP at the end of the forecast horizon – twice as large as expected.<br></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>PMQs - Snap verdict: </strong>Who cares, really, given it’s budget day, which will be something of a relief to Corbyn, who didn’t really cause May much trouble. She made a crass error in her final reply, but otherwise she brushed aside Corbyn’s attacks on Brexit and on tax avoidance with surprising ease. Surprising, because Corbyn was raising an issue, Brexit and Ireland, where the government’s position is extraordinarily weak. But it was a revelation to hear Corbyn raise Brexit in the first place because generally it is a topic that he has avoided (probably because it is an area where Labour itself is divided, and where Labour’s stance is in some respects fudged). Still, all soon forgotten ...</p>

  <p>Corbyn says the government voted down an amendment to the EU withdrawal bill last night on workers’ rights. Turning to tax avoidance, he asks if May will adopt new measures on this. Or is she threatening to turn Britain into a tax haven?</p> 
  <p>May says she will take no lectures on this. The government has raised more than £160bn by measures on tax avoidance, she says.</p> 
  <p>Corbyn says David Cameron blocked EU proposals for a public register of tax. When it comes to Brexit, this government is a shambles, he says. The Tories promise action on tax avoidance. But they vote against it, he says. The government has no energy, no agreed plan and no strategy to deliver a good Brexit for Britain.</p> 
  <p>May says it was Labour that refused to allow tax avoidance measures to go through in a bill before the election. On Monday 76 Labour MPs voted in a different lobby from the front bench on customs measures, she claims.</p> 
  <p><em>May is wrong about that. The division list is <a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2017-11-20/division/FB49F543-632D-456D-BD2D-8CA03CF3FEC8/DutiesOfCustoms?outputType=Party">here.</a> There were 76 opposition MPs voting for the amendment, but around half of those were from the SNP. There were only 28 Labour MPs voting in favour, against the Labour whip which said they should abstain. </em></p>

She says she wants to get on to deal with the future trading relationship. Labour cannot decide whether it wants to be in or out of the single market and customs union.</p>

  <p><strong>Theresa May</strong> echoes what Corbyn said about the bombing.</p> 
  <p>On Ireland, she says she has repeatedly said the common travel area will continue to operate. And, on trade and goods, there will be no hard border introduced. The government does not want physical infrastructure at the border.</p> 
  <p>Corbyn says the government has had 17 months to explain how this will work. The government has not engaged, he says. He says John Redwood, the Conservative MP, is a strategist for an investment firm. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/13/labour-accuses-john-redwood-of-talking-britain-down">He recently advised people to invest abroad</a>.

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A new homelessness reduction taskforce will be launched, aiming to halve the number of rough sleepers by 2022 and reduce it to zero by 2027. </p> 
   <p>The budget will commit £20 million to schemes that support people who are on the brink of homelessness. “We want everyone to have a roof over their heads, and that’s why we’ve committed to eliminating rough-sleeping by 2027,” Mr Hammond said. </p> 
   <p>“This new taskforce will be an important first step in the fight. I want to commend the Evening Standard for its tireless campaigning on homelessness, keeping this important issue in the front of people’s minds.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In 1947 Hugh Dalton resigned as chancellor after giving information to an evening paper about the contents of his budget that got published in the paper before the budget statement was over. But that was information about tax increases, which was more sensitive.</p>

  <p>The budget will, we were told by May’s spokesman, “adopt a balanced approach” between preserving the public finances and investment in areas such as the NHS and housing.</p> 
  <p>Hammond set out what he termed “a vision for post-Brexit Britain” with his budget, and - as is traditional – received an adulatory round of banging on the cabinet table by colleagues once he’d finished.</p> 
  <p>Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were among other ministers to speak, May’s spokesman said – and the latter did not <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/gove-shows-off-his-vocabulary-of-long-economicky-words-5cs9822gg">use any long, “economicky” terms</a>.</p>

  <p>Shelter has some interesting research that shows why Philip Hammond really needs to think about policies on housing – and not just home owners but renters too. </p> 
  <p>In 2010, the Conservative party was ahead by a few points among people living in the private rented sector, but in 2015 Labour had a lead of just over 10 points with that group – and by 2017 it was well over 20 points. That rises to over 30 for the social rented sector. The Tory lead has even been squeezed to just a few points for those with mortgages.</p> 
  <p>The figures also shows that the Tories’ support dropped most dramatically in English marginals with the highest proportion of renting households.</p> 
  <p>It also shows that groups labelled as “young JAMs and liberal youth” consider housing to be one of the issues they care most about, with the vast majority thinking the situation is getting worse and worse.</p>

   <p>In the round, however, I wouldn’t be at all surprised if this is the most dull budget of the 60 odd (if you include autumn statements) that it’s been my joy and privilege to cover in an absurdly long career as a hack.</p> 
   <p>Which points to this government’s most serious weakness.</p> 
   <p>It desperately needs to do big, bold and imaginative things, to prove to voters it has a vision and is in charge.</p> 
   <p>But with its non-existent parliamentary majority, and the permanent threat of revolting MPs, it can’t do anything big, let alone bold.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>And there will of course be decisions announced today that will have an impact on people’s lives. There will be more money for the NHS, although not as much as they have asked for, there will be new policies to try to encourage house-building, there will probably be changes to universal credit, there will be measures that will make a difference to firms around the country.</p> 
   <p>But for the Treasury today there’s no big bazooka - boring is good.</p> 
   <p>It is possible of course that the Treasury has simply been managing expectations. By leading people to believe there’s not much to see, anything that seems a modest success might feel like a decent win.</p> 
   <p>But the first political responsibility of Number 11 today is to try to avoid mistakes. Inspiring? Perhaps not. Vital to the prospects for the government and Philip Hammond’s career? Most definitely so.</p>

  <p>The services became subject to VAT when they were formed in 2013, when ministers at Holyrood merged regional forces together to create the two new national bodies.

 <h2 class="block-title">How the last three budgets have all backfired</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>All governments and chancellors have to perform U-turns from time to time. But the Treasury are probably particularly nervous about today because, remarkably, all three of the last budgets have ended up with the chancellor having to abandon one of the principal revenue-raising measures he announced. These weren’t relatively trivial U-turns, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/28/george-osborne-u-turns-pasties-caravans">like George Osborne’s pasty tax one.</a> (The pasty tax was a headline-grabber, but in fiscal terms, it was relatively trivial.) These U-turns all involved a central plank of the budget collapsing.</p> 
  <p>The fact that three budgets in a row have backfired so badly is partly a reflection of economic circumstances, and partly a reflection of what happens when a government has a small majority (as the Tories did between 2015 and 2017).</p> 
  <p>The first huge U-turn came after George Osborne’s summer budget in 2015. He announced plans to cut £4.4bn from tax credits. But this prompted a revolt in the Lords, and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/nov/25/george-osborne-taps-27bn-windfall-for-tax-credits-u-turn"> Osborne abandoned the cuts in his autumn statement.</a></p> 
  <p>Osborne announced another big welfare cut in his spring budget in 2016, a cut to personal independence payments (a disability benefit) worth more than a £1bn a year by the end of the parliament. But that triggered Iain Duncan Smith’s resignation as work and pensions secretary and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/stephen-crabb-government-u-turns-disability-cuts-leaves-budget-disarray"> within a week of the budget the government cancelled the cuts.</a></p> 
  <p>And in the spring this year, in his first budget as chancellor, Philip Hammond announced an increase in national insurance contributions for the self-employed. It was one of the only major announcements in the whole statement. But Hammond had not realised how damaging it would be breaking a Tory election promise, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/mar/15/philip-hammond-ditches-national-insurance-rise-for-self-employed">a week after his budget he had to perform a humiliating U-turn.</a></p>

      <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility is the government’s independent forecaster, which gives its verdict on the outlook for growth and the public finances twice a year.</p>
      <p>The forecasts are published to coincide with the chancellor’s two big set pieces of the year – the autumn budget and the spring statement – and takes into account the impact of any tax and spending measures announced in those statements.</p>
      <p>The OBR also uses its public finances forecasts to judge the Treasury’s performance against the chancellor’s fiscal targets, stating whether or not it has a greater than 50% chance of hitting the targets under current policy.</p>
      <p>It was established in 2010 by the then chancellor George Osborne with the aim of improving the credibility of the government’s official forecasts for growth. The forecasts were previously produced by the Treasury itself and often criticised for being unrealistic.</p>
      <p>The OBR is led by three members of the budget responsibility committee, including chairman Robert Chote, a former director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, with support from the OBR’s permanent staff of 27 civil servants.</p>

  <p><strong>It’s worth noting that Britain can borrow rather cheaply at present.</strong></p> 
  <p>Over in the City, UK 10-year government debt is changing hands at a yield (or interest rate) of under 1.3%. Back in 2008, it cost Britain over 4% per year to borrow for a decade.</p> 
  <p>So, why not use this opportunity to invest more in infrastructure and training?</p> 
  <p><strong>Anastasia Nesvetailova</strong>, professor of political economy at <strong>City University</strong>, thinks it’s a no-brainer.</p> 
  <p>She told Radio 4’s Today Programme that the UK would find plenty of buyers for additional debt to repair the damage caused by austerity.</p> 
  <p>Nesvetailova argued:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The UK can borrow very easily in the international markets. Big institutional investors need government paper [debt] as a safe asset for their financial investment.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But <strong>Rupert Harrison</strong>, former advisor to George Osborne, argues that Hammond should stick to his goal of getting the deficit down.</p> 
  <p>As Harrison put it:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“There’s a risk that we get complacent and think that the job’s done, that we can run 3% budget deficits indefinitely.</p> 
   <p>That would be failing to learn from what happened in the run-up to the crisis in the 2000s when we ran big deficits.</p> 
   <p>We would go into the next crisis even more vulnerable than last time, with a higher level of debt, and having failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining…</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>But.... if extra borrowing was used wisely, then the economy would grow faster, meaning debt as a percentage of GDP could actually be lower in the long term. </strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Economics preview: Productivity pain means little gain for Hammond</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The economic challenges facing Philip Hammond as he drew up this budget are as tricky as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2017/nov/22/autumn-budget-2017-philip-hammond-tax-spending-growth-deficit-politics-live?page=with:block-5a153040092af00708ebb803#block-5a153040092af00708ebb803">the political ones</a>.</strong><br></p> 
  <p>With growth having slowed this year, real pay shrinking, and the Brexit bill looming, Britain’s economic outlook is rather challenging. So it’s hard for the chancellor to “seize the opportunities for Britain” and “invest to secure a bright future” (as he’s expected to pledge today).</p> 
  <p>Hammond’s situation is complicated because the independent Office for Budget Responsibility will revise down its estimate of Britain’s long-term productivity gains, and economic growth. The OBR has (belatedly?) concluded that Britain’s economy isn’t going to bounce back from the financial crisis, and output per worker probably won’t recover to its pre-crisis rate of growth of around 2.1%.</p> 
  <p>The larger the downgrade, the greater the impact to future tax revenues and earnings growth — meaning a larger budget deficit in the years ahead.<br></p> 
  <p>So Hammond is going to lose much of the ‘headroom’ he created for himself in the last budget to protect the economy through the Brexit process. The Resolution Foundation estimate this cash war chest has shrunk from £25bn to £14bn - quite a deterioration since March.</p> 
  <p>The chancellor is likely to announce that Britain has borrowed less than expected this year, following better-than-expected tax receipts since March. But borrowing is likely to be higher than expected towards the end of the forecasting period, thanks to the OBR’s gloomier outlook.<br></p> 
  <p>That means there simply may not be the financial firepower for the radical measures Britain needs, without Hammond tearing up his goal of cutting the deficit to below 2% of GDP in 2020-21, and balancing the budget sometime in the next decade.</p> 
  <p>But the chancellor does have one card up his sleeve. English housing associations are being reclassified as part of the private sector, which takes £5bn of borrowing off the books. That could provide some wiggle room to invest in, say, housing or boost public sector pay.</p> 
  <p>Hammond is expected to announce support for Britain’s high-tech industry to develop technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. That could help boost productivity in future years, but only if the UK can compete with the budgets of massive US players like Tesla, Apple, Google....</p> 
  <p>In short, it’s a difficult budget -- something Hammond could probably do without right now. Economically, the Brexit talks are likely to have a bigger impact on the UK’s future than whatever the chancellor pulls out of the red box today.<br></p>

  <p>According to the BBC news this morning, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, will stand up at 12.30pm to deliver a budget intended to “revive the government’s fortunes”. Good luck with that. A more jaundiced view might be that his primary goal is to avoid catastrophe.</p> 
  <p>The first budget after a general election is normally the one chancellors use to raise taxes. But given that the Conservative party on its own doesn’t have a parliamentary majority, and that the voters’ tolerance of austerity seems to have reached its limit, Hammond has very little room for manoeuvre. My colleague Larry Elliott, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/21/philip-hammond-budget-november-2017">in his pre-budget analysis, </a>reckons it will be “the trickiest budget for a generation”.</p> 
  <p>It would be a challenge for even the most creative, dexterous, authoritative chancellor. But Hammond is not that man. He was chosen by Theresa May as a steady, City-friendly, fiscally conservative safe-pair-of-hands unlikely to overshadow her, but since then their relationship has deteriorated swiftly and he only avoided the sack after the general election because the result left her too weak to move him. But his long-term future at Number 11 is uncertain and there has been speculation that he could be moved in a reshuffle. Only last week Nick Timothy, May’s co chief of staff until June and for many years someone whose views were thought to be interchangeable with hers, wrote<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/nov/14/theresa-may-ally-accuses-hammond-of-vetoing-politics-promoting-economic-justice-politics-live?page=with:block-5a0aab4922c4a1070a15d00f#block-5a0aab4922c4a1070a15d00f"> a column in the Sun deriding him as useless</a> (I paraphrase, but only a bit). The Tory right would like to see him go because he’s accused of Brexit thoughtcrime (he thinks it’s a lousy idea, and finds it hard to pretend otherwise). And his last budget backfired when <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-39287222">he had to abandon one its main money-raising measures within a week. </a>For the chancellor, a budget that doesn’t lead to a U-turn and sees him still in his job at Christmas would amount to a result of sorts. Anything else would be a welcome bonus.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>I’ll be covering the build-up to the budget, the announcement itself, and the reaction with my colleague Graeme Wearden. After Hammond sits down we will be focusing particularly on the “small print” in the budget, the surprise and hidden announcements buried in the red book. We will also be flagging up the best analysis.</p> 
  <p>The key timings are:</p> 
  <p><em>12pm: </em>PMQs (we will cover the May/Corbyn exchanges, and budget-related comments)</p> 
  <p><em>12.30pm:</em> Hammond’s budget statement.</p> 
  <p><em>3pm:</em> Office for Budget Responsibility press conference.</p>
