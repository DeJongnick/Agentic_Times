<p>In a social media post on Sunday, Donald Trump has demanded homeless residents of Washington DC leave the country’s capital or face eviction, and again promised to use federal officers to jail criminals, even though violent crime in the city was at a 30-year low when he took office in January.</p> 
<p>“The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115005075016157889">wrote</a> on his Truth Social platform Sunday morning, shortly after being driven from the White House to his golf club in Virginia. “We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.”</p> 
<p>The post was illustrated with four photographs, all apparently taken from the president’s motorcade along the route from the White House to his golf course. Two of the images showed a total of 10 tents pitched on the grass <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/JikooXgeo6WaTt8P8">along a highway on-ramp</a> just over a mile from the White House. The third image showed a single person sleeping on the steps of the American Institute of Pharmacy Building <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/A7BAgYRyovuhCmPX7">on Constitution Avenue</a>. The fourth image showed the line of vehicles that whisk Trump to his golf course passing a small amount of roadside litter <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/2s4HMpTqKwFELd2R6">on the E Street Expressway</a>, near the Kennedy Center.</p> 
<p>Trump’s post promoted a previously announced news conference on Monday, which he has promised, “will, essentially, stop violent crime” in the capital district, without explaining how. In a subsequent post, he said that the news conference at 10am Monday, “will not only involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation’s Capital, but will also be about Cleanliness”.</p> 
<p>The Free DC movement, which advocates for self-determination, immediately scheduled <a href="https://freedcproject.org/event-list/dc-is-our-home-trump-cant-have-it">a protest</a> on Monday to coincide with Trump’s news conference.</p> 
<p>Despite Trump’s claims, there is no epidemic of homelessness or violent crime in the capital.</p> 
<p>According to the Community Partnership, which works to prevent homelessness in Washington DC, <a href="https://community-partnership.org/homelessness-in-dc/">on any given night</a> there are about 800 unsheltered persons sleeping outdoors in the city of about 700,000 people. A further 3,275 people use emergency shelters in Washington, and 1,065 people are in transitional housing facilities.</p> 
<p>Trump’s repeated claims that it might be necessary to federalize law enforcement in the city to make it safe also ignores data collected by the Metropolitan police department, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/violent-crime-dc-hits-30-year-low">released in January</a> by the federal government, which showed that violent crime in Washington DC in 2024 was down 35% from 2023 and was at the lowest level in over 30 years.</p> 
<p>“We are not experiencing a crime spike,” Washington DC’s mayor, Muriel Bowser, <a href="https://youtu.be/WJaGVJdcFRk?si=ibULqinrR1tOJoiv&amp;t=102">told MSNBC</a> on Sunday. “We have spent over the last two years driving down violent crime in this city, driving it down to a 30-year low.” She added that Washington DC police statistics show that violent crime is down a further 26% so far this year.</p> 
<p>“Federal law enforcement is always on the street in DC, and we always work cooperatively with them” Bowser said, adding the the Washington DC national guard, which Trump has threatened to deploy, is under the control of the president.</p> 
<p>Earlier this week, Trump ordered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/08/trump-violent-crime-crackdown-dc">a surge of federal officers</a> from a variety of agencies to increase patrols in Washington DC, pointing to the assault on a young federal worker who came to Washington to work with Elon Musk as evidence that the city’s police force was failing to combat violent crime. Washington DC police, however, had <a href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/release/mpd-makes-two-arrests-swann-street-attempted-carjacking">stopped the assault</a> Trump focused attention on, and arrested two 15-year-old suspects at the scene.</p> 
<p>Asked by Reuters, the White House declined to explain what legal authority Trump would use to evict people from Washington. The president controls only federal land and buildings in the city.</p> 
<p>The US Congress has control of the city’s budget but the <a href="https://dccouncil.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Home-Rule-Act-2018-for-printing-9-13-182.pdf">DC Home Rule Act</a>, signed into law in 1973 by Richard Nixon, gives Washington DC residents the right to elect the mayor, council members, and neighborhood commissioners to run day-to-day affairs in the district.</p> 
<p>Trump told reporters on Wednesday that White House lawyers were “already studying” the possibility of legislation to overturn the law granting the Washington DC self-rule and imposing direct federal control of the capital.</p> 
<p>“Even if crime in D.C. weren’t at a historic low point, President Trump’s comments would be misguided and offensive to the more than 700,000 people who live permanently in the nation’s capital,” Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents DC as a nonvoting delegate in congress said in <a href="https://norton.house.gov/media/press-releases/norton-statement-after-trump-threatens-federalize-dc-police-and-call-dc">a statement</a>. “D.C. residents, a majority of whom are Black and brown, are worthy and capable of governing themselves without interference from federal officials who are unaccountable to D.C.”</p> 
<p>“The only permanent remedy that will protect D.C.’s ability to govern itself is enactment of my D.C. statehood bill into law,” the 88-year-old congresswoman added.</p>
