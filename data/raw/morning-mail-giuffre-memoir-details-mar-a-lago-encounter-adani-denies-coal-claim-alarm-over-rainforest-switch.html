<p>Morning everyone. Today we publish an exclusive extract from the posthumous memoir of Virginia Giuffre, which recalls the day an “apex predator” recruited her from Mar-a-Lago.</p> 
<p>Extreme temperatures are pushing Australia’s tropical rainforests over the edge to where they are switching from a mass absorber of carbon to being an emissions source, according to alarming new research. We’re also reporting on claims Adani has sold coal under market rates, reducing royalties to the Queensland government – an analysis that the miner denies.</p> 
<p>Plus: why aisle tickets will soon cost more at some sports venues.</p>
