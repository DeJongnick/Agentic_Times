<p>France’s involvement in the transatlantic slave trade was historically among the most significant in Europe. After Britain, France had the <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/French_Empire">second biggest colonial empire</a>.<strong> </strong>We know that 1.38 million people <a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org/">were deported</a> in at least 4,220 documented <a href="https://memorial.nantes.fr/en/nantes-the-slave-trade-and-slavery/">French slave trade expeditions</a>. Yet the stories of the lives of those people are almost entirely absent from the French collective imagination.</p> <p>Growing up in France, the only images of this crime against humanity I ever saw on screen were in US-made films. I learned about it from the 1970s TV series Roots and from Steven Spielberg’s movie Amistad. Today in France, Hollywood films such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jan/12/12-years-a-slave-review">12 Years a Slave</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/dec/07/quentin-tarantino-slavery-django-unchained">Django Unchained</a> are still the references when it comes to depicting the horrors experienced by enslaved people.</p> <p>Despite the efforts of French film-makers with personal histories rooted in slavery – such as <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0487897/">Guadeloupean Christian Lara</a> (Vivre Libre ou Mourir, 1980, Bitter Sugar, 1998) or Martinican Guy Deslauriers (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262676/">Middle Passage</a><em>, </em>2000) – slavery as a French phenomenon remains almost invisible on our screens. Paradoxically, the first mainstream and commercially successful film set in the context of French Caribbean enslavement (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821362/">Case Départ</a>, 2011) was a comedy that failed to engage with the structural nature of the oppression it depicted.</p> <p>So when I finally got to see a story on the big screen about the victims of French slavery, set in the French colonies, the effect was profoundly moving. The film-maker Simon Moutaïrou told me when I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDcyHM1J5nc">interviewed him</a> last year about <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/global/studiocanal-simon-moutairou-no-chains-no-masters-slavery-france-1235910630/">No Chains No Masters</a>: “As a young cinephile, I was always struck by the absence of this subject – slavery, <em>marronage</em> – in French cinema.”</p> <p>For the first time in French film, the story of the victims of slavery in the 18th century – on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_de_France_(Mauritius)">Isle de France</a> (now Mauritius) in the Indian Ocean, then a possession of the French crown – was being told. Beyond its polished aesthetic, which portrays Black bodies in an unusually sublime way, the director’s decision to focus on <em>marronage</em> – the escape of enslaved people from being their oppressors’ property – the inclusion of African languages such as Wolof and the addition of a spiritual dimension all give this film a unique tone.</p> <p>Only this year, a biopic was at last dedicated to a monumental figure, one who should be a source of French national pride. <a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/culture/20250406-biopic-explores-the-life-and-legacy-of-frantz-fanon-a-century-after-his-birth">With Fanon</a>, the Guadeloupean film-maker Jean-Claude Barny (director of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/fr/title/tt0832431/?utm_source=chatgpt.com&amp;reasonForLanguagePrompt=browser_header_mismatch">Tropiques Amers</a>, a pioneering 2007 TV miniseries on slavery in Martinique) brings his signature cinematic talent to the extraordinary story of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/21/frantz-fanon-book-adam-shatz">Frantz Fanon</a>.</p>    <p>Fanon, a Martinican-born psychiatrist, wrote about the psychological effects of colonialism – drawing from his experience as a caregiver in Algeria – but he also walked the walk.</p> <p>He joined the Algerian revolution against France and became a spokesperson for the FLN (National Liberation Front). Fanon died in 1961, a year before Algeria’s liberation in 1962 – but in just two books, he managed to inspire liberation and anti-colonial movements across the world. And yet, in France, not a single school bears his name. In 2019, the city council in Bordeaux – a city deeply mired in the legacy of slavery, colonisation and the exploitation of Martinique and its people – approved a proposal to name an alley after Fanon, but the mayor, Alain Juppé, a former prime minister, <a href="https://blogs.mediapart.fr/karfa-sira-diallo/blog/180720/pourquoi-fanon-ne-un-20-juillet-sest-vu-refuser-une-rue-par-juppe">overturned the initiative</a>.</p> <p>Barny’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPgIvO3SjWA">moving film</a> begins with Fanon’s arrival in Algeria, and traces the painful journey of a psychiatrist who is committed, body and soul, to a country fighting to free itself from colonial rule. The film creates a powerful resonance between two territories – Fanon’s native Martinique, shaped by slavery, and Algeria, brutally <a href="https://www.historytoday.com/archive/conquest-algiers">invaded and suppressed</a> by French troops in 1830.</p> <p>Despite facing anti-Blackness, Fanon took notes throughout his mission, documenting with surgical precision the colonial situation that would give rise to his most powerful work: <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/6/6b/Fanon_Frantz_The_Wretched_of_the_Earth_1963.pdf">The Wretched of the Earth</a>. The film does not omit the valuable contribution of Fanon’s wife, <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/blogs/news/josie-fanon-and-her-fidelity-to-palestinian-liberation?srsltid=AfmBOoqMOHWKesrr65rEEt8_hvuDRV6VOCZn3wJ_tFZoW4TN_VkVCw2I">Josie Fanon</a>, as it captures the early stirrings of revolution. It immerses us in the weight and torment of oppression – palpable and ever-present. The daily reality of deadly, senseless repression is laid bare in its rawest brutality. But, as Fanon’s words – woven in to the very structure of the film – <a href="https://theconversation.com/fanon-and-the-politics-of-truth-and-lying-in-a-colonial-society-102594">remind us</a>: “The colonised is dominated but not domesticated.”</p> <p>The effects of slavery and colonialism are still visible in former colonies that are now full French departments and suffer from the same glaring abandonment. In Guadeloupe, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/da/qanda_22_2745">staggeringly high unemployment</a> has left many young people in a state of hopelessness and disarray.</p> <p><a href="https://pro.festivalscope.com/director/nelson-foix">Nelson Foix</a>, a Guadeloupean film-maker, has dedicated his new film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30330486/">Zion</a> to the island’s youth, drawn to delinquency in a place where opportunities are scarce. In a gripping thriller shot in Creole and backed by an entirely local production – including the Paris-based producer <a href="https://www.technikart.com/laurence-lascary-ce-quon-fait-est-universel/">Laurence Lascary</a>, who is of Guadeloupean heritage – Foix paints a stark portrait of an island still caught in a colonial dynamic. </p> <p>Under the guise of a gangster story – with guns and high-speed chases – Zion lays bare the high cost of living, constant water shortages, social uprisings, police repression<strong> </strong>and the <a href="https://paris.cour-administrative-appel.fr/decisions-de-justice/dernieres-decisions/exposition-au-chlordecone-en-martinique-et-en-guadeloupe-l-etat-doit-indemniser-les-victimes-qui-demontrent-un-prejudice-moral-d-anxiete">state-enabled</a> <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)00180-0/fulltext">poisoning </a>of the land with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/mar/20/a-deliberate-poisoning-how-a-banned-pesticide-haunts-the-french-caribbean-chlordecone-guadeloupe-martinique">a toxic pesticide called chlordecone, used on banana plantations.</a> All of it is infused with a mysticism that blends Catholicism and ancestral beliefs, resulting in a dazzling cinematic experience.</p> <p>It’s a relief to to finally see new films portraying France through a different lens, although I can’t help but lament their invisibility at the most prestigious showcase events – such as Cannes. These films are still pushed to the margins of a public space that is clearly not ready to make room for overdue and compelling narratives.</p> <p>Yet, despite a limited theatrical release – and suggestions of a “<a href="https://www.liberation.fr/checknews/le-film-fanon-est-il-boycotte-par-les-salles-de-cinema-et-notamment-le-reseau-mk2-20250409_BWP2LRRDLZEKNHNFCXJOJPY5ZM/">boycott</a>” by some cinemas – the remarkable Fanon is enjoying the public success it deserves.</p> <p>As for Moutaïrou, he cast two white film stars – Camille Cottin (known for the international TV hit Call My Agent) and Benoît Magimel – in supporting roles, yet media coverage of this cinematic event has been astonishingly minimal. According to the film-maker, social media has allowed the film to <a href="https://www.lagrandeconversation.com/societe/lignorance-qui-signore-a-propos-de-la-reception-mediatique-du-film-ni-chaines-ni-maitres/">find its audience</a>. </p> <p>After <a href="https://www.france24.com/fr/am%C3%A9riques/20250409-zion-film-cinema-succes-aux-antilles-sortie-hexagone-nelson-foix-jamel-debbouze">breaking box-office records</a> in the French Antilles before its release in mainland France, Zion has emerged as the <a href="https://www.lesinrocks.com/cinema/box-office-france-le-thriller-antillais-zion-cree-la-surprise-655815-11-04-2025/">surprise hit of the year</a>. For once, the French Caribbean islands are shown without the usual emphasis on postcard-perfect scenery.</p> <p>While colonial history remains a blind spot for French cinema, audiences are more than ready to face up to it<strong> </strong>– and there’s no shortage of talent to make that happen.</p> <ul> <li><p>Rokhaya Diallo is a Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> columnist</p></li> </ul>
