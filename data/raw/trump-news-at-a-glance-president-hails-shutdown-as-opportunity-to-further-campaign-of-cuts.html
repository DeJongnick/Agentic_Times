<p>As the US government shutdown stretched into its second day, Donald Trump on Thursday hailed the funding lapse as an “unprecedented opportunity” to further his campaign of firing federal workers and downsizing departments.</p> <p>The president announced on social media that he would sit down with Russell Vought, the White House office of management and budget chief, an architect of the mass firings and buyouts of federal workers.</p> <p>“I have a meeting today with Russ Vought, he of PROJECT 2025 Fame, to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p> <p>“I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.”</p>  <h2>Trump sees ‘unprecedented opportunity’ to punish Democrats as shutdown enters day two</h2>  <p>The government shut down on Wednesday at midnight, after Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/us-government-shuts-down">refused to support</a> a Republican plan to continue funding unless it included a series of healthcare-focused concessions. Vought has threatened to use the shutdown to conduct further layoffs of federal workers, and on Wednesday announced the cancellation of billions of dollars in federal funding for projects tied to Democrats.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/government-shutdown-federal-workers-funding-freeze"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump declares that drug cartels operating in the Caribbean are ‘unlawful combatants’</h2>  <p>Donald Trump has declared that drug cartels operating in the Caribbean are “unlawful combatants” and says the United States is now in a “non-international armed conflict”, according to a White House memo obtained by the Associated Press on Thursday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/trump-administration-caribbean-drug-cartels"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Hamas to demand key revisions to Trump Gaza plan before accepting, sources say</h2>  <p>Hamas is likely to provisionally accept Donald Trump’s Gaza ceasefire proposal in the coming days – but only on condition there are significant revisions of some of its key elements, analysts and sources close to the group say.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/02/hamas-likely-to-accept-trump-peace-plan-with-key-revisions-experts-say"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>California vows to ‘instantly’ cut funding to universities that cave to Trump ‘compact’</h2>  <p>Any California universities that sign the Trump administration’s proposed “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” will “instantly” lose their state funding, California governor Gavin Newsom said in a statement.</p> <p>The Trump administration on Wednesday offered nine prominent universities, including the University of Southern California, the chance to sign a “compact” that asks the universities to close academic departments that “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas”, limit the proportion of international undergraduate students to 15%, accept the administration’s definition of gender and ban the consideration of race or sex in hiring and admissions, in exchange for “substantial and meaningful federal grants”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/california-university-funding-trump-compact"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Judge denies Kilmar Ábrego García’s bid for asylum in the US</h2>  <p>An immigration judge in Baltimore has denied Kilmar Ábrego García’s bid for asylum on Thursday, but he has 30 days to appeal.</p> <p>Ábrego’s case has drawn national attention since the 30-year-old was wrongfully deported by the Trump administration to El Salvador in March.
