<p>Donald Trump has said his administration is planning to produce a list on Friday of “Democrat programs” that will be closed as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown, after the Senate failed in its eighth attempt to pass legislation that would end the impasse.</p> <p>He did not specify the programs but indicated to reporters at the White House on Tuesday that the closures would be permanent.</p> <p>The number of US federal worker laid off as a result of the shutdown was put at 4,108, according to a statement filed in court by the department of justice.</p> <p>Since 1981, the US has had 15 federal government shutdowns that furloughed hundreds of thousands of workers, however no president until now has sought to use a shutdown as the basis for large-scale firings. The dismissals are expected to disrupt government operations, including disease outbreak investigations.</p>  <h2>Johnson refuses bipartisan negotiations as US shutdown drags on</h2>  <p>The top House <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a> said he won’t negotiate with Senate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> as the government shutdown dragged into its 14th day on Tuesday, while defending the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration’s</a> decision to shuffle Pentagon funds to make sure military personnel get their paychecks.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/house-speaker-mike-johnson-shutdown"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump awards Charlie Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States, to the assassinated far-right commentator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">Charlie Kirk</a> at the White House on Tuesday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/charlie-kirk-presidential-medal-of-freedom-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Six killed in US strike on another boat near Venezuela</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> announced on Tuesday that the United States has struck another small boat that he accused of carrying drugs in waters off the coast of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a>, killing six people aboard.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/trump-six-killed-us-strike-boat-venezuela"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US revokes visas of at least 50 Mexican officials</h2>  <p>The US government has revoked the visas of at least 50 politicians and government officials in Mexico amid the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s crackdown on drug cartels and their suspected political allies, according to two Mexican officials.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/us-revokes-visas-mexican-trump-drug-cartel-crackdown"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump floats removing World Cup and Olympics from blue cities </h2>  <p>Donald Trump has again said he’d pressure Fifa to remove 2026 World Cup games from a host city on the basis of that city’s politics, with Boston becoming the third such city to come in for threats from the US president.
