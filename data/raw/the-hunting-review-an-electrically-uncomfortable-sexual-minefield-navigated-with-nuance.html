<p>If one were to distil a single core message from SBS’s cautionary four-part miniseries The Hunting it would be that sexting is never safe – so don’t do it.</p> <p>The public broadcaster has even developed a range of <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/learn/the-hunting">educational resources</a> about cyberbullying and image-sharing to accompany its release, including teacher and parent discussion guides.</p> <p>But the show (created by Sophie Hyde and Matthew Cormack, and directed by Hyde and Ana Kokkinos) is far from a “drugs are bad, mmmkay?”-style lecture for young people about the evils of a contemporary phenomenon many adults do not fully understand.</p> <p>Instead this very compelling, tense and prickly drama builds an electric kind of energy from a powder-keg scenario which leads to an array of dramatic consequences that fizz with moral and logical conundrums. The drama’s clear lineage to a root incident makes it conceptually similar to another recent SBS series, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/07/safe-harbour-review-tense-compelling-asylum-seeker-drama-offers-no-easy-answers">the terrific Safe Harbour</a>, which also delves into ethical grey areas through a “tangled web we weave” narrative.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W5hDTED5e0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="259" width="460" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5W5hDTED5e0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>But in the case of The Hunting, that core incident is split into two: in one, high school student Amandip (Kavitha Anandasivam) takes a nude photo of herself and sends it to a boy she likes, Nassim (Yazeed Daher); in the other, another compromising picture is generated from a screenshot captured during a video conversation between Zoe (Luca Sardelis) and Andy (Alex Cusack).</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/29/the-hunting-asher-keddie-and-richard-roxburgh-tackle-new-generations-sexual-power-dynamics">The Hunting: Keddie and Roxburgh tackle new generation's sexual power dynamics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In both instances explicit images of the young women are disseminated between boys at their school and made publicly available on a misogyny-filled website, with a constant stream of comments such as “pics or it didn’t happen”. The writers, Cormack and Niki Aken, skilfully navigate the question of blame, often by exploring the various pressures at play – not just pressure on the girls to send racy pictures, for instance, but also pressure on boys to share them.</p> <p>One character, who might have been the protagonist in a less tangled plotline, is Ray (Sam Reid, currently on screens in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/22/lambs-of-god-review-audacious-fable-of-blood-swilling-nuns-vs-church-politics">Lambs of God</a>): a young teacher new to the Adelaide school in and around which the drama takes place. He and the assistant principal, Eliza (Jessica De Gouw), quickly become romantically involved. During an early scene at a pub, Ray shares the philosophy of his father, who was also a teacher, which positions him as a kind of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/16/dead-poets-society-30-years-on-robin-williams-stirring-call-to-seize-the-day-endures">John Keating</a>-lite: “The kids don’t remember what you try to teach them,” he says, “but they do remember what you are.”</p> <p>It is through this pair that Cormack and Aken appear to reflect their own ideologies, particularly during the scenes that contrast the young teachers’ progressive ideas with the views of a crusty “seen it all before” principal (Pamela Rabe). When the principal links sexting to the school uniform – as if such a complex issue could be solved by insisting on knee-length dresses – Eliza questions her credibility as a feminist and as a manager of the school.</p> <p>“I don’t want to be a firefighter, I want to effect real change,” she proclaims in an exchange that evokes the classic paradigm of the idealist versus the pragmatist. “We are in a moment now when people are starting to see clearly what’s been happening and they want change,” she continues, with the MeToo movement presumably in mind.</p> <p>The Hunting is full of plot-points in which already intense situations are exacerbated tenfold by characters who make hot-tempered decisions that they believe are morally justified. There is an implicit understanding on behalf of the audience that we are meeting these people during pressure points in their lives, exacerbated by the fact that many are adolescents without the life experience that might have helped them to fully consider the consequences.</p>    <p>In terms of what these actions say about their personalities, the show is caught in an interesting space.<strong> </strong>On the one hand, characters such as Andy’s father Nick (Richard Roxburgh) reveal their true colours: in his case, as a conniving man who will obfuscate the truth to get what he wants. For others, there is a feeling that the heat of the moment has caused them to behave uncharacteristically.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/31/les-norton-rebooted-still-a-big-bad-boy-but-the-sex-and-crudity-is-less-1985-more-2019">Les Norton rebooted: still a big, bad boy but the sex and crudity is less 1985, more 2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kokkinos and Hyde ratchet up the tension as the show progresses, hitting maximum impact in the second and third episodes, which are electrically uncomfortable. They release the pressure valve for a less arresting finale – the conclusion doesn’t quite reconcile the open-ended qualities of real life with satisfying resolutions usually required for interesting drama, though the overarching approach is nothing if not multifaceted.</p> <p>All the cast contribute realistic and high-impact performances buoyed by a script that considers guilt and responsibility largely in terms of societal influences rather than “bad” people doing “bad” things. This sort of writing requires a tricky balancing act with many potential minefields to navigate, including the possibility of excusing unethical behaviour. But it hangs together impressively, with admirable depth and nuance.</p> <p><em>• The Hunting screens on SBS every Thursday 8.30pm from 1 August, and on SBS On Demand</em></p>
