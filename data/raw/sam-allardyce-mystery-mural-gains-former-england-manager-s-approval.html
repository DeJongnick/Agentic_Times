<p>Why a 10ft mural of the former football manager Sam Allardyce eating orange, battered chips has appeared in his home town of Dudley is something of a mystery.</p> <p>The man himself however is chuffed. “Just seen the mural,” he said <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/central/2025-07-17/former-west-brom-boss-sam-allardyce-privileged-over-mystery-mural-in-dudley">in a video message to ITV News</a>. “Absolutely privileged to be honest with you, I thought it was a very good likeness.</p> <p>“Chips look a bit hot, but I really enjoyed seeing it. Whoever did it, thank you very much.”</p> <p>The mural of the 70-year-old is believed to have been pasted on to a wall near a chip shop in the centre of Dudley on Wednesday. The reaction so far has been mixed.</p> <p>“It’s a bit odd as it doesn’t have a slogan or any words, but it brightens up the place,” said one man out shopping on Friday.</p> <p>A local worker, who asked not to be named and admitted he did not know who Big Sam was, described it as “the random-est thing I’ve ever seen”.</p> <p>He added: “Who is it? It’s just weird, it doesn’t make sense and it needs to go.”</p> <p>Allardyce, or Big Sam as he was and always will be known to football fans, is used to dividing the crowd.</p> <p>During his managerial career he became known as a survival specialist, taking charge at Bolton Wanderers, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers, West Ham, Sunderland, Crystal Palace, Everton, West Bromwich Albion, Leeds United – as well as England for one match.</p> <p>He was never afraid to say what he thought. As were fans of clubs he managed.</p> <p>During a miserable 6-0 defeat at Manchester City, West Ham repeatedly <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2536192/Travelling-West-Ham-faithful-finally-turn-manager-anti-Sam-Allardyce-chanting.html">chanted “fuck off Sam Allardyce”</a>. In his memoir not long after Allardyce described West Ham fans as “brainwashed” and “deluded”.</p> <p>He once said he would win the league every year if got to manage a club like Real Madrid. Allardyce joked that the reason he would never manage one of the top four English clubs was because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/may/15/down-but-not-out-lampooned-allardyce-can-still-make-albion-proud">his surname was not Allardici.</a></p> <p>For some, the mystery of the new mural will be: who is the artist and why? For others it will be: what the heck are orange chips?</p> <p>There is a debate over the origin of orange chips – as in chips fried in an orange batter. Some say they have been around since the second world war and rationing. Others claim they date to the 1970s.</p> <p>What makes the batter orange is often a secret. Some think it might be best not to know.</p> <p>During lockdown, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/how-make-your-black-country-18039073">the Birmingham Mail published an orange chip recipe</a> for people to try at home and the extra ingredients were paprika and orange food colouring.</p>
