<p>In the last 18 months I’ve found myself having to respond to claims that mental health culture has gone too far, that we’re over-diagnosing mental health problems and that we’re simply medicalising the ups and downs of life. I hope the children’s commissioner’s report (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/08/children-england-living-almost-dickensian-levels-poverty">Children in England ‘living in almost Dickensian levels of poverty’, 8 July</a>) is a moment for everyone to reflect on what the “ups and downs” of life look like for too many young people: going without food, cold and mouldy homes, and not feeling safe in the area you live.</p> <p>There is a toxic relationship between poverty and mental health. A fact reinforced by the latest NHS data, showing that mental health problems among adults are at record levels, with people in the most deprived areas hardest hit.</p> <p>As <a href="https://assets.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/wpuploads/2025/07/Growing-up-in-a-low-income-family-childrens-experiences.pdf">the report</a> itself cites, young people are understandably concerned about waits for mental health treatment. And with good reason – 35,000 young people have been waiting for more than two years for mental health support. Tackling mental health waiting lists&nbsp;and drivers of poor mental health must now be a priority for&nbsp;this government.<br><strong>Dr Sarah Hughes</strong><br><em>CEO, Mind</em></p> <p>• Many readers must have been shocked by the report that children in the UK are living in “almost Dickensian levels of poverty”. Abolishing the two-child limit on benefits would lift many out of poverty. The cost of doing this has been estimated by the Resolution Foundation as £3.5bn. This may seem a lot. However, every year <a href="https://policyinpractice.co.uk/blog/missing-out-2024-23-billion-of-support-is-unclaimed-each-year/">£23bn of benefits</a> go unclaimed, according to Policy in Practice. Why not use this money? It would benefit the children, their families and the places in which they live.<br><strong>Jan Pahl</strong><br><em>Professor emeritus of social policy, University of Kent</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
