<h2>Robin Roefs (NEC to Sunderland, £9.1m)</h2> 
<p>This season, all three promoted Premier League sides have started the season with a new goalkeeper between the posts. Given that the last six teams to come up have conceded a total of 515 goals (85.8 each on average) on their way straight back down, it’s not a bad position to focus on. Burnley replaced James Trafford with Martin Dubravka, while Leeds saw Lucas Perri as a safer pair of hands than Illan Meslier. Sunderland’s recruitment of Roefs, a small part of their £150m summer outlay, might be the best decision of all. Standing 6ft 4in tall, the Dutchman has a presence and composure that belies the fact he is only 22. Roefs has quickly become a fan favourite and saved a penalty to help <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/30/sunderland-brentford-premier-league-match-report">Sunderland beat Brentford</a>, their second win in three Premier League games.</p>

<h2>Ferran Jutglà (Club Brugge to Celta Vigo, £4.7m)</h2> 
<p>Celta’s decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/12/rafa-benitez-sacked-by-struggling-celta-vigo-after-eight-months-in-charge">replace Rafa Benítez</a> with B-team coach Claudio Giráldez last year was an inspired one. Giráldez transformed them from relegation candidates to European qualifiers in a single season and did so with minimal spending, building his team around a young, homegrown core of players. With a European campaign looming and winger Fer López sold to Wolves, reinforcements were needed this summer. Jutglà, a versatile attacker raised at Barcelona, could scarcely fit the Celta profile better – and with a year left on his contract, the 26-year-old was snapped up for less than £5m. If a three-year stint in Belgium was an unexpected step in his development, Jutglà still delivered: 31 goals in 105 games, including a fine strike to <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/video/0296-1d18afcde2c8-48f8f5cacc33-1000--watch-ferran-jutgla-s-thunderbolt-strike/">seal a surprise Champions League win</a> over Atalanta. He may well cause more shockwaves in the Europa League this season.</p> 
<h2>Ernest Poku (AZ Alkmaar to Bayer Leverkusen, £8.7m)</h2> 
<p>It has been a turbulent summer for Bayer Leverkusen, with an entire XI’s worth of players coming and going under the watch of Erik ten Hag, who was then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/erik-ten-hag-sacked-by-bayer-leverkusen-after-just-three-matches">dismissed after three games</a> in charge. An uncertain few weeks lie ahead for Leverkusen’s new recruits, including a trio of promising youngsters. Playmaker Ibrahim Maza and centre-back Abdoulaye Faye – plucked from second-tier Hertha and Swedish side Häcken respectively – are intriguing prospects, but flying winger Poku could make the quickest impact. Discovered in amateur football, Poku was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2021/oct/07/next-generation-2021-60-of-the-best-young-talents-in-world-football">quickly identified as a rising star</a>, helping unfancied AZ Alkmaar win the Uefa Youth League in 2023. Able to play out wide, up front or behind a central striker, Poku claims to “leave defenders behind for breakfast” with his raw pace, but is also blessed with a delicate touch. Whoever replaces Ten Hag would be wise to give him a chance to shine.</p>

   <div class="atom-Guide">
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Federico Chiesa (Juventus to Liverpool, £10m)</b></p>
    <p>Reduced to a bit-part role, Chiesa was one of the very few disappointments in Arne Slot's first season at Anfield – but the Italian stayed put and scored a big goal against Bournemouth (pictured) to open this season.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Khéphren Thuram (Nice to Juventus, £17.1m)</b></p>
    <p>It was another underwhelming season for Juve, but Thuram slotted in as one of their most-used players, and has kept his place in the starting XI under Igor Tudor while providing enough magic to earn an official highlights reel.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Alejandro Francés (Zaragoza to Girona, £3m)</b></p>
    <p>A promising start was stalled by an injury as Girona endured a tough campaign. Turning out at left, right and centre-back in the Champions League will at least have been a useful learning experience.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Ismaïla Sarr (Marseille to Crystal Palace, £12.5m)</b></p>
    <p>The flying winger has proved to be a perfect addition to Oliver Glasner's squad, scoring 15 goals and nine assists so far. Played a big role in run to FA Cup glory and will be missed over the next month with an injury.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Luka Sucic (Salzburg to Real Sociedad, £8.5m)</b></p>
    <p>In a disappointing season for La Real, Sucic still caught the eye and played down rumours he could emulate 'role model' Luka Modric with a move to Real Madrid. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Samuel Dahl (Djurgarden to Roma, £3.4m)</b></p>
    <p>Swedish left-back's&nbsp;move&nbsp;to Italy did not work out – he played just an hour of football before being loaned out to Benfica. Things have gone much better in Lisbon, though, with Dahl making the move permanent this summer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Léo Scienza (Ulm to Heidenheim, £420k)</b></p>
    <p>Plucked from lower-league obscurity, the Brazilian excelled in the Bundesliga, scoring a last-gasp goal to keep his club up. That earned a £7m move to Southampton, a huge profit on FCH's original investment.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Jorge Cuenca (Villarreal to Fulham, £5.7m)</b></p>
    <p>Found his chances limited in his first season, making just four Premier League starts, but Marco Silva shut down transfer talk and sees the Spaniard as one of his four regular centre-backs for this season.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Leopold Querfeld (Rapid Vienna to Union Berlin, £2.5m)</b></p>
    <p>Defender made an unexpected impact by scoring the Bundesliga goal of the season against Stuttgart, capping a strong debut season where he became a regular starter.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Theo Bair (Motherwell to Auxerre, £1.4m)</b></p>
    <p>The Canada striker could not continue his scoring form in Ligue 1, netting twice in 29 appearances. Has joined Lausanne on loan in bid to earn a place in co-hosts' 2026 World Cup squad.</p>

<h2>Adrian Truffert (Rennes to Bournemouth, £11.4m)</h2> 
<p>Bournemouth sold four players this summer for fees in excess of £40m, three of whom were key cogs in Andoni Iraola’s defence last season. The Cherries may have been picked apart but they have responded in the summer market with a range of smart mid-price signings. Truffert could be the best of the bunch; the left-back brings a very different physical profile to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/26/liverpool-complete-40m-signing-of-milos-kerkez-from-bournemouth-transfer-window">departed Milos Kerkez</a>, but offers an attractive blend of youth and experience. Still only 23, Truffert racked up 150 Rennes appearances and captained the club for part of last season. He also brings big-game prowess to this ambitious corner of the south coast, having featured in all three current Uefa competitions and won a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/aug/09/football-olympics-paris-france-spain-final">silver medal with France</a> at the Paris Olympics.</p> 
<h2>Santiago Hidalgo (Independiente to Toulouse, £2.5m)</h2> 
<p>Before he had signed his first professional contract, Hidalgo <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2022/sep/28/next-generation-2022-60-of-the-best-young-talents-in-world-football">was already aiming high</a>. Having switched position from left-winger to striker, his ambition was to emulate Sergio Agüero. It was another Argentina legend that slowed his progress at Independiente; Carlos Tevez came in as head coach and sent Hidalgo to the reserves. After opting against a free transfer away, he outlasted Tevez and began to attract interest from Europe – including Toulouse, who have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/06/stats-scouting-smart-coaching-toulouse-expectations-ligue-2-relegated">built an analytical model</a> under Damien Comolli with scouts in 70 different countries. Comolli has left for Juventus this summer but the club’s approach continues, negotiating a cut-price fee for a player with a reported €20m release clause. Hidalgo has hit the ground running as an impact substitute, notching two assists in three Ligue 1 games so far.</p> 
<h2>Borna Sosa (Ajax to Crystal Palace, £3m)</h2> 
<p>Crystal Palace are masters of a canny cut-price deal, but even by their standards, landing a defender of Sosa’s calibre and experience <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/07/transfer-latest-crystal-palace-borna-sosa-ajax">for a fee of up to £3m</a> was exceptional work. Seen as a rising star at Stuttgart, where he recorded a league-leading 24 assists across three seasons at left-back, Sosa’s career stalled when the former Stuttgart sporting director, Sven Mislintat, brought him to Ajax in 2023 – and was sacked three weeks later. Out of the picture in Amsterdam, Sosa struggled on loan at Torino but already looks a better fit on the left of Oliver Glasner’s 3-4-3 formation. Tyrick Mitchell remains first-choice in that position, but Sosa’s solid European experience will be hugely beneficial as Palace embark on their first continental campaign.</p> 
<h2>Berke Özer (Eyüpspor to Lille, £3.9m)</h2> 
<p>Luis Enrique’s decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/manchester-city-to-sell-ederson-to-fenerbahce-if-they-land-gianluca-donnarumma-psg">dispense with Gigi Donnarumma</a> and replace him with Lille goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier at PSG was a ruthless statement of intent. It also bolstered Les Dogues’ reputation as one of Europe’s leading clubs in terms of talent development. Having banked £47.6m for academy product Chevalier, Lille spent less than 10% of that fee on their new No 1, who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/oct/04/next-generation-2017-60-of-the-best-young-talents-in-world-football">playing first-team football at 18</a> for Turkish side Altinordu. Özer joined Fenerbahce but found his path blocked by Altay Bayindir, and took loan moves to Belgium and Portugal in order to play before settling back in Turkey with Eyüpspor. It was Lille’s previous history with Turkish stars like Burak Yilmaz that swayed Özer to move and he has started well, making big saves against Monaco before saving a penalty and notching an assist as Lille dismantled Lorient 7-1.</p>

<h2>Christian Ordoñez (Vélez Sarsfield to Parma, £6.7m)</h2> 
<p>Another club with a hard-earned reputation for developing players are Parma, aiming to stabilise in Serie A after a turbulent decade. Under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/mikel-arteta-arsenal-assistant-carlos-cuesta-parma-head-coach">new head coach Carlos Cuesta</a> – previously an assistant to Mikel Arteta at Arsenal – the club have cast their net wide this summer in search of young talent. Ordoñez, a tough-tackling midfielder, and January recruit Mateo Pellegrino were both signed from Argentinian side Vélez. Pellegrino scored twice in Cuesta’s first game in charge, a Coppa Italia win over Pescara, while Ordoñez has the ball-winning skills to make a big impact on Serie A midfields. Having flashed up on Manchester United’s radar, Ordoñez is happy to join a club “where so many important Argentinian players made history”. He and Pellegrino could quickly join that list.</p> 
<h2>Carlos Soler (PSG to Real Sociedad, £6.9m)</h2> 
<p>Not every good-value transfer involves an unfamiliar name on an upward trajectory. Soler would once have fit those criteria, but his career stalled after leaving hometown club Valencia for PSG’s crowded midfield engine room. He made 50 league appearances in Paris, but only played the full 90 minutes six times, and a season at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/aug/31/west-ham-sign-psg-carlos-soler-offload-aguerd-and-ward-prowse">West Ham on loan</a> saw him fall into a similar bit-part role. Real Sociedad’s deadline-day move is therefore something of a gamble, but the Anoeta seems an ideal location for Soler to rediscover his best form. Back in La Liga, where he made 182 appearances in his first stint, his flexibility and work ethic will be useful to a team rebuilding under new manager Sergio Francisco. If so, fans can thank former midfield star Mikel Merino, who encouraged the move in a phone call with Soler last week.</p> 
<h2>Nikola Stulic (Charleroi to Lecce, £4.3m)</h2> 
<p>When a key player is snapped up by a bigger club, some teams prefer a like-for-like replacement. That appears to be the case at Lecce, who have signed Serbian striker Nikola Stulic as the successor to Nikola Krstovic, the Montenegrin forward who has joined Atalanta. Krstovic (Red Star) and Stulic (Partizan) both developed at a Belgrade giant, and both took a sidestep on their way to Serie A. While Krstovic found his scoring touch at Slovakian side Dunajska Streda, Stulic bagged a goal every other game with Charleroi last season. There’s no guarantee that Stulic will keep following his predecessor’s path, but the bargain fee reduces any risk. If Krstovic is a hit in Bergamo, Lecce’s 10% sell-on fee might well cover the cost of signing Stulic entirely.</p>
