<p>Block, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/jack-dorsey">Jack Dorsey</a>’s financial technology company, plans to let go almost 1,000 current employees, while making other changes to its operations in its second such move in just over a year.</p> <p>Dorsey, who co-founded and previously ran Twitter before co-founding Block in 2009, informed employees of the impending cuts on Tuesday in an email, viewed by the Guardian, titled “smaller block”. The layoffs will impact more than 930 employees, with another nearly 200 managers being moved into non-management roles, and another nearly 800 open jobs will be closed, according to the email.</p> <p>Block now operates payment platforms Square and Afterpay, the money transfer app CashApp, and the music streaming service Tidal.</p> <p>Dorsey wrote in the email that the layoffs and other changes to staffing and organization are not being implemented with the intention of hitting “a specific financial target, replacing folks with AI, or changing our headcount cap”. As part of an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/block-layoffs-jack-dorsey-tech-industry-cuts-2024-1">earlier reorganization</a> that began in early 2024 and also saw roughly 1,000 Block employees lose their jobs, Dorsey implemented a headcount maximum of 12,000 employees.</p> <p>Instead, Dorsey wrote that this additional reorganization is about “raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org so we can move fast and with less abstraction”, according to the email. Last year Dorsey struck a <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/30/jack-dorsey-layoffs-streaming-music-app-tidal-block-leaked-email/">similar tone</a> in notifying staffers of layoffs, saying the company needed to “build like a startup again”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/25/napster-sold-infinite-reality">Napster, now a streaming service, sells for $207m to Infinite Reality</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Tuesday’s email, Dorsey added that he was enacting cuts to staff and management levels and closing open jobs all at once, instead of over time, because “we’re behind in our actions, and that’s not fair to the individual or the company.”</p> <p>Block’s stock is down 29% this year so far. Its revenue and profits have grown less over the last year, creating shareholder concern, even as Dorsey has taken back more operating control during that time. Dorsey noted in his email that part of his job is to increase the company’s stock value and that this reorganization “will help us focus and execute better to do just that”.</p> <p>“When we know, we should move, and there hasn’t been enough movement,” the CEO wrote. “And we need to move faster to stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in, so we’re able to continue increasing access, openness and automation.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for Block did not respond to calls and email seeking comment.</p>
