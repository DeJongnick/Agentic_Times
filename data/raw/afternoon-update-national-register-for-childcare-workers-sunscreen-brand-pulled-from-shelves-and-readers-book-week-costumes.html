<p>Good afternoon. Childcare workers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/22/national-childcare-register-cctv-trial-mobile-phone-ban-declared-australian-safety-reform">will be put on a national register in a sweeping safety overhaul of the sector</a> that includes a CCTV trial at hundreds of centres, mobile phone bans and mandatory staff training.</p> 
<p>Federal, state and territory education ministers met in Sydney on Friday and agreed to major changes in the childcare and early education sectors.</p> 
<p>The federal education minister, Jason Clare, said the CCTV trial would begin in October or November and run at 300 centres across the country. The trial will consider who holds the data and how the data is stored. The safety training regime for childcare employees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/aug/22/australia-news-live-penny-wong-gaza-israel-netanyahu-anthony-albanese-childcare-safety-education-database-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-68a7cb3c8f082259ede866b4#block-68a7cb3c8f082259ede866b4">will be rolled out early next year.</a></p> 
<p>“Is it everything that we need to do? No, of course it’s not – but it’s the next thing that we must do,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/aug/22/australia-news-live-penny-wong-gaza-israel-netanyahu-anthony-albanese-childcare-safety-education-database-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-68a7ca6e8f088233182d3c7d#block-68a7ca6e8f088233182d3c7d">Clare said.</a> The commonwealth will put $189m towards the reforms, and work will begin immediately.</p>
