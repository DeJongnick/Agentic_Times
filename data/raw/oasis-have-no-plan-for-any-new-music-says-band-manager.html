<p>Oasis’s co-manager has said the band have no plans for new music, and that their 2025 reunion tour will be their last.</p> <p><a href="https://www.musicweek.com/management/read/ignition-s-alec-mckinlay-on-oasis-comeback-25-years-of-big-brother-recordings-what-happens-next/091935">Speaking to Music Week</a>, Alec McKinlay said: “This is very much the last time around, as Noel’s made clear in the press. It’s a chance for fans who haven’t seen the band to see them, or at least for some of them to … there’s no plan for any new music.”</p> <p>The tour, which reunites the Gallagher brothers after years of fractious relations and verbal sniping in the press, will kick off on 4 July in Cardiff, and encompass 41 dates across the UK, Ireland, North America, east Asia, Australia and South America.</p> <p>There was phenomenal demand for tickets, with millions queuing online – and some consternation when fans were forced to pay more than they were expecting, thanks to dynamic pricing technology.</p> <p>McKinlay is co-director of management company Ignition, who have managed Oasis since 1993, and is also the director of Oasis’s label Big Brother.</p> <p>He added: “Probably the biggest and most pleasing surprise of the reunion announcement is how huge it was internationally. Honestly, we knew it would be big here, and that doesn’t take much intuition. But looking outside the UK, we knew they had a strong fanbase, we did all the stats. We were quite cautious about what that would mean when it came to people actually buying tickets but we were just bowled over by how huge it was. We could have sold out half a dozen Rose Bowls in Pasadena and probably eight MetLife stadiums in New York in a day.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/26/gallagher-brothers-perform-together-for-first-time-in-16-years-in-closed-london-pub">Gallagher brothers perform together for first time in 16 years in London members’ club</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the run-up to the tour, Oasis recently reissued their single Some Might Say in a vinyl edition. A reissue of debut album Definitely Maybe for its 30th anniversary took them back to No 1 in September 2024, and their 2010 best-of compilation Time Flies hasn’t left the UK Top 100 since 2017, going as high as No 3 amid the excitement of the reunion announcement.</p> <p>In April <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/apr/26/gallagher-brothers-perform-together-for-first-time-in-16-years-in-closed-london-pub">it was reported</a> that the Gallaghers performed together for the first time since their 2009 split, filming promotional material at a members’ club in north London.</p>
