<p>From early morning to late at night, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food">food</a> vendors are feeding the people of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a>. They offer nearly anything – tamales, fried fish, crispy tacos, mole, pupusas, fresh fruit, esquites, bacon-wrapped hot dogs – to Angelenos as they start their commutes or head home after the bars have closed.</p> <p>Taco trucks and food vendors are a vital part of the city’s celebrated culinary scene, one that came under attack <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/13/los-angeles-ice-raids-terror">this summer</a> as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> ordered mass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/08/immigration-officers-los-angeles-california">immigration raids</a> across the city.</p> <p>Shannon Camacho, a senior policy associate at <a href="https://inclusiveaction.org/about/">Inclusive Action for the City</a>, a non-profit in the Boyle Heights neighborhood that focuses on community economic development, says that many street vendors made the painful calculation between risking losing much-needed income or being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).</p> <p>“Vendors are in a particularly vulnerable situation, given that they have to work outdoors,” Camacho said. “They rely on foot traffic. They rely on busy neighborhoods and streets … This was something intentional that the Department of Homeland Security was doing – targeting vendors that were outside, understanding that many of them are immigrants and many of them are undocumented.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/los-angeles-immigration-trump-lawsuit">‘I will not stay quiet’: LA man swept up in Trump Ice dragnet on why he’s suing</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The LA Street Vendor Campaign, which <a href="https://lastreetvendors.org/about/">includes Inclusive Action and three other organizations</a>, has been advocating for the rights of vendors long before this summer. The LASVC led efforts to create a statewide policy decriminalizing street vending throughout the state. Recently, it raised about $100,000 of direct cash assistance for street vendors across Los Angeles county.</p> <p>Still, Camacho says more is needed.</p> <p>“There are thousands and thousands of street vendors, even just in the city of Los Angeles,” Camacho said. “And that’s not even including other parts of southern California. We don’t have enough to support everybody.”</p> <p>The Guardian spoke to three food business owners in LA about the summer of Ice, and how it had affected their families and businesses.</p> <h2>Juan Carlos Guerra, Taquería Frontera</h2> <p>It’s Los Angeles … you drive anywhere on the street, you’re going to see pop-ups. You’re going to see street vendors. But it just seemed like a ghost town during that time. No one was out on the street.</p> <p>I was going to open the new Silver Lake location of Taquería Frontera at the beginning of June. And then the raids happened. It didn’t seem like we should have a celebration or a grand opening.</p> <p>I reached out to Javier Cabral from [the hyperlocal news site] LA Taco, and I said to him, “I want to try to help out. Whatever I can do. Do you know a good organization?” And he said: “Oh, yeah. <a href="https://mycielo.org/">Cielo</a> is a great organization.”</p> <p>I talked to someone at Cielo, Comunidades Indígenas en Liderazgo (Indigenous Communities in Leadership). I was just like: “Taco Tuesday is usually a thing. Is it OK if I set up something saying that all proceeds of our trompo [taco] – which is what we sell the most – is going to be donated towards fundraising for Cielo so they can help immigrant families during this time?”</p> <p>We did Taco Tuesday with a purpose, and we ended up raising $4,000 from selling the trompo that day alone.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Sales have gone down a lot because of the raids. More than half of the clients we had haven’t come back to buy anything because of the fear that continues</p> <footer> <cite>Bulmaro, street vendor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Everyone was pretty supportive about it. And not just that day – a lot of people would come in just to check up on us, on my employees, see how they’re doing, how they’re feeling. There’s no way you could live in Los Angeles without being affected by this. And a lot of my clients were like: “I can’t believe this is going on.” Who doesn’t have a friend or family member or co-worker that isn’t undocumented here in Los Angeles?</p> <p>Street vendors are back out now and more people are outside eating. But I think that it’s still in the back of their minds. Could this happen at any time again? Right now it’s pretty calm, but what happens a month from now if they decide to do it again?</p> <h2>Bulmaro, street vendor</h2> <p>When we started the business, there weren’t many jobs out there. We knew how to make tamales, which is what we sell. Due to the lack of jobs and opportunities, we decided to do what we know how to do. From there, business grew and we started getting more clients, little by little. It’s our sole source of income.</p> <p>Because of the raids, everything stopped. We stopped selling for about a month, without working or anything. We just started working again a little more about two weeks ago. A lot of people don’t go out to buy things any more because they’re scared. Sales have gone down a lot because of the raids. More than half of the clients we had haven’t come back to buy anything because of the fear that continues.</p> <p>We haven’t had phone orders, either. We just bring the day’s supply, and sometimes we come back home with tamales or with atol that didn’t sell. It’s never going to be the same as before the raids.</p>    <p>It’s me, my wife and another employee – three of us depend on the business. There’s nothing we can do, we have to keep working. We need to pay rent and bills, even though we’re going outside with fear. There’s no other way. The rent isn’t going to wait. The bills, and the food we need to buy, aren’t going to wait either.</p> <h2>Alejandra Rodriguez, Alex Foods and Cemitas Poblanas</h2> <p>A lot of our customers stopped coming. They were scared because a lot of them are Latino. Even at the local restaurants in the city of West Hollywood, [the workers] have their visas to be here, but they were still scared because of everything that was going on. They were saying that even if you had a visa, even if you had permission to be here, everybody was still getting kicked out. Our sales dropped more than 70%.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/13/ice-immigration-raids-food-labor">How US immigration raids hurt summer pleasures, from berries to barbecues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even on the street, there was nobody walking, nobody coming. It did take a very big toll on us … the local people that work at the restaurants, the chefs or the servers or the valet guys, they weren’t coming in to work.</p> <p>We closed down for about 10 days because it wasn’t worth coming out here. And luckily, we had a little bit of money saved up. Usually, when we leave on trips, customers will still call us to place orders. But no, the whole 10 days we were gone, we didn’t go to work. We didn’t get any calls or people asking us when we were going to come back.</p> <p>I had to let one of my two employees go. I couldn’t afford it any more. And we’ve just slowly been climbing back. We have customers from the local car washes, and they told us that Ice actually got there at that car wash and took about four people. People are still aware. People are still scared. Any time they see a police officer pass by or a sheriff’s department or just somebody, they would flinch.</p> <p>People are just trying to get to work and come back. I know they were able to stay away, maybe for a couple of weeks, but everybody has to pay rent.</p>
