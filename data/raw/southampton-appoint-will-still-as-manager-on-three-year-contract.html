<p>Southampton have confirmed the appointment of Will Still as their manager on a three-year contract. The 32-year-old, born in Belgium to English parents, left the French top-division side Lens last week citing personal reasons and a desire to be closer to family in England. </p> 
<p>Still will succeed the interim head coach, Simon Rusk, after Sunday’s final Premier League game at home to Arsenal. Southampton have been relegated and in April sacked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/07/southampton-poised-sack-ivan-juric-manager-relegated-premier-league#:~:text=Relegated%20Southampton%20sack%20Ivan%20Juric,as%20manager%20%7C%20Southampton%20%7C%20The%20Guardian">Ivan Juric</a> after 107 days.</p> 
<p>Still said: “There is huge potential here and we have a great opportunity to do something special. The project that has been laid out to me is very impressive and, all together, I believe we can build a clear identity and a very positive future for the team.</p>

<p>“I can’t wait to meet you, the fans. I look forward to hearing you in voice and feeling the energy and belief at St Mary’s and beyond. I’m eager to get to work this summer and start building a close-knit group that can make everyone proud and ultimately get us back to where we belong: in the Premier League.”</p> 
<p>Still took his first steps into coaching at Preston’s academy, during an internship from a college course, but has spent all of his professional career in Belgium and France, also working at Sint-Truiden, Beerschot, Lierse and Reims. Lens finished the Ligue 1 season in eighth.</p>
