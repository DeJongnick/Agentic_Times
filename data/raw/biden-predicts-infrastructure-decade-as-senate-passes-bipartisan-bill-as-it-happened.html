And therefore, that’s what I’ll do,” Cuomo said, noting the resignation will take effect in 14 days.</li> <li><strong>Joe Biden welcomed the governor’s announcement,</strong> after the president called for Cuomo to step down last week.<strong> </strong>“I respect the governor’s decision, and I respect the decision he made,” Biden said.</li> <li><strong>The Senate passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill in a vote of 69 to 30. </strong>The legislation now heads to the House, where it may face resistance from some progressive lawmakers. If enacted, the bill would invest $550bn in new federal funds for roads, bridges and other physical infrastructure projects.</li> <li><strong>Biden praised the Senate’s passage of the infrastructure bill,</strong> describing the bipartisan deal as proof that “democracy can still work”. Speaking at the White House this afternoon, Biden said, “After years and years of infrastructure week, we’re on the cusp of an infrastructure decade that I truly believe will transform America.”</li> <li><strong>The Senate voted along party lines to start debate on the $3.5tn reconciliation bill, </strong>which Democrats plan to pass without any Republican support. The vote-a-rama on the bill is now under way in the Senate, and it may continue into the early hours of Wednesday morning.</li> <li><strong>Dominion Voting Systems is suing two far-right news networks, One America News (OAN) and Newsmax, for spreading lies about fraud in the 2020 election. </strong>In its lawsuits, Dominion accused the networks of having “manufactured, endorsed, repeated, and broadcast a series of verifiably false yet devastating lies” that caused irreparable harm to the company. Dominion is seeking billions of dollars in damages to make up for lost profits and other costs incurred as the company has fought these election lies.</li> <li><strong>The House will return to session 23 August and will likely work on HR 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.</strong> The act would restore protections of the Voting Rights Act, gutted by the supreme court in 2013. Meanwhile, a court <a href="https://www.txcourts.gov/supreme/orders-opinions/2021/august/august-10-2021/">temporarily blocked</a> a restraining order that protected Texas lawmakers from being arrested after they fled the state in July to stop a Republican effort to enact new voting restrictions. </li> <li><strong>Several of Indiana’s laws restricting abortion are unconstitutional, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday.</strong> US district court judge Sarah Evans Barker issued a permanent injunction against a ban on telemedicine consultations between doctors and women seeking abortions.
