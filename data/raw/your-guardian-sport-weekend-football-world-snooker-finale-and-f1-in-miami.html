Oddly, Rangers, 17 points behind the Hoops, have won the past two league derbies before the final Old Firm clash of the season.

Ruben Amorim’s side are set to record their lowest ever Premier League points tally and won’t find much respite in west London, particularly as this fixture comes just days after a pivotal Europa League semi-final first leg at Athletic Bilbao. So expect a host of academy graduates to feature, including 17-year-old striker Chido Obi, Harry Amass and Tyler Fredricson. Join Michael Butler to see if the tyros shine, before John Brewin’s report.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/may/04/brighton-v-newcastle-brentford-v-manchester-united-and-more-premier-league-live"><sub>Read more</sub></a></p> <p>2.15pm</p> <p>Tottenham v Chelsea live</p> <p>Women’s Super League</p>  <p>Chelsea have the title but there’s plenty still in the mix with two derbies – Liverpool face Everton plus the Manchester derby at noon – followed by Crystal Palace v Leicester, Tottenham v Chelsea and West Ham v Aston Villa.

The 27-year-old Mercedes driver may not be able to match the pace of the McLarens but three podiums in the first five races cannot be ignored.
