<p>‘I am human, and nothing human is alien to me,” wrote Roman playwright Terence in 165BC. He hadn’t seen any of the Alien films, though. He hadn’t seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/01/alien-review-ridley-scott-lethally-contemporary-masterpiece">Alien</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/12/my-favourite-film-aged-12-aliens">Aliens</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/22/alien-3-movie-1992-david-fincher">Alien 3</a> , he hadn’t seen any of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/16/news">Predator crossover canon</a>, he hadn’t seen Resurrection or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/30/prometheus-review">Prometheus</a> or the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/07/alien-covenant-review-ridley-scott-michael-fassbender-katherine-waterston-prometheus">one after</a> Prometheus. He hadn’t even seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/18/alien-romulus-review-thrillingly-gruesome-new-instalment-gets-a-shot-of-young-blood">Alien: Romulus</a>, even though it’s named after the guy who co-founded Rome. The Oscar-winning franchise has earned well over a billion dollars worldwide. There’s nothing more human than loving Alien.</p> <p>Part of the franchise’s success is its malleability. A creature-horror stuffed with Freudian nightmare, the films blend action, sci-fi, theology and satire. (I don’t want to be Frankenstein’s Pedant about it, but the monster is the profit-driven corporation determined to bring the alien to Earth to develop as a biological weapon.) Now that the IP belongs to Disney, we should expect many more instalments. But can they keep stretching the story into exciting shapes? Or are the days of Alien: Below Decks or The Real Housewives of Moon LV-426 upon us?</p>    <p>Thankfully, they’ve given control of Alien: Earth (Disney+, from Wednesday 13 August) to writer-director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/31/alien-earth-disney-noah-hawley-writer-director-interview-timothy-olyphant-fargo">Noah Hawley</a>, the TV genius responsible for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/apr/20/fargo-tv-review-disaster-or-homage">Fargo</a> and the dazzlingly ambitious Marvel series Legion. He takes us back a few years before the start of the first film, to an Earth run by a consortium of five tech companies. A deep space research vessel belonging to Weyland-Yutani, AKA Baddy Corp, crash-lands into a building owned by rival Prodigy. Guess what – there’s a very, very bad dog on board, and the Jurassic ovoids being transported? Not Kinder Eggs.</p> <p>The Alien movies’ main creature, the xenomorph, remains mesmerising. Rather than making an eight-hour slasher movie, Hawley uses its threat to explore a story about identity, the limits of AI and human weakness. An intriguing character is Boy Kavalier, the founder of Prodigy. To capture Weyland-Yutani’s extraterrestrial IP, he sends a party of his new creations: Hybrids. We see him secretly transferring the consciousness of terminally ill children into synthetic bodies, with tremendous strength and upgradable minds. Thank God our tech leaders are more responsible!</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XMfAABiVWM"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_XMfAABiVWM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>This is one of my favourite tropes: evil genius motivated by lonely boredom. Boy Kavalier, who resembles Richard Hammond in a Bob Dylan wig, has created a new species simply because he wants someone to have an interesting conversation with. No one gets him. There is a twisted romance to that idea, if far-fetched. I mean, what does Elon Musk want? Someone to laugh at his jokes? Maybe that’s the same thing.</p> <p>The Hybrids are a great creation. Watching them, I was reminded of The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds. That documentary showed us infants playing, tracing the growth of recognisably adult behaviour. Kavalier’s prototypes kill and jump off cliffs, charged by lithium batteries that would power a city. Yet in the aftermath they are confused, worried about getting in trouble. They’re super-soldiers with the emotional age of children.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/31/alien-earth-disney-noah-hawley-writer-director-interview-timothy-olyphant-fargo">‘It’s the best monster ever invented’: Noah Hawley on bringing Ridley Scott’s Alien to TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is there a current of identification between Hybrid and xenomorph? Is our enemy’s enemy our friend – or just another enemy? Do humans deserve to survive? The series plays with big questions. Yet this isn’t The Rest Is Aliens, a podcast about industrial espionage and existentialism. Its chief ambition is ramping up dread. And blood. Every episode is, frankly, an abattoir. New aliens have been designed that are blood-curdlingly creepy. </p> <p>The show boasts the sound design of the year, with chitinous clacking and background monkey whoops stoking constant unease. Even the casting is creepy, from child-adult Hybrids to Timothy Olyphant as an inscrutable robot scientist. Adrian Edmondson from The Young Ones is in it – yet so unrecognisable that I still don’t know he’s in it.</p> <p>Alien: Earth adds freshness to the franchise’s convoluted lore – give it your eyeballs. Tasting notes include Conrad’s Heart of Darkness, Westworld, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/29/lage-dor-bunuel-chien-andalou-philip-french">Un Chien Andalou</a>, plus The Secret Life of 4 Year Olds. There’s also the most cinematic monster to ever do it, doing it plenty. If that isn’t entertainment enough, then you truly are unknowable.</p>
