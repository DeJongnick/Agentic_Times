<p>A military vehicle crashed into a car in Washington DC on Wednesday morning, an incident that comes as six Republican-led states have all pledged to send more national guard troops to DC.</p> <p>The city’s local CBS station <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/traffic/incidents/crash/national-guard-military-humvee-crash-car-capitol-hill-extraction-dc-fire/65-1cef26de-0843-466d-a814-2492c47da27a">first reported </a>on the accident, which happened in Washington’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, and cited confirmation from the DC fire and emergency services. <a href="https://x.com/dcfireems/status/1958133995356430491">On social media</a>, the department said that one person was extricated and transported with “minor injuries”.</p> <p>A Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1mvbr29/humvee_t_boned_carin_cap_hill/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">posted a video</a> of the collision’s aftermath – showing a Humvee-style vehicle and a shattered silver SUV. A military affairs reporter for the Washington Post <a href="https://x.com/DanLamothe/status/1958183939832426957">noted on X</a> that according to the national guard, “one of the vehicles in this accident was an M-ATV, an armored tactical vehicle with a V-shaped hull designed to deflect roadside bombs. They have commonly been used in war zones for years, and weigh about 14 tons each.”</p> <p>The DC fire department and the national guard did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment and further details on the crash.</p> <p>The incident comes as Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio, South Carolina and West Virginia have all pledged to send at least 1,200 national guard troops to DC, to assist the president’s crackdown on “bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor” in the nation’s capital, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/trump-washington-dc-crime">despite a falling </a>crime rate.</p>
