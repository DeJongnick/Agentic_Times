<p>At least three events connected to Mexican Independence Day have been canceled or postponed in Chicago, amid reports that Donald Trump plans to send troops and immigration agents as part of plans to launch mass deportations.</p> <p>Organizers decided to cancel El Grito Chicago, an event that drew 24,000 people last year and was scheduled for 13-14 September.</p> <p>“It was a painful decision, but holding El Grito Chicago at this time puts the safety of our community at stake – and that’s a risk we are unwilling to take,” the <a href="https://elgritochicago.com/">event’s website</a> stated. “While we’re torn by this decision, when we brought this celebration back, our aim was to create a safe, affordable, family-friendly, community festival for all.”</p> <p>The anxiety in the country’s third-largest city comes after Trump deployed national guard troops to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/trumps-national-guard-troops-los-angeles-illegal">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/04/national-guard-washington-dc-lawsuit-trump-administration">Washington DC.</a> Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was concerned about Ice agents targeting people at the Mexican Independence Day events.</p> <p>Here’s the day’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> news at a glance.</p>  <h2>Mexican festivals in Chicago canceled amid Trump plans to deploy troops</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s plan to deploy national guard troops and federal immigration agents to Chicago is already having an impact on the city’s Mexican community.</p> <p>Organizers have canceled several local events tied to Mexican Independence Day, which occurs on 16 September.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/chicago-mexican-independence-day-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump claims Chicago is ‘world’s most dangerous city’. The most violent ones are in red states</h2>  <p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> threatens to deploy national guard units to cities ostensibly to quell violence, he repeatedly targets Democratic run-cities.</p> <p>But an analysis of crime trends over the last four years shows two things. First, violent crime rates in America’s big cities have been falling over the last two years, and at an even greater rate over the last six months. The decrease<em> </em>in violence in America is unprecedented.</p> <p>Second, crime in large cities in the aggregate is lower in states with Democratic leadership. But the president focuses his ire almost exclusively on large blue<em> </em>cities in blue<em> </em>states, sidestepping political conflict with red<em> </em>Republican governors.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/trump-chicago-crime-red-states-violent"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Postal traffic into US plunges by more than 80% after Trump ends exemption</h2>  <p>Postal traffic into the US plunged by more than 80% after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> ended a tariff exemption for low-cost imports, the United Nations postal agency said Saturday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/postal-traffic-us-plunges"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Rightwing conference reveals muddled lines between Trump and far right</h2>  <p>A rightwing conference recently saw theocratic Christian nationalists, far-right publishers and members of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/05/far-right-mens-clubs-old-glory">men-only secret societies</a> speaking alongside the Missouri senator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmitt">Eric Schmitt</a>, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s Department of Justice and other senior Republican figures.</p> <p>The speaker list at the National Conservatism conference in Washington DC raises questions over what distinctions exist between the nationalist hard right in the US and members of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a> party.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/national-convservatism-conference-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump’s former surgeon general urges president to fire RFK Jr</h2>  <p>The surgeon general from the first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> on Saturday said that the US president should “absolutely” fire health secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a> over his “dangerous” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/11/rfk-jr-trump-vaccine-research-avian-flu">policies on vaccines</a> and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/jerome-adams-trump-surgeon-blasts-rfk-jr"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump administration begins new Ice operation in Massachusetts</h2>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has targeted Massachusetts as its next location to begin arresting and deporting immigrants, a Department of Homeland Security official confirmed to NBC News on Saturday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/trump-administration-immigration-crackdown-massachusetts"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>What else happened today:</h2>  <ul> <li><p><strong>US supreme court rulings are “not just an opinion poll” of its nine judges’ beliefs, conservative <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-rulings">Amy Coney Barrett has said</a></strong>, as she and her colleagues weigh a request to overturn the legalization of same-sex marriage.</p></li> <li><p><strong>US Open broadcasters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/06/broadcasters-told-not-to-air-any-booing-of-donald-trump-at-us-open-mens-final">have been asked not to air any booing of Donald Trump</a></strong> at Sunday’s men’s final.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The West Point Association of Graduates has reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/west-point-cancels-tom-hanks-ceremony">canceled a ceremony to honor Tom Hanks</a></strong> just weeks before it was to take place.</p></li> </ul>  <p>Catching up?<em> Here’s what happened on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/trump-administration-news-updates-today">Friday 5 September</a>.</em></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Atom">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
