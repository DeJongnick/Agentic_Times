<h1>What to take to university – and what to leave behind, according to students</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-09-10T09:00:08Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Mabel Banfield-Nwachi &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> The Filter</div>
<p>Starting university can be exciting, overwhelming and, if you’re not careful, a bit of a packing disaster. Faced with the prospect of moving from home, it’s easy to convince yourself you’ll need every mug, blanket and kitchen gadget you’ve ever touched, just in case. However, speak to students who’ve already lived through the chaos of it and they’ll tell you … most of it sits unused, taking up space and making the end-of-term move a nightmare.</p> <p>There are some things worth the space in your suitcase, though. From the practical spare phone cables to that one pair of sliders everyone swears by, here are the things students say they couldn’t do without – and the ones they wish they’d left at home.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>What to take to uni</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2>Bedroom</h2> <h2>A robe</h2> <p>When the fire alarm goes off early in the morning and you feel too embarrassed to stand outside in your pyjamas, you’ll thank your past self for buying one! <strong>Sundus Abdi, journalism MA, </strong><strong>Leeds Trinity University</strong></p>    <p><strong>John Lewis fleece robe</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-hi-pile-fleece-robe/grey/p3399139" > £42 at John Lewis </a>    <p><strong>M&amp;S Collection polka dot dressing gown</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/pure-cotton-polka-dot-dressing-gown/p/clp60705401" > £35 at M&amp;S </a>  <h2>A comfy mattress pad</h2> <p>Invest in a thick mattress topper. You’ll be on a few different mattresses at uni, not all of them great. <strong>Zoe Cochrane, geography, </strong><strong>University of Glasgow</strong></p>    <p><strong>Ikea mattress pad</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/nisseholm-mattress-pad-white-40558930/" > £85 at Ikea </a>    <p><strong>John Lewis </strong><strong>mattress topper</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-synthetic-soft-touch-washable-dual-layer-6cm-deep-mattress-topper/p1519431" > From £85 at John Lewis </a>  <p><em><strong>For more, read our guide to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/31/best-mattress-toppers-uk">best mattress toppers, tested</a></strong></em></p> <h2>Smart storage</h2> <p>An over-the-door hook was really useful in freeing up space in my tiny wardrobe. Hanging this over your bathroom or bedroom door means you can hang up coats, dressing gowns or bags and make use of the usually small space you get in student halls bedrooms. <strong>Charlotte Gornall, fashion communication: journalism, Central Saint Martins</strong></p>    <p><strong>Dunelm </strong><strong>over-door hook</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/bathroom-basics-white-over-door-hook-1000024849?defaultSkuId=30103846" > £6 at Dunelm </a>  <h2>Good lighting</h2> <p>A good desk lamp. Halls’ lighting was so dim that I couldn’t work without one. <strong>Alex, history and communications, </strong><strong>Nottingham Trent University</strong></p>    <p><strong>Habitat </strong><strong>metal desk lamp</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.habitat.co.uk/product/7945601" > £40 at Habitat </a>    <p><strong>Elliott desk lamp</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-elliott-desk-lamp/avocado/p6140120" > £70 at John Lewis </a>  <h2>More plugs</h2> <p>Plug block and extension cables. The plugs are never where you need them. <strong>Ollie Blanson, business and management, University of Bristol</strong></p>    <p><strong>Masterplug </strong><strong>three-way plug adaptor</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.screwfix.com/p/masterplug-13a-fused-3-way-plug-adaptor/9773P" > £3.49 at Screwfix </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/gol-ui/product/masterplug-3-socket-multisocket-adaptor" > £3.99 at Sainsbury’s </a>    <p><strong>Ikea extension cord</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/hornfels-extension-cord-yellow-80555722/" > £12 at Ikea </a>  <h2>Organisation</h2> <p>Small baskets and containers for organising. <strong>Hafsa, Leeds Arts University</strong></p>    <p><strong>Sostrene Grene folding crate</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://sostrenegrene.com/en-gb/products/home/folding-crate-p-7dfe44e7?variant=512846-028" > £10.34 at Sostrene Grene </a>    <p><strong>H&amp;M seagrass storage basket</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.1257883002.html" > £8.50 at H&amp;M </a>  <h2>Underbed storage</h2> <p>You move around a lot and these make it easy to organise stuff and keep it out of sight. <strong>Will Owen, English literature, </strong><strong>University of Cambridge</strong></p>    <p><strong>Dunelm Stripe underbed storage bag</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/stripe-underbed-storage-bag-1000221026" > £14 at Dunelm </a>    <p><strong>H&amp;M large storage box</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.1203227001.html" > £17 at H&amp;M </a>  <h2>A bin</h2> <p>I didn’t bring an under-desk bin when I first got to uni and my room was a mess. <strong>Francis, politics and international relations, University of Sheffield</strong></p>    <p><strong>Viking waste bin</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.viking-direct.co.uk/en/p/1523520" > £3.99 at Viking </a>    <p><strong>La Redoute waste basket</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.laredoute.co.uk/ppdp/prod-350191552.aspx" > £18.74 at La Redoute </a>  <h2>Command strips for hanging pictures</h2> <p>Blu-Tak is good but it can leave marks, which if you’re in a flat you might have to pay the landlord for. I had no issues getting these off when I moved out. <strong>Camilla Shaw, classics, University of Nottingham</strong></p>    <p><strong>Command small and medium picture hanging strips</strong></p>  <a

charger, water bottle and maybe even a food shop in the same bag, so it’s worth having one that spreads the weight. <strong>Amelia Hart, history, </strong><strong>University of Warwick</strong></p>    <p><strong>Eastpak Up Roll backpack</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.endclothing.com/gb/eastpak-up-roll-travelpack-backpack-ek0a5bgf4y81.html" > £65 at End Clothing </a>

<h2>A water bottle</h2> <p>My big reusable water bottle came with me everywhere, saved me from buying plastic bottles constantly and was a good reminder to stay hydrated when busy revising. <strong>Anna Fields, accounting, </strong><strong>University of Reading</strong></p>    <p><strong>Yeti Rambler </strong><strong>532ml bottle</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link"

<p>A long cable is so good for when you’re in your student halls: it will probably stretch the length of the room so you can always have your phone plugged in. <strong>Ella, Queen’s University

drown out noisy neighbours. <strong>Leila, sociology, Goldsmiths, University of London</strong></p>    <p><strong>Ultimate Ears Bluetooth waterproof portable speaker</strong></p>  <a class="element

dryers and they’re quite pricey. <strong>Hannah Wilkes, psychology, University of Exeter</strong></p>    <p><strong>Three-tier indoor clothes airer</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link"

wind. <strong>Tessa, history, University of Glasgow</strong></p>    <p><strong>Uniqlo seamless down long coat</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link"

They’re banned in most student accommodation because of the fire hazard, so you don’t need to add extra weight to your luggage. <strong>Sundus Abdi</strong></p> <p>I bought lots of notebooks and stationery but didn’t end up using it. I mainly use my laptop for taking notes in lectures and for essays. <strong>Zoe Cochrane</strong></p> <p>An iron! I brought one with me but didn’t use it once, because there was never enough space to iron. Instead, I would invest in <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/russell-hobbs-steam-genie-2-in-1-handheld-clothes-steamer-blue/p113463871">a small steamer</a>; quick to use and takes little effort. <strong>Charlotte Gornall</strong></p> <p>Not everyone [going in to halls or a shared house] has to buy their own kettle and toaster. Have a chat about this with your flatmates before you buy anything. <strong>Zainab</strong></p> <p>An entire set of pans. Everyone ends up sharing, and mine just took up space. But when you move into second year, I’d recommend all chipping in for a good-quality set and looking after it. <strong>Alex</strong></p> <p>A printer. I thought I’d be using it weekly but I barely touched it, and the library had everything. I even had some free printing credits from uni each year. <strong>Ollie Blanson</strong></p> <p>Lots of clothes. It ended up being my downfall when I was moving back home. A smaller wardrobe is easier to manage, packing-wise. <strong>Hafsa</strong></p> <p>Decorative cushions. I brought four and they ended up on the floor every day. <strong>Priya Shah</strong></p> <p>A smoothie-maker. I used it twice, then it gathered dust until I took it home. <strong>Anna Fields</strong></p> <p>Loads of sets of bedding. A weekly wash is easier than storing the spares. <strong>Ella</strong></p> <p>Microplane grater. I ended up just using one of the <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-stainless-steel-4-sided-box-grater/p5359745">four-sided box graters</a> for everything. <strong>Ruben</strong></p> <p>A huge first aid kit. It’s good to <a href="https://www.boots.com/mini-first-aid-kit-74-pieces-10308587">have a small one</a> with some plasters, antiseptic and paracetamol, but the rest is overkill. <strong>Anonymous</strong></p> <p>Random food you don’t normally eat. I rocked up to uni with so many tins of beans, like some apocalyptic prepper, despite the fact that I was living in a normal city with normal supermarkets, and I hate beans. <strong>Will Owen</strong></p> <p>Too many shoes. I brought a shelf’s worth and lived in the same trainers every day. <strong>Amelia Hart</strong></p> <p>Too many accessories. You do not need 15 handbags; you’re just going to use one. <strong>Kirsten</strong></p> <p>A TV in first year. I didn’t use the TV in my room at all until second year, where it became our house one. <strong>Tessa</strong></p> <p>A whiteboard. I thought it would keep me organised but my friends just doodled on it. <strong>Leila</strong></p> <p>Extra furniture. I bought a chair but it just ended up being another wash basket. <strong>Francis</strong></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Buttons">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/11/20/small-blue-link-embed-nov-24.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
