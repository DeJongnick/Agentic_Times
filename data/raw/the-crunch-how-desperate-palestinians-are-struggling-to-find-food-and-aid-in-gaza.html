<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch!</p> <p>More Palestinians died of starvation in the past week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/29/famine-gaza-israel-war-starvation-hunger">than in the preceding 21 months</a>, prompting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/23/the-guardian-view-on-starvation-in-gaza-it-will-take-more-than-words-to-halt-israels-genocide">widespread condemnation of Israel’s actions</a>.</p> <p>As a result, much of the media’s focus has been on the desperate suffering of the Palestinians. So we are doing something slightly different in this newsletter: a spotlight on data-visualisation about how people in Gaza are being killed and injured while seeking aid.</p> <p>There’s also a collection of other things that caught our eye this fortnight towards the end of the newsletter.</p> <h2>1. An eleven-minute race for food</h2> <p>The four aid distribution sites across Gaza run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) are only open for a few minutes a day – the Saudi site was open for an average of 11 minutes in June. Our colleagues in the UK put together <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/22/food-aid-gaza-deaths-visual-story-ghf-israel">this visual explainer</a> on “how aid points in Gaza became death traps”.</p> <p>This chart shows the time between aid sites opening and closing through June and July:</p>    <p>Palestinians in Gaza have to queue and walk kilometres – through evacuation zones that civilians have been told to leave – to reach aid sites. The piece also includes maps if, like us, you are having trouble getting your head around this geography.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/mahmoud_route/giv-325544AUfMxkDileb" data-alt="A map showing the 8km distance of a queue to receive food aid in Palestine"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/07/mahmoud_route/giv-325544AUfMxkDileb">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>***</p> <p><strong>2. Average daily calories in Gaza</strong></p> <p>Our colleague Mona Chalabi also posted this devastating graphic <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMdSiSju8Gj/">on Instagram</a> comparing the average calories consumed by someone in Gaza in May, to the daily recommended amount:</p>    <p>We’ve often featured Mona’s spectacular work, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA_SXyRu6aj/?img_index=1">this one</a> on Gaza’s population as 100 people, and the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3iR068O5I0/">population density of bombed cities</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>3. Aid sites and access routes</strong></p> <p>The Economist <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2025/07/28/satellite-images-show-how-receiving-aid-in-gaza-became-so-deadly">also covered the GHF aid sites</a> ($), with a series of excellent maps and satellite images showing the long walks and the huge crowds forming at checkpoints.</p>    <p>Among other things, this really drives home the distances that families are forced to travel to get aid.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>4. Huge crowds for aid convoy</strong></p> <p>To give more context around the scale of the desperation for aid, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/29/world/middleeast/gaza-satellite-aid-truck-famine.html">reports</a> on a satellite image of huge crowds gathering around aid trucks taken in Gaza last week:</p>    <p>Not a lot is known about where these trucks were going or what they were carrying. The NYT has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/30/world/middleeast/palestinian-state-recognition-maps.html">published a map</a> showing which countries have already recognised a Palestinian state.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>5. Environmental devastation in Gaza</strong></p> <p>Environmental devastation is an under-reported aspect of the destruction in Gaza. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-gaza-war-environmental-disaster/">Bloomberg analysis</a> of satellite data has found nearly 350 sites where waste has been piling up since the conflict began.</p> <p>This map shows Souk Feras, which was a market before the conflict began but now holds an estimated 200,000 metric tons of rubbish:</p>    <p>The Bloomberg team estimates that new garbage sites cover more than 1 sq kilometre, about 60% of the areas are close to tents, and 15% are near water, sanitation or other “hygiene sites”.
