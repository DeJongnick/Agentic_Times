    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - Salah has Hunt (285) in his sights but he is still some way behind Rush (346)., 2:B - He also made 95 appearances for England. , 3:C - There have been 340 goals – 3.43 per match. , 4:A - Despite all those runs, Australia did not win the tournament. They were beaten by India in the final., 5:D - They have held them to a draw twice but that’s not a great record given they’ve played 32 times., 6:C - It was their biggest ever win at Murrayfield; although their biggest ever win would be beating New Zealand on Saturday., 7:C - South Africa beat France 29-28 in the quarter-finals, England 16-15 in the semi-finals and New Zealand 12-11 in the final., 8:C - It has taken him 1,504 games. “Every milestone is a special moment,” he said. , 9:A - England have one more chance to beat Australia when the teams meet in Leeds this weekend. , 10:B - Kanu was just 18 years and 296 days old when he played for Ajax against Milan in the 1995 final. Patrick Kluivert, who scored the only goal of the game, was also 18. , 11:A - They beat the Padres in 1998, the Braves in 1999 and the Mets in 2000. , 12:D - They were own goals. Estève put the ball in his own net twice when City beat Burnley 5-1 in September., 13:D - Women usually fight 10 two-minute rounds rather than 12 three-minute rounds. “Women’s boxing has come a long way, but there’s still progress to be made,” she said. “I’ve always believed in equality, and that includes the choice to fight equal rounds, equal opportunities and equal respect. I’m proud of my accomplishment in becoming a WBC champion, but it’s time to take a stand for what’s right and for the future of the sport.” , 14:A - Matthews was awarded his knighthood in 1965, towards the end of his long career. He was 50 – the same age David Beckham is now. , 15:D - Cameron Green is the only player yet to turn 30. Former Australia captain Steve Waugh is concerned that the team is too old. “The bowlers are in their 30s and some of the batsmen are getting on as well,” he said. “That’s natural for every team. You just want to make sure that three or four players don’t go out at the same time. That leaves a big hole in the team.” , 16:A - King, the world No 1 at the time, initially turned down the offer to play Riggs, who was 55 years old and well into his retirement. But when he beat Margaret Court in what became known as the “Mother’s Day Massacre” and gloated about the victory, she thought she had to take on the challenge. She said later: “I thought it would set us back 50 years if I didn’t win that match. It would ruin the women’s tour and affect all women’s self-esteem.”</p>
