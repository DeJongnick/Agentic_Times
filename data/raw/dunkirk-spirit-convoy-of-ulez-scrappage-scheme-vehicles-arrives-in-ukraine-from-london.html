Emotions are always honest’: the film at the heart of Ukraine’s agonising evacuations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ukraine is short of vehicles, particularly near the frontline where ordinary cars and vans are used to transport casualties from the battlefield and medical facilities to hospitals. The London scheme is supported by Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko.</p> <p>The Ulez area was expanded by the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, in August 2023 to include the whole of the capital, making it the world’s largest pollution charging area. People who drive in the zone in a vehicle that does not meet minimum emissions standards are required to pay a £12.50 daily fee. A £160m scheme run by TfL enables residents, small businesses, sole traders and charities to scrap non-compliant cars and claim grants.</p> <p>For a scrapped vehicle to be sent to Ukraine through the programme, it must serve a function such as assisting with medical aid or evacuating people from dangerous areas.</p> <p>“We remain enormously grateful for the support given to us by the mayors of London and Kyiv, and by our many partners, supporters and donors,” a BUAID spokesperson said.</p> <p>“Vehicles that would have gone to scrap are saving lives in Ukraine, and we know that every one of them is valued and valuable.</p> <p>“It is great to see people showing the Dunkirk spirit that Churchill talked about in world war two, making transport available to those under threat from a ruthless enemy.”</p> <p>TfL’s head of transport strategy and planning, Lucy Hayward-Speight, said: “The scrappage scheme has provided support for people to make the green transition alongside the London-wide Ulez being introduced.</p> <p>“As well as helping to clean up the capital’s toxic air, Londoners are also demonstrating their concern for others by choosing to provide vital aid for those in the most unimaginable circumstances in Ukraine.</p> <p>“We would encourage anyone eligible to donate their vehicle if they can.”</p> <p><em>Press Association contributed to this story</em></p>
