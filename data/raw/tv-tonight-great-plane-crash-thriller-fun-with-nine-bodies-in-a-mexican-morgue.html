<h2><strong>Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue</strong></h2> <p><strong>9.20pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>The American authorities are in Mexico demanding answers about Flight CBZ517: was the aircraft even legit? Flashbacks show the moment the survivors discover the big secret behind the crash for themselves, which makes them believe they know who the traitor is. Meanwhile – you guessed it! – another passenger snuffs it. Great plane thriller fun from Anthony Horowitz. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>Bettany Hughes’ Treasures of the World</strong></h2> <p><strong>7pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>In this episode, Hughes is in Uzbekistan, the ancient Silk Road hub and former Soviet republic. In the city of Termez, she finds out about Alexander the Great, before heading to Chorasmia to learn about sun worship. Then, she sees the world’s first pack camel statuette in Bukhara. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>The Weakest Link: Redemption Special</strong></h2> <p><strong>8.35pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>Now hosted by the omnipresent Romesh Ranganathan, this special episode of the gameshow gives previously underachieving celebrity contestants a shot at reputational recovery. Tim Vine and Donna Preston are among the first-time losers trying again, in aid of charity. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Romesh Ranganathan’s Parents’ Evening</strong></h2> <p><strong>9.35pm, ITV1</strong></p>    <p>Her son’s name may be in the title but it’s Shanthi Ranganathan who is the MVP of this comedy game, often upstaging Romesh as she tallies the scores. This week’s parent-child teams being quizzed are Alex Brooker and his mum Elaine, Jeff Brazier and his son Bobby, and perhaps the ultimate glam fam: Janet Ellis and Sophie Ellis-Bextor. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2><strong>The Intruder</strong></h2> <p><strong>9.45pm, BBC Four</strong></p> <p>It’s the second and concluding double bill of the moreish French psychological thriller about a shifty au pair. Paula has been arrested for neighbour Aline’s murder – and the fact Paula was having an affair with Aline’s husband isn’t great. But she’s adamant that Tess – who is still looking after her children in her home – is the real perpetrator. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Film choices</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Twits, out now, Netflix </strong></p>    <p>The first animated feature born out of Netflix’s purchase of Roald Dahl’s back catalogue takes the book’s cruel, disgusting, prank-playing couple and sets them against a bunch of resourceful American kids. Margo Martindale and Johnny Vegas voice Mr and Mrs Twit, whose dream of opening a theme park falls foul of Maitreyi Ramakrishnan’s Beesha, doyenne of the local orphanage. There is plenty of burping and farting – and the odd exploding bottom – to remind you of Dahl’s penchant for earthy physical comedy, before the hugs and learning kick in. <em>Simon Wardell</em> </p> <p><strong>The Menu, 9pm, Channel 4 </strong></p> <p>Revenge is a dish best served with a potato confit and beef jus. Luckily, chef Julian Slowik (a steely Ralph Fiennes) is a feted master of fine dining. Unluckily, the 12 guests chosen to join him for a meal on his private island all have dark deeds in their pasts for which Slowik will punish them. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the cuckoo in the nest, Margot, who is the date of idiot gourmand Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) but is not what she appears. Mark Mylod’s darkly comic drama is an exquisite concoction – from the artful food to the escalating fear as the diners see what the next course brings. <em>SW</em></p> <h2><strong>Live sport</strong></h2> <p><strong>International T20 Cricket, New Zealand v England , 7am, TNT Sports 1 </strong>From Christchurch.
