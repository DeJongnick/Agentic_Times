<p>A little under six months ago, Leny Yoro sat on the San Mamés turf, head slumped, anguished by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/europa-league-final-tottenham-manchester-united-match-report">Europa League final defeat</a> to Tottenham. It extinguished Manchester United’s last flicker of hope of Champions League qualification in a desperate season, the Frenchman’s first in England.</p> <p>United visit the same opponents on Saturday, with optimism finally creeping back at Old Trafford after a run of four games without defeat. Yoro, who turns 20 next week, was one of the few successes of a grinding campaign. Ruben Amorim’s attempt to turn the behemoth around is starting to see results and a win at Tottenham would be a further indication of progress as the head coach begins his second year in charge.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/06/chelsea-fully-supportive-of-marescas-rotation-policy-despite-qarabag-draw">Chelsea fully supportive of Maresca’s rotation policy despite Qarabag draw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Everyone knows last season was a really emotional season,” Yoro says. “Not just for the coach, for everyone. It was tough, honestly, it was tough for us to sometimes face the games, face training. So everyone was emotional, to be honest.</p> <p>“I think this year is different. We don’t have the Champions League, but if you can take the good, we have more time to train, we have more freedom in our head. The coach is not different than last year, it’s just the result that is different. And every footballer knows when you win on the day, you have a really perfect week after. It’s more about the result in the head. It’s not as emotional as last year.”</p> <p>Focusing on the benefits does not make up for the lack of European competition and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/27/grimsby-manchester-united-carabao-cup-second-round-match-report">being eliminated by Grimsby</a> in the Carabao Cup. Yoro has played in all 10 Premier League games, helping United to start the weekend in eighth, but the upward trajectory needs to continue to scratch the itch for continental football.</p> <p>“When you’re in Manchester United, you need to play in Europe, especially with what happened last year,” says Yoro. “Everyone knows our idea is to be in the top, to be in the Champions League, of course. I think we can reach it. When you’re at Manchester United, you need to think about this. It’s really important for us this year to achieve this, and this is in the mind of everyone.”</p>    <p>United and Amorim knew changes were required to adapt what the Portuguese inherited into something he could turn in his own image. The director of football, Jason Wilcox, spoke this week about not wanting to recruit “Harlem Globetrotters” but a group of players who are disciplined and eager to improve, pointing out that many often arrive more than an hour early for training.</p> <p>Marcus Rashford, Antony, Jadon Sancho and Alejandro Garnacho left the squad as part of the rebuild. More than £200m was invested in Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko in another expensive summer. In the previous one a then 18-year‑old Yoro <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/18/manchester-united-leny-yoro-lille#:~:text=Manchester%20United%20sign%20defender%20Leny%20Yoro%20from%20Lille%20for%20%C2%A352.2m,-This%20article%20is&amp;amp;text=Manchester%20United%20have%20announced%20the,extend%20for%20a%20further%20year.">arrived for £52m</a> as United sought a defender who could be pivotal for the next decade. But he missed the first four months of the season through injury, delaying his competitive debut until December.</p> <p>“The character is really important, for the atmosphere of the team,” Yoro says. “I think the club is doing well with this, to take only people who can bring good things to the team. We don’t want any bad things in the team. It’s really important for us to be focused on the team, don’t do any drama. Just speak with everyone, have a good relationship. This is the best, I think, for the team.</p> <p>“We cannot build something with bad energy or bad atmosphere or bad characters. The thing that’s good is that there is no group of friends in the team. This is just one group of friends. This is the best for the team to not have any drama.”</p> <p>A strong friendship with Kobbie Mainoo has helped Yoro ease into Manchester life, with the Stockport-born midfielder taking the Frenchman to some of his favourite local haunts. The pair went on holiday together to Los Angeles over the summer, while the former United defender Rio Ferdinand has offered advice to the latest generation.</p> <p>Real Madrid were interested in Yoro but United signed the centre‑back from Lille, where two of his three younger brothers are in the academy. Before he had even played a game for the club, Erik ten Hag was sacked as head coach and under Amorim they finished the season three places above the relegation zone.</p>    <p>“Even with last season, I never had this feeling of regret,” Yoro says of joining United. “I know Manchester United, I know sometimes you can have a bad season, but this club is a top club, so you cannot have doubts about this. I knew the project of the club before I came.</p> <p>“Of course I cannot expect the first year to finish in 15th position. These are some things you need to face also. But you have the director of the club, the coach, all the players, they’re here to push you every day. You have confidence in this club. You need to put your heads up every day and try to do your best.”</p>
