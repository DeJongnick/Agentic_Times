In most cases, the government has cited their roles in pro-Palestinian campus protests over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel-hamas-war">Israel’s war in Gaza</a> following the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/29/the-middle-east-in-crisis-7-october-the-day-that-changed-the-world">7 October 2023 attack</a>. Claims that they “support <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a>” are invoked as justification for wanting to deport them, even though they have not been charged with any crimes. Those taken include:</p> <p><strong>Mahmoud Khalil</strong></p> <p>A recent graduate student of Columbia University in New York, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mahmoud-khalil">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, 30, is a Palestinian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/why-was-mahmoud-khalil-arrested">green-card holder</a> who was a leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/30/columbia-university-campus-protests">during protests</a> last year. He was arrested <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/columbia-student-mahmoud-khalil-was-detained-arrest-warrant-trump-admi-rcna202946">without</a> due process in front of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/mahmoud-khalil-wife-noor-abdalla">his pregnant wife</a> and has been in a detention center <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/29/ice-detention-centers-immigration-asylum">in Louisiana</a> since mid-March, denied release to attend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/21/mahmoud-khalil-ice-noor-abdalla-birth">the birth</a>. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/11/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-ruling-immigration">told</a> an immigration judge that he and hundreds of other detainees were being denied rights – “due process and fundamental fairness” – the court itself had claimed to prioritize.</p>    <p>The government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/mahmoud-khalil-first-amendment-trump">is using</a> obscure immigration law to make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/11/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-ruling-immigration">extraordinary claims</a> in cases like Khalil’s that it can summarily detain and deport people for constitutionally protected free speech if they are deemed adverse to US foreign policy. A far-right group has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/israel-betar-deportation-list-trump">claimed credit</a> for flagging his and others’ names for scrutiny by the authorities. He was now allowed to attend the birth of his son. Khalil was released on bail on June 20 after more than three months in detention and, appearing in public the next day after being reunited with his wife, Noor Abdalla, and their child, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/21/mahmoud-khalil-released-family">he pledged</a> to continue to speak up for Palestine. Supporters said they would continue to rally behind him as he fought his case, and Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused the Trump administration of “persecution based on political speech.”</p> <p><strong>Rümeysa Öztürk</strong></p>    <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">US immigration</a> officials <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/ice-agents-detain-tufts-university-graduate-student">grabbed</a> the Tufts University PhD student near Boston and bustled her into an unmarked car, shown in onlooker video. Öztürk, a Fulbright scholar and Turkish national on a visa, had co-written a student <a href="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj">newspaper op-ed</a> criticizing Tufts’ response to Israel’s military assault on Gaza and Palestinians. She was rushed into detention in Louisiana in apparent defiance of a court order. Öztürk, 30, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/tufts-student-ice-asthma-attacks">reported</a> neglect and abuse there in “unsafe and inhumane conditions”. On 7 May, an appeals court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/07/detained-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-ruling">granted a judge’s order</a> that she be returned to New England for hearings but on 9 May the judge ordered her immediate release, citing deep <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/trump-tufts-student-deportation-rumeysa-ozturk">constitutional concerns</a>, and she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/trump-tufts-student-deportation-rumeysa-ozturk">was freed</a> on bail.</p> <p><strong>Mohsen Mahdawi</strong></p>    <p>Mahdawi, a Palestinian green-card holder and student at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/columbia-university">Columbia University</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/mohsen-mahdawi-palestinian-detained-ice">was apprehended</a> by Ice in Colchester, Vermont, on 14 April, as first <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/04/14/ice-columbia-student-mohsen-mahdawi-citizenship-interview/">reported</a> by the Intercept.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/trump-student-visas-deportation">Deported over a speeding ticket?

He was arrested during an interview for US citizenship, which he <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/mohsen-mahdawi-columbia-student-freed-ice-feared-citizenship/story?id=121485222">now views</a> as “a trap”. The administration’s arcane <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/mohsen-mahdawi-columbia-detained">justification</a> was that his activism could “potentially undermine” the Middle East peace process, citing the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). He was detained in Vermont and a judge <a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/mahdawi-to-remain-in-vermont/64590246">blocked</a> his transfer to Louisiana. Democratic lawmakers visited Khalil, Öztürk and Mahdawi but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/22/mahmoud-khalil-rumeysa-ozturk-ice-detention">failed</a> to secure their release. Then on 30 April, the federal court in Vermont ordered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/mohsen-mahdawi-released-immigration-detention">his release</a>, and upon being freed Mahdawi said: “This is a light of hope and faith in the justice system … we are witnessing the fight for justice in America.”</p> <p><strong>Yunseo Chung</strong></p>    <p>Another Columbia student, Chung, 21, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/columbia-palestinian-activist-sues-trump-administration-deportation">sued</a> the administration for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/25/columbia-gaza-protester-yunseo-chung-lawsuit">trying to</a> deport her, and has gone <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/04/14/yunseo-chung-marco-rubio-columbia-deportation-mahmoud-khalil-mohsen-mahdawi/">into hiding</a>. She is a pro-Palestinian campaigner and was arrested by the New York police in March while protesting, as first reported by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/24/nyregion/columbia-student-ice-suit-yunseo-chung.html">New York Times</a>. She said a government official told her lawyer they wanted to remove her from the country and her residency status was being revoked. Chung was born in South Korea and has been in the US since she was seven. Ice is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/16/ice-warrant-false-pretenses-columbia-students">accused of using</a> false pretenses to obtain a warrant for her apprehension.</p> <p><strong>Alireza Doroudi</strong></p>    <p>The College Democrats group at the University of Alabama said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/ice-university-of-alabama-doctoral-student">of the arrest</a> of Doroudi, 32, an Iranian studying mechanical engineering: “Donald Trump, Tom Homan [Trump’s ‘border czar’], and Ice have struck a cold, vicious dagger through the heart of UA’s international community.”</p> <p>He was taken to the same Louisiana federal detention center as Khalil and <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2025/04/alireza-doroudi-denied-bond-alabama-doctoral-student-faces-possible-deportation-to-iran.html">denied bond</a>. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said he was a threat to national security, without providing details. Doroudi’s fiancee, Sama Bajgani, also an Iranian doctoral student at the university, <a href="https://www.wvua23.com/communitystories/wvua-23-news-exclusive-alireza-doroudis-fianc-e-speaks-out/article_216cfdae-97fc-471e-b199-26e7f3176c3a.html">told</a> local TV: “We endured a lot to come to a safe place, to just pursue a degree. And then this happened to us.” In mid-May, he indicated to a court that he was so stricken that he was willing to leave the country, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/us/doroudi-student-visa-detention.html">reported</a>.</p> <p><strong>Badar Khan Suri</strong></p>    <p>More than 370 alumni of Washington DC-based Georgetown University joined 65 current students there in signing on to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19ExNYSjEOcP9E9UFKhFtzbEHV9ZxDAIX/view?usp=sharing">letter</a> opposing immigration authorities’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/georgetown-professor-detained">detention of Dr Badar Khan Suri</a>, a senior postdoctoral fellow at the institution’s Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (ACMCU).</p> <p>The authorities revoked his student visa, alleging the Indian citizen’s father-in-law had been an adviser to Hamas in the past – and <a href="https://thehoya.com/news/on-social-media-khan-suri-opposed-israeli-action-did-not-advocate-breaking-law/">claiming</a> he was “deportable” because of pro-Palestinian social media posts. He was taken to Louisiana and then <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/ice-snatched-a-georgetown-postdoc-i-visited-him-in-jail">detention in Texas</a>. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/14/judge-order-release-khan-suri-ice">was released</a> in mid-May but still faces deportation proceedings. In turn, he has a petition against the Trump administration for wrongful arrest and detention in violation of the first amendment and other constitutional rights.</p>    <p><strong>Kseniia Petrova</strong></p> <p>The Harvard Medical School research scientist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/russian-scientist-harvard-medical-school-ice-detention">was stopped</a> at Boston’s Logan airport by US authorities on her way back from France in February, over what appeared to be an irregularity in customs paperwork related to a packet of frog embryo samples. She was told her visa was being revoked and she was being deported to her native Russia.</p> <p>Petrova, 30, said she feared persecution for opposing the invasion of Ukraine and also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/science/russian-scientist-ice-detained-harvard.html">ended up</a> in overcrowded detention in Louisiana. Her colleagues say her expertise is “irreplaceable” and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/26/us/kseniia-petrova-harvard-detained-ice/index.html">Petrova said</a> foreign scientists “enrich” the US – and she had no idea she needed to declare the research packet at customs. In mid-May, she was criminally charged with smuggling and faces 20 years in prison. She was expected to be transferred back to Massachusetts to face the federal charges. In late May, she was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/28/harvard-researcher-released-smuggling">ordered released</a> on bail.</p> <h2>Student visas revoked, then restored amid chaos</h2> <p>More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/25/student-visa-legal-status-restored">1,400 international students</a> from 200 US colleges had their “legal status changed” by the state department, in what the specialist publication Inside Higher Education <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/07/where-students-have-had-their-visas-revoked">called</a> “an explosion of visa terminations”.</p> <p>Amid scant information and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-student-f1-visa-revoked-college-f12320b435b6bf9cf723f1e8eb8c67ae">rising panic</a>, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, lambasted protesters and campus activists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/state-department-visas-pro-palestine-protesters">as “lunatics”</a>. Some were cited for pro-Palestinian views, others think they were targeted because of minor crimes or offenses, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/trump-student-visas-deportation">a speeding ticket</a>. Some could find no explanation, many tried to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-student-visa-status-restraining-order-64a97b4fabc5264ed20b179952cdabff">lie low</a>. Critics of the administration surmise students are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-student-visa-status-restraining-order-64a97b4fabc5264ed20b179952cdabff">intentionally being</a> pressured to leave voluntarily. DHS terms this “self-deport”, a confused term for leaving the country before you can be removed or detained, increasingly without due process, after losing your immigration status. Then in the face of multiple court challenges, the administration in late April <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/25/student-visa-legal-status-restored">reversed course</a> and restored legal statuses that had been rescinded en masse. The administration <a href="https://apnews.com/article/international-student-visa-f1-sevis-status-716ce8e67e2c3093eba4092e57ba1612?user_email=93df1d59dd8381253acc03a96b6458f2390e081c225d587853d09e8df84ea9b1&amp;utm_medium=Morning_Wire&amp;utm_source=Sailthru_AP&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Wire%20Apr%2030%2C%202025&amp;utm_term=Morning%20Wire%20Subscribers">later revealed</a> in court that names were scraped from a national crime database that includes cases with arrests but no charges, charges dropped and even missing persons. It also issued new guidelines, however, that appear to expand Ice’s power over students’ immigration status. Uncertainty prevails.</p> <p>The legal rollercoaster came too late for these cases:</p> <p><strong>Felipe Zapata Velá</strong><strong>squez</strong></p>    <p>The family of the University of Florida student Felipe Zapata Velásquez, 27, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/university-florida-student-deported-colombia">said he was</a> “undergoing a physical and emotional recovery process” in his native Colombia after police arrested him in Gainesville in March for traffic offenses and turned him over to Ice. He agreed to be deported, to avoid lengthy detention and legal battles. The Democratic congressman Maxwell Frost <a href="https://westorlandonews.com/florida-congressman-slams-president-trump-ice-for-kidnapping-uf-student/">accused</a> authorities of “kidnapping” Velásquez.</p> <p><strong>Ranjani Srinivasan</strong></p> <p>Columbia doctoral student and Indian citizen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/homeland-security-search-columbia-students">Ranjani Srinivasan</a> had her visa revoked in early March and Ice came knocking at her university apartment in New York. She swiftly fled to Canada. DHS later <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/03/14/video-columbia-university-student-whose-visa-was-revoked-supporting-hamas-and">trumpeted</a> her departure, called her a “terrorist sympathizer” and published surveillance footage of her <a href="https://x.com/Sec_Noem/status/1900562928849326488">rushing</a> through LaGuardia airport. Srinivasan <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/nyregion/columbia-student-kristi-noem-video.html">described to</a> the New York Times a “volatile and dangerous” atmosphere in the US. Her lawyer accused DHS of being “un-American” and punishing constitutionally protected free speech.</p> <h2>Removed by (admitted) mistake</h2> <p><strong>Kilmar Ábrego</strong><strong> García</strong></p>    <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kilmar-abrego-garcia">Salvadorian</a> man <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/who-is-kilmar-abrego-garcia">was removed</a> to El Salvador by mistake, which the Trump administration admitted. But it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/trump-el-salvador-deportation-kilmar-abrego-garcia">essentially defying</a> a US supreme <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/supreme-court-order-el-salvador">court order</a> to “facilitate” his return to his home and family in Maryland. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kilmar-abrego-garcia">Ábrego García</a> was undocumented but had protected status against being deported to El Salvador. He was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/apr/16/trumps-deportation-mistake-the-man-trapped-in-a-prison-in-el-salvador">flown there anyway</a>, without a hearing, to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/20/trump-deportations-venezuela-prison">brutal mega-prison</a>, then later transferred to another facility. The administration accuses him of being a violent gangster and has abandoned him, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/trump-administration-kilmar-abrego-garcia-deportation">infuriating</a> a federal judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/23/kilmar-abrego-garcia-judge-trump-bad-faith">repeatedly</a> and prompting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/chris-van-hollen-kilmar-abrego-garcia">warnings</a> of a constitutional <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/20/senator-chris-van-hollen-kilmar-abrego-garcia">crisis</a>.</p> <p>He has not been charged with any crimes but was swept up with hundreds of Venezuelans deported there. He has begged to speak to his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, who insists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/kilmar-abrego-garcia-wife-interview">he is not</a> a criminal. The sheet metalworkers union chief, Michael Coleman, described Ábrego García as an “apprentice working hard to pursue the American dream” <a href="https://www.smart-union.org/smart-statement-on-supreme-courts-decision-regarding-kilmar-armando-abrego-garcias-return-to-the-united-states/">and said</a> he was not a gang member. Trump said he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/attorney-general-trump-deport-citizens-el-salvador">was eyeing</a> Salvadorian prisons for US citizens.</p> <p>Then in June, the US suddenly flew Ábrego García <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/06/kilmar-abrego-garcia-charges">back to the US</a> but kept him in custody and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/kilmar-abrego-garcia-pleads-not-guilty">charged him</a> with taking part in a conspiracy to smuggle migrants into the United States. He appeared in court in Tennessee and pleaded not guilty, and remains in custody in the US. His lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said: “This shows that they [the administration] were playing games with the court all along. Due process means the chance to defend yourself before you’re punished – not after.”</p> <h2>Deported to a third country, without due process</h2> <p>The US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/deportation-alleged-gang-members-el-salvador">deported more</a> than 230 Venezuelan men to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/kristi-noem-el-salvador-prison-visit-trump-admin">the mega-prison</a> in El Salvador without so much as a hearing in mid-March despite an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/trump-judge-venezuela-deportations">infuriated federal judge</a> trying to halt the flights, then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/court-upholds-block-trump-deportation-venezuelans">blocking</a> others. Donald Trump took extraordinary action to avoid due process by invoking the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/alien-enemies-act-explainer-can-trump-apply-a-wartime-law-to-deport-gang-members">1798 Alien Enemies Act</a> (AEA), a law meant only to be used in wartime, prompting court challenges led by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). John Roberts, the US chief justice, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/trump-judge-impeachment-venezuelan-deportations">rebuked</a> the president when he threatened the judge.
