  <p>You can keep up to date with the Guardian’s UK politics coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics">here</a>.</p> 
  <p>Here is a summary from today’s blog:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The Tories and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Reform UK</a> only offer “easy answers and snake oil” when it comes to the UK’s relationship with the European Union, Nick Thomas-Symonds has said.</strong> In a speech hosted by the Spectator magazine, the EU relations minister said: “Some will hysterically cry even treason. Some will say we’re surrendering sovereignty or freedoms, but that is nonsense.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Thomas-Symonds also accused Farage of “dividing communities and stoking anger”.</strong> He dismissed Reform UK’s proposal to negotiate returns agreements with states such as Iran and renegotiate the Good Friday agreement, saying Nigel Farage was struggling to control his own parliamentary party.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/27/nigel-farage-rolls-back-on-vow-to-deport-all-small-boat-arrivals-to-the-uk">Farage has rolled back on his pledge to deport “absolutely anyone” arriving in the UK on small boats just 24 hours after making it</a> at a combative press conference in Oxford that led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/nigel-farage-plan-deport-asylum-seekers-scorn-from-legal-experts">accusations of ugly and destructive rhetoric</a>. </strong>Farage announced plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in the first five years of a Reform government and to pay despotic regimes such as the Taliban to take them back. He also said: “Yes, women and children, everybody on arrival, will be detained.” At a press conference near Edinburgh on Wednesday, however, when asked whether his comments on securing women’s safety in the UK rang hollow when he had committed to deporting women and girls back to countries where they faced oppression and sexual violence, Farage said that was not true. Asked if that meant women and children were exempt from the plans, he said: “I didn’t say exempt for ever, but at this stage it is not part of our plan for the next five years.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Farage similarly rowed back on his proposal to renegotiate the Good Friday agreement after political parties in Northern Ireland condemned his comment as reckless and irresponsible. </strong>He said “the Northern Ireland situation is deeply complex” and “that will not be at the forefront of what we do”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Claire Hanna,</strong> <strong>the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) leader,<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr74kmkzmpeo"> </a>said on Wednesday that Farage’s plan to withdraw the UK from the European convention on human rights would remove a pillar of the Good Friday agreement. </strong>Hanna said: “The agreement belongs to the people of this island. It is not Nigel Farage’s to tear up, nor any other British politician’s.” The Alliance party and SDLP have echoed Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland secretary, in saying that any attempt to unpick the 1998 peace agreement could destabilise the region.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Farage spoke in Scotland on Wednesday to announce the MSP Graham Simpson as the latest defection from the Scottish Conservatives to Reform UK</strong>. Simpson becomes Reform’s sole MSP sitting in the Scottish parliament, and its second MSP overall after the former Tory Michelle Ballantyne’s defection in the last parliamentary session.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Simpson said he decided to join <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Reform UK</a> to “create something new, exciting and lasting” and appealed to former colleagues</strong>, saying “I say to those who have great ideas for Scotland and who may have felt ignored: ‘Talk to me, you will find my door – wherever I am put in parliament next week – open and receptive to the kind of fresh thinking that we need in politics.’” He added he thought Reform could “help” to remove the SNP from office after 19 years in power.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/conservatives">Conservatives</a> could “potentially” strike a deal with Afghanistan over migration, the party’s chair has said. </strong>Asked directly if the Tories would set up a returns agreement with the Taliban-run country, Kevin Hollinrake told Times Radio: “Well, potentially, yes.” However, Hollinrake later told Sky News such a deal would be “very expensive” and have “very significant” human rights consequences.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Hollinrake added that his party’s Rwanda deportation plan, which was published in May, is “far more comprehensive</strong> than the one we’ve seen from Reform, in that it dealt with both legal migration and illegal migration”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Farage has been called “one of the most disastrous politicians” and “extraordinarily damaging” by the SNP after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Reform UK</a> leader outlined his plans to curb migration. </strong>SNP MP Stephen Gethins, the SNP foreign affairs spokesperson at Westminster, questioned parts of the policy – which could see a future UK government potentially work with the Taliban to send people back to Afghanistan, with the UK also leaving the European convention on human rights. Reform councillor Ross Lambie defended the party’s immigration policy.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The UK has had reassurance from France that the deal between the two countries to allow small boat interceptions in the English Channel “will go ahead”, Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said.</strong> He told Times Radio: “The Home Office have already set out that they’ve had reassurance from the French interior ministry that this change in maritime law will go ahead.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Talks on a food and drink deal with the EU will begin in the autumn, with MPs having the final say on any agreement, the minister in charge of negotiations with the bloc has said. </strong>Thomas-Symonds told an event hosted by the Spectator magazine on Wednesday: “This autumn, we will start the detailed negotiations on the SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary standards) deal, as well as other commitments from our summit last May.” Earlier, it had been reported that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/26/brexit-export-licences-eu-food-agricultural-products-uk-companies">UK companies spent up to £65m last year on licences to export food and agricultural products to the EU </a>– costs that the government is promising to eliminate as part of a new deal to be agreed by 2027.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Thomas-Symonds enthused about how excited he is by the prospect of an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/starmers-top-eu-negotiator-hints-at-possible-youth-mobility-scheme">EU youth mobility scheme</a>, as he signalled a broader government shift towards embracing closer ties with the bloc. </strong>Thomas-Symonds said on Wednesday he was looking forward to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/19/fishing-erasmus-uk-eu-deal-keir-starmer">signing a deal</a> to let young people travel and work more freely across Europe.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Refugee charities warn that thousands of people in the UK could find themselves homeless on the streets this winter after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/27/charities-warn-rise-rough-sleeping-refugees-winter-uk">the Home Office quietly reverse its asylum accommodation policy</a>. </strong>The Guardian has learned that ministers are planning to halve the period asylum seekers are given to find new accommodation after getting a decision on their case, from 56 to 28 days. Refugee organisations say this is not enough time to find work and a home to rent and will lead to many people pitching tents in the streets.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/27/higher-energy-bills-price-cap-rises">Energy costs will rise for millions of British households this autumn</a> after the price cap for a typical annual dual-fuel bill increased by 2% to £1,755. </strong>The energy regulator for Great Britain, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/ofgem">Ofgem</a>, will raise the cap on gas and electricity charges from October by the equivalent of just over £35 a year for the average home, following a rise in European gas prices. Labour responded by saying its plan for change will protect consumers, but the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said the government should cancel the rise and take up his party’s plan “to halve energy bills instead”. Plaid Cymru called for the government to “tax the super rich and lower bills for our communities”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Tim Jarvis, director general of markets at Ofgem, told Sky News that the government’s increase in the warm home discount would help some of the lowest income households in the country</strong> and see them receive an additional £150 towards their energy.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/26/more-pain-reeves-government-borrowing-jumps-26-year-high">The cost of UK government borrowing has jumped to near a 27-year high</a>, piling pressure on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves">Rachel Reeves</a> to reveal how she will tackle the deficit in the public finances before the autumn budget. </strong>The yield, or interest rate, on the UK’s 30-year bond rose by eight basis points (0.08 of a percentage point) on Tuesday to 5.62%.</p></li>

  <p>Inequality in <strong>transport emissions</strong> between the richest and the poorest in the UK is set to widen dramatically over the next decade, an analysis has found.</p> 
  <p>The most affluent and mobile already produce 10 times more carbon through their domestic travel than the poorest and least mobile. Under current decarbonisation policies, thinktank researchers forecast this to grow to 13 times by 2035.</p> 
  <p>But revised policies that tackle domestic flying and excess private car use could not only lessen inequality, they say, but also reduce emissions faster overall.</p> 
  <p>“Fairness isn’t a barrier to climate action – it’s the key to unlocking it,” said <strong>Stephen Frost</strong>, the head of transport policy at the <strong>Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR)</strong>. “A fairer approach doesn’t just cut carbon faster, it builds a healthier, more inclusive transport system for everyone.”</p> 
  <p>The IPPR research updates a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/29/wealthy-white-men-uk-biggest-transport-polluters">study last year</a> that broke down transport emissions by income, gender, location, ethnicity and age, finding that wealthy white men from rural areas are the country’s biggest emitters of greenhouse gases.</p> 
  <p>They found there was a stark divide in people’s experience of getting around, with some having effectively unlimited ability to travel how, when and where they like, while millions of others are unable to access community life or jobs.</p> 
  <p>In the current research, they used the same 12 traveller profiles on which the original study was based, ranging from the most to least affluent and mobile, and projected their decrease in transport emissions over the next decade according to the government’s current policies.</p> 
  <p>They found that the poorest groups were due to decarbonise much faster than the wealthiest, with the richest 4% set to emit 13 times more carbon from their domestic travel than the poorest 14% by 2035 – up from a tenfold gap today.</p> 
  <p>When international travel was included, the richest were expected to emit 22 times more than the poorest – up from 20 times today.</p> 
  <p>Transport is the highest emitting sector in the UK and almost 30% of emission savings will potentially come from surface transport between now and 2030. The government’s approach to decarbonising the sector focuses heavily on the adoption of climate technologies, such as zero-emission vehicles and sustainable aviation fuels, with limited policies focusing on demand reduction.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have held a negative view on the UK fiscal picture and maintain the view. We see UK growth disappointing relative to official forecasts which would leave the Chancellor with a bigger budget hole than current official forecast suggests.

  <p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> has sought to clarify Reform UK’s deportation policy, saying single women will be removed from the country if the party comes to power. </p> 
  <p>According to the PA news agency, the Reform leader told broadcasters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There’s slight confusion here. Deporting children is a very difficult thing to do. Who do they go to, what are the wards of care. Women and children, intimating families that have been here illegally for some years, are they top of our list? No. </p> 
   <p>So, there’s a slight confusion over this, and I think maybe in the press conference I didn’t quite understand the context of what Richard Tice was saying.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked whether women would be deported, he said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If a single woman etc comes to Britain, they will be detained and deported. If a woman comes with children, we will work out the best thing to do.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He added that the “big message” was that the “vast majority of those that come are young males” and they “will not be staying” in the UK.</p>

  <p><strong>Patrick Harvie</strong> has urged <strong>Scottish Green</strong> members to back whoever is elected to the leadership on Friday as he steps down, reports the PA news agency.</p> 
  <p>The MSP announced earlier this year he would be stepping away from heading up the party after 17 years, but plans to continue as an MSP. His fellow co-leader <strong>Lorna Slater</strong> is seeking to keep her job, facing a challenge from fellow MSP <strong>Gillian Mackay</strong>, while <strong>Ross Greer</strong> is seeking to replace Harvie as part of top team against Edinburgh-based activist <strong>Dominic Ashmole</strong>.</p> 
  <p>In a statement released ahead of the announcement of the result on Friday, Harvie stressed the need for Green voices in Scottish politics as he urged the party to back whoever is victorious. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>With a new leadership team taking office on Friday it will be the start of a new chapter for our party. Regardless of who wins, my role will be changing and I’m looking forward to being a loyal lieutenant for whoever they are.</p> 
   <p>The polls look very positive for our prospects to elect a record number of Greens MSPs in 2026 and if the party works hard and supports the new leadership team, we can continue to change Scotland for the better. </p> 
   <p>Green ideas are more necessary than ever. Our world is on fire, our economic system is broken and the far right are on the rise. </p> 
   <p>Green voices are absolutely vital if we are to protect people and planet, and secure a fairer, greener and better future.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Harvie was elected as an MSP in 2003 and became co-leader of the party in 2008, when the Greens were “very different”, he said. Harvie added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It has been humbling and inspiring to have played such a frontline role as we have grown across every part of Scotland. </p> 
   <p>At the time I took office it wasn’t just climate deniers and the political right who wrote us off. Lots of people who had sympathy for what we stand for hadn’t yet been persuaded we could make a difference. </p> 
   <p>But we got stuck in and we delivered Green change, from higher taxes on the wealthy to ending peak rail fares and establishing free bus travel for young people. It is because of this record that we have firmly established ourselves as a bold and radical force in Scottish politics.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He steps down as one of just two Green MSPs – along with Slater – to ever hold ministerial office, having been appointed by <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> in 2021 after the signing of the <strong>Bute House agreement</strong>, which secured the backing of the party’s MSPs for major <strong>SNP</strong> legislation.</p>

  <p><strong>Nigel Farage has said that even Keir Starmer “hasn’t attacked me” over his controversial and “uncosted, undeliverable” plan to tackle illegal immigration, one day after Reform UK announced their policies.</strong></p> 
  <p>The Reform leader told a press conference in Scotland on Wednesday: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think what’s really interesting is people aren’t questioning the need for something radical to be done.</p> 
   <p>Even the prime minister hasn’t attacked me on the idea that we should be deporting people that come illegally. But he hasn’t got the means to do it, the Tories didn’t have the means to do it. We are proposing the means to do it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>However, Home Office minister <strong>Lord Hanson</strong> told LBC that the Reform UK plans are “uncosted, unconstructed” and “won’t be very effective”.</p> 
  <p>“Nigel Farage’s plan, such as it is, could have been written on the back of a fag packet, is very uncosted and unconstructed, and it’s not really going to be very effective and it’s not really a plan that is deliverable,” he said.</p> 
  <p>The veteran politician, who has served under Blair and Brown’s governments, added: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>To deliver something, you need to have a proper, effective plan.</p> 
   <p>And what we’re trying to do in government, difficult and challenging though it is, is to make some inroads into some of the real challenges and real issues without … promising undeliverable plans.</p>

After the health secretary walked away from talks with the <strong>Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI)</strong> on Friday, he stuck the boot in. The “shortsighted” pharma industry had rejected “a serious and generous” offer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/25/wes-streeting-criticises-shortsighted-drug-firms-for-rejecting-pricing-offer">he said</a>. It should be more “collaborative” instead of making “unaffordable” demands. The government could not allow British patients and taxpayers to be ripped off.</p> 
  <p>Yet Streeting surely also knows this standoff cannot be allowed to last indefinitely. Portraying the pharma companies as greedy may be good political theatre – and, since we are talking about some of the world’s biggest and richest corporations, the sentiment is hardly controversial. But at the end of this process the government still needs a deal. If not, its boasts about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/life-sciences-sector-plan-to-grow-economy-and-transform-nhs">making the UK a life sciences “superpower”</a> will ring hollow. And the cold reality, unfortunately, is that Streeting is negotiating with global companies that also have reasons to play hard.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Farage says deporting women and children not part of Reform's plans 'for next five years'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> said deporting women and children was not part of Reform UK’s plans “for the next five years”, a day after he announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/farage-aims-for-hardline-vibes-with-his-mass-deportation-plan">proposals to remove up to 600,000 people from the UK</a>. </p> 
  <p>He told a press conference in <strong>Scotland</strong> on Wednesday: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I was very, very clear yesterday in what I said, that deportation of illegal immigrants – we are not even discussing women and children at this stage – there are so many illegal males in Britain, and the news reports that said that after my conference yesterday were wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked whether women and children would be “exempt” from deportation, the Reform UK leader added: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I didn’t say exempt forever, but at this stage it’s not part of our plan for the next five years.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On Tuesday, senior Reform figure <strong>Zia Yusuf</strong> said “phase one” of the party’s plans would focus on adults, with unaccompanied children being removed “towards the latter half of that five years”.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.chevening.org/scholarships/">Chevening scholarships</a> are largely government funded and are offered to “exceptional individuals” to study for a one-year master’s degree at a UK university. All 40 students identified by the government have fully funded scholarships.</p> 
  <p>A <strong>Home Office</strong> source said it was “a complex and challenging task”.

  <p>Campaigners for the students welcomed the news, but expressed concern that the latest group had received no direct contact from the government or been given details of what might happen next, while others with full funding appeared not to have been included.</p> 
  <p><strong>Dr Norah Parr</strong>, a researcher at the <strong>University of Birmingham</strong> who has been coordinating efforts to support the students, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are relieved that the government has agreed to assist a larger group of students and ensure their arrival to the UK for the start of their autumn term, but we remain concerned about a lack of transparency or clear guidelines.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Charities raise alarm after Home Office reverses part of asylum accommodation policy</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Refugee charities warn that thousands of people in the UK could find themselves homeless on the streets this winter after the <strong>Home Office</strong> quietly reverse its asylum accommodation policy.</p> 
  <p>The Guardian has learned that ministers are planning to halve the period asylum seekers are given to find new accommodation after getting a decision on their case, from 56 to 28 days. Refugee organisations say this is not enough time to find work and a home to rent and will lead to many people pitching tents in the streets.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>British Red Cross</strong> is among those raising concerns about an increase in rough sleeping among refugees and, along with other refugee NGOs, is calling on the government to rethink.</p> 
  <p><strong>Alex Fraser</strong>, the British Red Cross director of refugee services, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Reducing the ‘move-on’ period will increase levels of homelessness and destitution for people granted protection and put additional pressure on local authorities.</p> 
   <p>The numbers don’t add up. It takes around 35 days to receive universal credit. Local authorities need 56 days to work with households at risk of homelessness. Giving people only 28 days to find work, housing or support isn’t enough time.</p> 
   <p>Making people destitute ends up costing the taxpayer more money and causing distress and hardship. We urge the government to review this decision.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The government is grappling with a crisis over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/25/home-office-promises-big-surge-in-asylum-hotel-closures-in-new-year">use of hotels</a> for asylum seekers, with dozens of protests staged by anti-migrant groups and individuals in recent weeks.</p> 
  <p>Ministers are under pressure to expedite hotel closures and have committed to speeding up asylum decision-making, a decision welcomed by refugee organisations and by asylum seekers. But if there is not sufficient time for refugees to find work and accommodation, this could increase street homelessness.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Political parties in <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/northernireland">Northern Ireland</a></strong> have condemned <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>’s proposal to renegotiate the <strong>Good Friday agreement</strong>, calling it reckless and irresponsible.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Alliance party</strong> and the <strong>Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP)</strong> echoed <strong>Hilary Benn</strong>, the Northern Ireland secretary, in saying that any attempt to unpick the 1998 peace agreement could destabilise the region.</p> 
  <p><strong>Claire Hanna</strong>, the SDLP leader,<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr74kmkzmpeo"> </a>on Wednesday that Farage’s plan to withdraw the UK from the <strong>European convention on human rights</strong> would remove a pillar of the Good Friday agreement. Hanna said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The agreement belongs to the people of this island. It is not Nigel Farage’s to tear up, nor any other British politician’s. Farage has never had any interest in Northern Ireland and when things get difficult, he will drop Northern Ireland in a heartbeat rather than spend years painstakingly negotiating with Dublin.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>However, <strong>Sammy Wilson</strong>, a <strong>Democratic Unionist party (DUP)</strong> MP, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce835r795emo">endorsed Farage’s proposal </a>as a way to stem immigration and said Reform, with a big enough majority after the next election, could renegotiate the Good Friday agreement without much difficulty.</p>

  <p><strong>Graham Simpson</strong> said he decided to join Reform UK to “create something new, exciting and lasting”.</p> 
  <p>Speaking with party leader <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> by his side, the former Scottish Tory MSP said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’ve joined Reform because we have the chance to create something new, exciting and lasting that puts the needs of people over the system, that asks what is going wrong how we can fix it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He added he thought Reform could “help” to remove the <strong>SNP</strong> from office after 19 years in power.</p> 
  <p>According to the PA news agency, Simpson also said he would not step down from the <strong>central Scotland</strong> regional list at <strong>Holyrood</strong> after his defection. Simpson said he still has work to do as an MSP, including a members’ bill which would create a mechanism for sacking MSPs.</p> 
  <p>Simpson also said he would seek to “develop a policy suite” which goes beyond Reform’s two key issues in Scotland of net zero and immigration.</p> 
  <p>Addressing the decision to leave the party he joined at the age of 15, Simpson said it was a “wrench”. Speaking at the press conference in <strong>Broxburn</strong>, <strong>West Lothian</strong>, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s fair to say that some of you won’t be surprised to see me here, given that the Scottish Tories have been touting my name as a potential defector for months now.</p> 
   <p>So today, I’m giving them what they want, but perhaps not for the reasons that they think. Leaving the party that I first joined when I was 15 is an enormous wrench, and I’ve been through a lot of soul searching in the past few weeks.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>However, Simpson said he had decided earlier this year not to stand again for the Scottish Tories, but it was not until the past few weeks he had chosen to move to Reform:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I watched Reform with interest and I see the opportunity to help create something fresh here in Scotland, and it’s clear that the voters agree in increasing numbers. But just because a party is becoming popular isn’t a reason to join it, keeping your job in parliament isn’t a good enough reason either.</p> 
   <p>Too many people feel let down and ignored, they feel the system is against them, that the traditional parties don’t even care about them. Save for some fine individual MSPs across parties, the political class is not serving the people well. Failure is accepted and change takes far too long.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In an open call to his former Tory colleagues, Simpson said his door will be open to those with “great ideas for Scotland”. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’ve no doubt that, initially, my announcement today will spark anger, disappointment and probably some sheer nastiness.</p> 
   <p>I don’t like that aspect of politics and I’m not looking forward to it, but there are many ex-colleagues who will also understand.</p> 
   <p>I say to those who have great ideas for Scotland and who may have felt ignored: talk to me, you will find my door – wherever I am put in parliament next week – open and receptive to the kind of fresh thinking that we need in politics.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Government borrowing cost nears 27-year high, piling pressure on Rachel Reeves</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The cost of <strong>UK government borrowing</strong> has jumped to near a 27-year high, piling pressure on <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves">Rachel Reeves</a></strong> to reveal how she will tackle the deficit in the public finances before the autumn budget.</p> 
  <p>The yield, or interest rate, on the UK’s 30-year bond rose by eight basis points (0.08 of a percentage point) on Tuesday to 5.62%.</p> 
  <p>That pushed the UK’s long-term borrowing costs close to a spike in April of 5.66%, when 30-year bond yields reached their highest since 1998.</p> 
  <p>UK borrowing costs have risen sharply in recent months, increasing the cost of financing UK government debt to more than £100bn a year – almost 10% of the annual budget.</p> 
  <p>Economists have said the UK faces a unique strain on its financial position at a time when higher welfare and healthcare costs and rapid ageing are driving up the level of borrowing across most industrialised nations.</p> 
  <p>Reeves is expected to be faced with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/06/tax-rises-budget-deficit-rachel-reeves-niesr#:~:text=NIESR%20said%20%E2%80%9Cmoderate%20but%20sustained,cutting%20measures%20to%20find%20extra">deficit of between £20bn and £40bn</a> when she delivers the autumn budget.</p> 
  <p>To maintain her fiscal rules and maintain the £10bn buffer in place under current plans, the chancellor will need to find between £30bn and £50bn in either extra taxes, reduced spending or higher borrowing.</p> 
  <p>Higher borrowing bills and U-turns on proposed welfare cuts have heightened the expectation of increases in taxes later this year.</p> 
  <p>Investors also fear the UK is suffering from high inflation that will persist for several years, devaluing their UK funds.</p> 
  <p><strong>Catherine Mann</strong>, a member of the <strong>Bank of England</strong>’s interest rate-setting committee, said UK policymakers were underestimating “inflation persistence”. She said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is an increasing tension between inflation persistence and weak growth, the trade-off that we currently face in the United Kingdom.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said the Bank needed to maintain high interest rates to bring down inflation and then cut aggressively to revive the economy.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> is speaking to reporters at a hotel near <strong>Edinburgh</strong> the day after he was accused of “ugly” and “destructive” rhetoric after his announcement of plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers from the UK.</p> 
  <p>He has just announced the defection of <strong>Scottish Conservative</strong> MSP for central Scotland <strong>Graham Simpson</strong> to Reform. Simpson will be Reform’s sole MSP at <strong>Holyrood</strong>: Farage said he would be able to “show colleagues the ropes” at Holyrood at next May’s elections. </p>

  <p>Farage said that his press conference yesterday had “sparked the beginning of a national debate”, before introducing Simpson who said Reform represented “an opportunity to create something fresh” for voters.</p> 
  <p>This is the third MSP to leave the Scottish Tories in recent months, the other two quitting for the Lib Dems and another to sit as an independent.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Post-Brexit licences for exporting food to EU cost UK firms up to £65m last year</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>UK companies spent up to £65m last year on licences to export food and agricultural products to the <strong>EU</strong> – costs that the government is promising to eliminate as part of a new deal to be agreed by 2027.</p> 
  <p>Government figures released on Tuesday showed it issued 328,727 such licences last year, at a cost of between £113 and £200 each. That would put the total cost to business at somewhere between £37m and £65m.</p> 
  <p><strong>Nick Thomas-Symonds</strong>, the <strong>Cabinet Office</strong> minister in charge of European negotiations, will on Wednesday pledge to eliminate such costs as he promises a new agreement with the EU in the next 18 months.</p> 
  <p>In an event at the Spectator offices in London to be hosted by the leading Brexiter <strong>Michael Gove</strong>, Thomas-Symonds will make a vocally political argument for becoming closer to the EU.</p> 
  <p>Ministers have decided in recent months their attempts to realign with <strong>Brussels</strong> enjoy more support than the approach of the Conservatives or Reform UK, which have promised to rip up Labour’s renegotiated deal.</p> 
  <p>Thomas-Symonds will take specific aim at Farage, arguing: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Nigel Farage’s manifesto at the next election will say in writing he wants to take Britain backwards, cutting at least £9bn from the economy, bringing with it a risk to jobs and a risk of food prices going up.</p>

  <p>A day after the Reform leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/nigel-farage-plan-deport-asylum-seekers-scorn-from-legal-experts">gave a speech</a> warning that Britain was under threat from an “invasion” of asylum seekers, Thomas-Symonds will add: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Nigel Farage wants Britain to fail. His model of politics feeds on it, offering the easy answers, dividing communities and stoking anger.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/19/keir-starmer-uk-eu-reset-deal-win-win">a new agreement with the EU</a> in May, as part of which ministers agreed to pursue a series of specific deals, including one on food and agricultural products.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Tories and Reform only offer 'easy answers and snake oil' on UK-EU relationship, says Thomas-Symonds</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Tories and Reform UK only offer “easy answers and snake oil” when it comes to the UK’s relationship with the <strong>European Union</strong>, <strong>Nick Thomas-Symonds</strong> has said.</p> 
  <p>In a speech hosted by the Spectator magazine, the EU relations minister said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Some will hysterically cry even treason. Some will say we’re surrendering sovereignty or freedoms, but that is nonsense.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Now, we know we are going to have a political fight on this, especially when we legislate for it in parliament. But the prime minister was very direct in his instructions to me on taking office – national interests first, build on what’s best about Britain.</p> 
   <p>We are determined to plug the gaps, to rebuild Britain, protect our borders, bring down bills in every part of the country and secure good jobs, a new relationship of mutual benefit, one that brings freedom back to our businesses and exercises our sovereignty.</p> 
   <p>And it needs pragmatism. When you’re tough, decisive and collaborative. That cannot rest on easy answers and snake oil. The Tories [are] completely 2D, stuck with a ghost of Brexit past. And then Nigel Farage, who has pledged to reverse our progress.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Thomas-Symonds also accused <strong>Farage</strong> of “dividing communities and stoking anger”. He also dismissed Reform UK’s proposal to negotiate returns agreements with states such as <strong>Iran</strong> and renegotiate the <strong>Good Friday agreement</strong>, saying Farage was struggling to control his own parliamentary party.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Cabinet Office</strong> minister told an event in <strong>Westminster</strong> hosted by the Spectator magazine:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think that a careful, considered approach in Northern Ireland is absolutely critical. I think the Good Friday agreement is one of the great achievements of any peacetime UK government since 1945 and a comment like that just simply shows that Nigel Farage produces outlandish, unrealistic promises for solving problems and that, I’m afraid, is another one of them.</p> 
   <p>He was talking as well, as far as I can make out, of negotiating with hostile regimes around the world. He’s struggling at the moment to negotiate the politics of a parliamentary party that fits in the back of a taxi. I don’t put too much confidence in them.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Talks on food and drink deal with EU will start in autumn, says Cabinet Office minister</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Talks on a food and drink deal with the <strong>EU</strong> will begin in the autumn, with MPs having the final say on any agreement, the minister in charge of negotiations with the bloc has said. </p> 
  <p><strong>Cabinet Office</strong> minister <strong>Nick Thomas-Symonds</strong> told an event hosted by the Spectator magazine on Wednesday: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This autumn, we will start the detailed negotiations on the SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary standards) deal, as well as other commitments from our summit last May. </p> 
   <p>We will then bring the legislation to parliament to implement the deal. We will get that done by 2027, so businesses and consumers see the tangible impacts as soon as possible – money saved at the borders, profits freed up to invest, pounds kept in the pocket of working people.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Earlier, Thomas-Symonds had insisted that the government’s approach would deliver “practical” benefits including lower prices, easier food exports for farmers and less time spent by truck drivers sitting in queues.</p>

  <p><strong>Thames Water</strong> has agreed a payment plan with the water regulator for fines it owes worth £123m, as it races to secure funding to avoid temporary nationalisation.</p> 
  <p>The water company, which serves 16 million customers across <strong>London</strong> and the <strong>south-east</strong>, is trying to pull together a deal to avoid collapse.</p> 
  <p>Earlier this month, the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/thames-water-advisers-appointed-to-plan-for-utilitys-potential-collapse">approved the appointment of insolvency advisers</a> <strong>FTI Consulting</strong> to consult on plans for Thames Water to be placed into a special administration regime.</p> 
  <p>The debt-laden utility company was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/may/28/thames-water-hit-with-record-fine-over-sewage-breaches">hit with a record £104m fine</a> by <strong>Ofwat</strong> in May over environmental breaches involving sewage spills, after failing to operate and manage its treatment works and wastewater networks effectively.</p> 
  <p>At the same time, a further £18.2m fine was levied on Thames for breaking dividend rules, the first penalty of its kind in the water industry. Ofwat said the company had paid out cash to investors despite having fallen short in its services to customers and its environmental record.</p> 
  <p>The penalties were originally due to be paid by 20 August but the regulator has given the company some breathing space to pay the fines.</p> 
  <p>Ofwat had previously told Thames that the penalties had to be “paid by the company and its investors, and not by customers”.</p> 
  <p>The regulator has approved Thames’s request for a payment plan, which will result in it paying £24.5m, or 20% of the penalties, by the end of September, with the rest to be paid later.</p> 
  <p>The company will pay the remainder on the earliest of three possible dates, which would be either 30 days after the implementation of a restructuring plan, or if Thames enters an SAR the balance would be due 30 days after the end of that process. The final deadline for payment of the fine will be 31 March 2030.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Farage described as 'disastrous' and 'damaging' by SNP over immigration plans</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> has been called “one of the most disastrous politicians” and “extraordinarily damaging” by the <strong>SNP</strong> after the Reform UK leader outlined his plans to curb migration. </p> 
  <p>SNP MP <strong>Stephen Gethins</strong>, the SNP foreign affairs spokesperson at <strong>Westminster</strong>, questioned parts of the policy – which could see a future UK government potentially work with the <strong>Taliban</strong> to send people back to <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, with the UK also leaving the <strong>European convention on human rights</strong>. </p> 
  <p>He argued that Brexit – which Farage campaigned for – had “pushed up the small boats crisis” in the UK, as it means those seeking asylum are forced to do so in the first country they arrive in. </p> 
  <p>Hitting out at the Reform UK leader, Gethins told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>He is the architect, along with people like Boris Johnson, and others of the small boats crisis. </p> 
   <p>Now he wants to remove us from the European convention on human rights, which was the convention introduced at the end of the second world war to give us some of the most basic rights, like prohibition of torture and right to life and all these other basic things we take for granted.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Reform on Tuesday said they would scale up detention capacity for asylum seekers to 24,000 and secure deals with countries such as Afghanistan, <strong>Eritrea</strong> and <strong>Iran</strong> to return migrants. However Farage failed to answer when asked how much he would be prepared to pay Iran and the Taliban to take deportees back. Gethins insisted such policies show Farage “is an extraordinarily damaging politician”. </p> 
  <p>The PA news agency reports that the <strong>Arbroath and Broughty Ferry</strong> MP continued:</p> 
  <p>On Afghanistan, he now wants to do deals with the Taliban. Will that mean people who were abandoned in Kabul, who served alongside the British army … are they now going to be sent back to the Taliban, and are we going to be paying for the Taliban for the privilege of sending these people back? </p> 
  <p>I think most people can see that doing a deal with the Taliban to send back women, human rights advocates and others who have campaigned against that brutal regime is unrealistic. </p> 
  <p>I don’t think it is realistic, and I think any basic reading of this is unrealistic. That is why Nigel Farage is one of the most disastrous politicians. He is one of the most consequential, but not in a good way.</p> 
  <p>But Reform councillor <strong>Ross Lambie</strong> defended the party’s immigration policy, saying: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>My view on it and Reform’s view on it is that largely, if not all, of those people crossing the Channel are bogus asylum seekers who are, at best they’re here to gain the benefits system of this country. At worst, they could be here to do us harm.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He told BBC Radio Scotland that those coming to the UK in small boats are “not people fleeing” oppressive regimes and are “obscuring their identity”. Lambie said this involves either “hiding their past” or “actually hiding their true country of origin”. </p> 
  <p>According to the PA news agency, his comments came after a poll, by the <strong>David Hume Institute and Diffley Partnership</strong>, found 21% of Scots think immigration is one of the top three issues in the country, up from 16% in May and just 4% in May 2023. It suggests that immigration is now seen as the third biggest priority for the country, with only health and the cost-of-living crisis regarded as more important by voters.</p>

  <p>Speaking about the news of a <strong>2% rise in energy bills</strong> from October for a typical household in <strong>England</strong>, <strong>Scotland</strong> and <strong>Wales</strong>, director general of markets at <strong>Ofgem</strong>, <strong>Tim Jarvis</strong>, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That’s slightly lower than the rate of inflation, but is nevertheless a rise, and I recognise that that’s going to be unwelcome for many households.</p> 
   <p>If this is a cap on what suppliers can charge, it’s important to remember that people can get cheaper deals in the fixed rate market, and we’ve already got about a third of households that are on fixed rate deals – but there have been increases in prices, in costs related to the network and related to policy costs from government, which have led to this slight increase this quarter.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Jarvis added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I recognise that it’s difficult for households, as a lot of essential goods have been going up higher than the rate of inflation. As I say, today’s rise is lower than the rate of inflation, but I think people are going to struggle to feel that in their pockets with the other things that are going on.</p> 
   <p>It is welcome that the government is expanding the help available to households on low incomes. We’ve been calling for that for some time, so that’s a welcome additional increase this winter to try and help people with their bills.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Jarvis also said that Ofgemwill be looking at upgrading the country’s network to stabilise prices in the long term. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have seen prices come down by around 60% since the height of the crisis, and that’s even taking into account the level of government support that was made available at that time to deal with the increase in prices. But we are entering a period where we’re looking to try and stabilise the bill that is largely going to be about getting off international gas prices.</p> 
   <p>It is that volatility that is making prices very difficult to predict, and we’re seeing big spikes and big reductions over time. And that’s why it’s so important that we’re investing in the network, and the investment in the network will enable us to get access to clean energy and cheaper energy in the longer term.</p>

  <p>Labour’s plan for change will protect consumers, the party said, following <strong>Ofgem</strong>’s announcement that the <strong>energy price cap will rise by 2% from October</strong>. </p> 
  <p>According to the PA news agency, a Labour Party spokesperson said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Energy bills soared under the Conservatives because they tied our country to the fossil fuel rollercoaster and working people are still paying the price. </p>

   <p>This Labour government’s plan for change is protecting consumers with three million more families getting £150 off their bills through the warm home discount, a total of six million in all, as we continue to invest in clean homegrown power to bring energy bills down for good.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Typical annual energy bill to rise to £1,755 in Great Britain from October</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Energy costs will rise for millions of British households this autumn after the price cap for a typical annual dual-fuel bill increased by 2% to £1,755.</p> 
  <p>The energy regulator for Great Britain, <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/ofgem">Ofgem</a></strong>, will raise the cap on gas and electricity charges from October by the equivalent of just over £35 a year for the average home, following a rise in <strong>European</strong> gas prices.</p> 
  <p>The modest increase follows a brief reprieve from rising energy bills over the summer when the energy price cap fell by 7% to £1,720 from July because of lower market prices.</p> 
  <p>Energy bills will also increase because of an expansion of the government’s warm home discount scheme, which is expected to add about £15 to a typical bill, according to analysts at <strong>Cornwall Insight</strong>, an energy consultancy.</p> 
  <p>About 9 million households who buy their energy through variable tariffs will see an immediate impact on their bills when the cap takes effect in October. Households could face even higher bills if they use more than the typical amount of energy.</p> 
  <p>This is because the cap, which is recalculated every three months, limits the rate energy suppliers can charge customers for each unit of gas and electricity – not the total bill.</p> 
  <p>The return to rising energy bills means the typical household will pay about £600 a year more on its annual bill than before <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/31/russia-gas-supply-to-europe-via-ukraine-transit-deal-expires">Russia</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/31/russia-gas-supply-to-europe-via-ukraine-transit-deal-expires">’s invasion of </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/31/russia-gas-supply-to-europe-via-ukraine-transit-deal-expires">Ukraine</a></strong> in 2022 caused gas market prices to soar.</p> 
  <p>The rising price cap is likely to reignite the debate over the affordability of the UK’s energy as households look ahead to winter.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> has been accused of “ugly” and “destructive” rhetoric after announcing plans to deport hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and pledging to pay despotic regimes such as the <strong>Taliban</strong> to take them back.</p> 
  <p>Unveiling Reform UK’s <strong>“Operation Restoring Justice”</strong> at a combative press conference in <strong>Oxford</strong>, Farage said he would rip up the UK’s postwar human rights commitments, contained in a range of international conventions, to deport “absolutely anyone” – including women and children – arriving by small boat.</p> 
  <p>Calling asylum seekers a threat to national security and to British women, he claimed his plans would stop Channel crossings “within days” and “save tens and possibly hundreds of billions of pounds”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Downing Street</strong> accused Farage of not being serious about his plans, but in a sign of how Reform has set the tone for public debate, the prime minister’s spokesperson refused to criticise his references to irregular migration as an “invasion” and a “scourge” or his prediction that Britain is “not far away from major civil disorder”.</p> 
  <p>Pushed on whether it would be a good idea to sign a returns deal with Taliban-controlled <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, as Farage proposed, the spokesperson said the government was “not going to take anything off the table”.</p> 
  <p>The Conservatives merely accused Reform UK of “reheating and recycling” Tory plans.</p> 
  <p>The Liberal Democrat leader, <strong>Ed Davey</strong>, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We really are through the looking-glass now. Nigel Farage pretending to be patriotic while pledging to rip up Britain’s proud record of leading the world on human rights.</p> 
   <p>As we’ve seen across history, his populist playbook is ugly, powerful and incredibly destructive. We know where it will lead if we don’t stop it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Laura Smith</strong>, a co-head of legal at the <strong>Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI)</strong>, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If today feels like a Rubicon moment, it’s because it is. We are hearing proposals that would tear through centuries of British legal tradition – from the Magna Carta to the Human Rights Act – with barely any resistance from those who should be defending those values.</p> 
   <p>The ban on torture is absolute and fundamental; it cannot be bargained away. That mainstream parties have failed to push back is deeply alarming. This isn’t about migration policy any more, it’s about whether we still value the basic human rights and freedoms that define a democratic society. Now more than ever, we must fight against the normalisation of this rhetoric.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Conservatives could “potentially” strike a deal with <strong>Afghanistan</strong> over migration, the party’s chair has said.</p> 
  <p>Asked directly if the Tories would set up a returns agreement with the <strong>Taliban</strong>-run country, <strong>Kevin Hollinrake</strong> told Times Radio: “Well, potentially, yes.”</p>

I’ll bring you any interesting lines from them as they come in.</p> 
  <p>But first, here are some other developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>UK companies spent up to £65m last year on licences to export food and agricultural products to the EU – costs that the government is promising to eliminate as part of a new deal to be agreed by 2027. </strong>Government figures released on Tuesday showed it issued 328,727 such licences last year, at a cost of between £113 and £200 each.
