<p>Morning everyone. Do the government’s hate speech laws risk turning Australia into a police state where expressing a view contrary to a “government orthodoxy” is outlawed? That’s what Christian lobby groups are saying today.</p> 
<p>We’re also looking at astonishing figures on high pay among university bosses, we’ve got the Aria winners, plus Ukraine has fired UK-made long-range missiles into Russia for the first time.</p>
