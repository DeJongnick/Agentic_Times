<p>Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, who performs with the Irish rap trio Kneecap, has been charged with a terrorism offence for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a gig in London, police said.</p> <p>The 27-year-old, of Belfast, was charged after an investigation by the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command and is scheduled to appear at Westminster magistrates court on 18 June.</p> <p>O’Hanna, who performs under the stage name Mo Chara, was charged with displaying a flag at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town, north London, on 21 November last year “in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion that he is a supporter of a proscribed organisation”, the Met said.</p> <p>The force added: “Officers from the Met’s counter-terrorism command were made aware on Tuesday 22 April of an online video from the event. An investigation was carried out, which led to the Crown Prosecution Service authorising the above charge.”</p> <p>Earlier this month, the Met said Kneecap was being investigated by counter-terrorism police after videos emerged allegedly showing the band calling for the deaths of MPs and shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah”.</p> <p>The counter terrorism internet referral unit (CTIRU) is a national unit based within the Met’s counter-terrorism command, which is dedicated to identifying terrorist and extremist material online.</p> <p>Both Hamas and Hezbollah are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.</p> <p>A Metropolitan police spokesperson said at the time: “We were made aware of a video on 22 April, believed to be from an event in November 2024, and it has been referred to the counter-terrorism internet referral unit for assessment and to determine whether any further police investigation may be required.</p> <p>“We have also been made aware of another video believed to be from an event in November 2023.”</p> <p>Kneecap said they have never supported Hamas or Hezbollah and apologised last month to the families of murdered MPs but claimed footage of the incident had been taken out of context and was being “exploited and weaponised”.</p> <p>A number of concerts featuring the band have been called off since the videos emerged.</p> <p>• The subheading, caption and main text of this article were amended on 22 May 2025.
