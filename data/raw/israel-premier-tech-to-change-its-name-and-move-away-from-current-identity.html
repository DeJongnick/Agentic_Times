<p>The Israel-Premier Tech cycling team, whose participation in the Vuelta a España triggered a series of pro‑Palestinian protests that resulted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/14/jonas-vingegaard-wins-vuelta-a-espana-pro-palestinian-protests">the race’s premature end last month</a>, has announced it will change its name and move away from “its current Israeli identity”.</p> <p>The decision comes three weeks after World Tour cycling teams suggested they may boycott races against Israel-Premier Tech because of the team’s refusal to withdraw from the Vuelta and the lack of protection from the International <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cycling">Cycling</a> Union (UCI) for its own commercial and sporting interests.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/18/vuelta-chaos-shows-selling-sport-as-a-tool-for-peace-can-create-its-own-battlefield">Vuelta chaos shows selling sport as a tool for peace can create its own battlefield | Jonathan Liew</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The team’s sponsors had also urged a change of name and image after the team became a focus for protesters demonstrating against Israel’s offensive in Gaza.</p> <p>Anger over Israel-Premier Tech’s Vuelta participation intensified after the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, offered his backing to the team, which is owned by the billionaire entrepreneur Sylvan Adams. Netanyahu said: “Great job to Sylvan and Israel’s cycling team for not giving in to hatred and intimidation. You make Israel proud!”</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/03/we-just-want-to-race-riders-demand-tighter-security-after-protesters-halt-vuelta">disruptions throughout the three-week race</a> affected multiple stages and led to the cancellation of planned stage finishes and the shortening of the race distance. There were isolated protests during the sport’s other two grand tours, the Giro d’Italia and Tour de France.</p> <p>Israel-Premier Tech announced On Monday that it would be rebranding the team, adding that Adams would be relinquishing his current duties. “With steadfast commitment to our riders, staff, and valued partners, the decision has been made to rename and rebrand the team, moving away from its current Israeli identity,” the team said in a statement.</p> <p>“In sport, progress often requires sacrifice, and this step is essential to securing the future of the team. Looking ahead to the 2026 season, Sylvan Adams has chosen to step back from his day-to-day involvement and will no longer speak on behalf of the team, instead focusing on his role as president of the World Jewish Congress, Israel.”</p> <p>One of the team’s sponsors, the UK‑based Factor Bikes, had said its support was conditional on disassociating from Israel. Another sponsor, the Canadian-based manufacturer and horticulture firm Premier Tech, had taken a similar stance, saying it expected that Israel-Premier Tech would “evolve to a new name excluding the term Israel, and that it will adopt a new identity and a new brand image”.</p> <p>Although the scrappy end to the Vuelta in Madrid was criticised by rightwing Spanish politicians, the country’s socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/15/spains-pm-criticised-after-vuelta-a-espana-race-abandoned-over-pro-palestinian-protests">praised those who had protested peacefully</a>.</p> <p>Sánchez said he had “a deep admiration and respect” for the cyclists in the Vuelta and for “a Spanish society that mobilises against injustice and defends its ideas in a peaceful manner”.</p> <p><em>Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report.</em></p>
