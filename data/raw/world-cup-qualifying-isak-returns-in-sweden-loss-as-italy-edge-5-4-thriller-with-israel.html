<p>Liverpool’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/01/liverpool-sign-alexander-isak-british-transfer-record-125m-newcastle">new £125m signing Alexander Isak</a> made his first appearance of the season as a substitute for <strong>Sweden</strong> on Monday night, but he could not prevent his country falling to damaging 2-0 defeat away to <strong>Kosovo</strong> in World Cup qualifying.</p> <p>The Swedes, who conceded a 90th-minute equaliser in a 2-2 draw away to Slovenia on Friday, went behind in the 26th minute as goalkeeper Robin Olsen blocked Elvis Rexhbecaj’s shot only for the rebound to fly off the midfielder’s shin into the net.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/08/belarus-scotland-world-cup-qualifying-match-report">Ché Adams on target as Scotland cruise to victory against Belarus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Vedat Muriqi made it 2-0 for Kosovo three minutes before the break and although Sweden brought on Isak on 72 minutes, they could not find a way back into the game despite also having Arsenal’s £64m striker Viktor Gyökeres on the pitch from the start.</p> <p>Isak said he was glad to be on the pitch again. “It’s great that everything was settled before the camp and that I could focus on playing football again,” he told Swedish media. “It’s been a fairly new situation for me, but you always learn and develop mentally off the pitch as well.”</p> <p>The striker had made clear he wanted to leave Newcastle and played no part in the club’s pre-season or opening league games, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/19/alexander-isak-opens-up-newcastle-standoff-pfa-awards">accusing the club of breaking promises</a> and misleading supporters. “Obviously, not everyone has the full picture, but that’s something for another day,” he said. “I can’t control everything that’s said or written. But I’m happy that I became a Liverpool player.”</p> <p>Kosovo moved up to second place in Group B on three points, three behind <strong>Switzerland</strong>, who thumped <strong>Slovenia</strong> 3-0 to make it two wins out of two. Sweden are third on one point, ahead of Slovenia on goal difference. The top team in each group qualify directly for next year’s finals with the runners-up going into the playoffs.</p> <p>Isak’s former Newcastle teammate Sandro Tonali was the hero for <strong>Italy</strong>, scoring a stoppage-time winner to seal an extraordinary 5-4 qualifying win against <strong>Israel</strong> in Hungary. Italy scored two own goals, twice came from behind and conceded a late equaliser but somehow still won to stay in the hunt in Group I.</p> <p>Israel took a deserved lead in the 16th minute when Manuel Locatelli diverted Dan Biton’s pullback into his own goal. Italy found the equaliser five minutes from the break when Moise Kean’s powerful low shot from outside the box found the bottom corner.</p> <p>Kean forced Israel’s keeper Daniel Peretz into a save shortly after the interval but it was Israel who took the lead again in the 52nd minute, when Manor Solomon twisted and turned his way into the area before laying off a pass that Dor Peretz whipped first time beyond the reach of the <em>Azzurri’s</em> No 1 Gianluigi Donnarumma.</p> <p>Italy were almost immediately back on terms, with Kean smashing in a half-volley from the edge of the area. And they took the lead for the first time when Matteo Politano poked home on 58 minutes. Italy looked to have sealed the win when substitute Giacomo Raspadori netted with nine minutes remaining – only for Alessandro Bastoni’s own goal in the 87th minute to hand Israel a lifeline.</p>    <p>Chaos ensued, with Israel thinking they had snatched a draw when Dor Peretz headed his second in the 89th minute only for Tonali to fire in an opportunistic shot from outside the area. Italy’s head coach, Gennaro Gattuso, taking charge of the national side for only the second time, said: “We’re crazy – we conceded some absurd goals but we will hold on to this win.”</p> <p>The victory puts Italy second in the group on nine points, ahead of Israel on goal difference with a game in hand, but three points off Norway who have also played four matches.</p> <p><strong>Denmark’s</strong> Mikkel Damsgaard displayed the full range of his dribbling tricks as his side thumped <strong>Greece</strong> 3-0 away, grabbing the opening goal as the Danes went top of qualifying Group C ahead of Scotland on goal difference.</p> <p>Damsgaard put Denmark ahead in the 32nd minute, pirouetting and curling a superb shot past the despairing dive of Konstantinos Tzolakis for his fifth international goal. Denmark’s second came after the break when Andreas Christensen surged forward from his centre-back position before firing home from the edge of the area. Rasmus Højlund, on loan at Napoli from Manchester United, killed the game off two minutes later, tapping the ball into an empty net after Patrick Dorgu hit the post. The win leaves them level on four points with the Scots, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/08/belarus-scotland-world-cup-qualifying-match-report">who beat Belarus 2-0</a> in Hungary.</p> <p>In Group L, <strong>Croatia</strong> thrashed <strong>Montenegro</strong> 4-0 at home to move above the Czech Republic into top spot having played one game fewer. In the same group, <strong>the Faroe Islands</strong> won 1-0 away to <strong>Gibraltar</strong> in a battle of the minnows.</p> <p>In African qualifying, <strong>Tunisia’s</strong> Mohamed Ben Romdhane scored a 94th-minute winner as they booked their place at the World Cup finals with a 1-0 victory over hosts <strong>Equatorial Guinea</strong>. They are the second African side to qualify after <strong>Morocco</strong> booked their spot last Saturday.</p>
