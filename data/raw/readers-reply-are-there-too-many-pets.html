<p>Are there too many pets? Pet ownership goes up and up, particularly dogs and cats. But how many is too many? <em>Gene Leonard, London</em></p> <p><em>Send new questions to </em><strong><a href="mailto:nq@theguardian.com">nq@theguardian.com</a></strong><em>.</em></p> <h2>Readers reply</h2> <p>This needs to be qualified: “There are too many pets … for people who dislike dogs so much they can’t enjoy green spaces, cafes and other public areas.” <strong>rewilder</strong></p> <p>As I get older, I find myself questioning pet ownership. A pet exists for the sole purpose of pleasing its owner, giving it comfort, pleasure and companionship but also putting it at risk of abuse, pain, displeasure and abandonment. They are bred (often conforming to a human-designed ideal) or captured in order to perform human-pleasing duties. So, yes, there are too many pets for their human masters. <strong>02Dscythe</strong></p> <p>This is probably true unless you live with a cat, in which case the roles are reversed. <strong>kiramango</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/its-a-total-cat-astrophe-why-are-so-many-pet-cats-being-abandoned">‘You feel sorry for the person as well’: why are so many pet cats being abandoned?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think there are too many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/01/its-a-total-cat-astrophe-why-are-so-many-pet-cats-being-abandoned">abandoned pets</a>, too many pets in rescue, too many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/27/this-is-a-calamity-the-surgeons-keeping-pugs-and-bulldogs-alive">designer pets with health problems</a> because of their breed standards and too many dogs tied up outside leading lonely, deprived lives. We have one rescued dog, who is adored. He is walked on a lead three times daily, enjoys off-lead time playing in the fully fenced back yard, is fed the best possible food and is treated like a member of the family in all ways. I love cats, but I also love birds; I wish people would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/14/cats-kill-birds-wildlife-keep-indoors">keep their cats indoors</a> to protect the birds. The worst problem in our world is too many irresponsible humans, not too many animals. <strong>MythKenner</strong></p> <p>From an ecological point of view there are too many of everything associated with humans, so yes, there are definitely too many pets. I doubt there’s an easy way to solve that, though. <strong>unclestinky</strong></p> <p>There are certainly far too many people involved in the selling of mindless rubbish surrounding the keeping of animals at home. Cat and dog fashion, cosmetics, toys: too many containers of senseless junk being shipped around the world. There are way too many nonsense pet food brands as well: “Delicious morsels lovingly selected and served with rosemary and green beans.” What? It’s a pooch, or a moggy; it can’t read, it doesn’t understand infantile advertising slop and it’s not Jay Rayner.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/02/dog-breeds-must-be-rebooted-to-halt-health-problems-says-expert-has-said">Dog breeds must be ‘rebooted’ to halt health problems, says expert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pets are for companionship, a haven from loneliness for many, also to assist in teaching children about caring, responsibility, kindness, life, death and how not to develop into cruel, selfish brutes who think only of themselves and the next fix of cheap entertainment. <strong>bricklayersoption</strong></p> <p>How many is too many? Well, I did a house-sit with 17 cats and I can tell you, categorically: that’s too many. (Now, I ask people to define “a few cats”.) <strong>Leoned</strong></p> <p>There are far too many dogs now. Every public space, outdoor and indoor, is overrun with them. It’s time to reintroduce the dog licence at a realistic (high) level and set some rules and expectations around dog ownership, as there are currently none. So, one dog a household. On leads in all public spaces except enclosed dog fields, which would be funded by the licence fee. Breeding banned. Tougher rules on dangerous dogs. Some basic hygiene requirements on cafe and pub owners who allow dogs. Ownership banned if you fail to pick up dog mess – no excuses. This’ll do for starters. <strong>Dennis1970</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/27/this-is-a-calamity-the-surgeons-keeping-pugs-and-bulldogs-alive">‘This is a calamity’: the surgeons keeping pugs and bulldogs alive</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Every public space, outdoor and indoor, is overrun with them”? They really aren’t. And cafes and pubs already have to meet hygiene standards. And there are <a href="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/pet-help-and-advice/looking-after-your-pet/puppies-dogs/dog-laws-for-owners">rules and expectations around dog ownership</a>. You can argue they need strengthening, but saying there are none is just untrue. <strong>Oldhairynose</strong></p> <p>Too many inconsiderate dog owners use those extending leads in public spaces and expect others to get out of the way or else trip over them, or let their dogs foul the public spaces they insist on using for their dog’s toilet needs. Add to that letting poorly trained dogs off their leads and then saying: “He won’t hurt you, he just wants to play!” <strong>Sundaygal</strong></p> <p>NYC has too many. The streets reek of dog urine and too many owners don’t clean up faeces – especially in Brooklyn – so walking is a dangerous hopscotch around smears of festering mess. It can’t be very friendly for the dogs, either, which are kept locked up most of the day, against their nature. <strong>80xd35</strong></p> <p>Dogs are an environmental disaster, from the contamination of waterways from improperly disposed waste – and how long will it take for those plastic poo bags to degrade even if<em> </em>they’re<em> </em>used properly? – to the <a href="https://mountainjournal.org/we-love-dogs-but-they-are-wreaking-havoc-on-wildlife/">harmful effects on wildlife</a>. <strong>Dylan</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/13/the-case-against-pets-is-it-time-to-give-up-our-cats-and-dogs">The case against pets: is it time to give up our cats and dogs?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dog ownership is shown to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/feb/17/why-owning-a-pet-is-good-for-body-and-mind">improve people’s physical health</a>, pet ownership improves mental health and many people socially benefit from pets. The frustration is those few who mistreat their pets, have too many pets, don’t pick up after their pets, let their cats out to kill birds – and those who spend all their time moaning about other people’s pets. But the majority, who own pets with kindness and with social benefit, shouldn’t have to be judged by the minority. <strong>specklefreckle</strong></p> <p>We need dogs. They take us out, even in the rain. They help us to relax. They are true friends. It would be a sad world without them. <strong>Anne Meile</strong></p> <p>I’d welcome a ban on the “exotic pet” trade. <strong>Murdomania</strong></p>
