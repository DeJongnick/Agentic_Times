<p>Pleased to see I’m far from alone in trying to avoid American products (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/apr/19/this-unamerican-life-can-you-really-divest-yourself-of-everything-from-the-us">This un-American life: can you really divest yourself of everything from the US?, 19 April</a>). Mostly there are alternatives. There is no need to make your own cleaning products – for example, there are Bio-D and Faith in Nature. I have a Kobo e-reader and a Doro phone. A good source of alternatives is <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/">Ethical Consumer</a> magazine.<br><strong>Ruth Clancy</strong><br><em>Whaley Bridge, Derbyshire</em></p> <p>• For someone who sees nothing wrong in saying the US wants Greenland, no wonder Donald Trump thinks it is alright for Russia to have Crimea (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/vance-says-us-will-walk-away-unless-ukraine-and-russia-accept-peace-deal">Report, 24 April</a>).<br><strong>Helen Evans</strong><br><em>Ruthin, Denbighshire</em></p> <p>• At last, a great use for robots – running half-marathons so I don’t have to (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/21/humanoid-workers-and-surveillance-buggies-embodied-ai-is-reshaping-daily-life-in-china">Humanoid workers and surveillance buggies: ‘embodied AI’ is reshaping daily life in China, 21 April</a>).<br><strong>Toby Wood</strong><br><em>Peterborough</em> </p> <p>• Terry Bates in London writes that his newspaper costs less than a cup of coffee (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/20/britain-must-steel-itself-for-the-future">Letters, 20 April</a>), and Pete Bibby in Sheffield that his costs less than a pint (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/apr/22/the-ridiculous-notion-of-illegitimate-children-lingered-for-too-long">22 April</a>). I can buy a pint of bitter in my local pub for £1.79, or a coffee for £1.71. My paper of choice costs me more than either.<br><strong>Polly Llwynfedwen</strong><br><em>Brecon, Powys </em></p> <p>• On the rise of extra time in school exams (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/apr/23/extra-exam-time-why-do-so-many-schoolkids-suddenly-need-it">Report, 23 April</a>), as a teacher I’ve always wonder what provision employers make for employees who used to get extra time. <br><strong>Kartar Uppal</strong><br><em>Streetly, West Midlands</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
