<p>People across the US took to the streets on Saturday to oppose what left-leaning organizations called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s “authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda”.</p> 
<p>Organizers estimated<strong> </strong>that more than 500,000 people demonstrated in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere.</p>

<p>At Washington’s national mall, demonstrators from as far afield as New Hampshire and Pennsylvania gathered in the shadow of the Washington monument before the anti-Trump rally there.</p> 
<p>In overcast conditions, protesters displayed a vast array of placards and, in some cases, Ukrainian flags, expressing opposition to the policies of the administration, which has sought cordial relations with Russia amid its invasion of Ukraine.</p> 
<p>Some protesters said they hoped the event – the first mass demonstration in Washington DC since Trump took office – would act as an example to inspire others to register opposition. “The aim is, get people to rise up,” said Diane Kolifrath, 63, who had travelled from New Hampshire with 100 fellow members of New Hampshire Forward, a civic society organisation.</p> 
<p>“Many people are scared to protest against Trump because he has reacted aggressively and violently to those who have stood up,” Kolifrath said. The goal of this protest is to let the rest of Americans who aren’t participating see that we are standing up and hopefully when they see our strength, that will give them the courage to also stand up.”</p> 
<p>MoveOn, one of the organizations behind the day of protest dubbed “Hands Off” along with <a href="https://handsoff2025.com/about-1">dozens</a> of labor, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests took place across the US, including at state capitols.</p> 
<p>“We want to send a signal to all people and institutions that have been showing anticipatory obedience to Trump and showing they are willing to bend the knee that there is, in fact, a mass public movement that’s willing to rise up and stop this,” said Leah Greenberg, Indivisible’s executive director.</p> 
<p>“If our political leaders stand up, we will have their backs. We want them to stand up and protect the norms of democracy and want them to see that there are people out there who are willing to do that. The goal of this is building a message.”</p> 
<p>The largest event was at the national mall in DC, where demonstrators numbered in the tens of thousands. Members of Congress, including the Democrats Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, spoke to the crowd.</p> 
<p>“They believe democracy is doomed and they believe regime change is upon us if only they can seize our payments system,” said Raskin, a Democratic representative from Maryland who is the party’s top figure on the House judiciary committee.</p> 
<p>He added: “If they think they are going to overthrow the foundations of democracy, they don’t know who they are dealing with.”</p> 
<p>Kelley Robinson, the president of the Human Rights Campaign advocacy group, criticized the administration’s treatment of the LBGTQ+ community at the rally at the national mall.</p> 
<p>“The attacks that we’re seeing, they’re not just political. They are personal, y’all,” Robinson said. “They’re trying to ban our books, they’re slashing HIV-prevention funding, they’re criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives.”</p> 
<p>“We don’t want this America, y’all,” Robinson added. “We want the America we deserve, where dignity, safety and freedom belong not to some of us, but to all of us.”</p> 
<p>The scene in Hollywood, Florida, about an hour south of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, was lively as well. Referring to the White House’s billionaire business adviser <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> and the government cuts he has overseen, predominantly white protesters chanted: “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Trump and Musk have got to go.”</p> 
<p>They jeered motorists in Tesla Cybertrucks manufactured by Musk’s electric vehicle maker – and wielded colorful placards that left little doubt as to where they stood with the Trump administration.</p> 
<p>“Prosecute and jail the Turd Reich,” read one. Some reserved special ire for the world’s richest person: “I did not elect Elon Musk.” Others emphasized the protesters’ anxieties about the future of democracy in the US. “Hands off democracy,” declared one placard. “Stop being [Vladimir] Putin’s puppet,” enjoined another, referring to Russia’s dictator.</p> 
<p>Many motorists driving past the assembled demonstrators honked their horns and flashed thumb’s-up gestures in solidarity. Broward county was one of only six counties in Florida that voted for Kamala Harris in November – she defeated Trump there by 16 percentage points – and it is host to one of the US’s most vibrant LGBTQ+ communities.</p> 
<p>“This is an assault on our democracy, on our economy, on our civil rights,” said Jennifer Heit, a 64-year-old editor and resident of Plantation who toted a poster that read: “USA: No to King or Oligarchy.” She added: “Everything is looking so bad that I feel we have to do all we can while we can, and just having all this noise is unsettling to everyone.”</p> 
<p>Heit attended a protest outside a Tesla dealership in Fort Lauderdale recently, and she has been outraged by the Trump administration’s frontal assault on the rule of law and the judiciary – including with respect to people who have been deported without due process. “We’re supposed to be a nation of laws and due process,” she said.</p> 
<p>Public health researcher Donna Greene, 62, came dressed as France’s beheaded queen Marie Antoinette and carried a placard that said: “Musk and Trump Say Let Them Eat Cake.”</p> 
<p>She said she is proud of the 65 missions that her father Sam Ragland flew for the US military during the second world war. But, she said, the country her dad fought for is not the same one she sees emerging under Trump.</p> 
<p>“Everything my father fought for and everything we hold dear as a country is being dismantled,” Greene said. “I am beyond incredulous at how quickly our country’s institutions have been dismantled with no pushback from the Republicans who are currently in charge.”</p>

<p>In Ventura, California, Sandy Friedman brought her eight-year-old graddaughter, Harlow Rose Rega, to demonstrate. Friedman said she was worried about her social security, remarking: “I worked my whole life and so did my husband. Now I’m afraid Trump will take it away.”</p> 
<p>Harlow held up a sign reading: “Save my future.”</p> 
<p>The protests come after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/stock-markets-trump-tariffs">stock market plummeted</a> this week following Trump’s 1 April announcement of tariffs. Despite the economic fallout, Trump said on Friday: “My policies will never change.”</p> 
<p>Trump’s approval rating this week fell to 43%, his lowest since taking office, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/default/trump-approval-falls-43-lowest-since-returning-office-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-04-02/">Reuters poll</a>.</p>
