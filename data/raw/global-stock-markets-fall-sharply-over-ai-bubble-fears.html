<p>Global stock markets have fallen sharply amid concerns that a boom in valuations of artificial intelligence (AI) companies could be rapidly cooling.</p> <p>Markets in the US, Asia and Europe have fallen after bank bosses warned a serious stock market correction could lie ahead, after a run of record stock market highs led <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/01/leading-uk-tech-investor-warns-of-disconcerting-signs-of-ai-stock-bubble">some companies to appear overvalued</a>.</p> <p>In the US, the tech-focused Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday suffered their largest one-day percentage drop in almost a month.</p> <p>Technology shares pulled the Nasdaq lower, which resulted in it closing 2% down. Meanwhile, there were one-day falls for all of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/23/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst-and-send-the-stock-market-into-freefall">“magnificent seven” AI-related stocks</a>, including the chipmaker Nvidia, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Alphabet (the owner of Google) and Meta (the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp).</p> <p>The S&amp;P also closed down just over 1% as it lost ground because of tech stocks, particularly the data analytics company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/palantir">Palantir</a>, which slumped by almost 8% despite having raised its revenue outlook the previous day.</p> <p>Palantir has also been targeted by a well-known short-seller – who bets on falls in the value of a company.</p> <p>The investor Michael Burry – who rose to prominence after predicting the 2008 financial crash and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/27/the-big-short-financially-accurate-adam-mckay-subprime-money-bale-gosling-pitt">inspiring the film The Big Short</a> – bet against Palantir and the chipmaker Nvidia, two of the biggest AI companies, sparking criticism from Palantir’s boss and a stock sell-off.</p> <p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqa1yEd891o">interview on CNBC</a>, Alex Karp, Palantir’s chief executive, criticised Burry and other short-sellers for “trying to call the AI revolution into question”.</p> <p>Asian markets followed the US falls on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/nov/05/china-ends-tariffs-us-imports-soy-bean-levies-ms-profits-cyber-attack-business-live">recording the sharpest slide</a> in seven months, as the concerns about tech stocks spread, and indices in Japan and South Korea dropped more than 5% from the record highs reached the previous day. In Europe, markets in the UK, France and Germany dropped slightly on Wednesday morning.</p> <p>The market falls came as the chief executives of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs cautioned there could be a market correction ahead.</p> <p>They added their voices to that of Jamie Dimon, the head of the US’s largest bank, JP Morgan Chase, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/09/head-of-jpmorgan-chase-warns-of-risk-of-american-stock-market-crash">warned in October</a> he was worried markets would crash in the next six months to two years.</p> <p>Jim Reid, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said there was a “growing chorus<em><strong> </strong></em>discussing whether we might be on the verge of an equity correction”.</p> <p>Reid added: “The last 24 hours have brought a clear risk-off move, as concerns over lofty tech valuations have hit investor sentiment.”</p> <p>Other analysts have raised questions about investment in AI companies, highlighting that the vast majority of investment in AI programmes has been promised to a very small group of tech companies, particularly OpenAI and Nvidia, while there has so far been little return on investment.</p> <p>The price of bitcoin briefly dipped below $100,000 (£76,764) for the first time since June, as investors withdrew their money from riskier assets such as cryptocurrencies over fears about the economic outlook.</p> <p>Bitcoin touched a record price of more than $126,000 in early October but went on to fall by 3.7% during the month, resulting in the worst monthly performance by the cryptocurrency in the last decade, according to figures from CoinMarketCap.</p>
