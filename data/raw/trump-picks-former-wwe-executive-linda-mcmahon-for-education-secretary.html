<p>Linda McMahon, co-chair of Donald Trump’s transition team, has been named as the president-elect’s pick for education secretary in his upcoming administration.</p> <p>In a statement, Trump extolled the “incredible” job McMahon, the billionaire co-founder of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), has been doing as transition team co-chair and said: “As Secretary of Education, Linda will fight tirelessly to expand ‘Choice’ to every State in America, and empower parents to make the best Education decisions for their families. … We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort.”</p> <p>McMahon was made transition team chair in August, after having donated <a href="https://www.nhregister.com/politics/article/ct-biggest-donors-presidential-donors-biden-trump-19548857.php">$814,600 to Trump’s 2024 campaign</a> as of July. She served in Trump’s cabinet in his first administration as the administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019. McMahon chaired America First Action, a super PAC that backed Trump’s reelection campaign, where <a href="https://ctmirror.org/2020/10/09/linda-mcmahon-is-raising-millions-with-her-pro-trump-super-pac-but-not-from-ct/">she raised $83m</a> in 2020. She provided $6 million to help Trump’s candidacy after he secured the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>McMahon is the former chief executive of WWE, which she co-founded with her husband, Vince McMahon.</p> <p>In October, McMahon was named in a new lawsuit involving WWE. The suit alleges that she and other leaders of the company allowed the sexual abuse of young boys at the hands of a ringside announcer, former WWE ring crew chief Melvin Phillips Jr. The complaint specifically alleges that the McMahons knew about the abuse and failed to stop it.</p> <p>An attorney for the McMahons told <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/10/23/ww-ring-boys-sexual-abuse-negligence-lawsuit-vince-mcmahon-linda-tko/75814539007/">USA Today Sports</a> that the allegations are “false claims” stemming from reporting that the couple deems “absurd, defamatory and utterly meritless”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/trump-cabinet-picks-administration-appointees">Trump’s cabinet and White House picks – so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McMahon stepped down from her position as WWE’s chief executive to enter politics. She ran twice for a US Senate seat in Connecticut, but lost in 2010 to Richard Blumenthal and in 2012 to Chris Murphy.</p> <p>Since 2021, McMahon has been the chair of Washington DC-based thinktank America First Policy Institute’s board and chair of its Center for the American Worker.</p> <p>McMahon is seen as a relative unknown in education circles, though she has expressed support for charter schools and school choice.<strong> <br><br></strong>She served on the Connecticut Board of Education for a year starting in 2009. She told lawmakers at the time that she had a lifelong interest in education and once planned to become a teacher, a goal that fell aside after her marriage. She also spent years on the board of trustees for Sacred Heart University in Connecticut.</p> <p>Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/jul/04/trump-project-2025-heritage-foundation-education-department">promised to close the Education Department</a> and return much of its powers to states. He has not explained how he would close the agency, which was created by Congress in 1979 and would likely require action from Congress to dismantle.</p> <p>McMahon’s co-chair on the transition team and billionaire founder of the financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/howard-lutnick-commerce-secretary-trump">Howard Lutnick</a>, was named as Trump’s pick for commerce secretary. </p>
