<p>Becoming obese under the age of 30 increases the chances of premature death by more than 75%,<strong> </strong>a large-scale study has found.</p> <p>Nearly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/update-to-the-obesity-profile-on-fingertips/obesity-profile-short-statistical-commentary-may-2024">two-thirds of adults in England</a> are overweight or obese, while <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/health-survey-for-england/2022-part-2/adult-overweight-and-obesity">NHS data shows</a> that the average man now weighs more than 85kg (13st 5lb) and the typical woman about 73kg (11st 7lb), more than 6kg heavier than they were in 1993.</p> <p>While excess weight is more common with age, the Swedish research shows that putting on extra weight in early adulthood has a sharply disproportionate impact on mortality risk, compared with those who gained weight later.</p> <p>Researchers, led by academics from Lund University, Malmö, Sweden, tracked 620,000 adults aged 17-60 and found that women who became obese under the age of 30 were 84% more likely to die early, while men were 79% more likely when they were compared with those who did not gain weight in young adulthood.</p> <p>Patients typically gained about half a kilogram a year until the age of 60, but for the under-30s, each additional half kilogram increased their mortality risk by 24% for men and 22% for women.</p> <p>The study, presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Málaga followed male participants for an average of 23 years and females for 12 years.</p> <p>The researchers calculated that weight gain before the age of 30 substantially increased the likelihood of early death from a range of conditions, in particular heart disease and type 2 diabetes. For women, weight gain increased their risk of dying early from cancer at any age.</p> <p>Huyen Le, the lead researcher, said the findings showed how crucial it is to avoid weight gain in teenage years or the 20s. She said: “Gaining weight early in adulthood, or developing obesity at a young age, is linked to a higher risk of dying from many chronic diseases later in life.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/11/weight-loss-jabs-could-halve-risk-of-obesity-related-cancers-study-finds">Weight-loss jabs could halve risk of obesity-related cancers, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While weight gain after 30 also increased the chance of early death, it was not as dramatic. It increased mortality risk for those aged 30-45 by 52% and for those aged 45-60 by just over 25%.</p> <p>Prof Tanja Stocks, a senior researcher, said “cumulative, long exposure likely causes these diseases” and called for greater efforts to prevent weight gain in young adults, with improved access to healthier foods, and encouragement of exercise.</p> <p>She said: “Supporting healthy habits during this critical life stage can have lasting benefits. Even modest weight gains in your 20s can significantly increase the risk of early death if they persist over several years. The earlier people embrace healthy living, the better the chance of a long life.”</p> <p>Responding to the findings, Sonia Pombo, the head of impact and research at Action on Salt, said: “This important new study provides yet more compelling evidence that weight gain, particularly in early adulthood, has a profound and lasting impact on health and longevity.</p> <p>“It is clear that we are failing to protect young people from environments that promote poor diets. Urgent action is needed to reformulate unhealthy food and drink, restrict marketing to children and young adults, and make healthy options the easiest, most affordable choice.”</p> <p>Katharine Jenner, the director of the <a href="https://obesityhealthalliance.org.uk/">Obesity Health Alliance</a>, said: “This study is yet another wake-up call. Gaining excess weight early in life doesn’t just increase the risk of obesity – it can shorten lives by driving up rates of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers and poor mental health.</p> <p>“Many young people are on course to reach obesity by 30, driven by a food environment dominated by fast food deals, oversized portions and highly processed products.</p> <p>“This is the consequence of decades of failure by the commercial food system and the lack of action by government to fix it.</p> <p>“Preventing obesity in the first place is essential if the government is serious about delivering five extra healthy years of life and narrowing the life expectancy gap.</p> <p>“That means more than treatment – we need bold action to make healthy food the easy, affordable and appealing choice.”</p>
