<h2>Disease X: Hunting the Next Pandemic</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>“Covid may have just been a warning shot,” says doctor and buzzkiller-in-chief Chris van Tulleken. This bleak Horizon documentary sees him undertake a virus world tour, visiting countries including Switzerland, Malaysia and Bangladesh in search of the next deadly threat and finding several likely candidates. The good news? Lots of very clever, very diligent people are monitoring these ominous pathogens on a granular, daily basis. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Panorama: Gaza – Dying for Food</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>Acute food shortages are making the horrifying situation in Gaza even worse. But who is to blame? This edition of Panorama hears from those on the ground. It also takes a closer look at the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the new aid organisation – backed by the US and Israel – that has controversially risen to prominence. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Jamie: Eat Yourself Healthy</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Jamie Oliver has revealed an obsession with filo pastry in this useful series; it features again in this final episode, along with cod and a tomato orzo. He also serves up a healthy and lavish-looking stew and dumplings, and looks at some of the science around the good habits he’s been promoting. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>The Guest</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>This wild, hugely entertaining Welsh thriller reaches a climax that is moody and adrenalised. We begin with a dead body and a bloody meat tenderiser – things look bad for Ria and she’s forced to go on the run. Can she evade capture for long enough to prove her innocence? <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Task</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic</strong><strong><br></strong>Another week of drug-fuelled crime drama. Maverick in-over-their-heads garbagemen Robbie and Cliff try to find a buyer for the results of their botched heist, while coppers Aleah and Lizzie question them over their former co-worker Peaches. <em>Alexi Duggins</em></p> <h2>Trying</h2>    <p><strong>10.40pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>The gruelling adoption process meets English class insecurity head-on, when a beleaguered Jason and Nikki attend a snooty adoption support group picnic, filled with journalists, financial advisers, ceramic artists and solicitors. After Nikki develops a whopping inferiority complex, she enrols in brow-furrowing lectures to appear more serious. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p>
