<p>Without shops, fuel supplies and post offices with banking facilities, will remote communities face further depopulation? The closure of the shop in Kilchoan follows a number of other closures of similar local assets in Lochaber and Argyll (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/30/scotland-kilchoan-shop-closure-retail-online-shopping">‘Morrisons killed us’: Britain’s most westerly mainland village shop closes after half a century, 30 October</a>). But is it a policy failure or just a case of market forces?</p> <p>Nearly 50 years ago, a government-funded scheme offered a lifeline to communities that were keen to save key assets. A programme was initiated by the Highlands and Islands Development Board in 1977 as a way of supporting community-led development. It offered to match local financial contributions and provide practical support through an outreach team, of which I was a member. Tested in the Western Isles, by 1979 it was expanded to the rest of the Highlands and islands.</p> <p>Such initiatives contributed to vital community wealth-building and supported community investment in revenue-generating activities. Today there are numerous active co-operatives that help to retain people and money in communities across the Highlands and Islands – but even they are operating in challenging conditions.</p> <p>As Lochaber residents have seen, major retailers have extended home deliveries to remote households. If services are cut off, the economic base of an area inevitably declines. There is a case for public support for communities to maintain essential services, which helps stem depopulation – or is the plan for everyone to move to urban centres?<br><strong>Chas Ball</strong><br><em>Huddersfield, West Yorkshire </em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
