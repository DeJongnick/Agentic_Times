<p>Morning everyone. Today’s Essential poll shows public backing for the government’s net zero targets announced last week – but many doubt that the targets can be reached. The poll also shows a remarkable surge in support for One Nation.</p> 
<p>Donald Trump and his defence chief have delivered a pair of incendiary speeches to a rare gathering of the US’s generals and admirals. A senior Australian human rights expert says Israel’s genocidal policy of “mass slaughter” has failed.</p> 
<p>Plus: a Melbourne charity reveals how it has been bombarded with abusive messages after the Charlie Kirk shooting, and scientists have created human eggs from skin cells.</p>

<p>A small mental health charity in Melbourne has been inundated with abusive messages after United Australia senator Ralph Babet accused a member of staff of celebrating the death of US activist Charlie Kirk. He encouraged his social media followers to demand the person’s sacking, even though the person had left the charity a year before. The charity’s chief executive called the abuse <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/30/melbourne-charity-receives-hate-mail-after-senator-and-others-post-contact-details-in-wake-of-charlie-kirk-killing">“highly distressing”</a>.</p>
