<p>In 1937, aviator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/jun/10/amelia-earhart-footage-discovered-pilot-video">Amelia Earhart</a> went missing during her her solo journey around the world, her fame so great that her disappearance would’ve coloured the childhood of <a href="https://laurieanderson.com/">Laurie Anderson</a>, born 10 years later. Updating a piece first performed 24 years ago, <em>Amelia </em>attempts to revivify this primordial tale of human flight, compressing diaries, telegrams and biographies into a narrative orchestral song cycle, circling around the missing adventurer’s last six weeks in the sky.</p> <p>Czech orchestra Filharmonie Brno concoct agreeable tension between the suite’s electronic and analogue elements, and occasional ornamental support from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/16/on-my-radar-anohni-cultural-highlights">Anohni</a> is welcome. It’s all rather restful. Perhaps too restful. The staccato sentences Anderson murmurs in impassive contemplation of Earhart’s astonishing expedition (“Waves of air. Feel the wind blow”) are frustratingly jejune. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/22/laurie-anderson-us-artist-musician-amelia-earhart">‘Optimists have happier lives’: Laurie Anderson on Bowie, Lou Reed and ‘romantic, inspiring’ JFK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The project’s biggest failing is its artless shifting of perspectives between anodyne reportage and first-person journalling, leaving it neither compendious nor immediate enough.
