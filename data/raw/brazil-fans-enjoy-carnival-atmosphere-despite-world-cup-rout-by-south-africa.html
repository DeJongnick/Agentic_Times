<p>In certain other sports, Brazil’s absence from any World Cup tournament would be regarded as downright bizarre. It’s not quite like that in rugby, and their women’s 15s team created history simply by running on to the turf.</p> 
<p>The first Brazil team to qualify for a men’s or women’s Rugby World Cup had played only 16 times before this, winning five matches, including a playoff against Colombia that secured qualification. Their prize, if you can call it that, was an intimidating opener against the famously powerful South Africa.</p>

<p>“Our first Brazil fan of the day,” one of the friendly volunteers outside Northampton train station declared just before 10am, as supporters began to drift from the platforms towards the venue. There would be more.</p> 
<p>The throb of drums was audible approaching the stadium, too. Although it may be stretching it to suggest Northampton was rocking to a samba beat courtesy of the World Rugby-sanctioned percussionists positioned outside Gate Three.</p> 
<p>There was more than a whiff of carnival atmosphere in the air, though, as the fans welcomed Japan and Ireland for their first instalment of the Franklin’s Gardens double‑header. There were patches of Brazilian gold and green visible around the packed stadium, and judging by the roars, every neutral fan in the place was praying for a gargantuan upset in the second match on the bill.</p> 
<p>After three early tries, one disallowed, for South Africa it looked like a cricket score might materialise but the lowest-ranked team in the tournament defended doggedly, and a sweetly struck penalty from Raquel Kochhann got them on the board. Kochhann is a cancer survivor as well as a three‑time Olympian, in sevens, and personifies the squad’s character.</p> 
<p>“I just made the kick,” Kochhann said. “It was the result of a jackal, so the whole team worked to get those points. They are team points because everyone needed to work hard. If we are not so skilful – yet – we have a lot of heart. And we put all that on the field.”</p> 
<p>Aseza Hele, the dynamic Springbok No 8, personified the size of Brazil’s task, and scored two superb tries before half-time. Nadine Roos, Ayanda Malinga and Libbie Janse van Rensburg also crossed, making it 26-3 at the break, but Brazil stayed firmly in the fight. The half‑time numbers told the story: Brazil had made 130 tackles against 25 for South Africa.</p> 
<p>Gaps were always likely to open up and three minutes after half-time the sprightly Roos skipped around a would-be tackler and chipped into the Brazil 22, where Byrhandré Dolf snaffled the bouncing ball and sensed Hele on her left shoulder. The irrepressible No 8 raced under the sticks to seal a hat-trick.</p> 
<p>Van Rensburg went over again, and Aphiwe Ngwevu added an eighth try, as the second half wore on and the Brazil team wore out. But Kochhann, to symbolise their continued desire, added a second penalty on 57min.</p> 
<p>“We’re very proud,” said the Brazilian supporter Fabiano Ferreira, born in the countryside near São Paulo and now living in south London with his Scottish wife and family. “It’s been very difficult for the team against South Africa.”</p>

    <p>England's Hannah Botterman has said she wants to 'cement' herself as the best loosehead prop in the world at this Rugby World Cup. The Red Roses star produced a great performance against the USA in England's opener, scoring a brilliant try and coming up with scrum and breakdown penalties. The Bristol player believes she has room to improve at this tournament and beyond, however.<br><br>'I’ve worked really hard over the offseason to get into some decent shape,' Botterman (pictured) said. 'I don’t want to be shy about the fact that I want to be the best loosehead prop in the world. I want to cement that this tournament. For me, that was a good start, but I feel like I’ve still got a lot more I can give.'<br><br>'I don’t want it to be questioned, if I’m honest. I think I am within the conversation and now I just want to push on and keep improving', the 26-year-old added. 'Everyone can improve everywhere, but for a long time my scrummaging wasn’t the best. I’ve really worked on that and I think that is an area of strength now. Attacking wise, I’m happy; defensively I think I can be a bit stronger and chuck my weight around a bit more. I feel physically in a really good spot.'<br><br>Another name that could be included among the best looseheads in the world is the USA's Hope Rogers, who played against Botterman on Friday night. The game was a record-breaker with 42,723 fans at Sunderland's Stadium of Light – the biggest attendance for a Women's Rugby World Cup opening game.&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>'I don't think we probably quite knew how big it was going to be,' Botterman added. 'When we turned up and started seeing the crowds, when we walked out with&nbsp;all the flames, it started to feel a bit real. We fed off the crowd well.'<b> Sarah Rendell</b></p>

<p>Ferreira’s three children – Fergus, Bella and Laura – confirmed they, too, were proud even as the South Africa points continued to rain down. It became 10 tries in total, Lerato Makua rounding off the scoring. Malinga and Van Rensburg both scored twice and Dolf finished with eight conversions.</p> 
<p>“Very satisfactory performance,” the Springboks head coach, Swys de Bruin, said. “Their defence was good, but so was our attack.”</p> 
<p>Of South Africa’s experience in the early days of this tournament De Bruin said: “I tell you it’s fantastic. It’s the first time for these girls, in a lot of things, and that’s why they’re blessed, humble, and grateful. It’s a nice day to be a South African.”</p> 
<p>It was a nice day, and a proud day, to be a Brazilian too.</p>
