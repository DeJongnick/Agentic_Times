<p>The best Apple Watch may be the one already on your wrist.</p> 
<p>Each generation of Apple’s smartwatch is fairly iterative, with most of the best features added via software updates, which means there’s no need to buy a new device each year. That said, if your watch has seen better days, or it’s stopped receiving updates, then your best options are set out below.</p> 
<p>While several third-party smartwatches are compatible with the iPhone, they don’t offer the same level of integration that the Apple Watch does with the phone, iOS and the company’s other devices and services. It’s the best smartwatch for iPhone users, but note that you’ll soon need an iPhone capable of being <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2025/06/apple-elevates-the-iphone-experience-with-ios-26/">updated to iOS 26</a> – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/01/iphone-11-review-iphone-xr-dual-camera-a13-smartphone">iPhone 11</a> or later – as <a href="https://www.apple.com/os/watchos/">watchOS 26</a> is due for release in September. The free update will bring a raft of new features, including an AI motivational workout coach called Workout Buddy, a new wrist-flick gesture to clear notifications, a design revamp and various smart actions for messages, dealing with spam, and controlling the volume. The Apple Watch can’t be used with Android or as a standalone device.</p>

<h2><em>Best Apple Watch for most people:</em> <br>Series 10 Aluminium</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-watch-series-10/"><sub>From £399 at Apple</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/apple-watch-series-10-gps-42mm-aluminium-case-sport-band/black/p112608936"><sub>£399 at John Lewis</sub></a></p> 
<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 is the best model for most people, offering the full Apple smartwatch experience in a choice of two sizes. It’s the thinnest model yet, at just under 1cm thick, so it easily slips under shirt cuffs and feels light and compact on the wrist. The 42mm version should fit smaller wrists, while the 46mm version is the bearer of the largest screen on an Apple Watch – if only <em>just</em> over the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra">Ultra 2</a>.</p> 
<p>The screen is a bright and crisp OLED that stays on all the time and can be easily read in direct sunlight or from an angle. The watch feels slick in operation, with the 46mm unit lasting about two days between charges (if it’s not monitoring exercise), or long enough to track a marathon with battery life to spare. The double-tap gesture is handy for cancelling timers, alarms and scrolling through your widgets without having to touch the watch. And with Siri on board, you can set alarms and other basic features quickly, without an internet connection.</p> 
<p>One of the biggest benefits of the Series 10 Apple Watch is pretty comprehensive health tracking, including ECG (heart rhythm), blood oxygen and skin temperature, plus sleep and menstrual cycle monitoring. Apple’s sports tracking is solid, too, covering running, cycling, and swimming at depths up to 6m. Offline music from Apple Music, Spotify and other third-party apps means you can access your tunes without having to carry your phone with you.</p> 
<p>However, it’s the deep integration with iOS that makes the Apple Watch the best smartwatch for iPhone users, with Apple Pay, notifications, calls, texts, maps, photos and more accessible from your wrist.</p> 
<p>Note that 4G models are available but require a plan linked to your phone provider. They allow you to stay connected when you’re out of Bluetooth or wifi range, which can be particularly handy for making calls and staying in touch while you’re out exercising without your iPhone in tow.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The Series 10 offers the best Apple Watch experience in the slimmest and most compact package. Add to this the bright and always-on screen, ECG and handy gesture controls, and it’s<strong> </strong>also<strong> </strong>the best Apple Watch for daily wear.</p> 
<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want a great Apple Watch with almost all the features<br><strong>Don’t buy if:</strong> you want longer battery life or a more rugged design</p>

<h2><em>Best cheap </em><em>Apple Watch:<br></em>SE (2nd gen)</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-se"><sub>From £219 at Apple</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/apple-watch-se-gps-40mm-sport-band/p112623060"><sub>£219 at John Lewis</sub></a></p> 
<p>The SE is a cut-down version of the Apple Watch that offers the basics for just over half the price of the Series 10. The shape of the second-gen SE is based on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/05/apple-watch-series-6-review-faster-cheaper-still-the-best">Series 6</a> from 2020, which means it has an older design and thicker body, but it still comes in a choice of 40mm or 44mm sizes. The OLED screen is smaller than the Series 10 with chunkier bezels. While crisp and good-looking, it’s not as bright nor is it always-on; it lights up only when you turn your wrist – which might be a deal breaker for some.</p> 
<p>Built around the S8 chip from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/28/apple-watch-series-8-review-better-womens-health-tracking">the Series 8</a>, the SE is missing some of the S10’s other nice-to-have features, too: it lacks support for the offline and faster Siri, the useful double-tap gesture, and it has only half the storage (32GB) for offline music and apps. The watch still tracks quite a lot of health and sport metrics, but has an older-generation heart-rate monitor compared with the Series 10. It doesn’t give ECG, blood oxygen and skin temperature measurements, either.</p> 
<p>What you do get is all the same tie-ins with the iPhone, including Apple Pay, notifications and calls on your wrist. Battery life is about two days, but note the current generation of SE is approaching three years old and could be replaced later this year. And while it’s the cheapest Apple Watch that Apple is selling new, you can often find better refurbished deals on higher-end models.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The older SE still offers most of the experience that makes an Apple Watch great, but for less money. Some of the more advanced heart-tracking features and the always-on screen are missing, though.</p> 
<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want most of what makes the Apple Watch great for less<br><strong>Don’t buy if:</strong> you want an ECG or an always-on screen</p> 
<p><strong>Size:</strong> 40/44mm<br><strong>Thickness:</strong> 10.7mm<br><strong>Screen brightness:</strong> up to 1,000nits<br><strong>Tested battery life:</strong> 2 days<br><strong>Processor:</strong> S8<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 32GB<br><strong>Water resistance:</strong> 50 metres <br><strong>Sensors:</strong> HR (2nd gen)</p>

<h2>Best Apple Watch for battery: <br>Ultra 2</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/apple-watch-ultra-2-cellular-49-mm-natural-titanium-case-with-navy-ocean-band-10269995.html"><sub>From £779 at Currys</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch-ultra"><sub>From £799 at Apple</sub></a></p> 
<p>The biggest and longest-lasting Apple Watch is the Ultra 2, which is unapologetically beefy compared with its siblings. It comes in only one size – 49mm – but is available in black or natural titanium and has a super scratch-resistant sapphire crystal screen.</p> 
<p>The Ultra 2 is Apple’s adventure watch, complete with an extra “action” button in bold orange on the side for triggering sports tracking or other functions, plus an extra chunky digital crown that can be easily engaged if you’re wearing gloves. It has a siren for emergencies and a super bright OLED screen that’s 1.5x as bright as the Series 10 and works well if you’re in need of a torch.</p> 
<p>On the inside it has the same chips and sensors as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/19/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-chips-screen-smartwatch-siri">Series 9</a>, matching the health and sports tracking features of the Series 10, including ECG and blood oxygen monitoring. It has a few extras, such as dual-band GPS for higher accuracy in built-up areas or forests, plus a “precision start” setting that gets a GPS and heart rate lock before you start an activity. It also comes with 4G as standard, although it still needs a compatible plan with your phone provider. One of the Ultra 2’s standout features is battery life, which is about three days without exercise monitoring or long enough to track an ultramarathon.</p> 
<p>Despite being quite big for an Apple Watch, the Ultra 2 still fits under shirt cuffs fairly easily and looks expensive despite its rugged design – which is good because it’s roughly double the starting price of the Series 10.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The Ultra 2 is the biggest, longest-lasting and most distinctive Apple Watch available and comes with all the features you need to help make the most out of exercise, adventure and just daily life.</p> 
<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want the biggest and longest-lasting Apple Watch with extra features<br><strong>Don’t buy if:</strong> you need a compact model or have smaller wrists</p>

<h2>Other options</h2> 
<p>***</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/19/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-chips-screen-smartwatch-siri">Series 9</a></strong> – Essentially the same as the Series 10, just a little thicker with a slightly smaller screen. It’s worth buying refurbished or when it is reduced.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/sep/28/apple-watch-series-8-review-better-womens-health-tracking">Series 8</a></strong> – Good at the time of release in 2022, the Series 8 still has most of the main Apple Watch features with a slightly smaller and dimmer screen. Worth picking up refurbished at a substantial discount.</p> 
<p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/09/apple-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-design-athletes">Ultra</a></strong> – For looks, Apple’s original chunky watch is almost identical to the Ultra 2, missing out on only a few minor features such as the double-tap gesture, a less bright screen, precision finding and sleep apnoea notifications. Worth buying refurbished.</p> 
<p>***</p> 
<h2>Replace or spruce up?</h2> 
<p>Wearable devices can take a beating, so if your existing Apple Watch is looking a bit tired, there are things you can do. Simply cleaning out the speaker grilles and other crevices can help, as can swapping out the straps or switching up the face to make the watch look fresh.</p> 
<p>Greater damage, such as a cracked screen, can be repaired, though options are more limited than those for an iPhone. Apple charges at <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/watch/repair">least £169 for such repairs</a> ; third parties can be cheaper. Having Apple replace batteries <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/watch/repair">costs £95</a>.</p> 
<h2>What to look out for in a refurb</h2> 
<p>Buying refurbished watches is a good option for the planet and your wallet. Apple’s are among the fastest and smoothest-running smartwatches available, and they are supported by software updates for about six years from release, so buying a refurbished model can save you some money.</p> 
<p>There are two types of refurbished Apple Watch available: those that Apple refurbishes and <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/watch">sells as new directly</a>, and those refurbished by third parties that are available in various grades or conditions for less.</p> 
<p>Several third-party retailers offer secondhand or refurbished Apple Watches, including the UK high-street chain <a href="https://uk.webuy.com/search?categoryIds=1019&amp;categoryName=Apple%20Watch">CeX</a>, online stores such as <a href="https://www.musicmagpie.co.uk/store/category/wearables/apple/">musicMagpie</a>, and marketplaces such as <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=apple+watch&amp;rh=p_n_condition-type%3A13736824031&amp;dc">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/e/special-events/roe-shop-all/Smart-Watches/178893?_dmd=2&amp;Brand=Apple">eBay</a> and <a href="https://www.backmarket.co.uk/en-gb/l/apple-watch/92caf545-c033-409f-bcb0-d3cfec8af49d">Back Market</a>.</p> 
<p>Make sure you consider the condition of the watch before parting with any cash. Grading is as follows:</p> 
<p><strong>Grade A or Excellent</strong> – virtually identical to new, often with the original box and accessories, making them the most expensive.</p> 
<p><strong>Grade B or Good</strong> – in full working order but with light marks, and it may come with replacement accessories.</p> 
<p><strong>Grade C or Fair</strong> – in full working order but with obvious signs of use, and it may not come with accessories.</p> 
<p>Once you’re satisfied with a watch’s condition, ensure you check that the strap connects properly, and that the device powers up and connects to your iPhone. Then check the following:</p> 
<p><strong>Battery </strong><strong>health</strong> – the battery in the Apple Watch is <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/batteries/service-and-recycling/">designed to maintain at least 80%</a> of its original capacity for 1,000 full charge cycles. Check the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/watch/apd24c6cb2dd/watchos">battery health under battery</a> via the Settings app on the watch. Has the battery been replaced?</p> 
<p><strong>Charging cable</strong> – the Apple Watch requires a special magnetic puck to charge, which <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/product/MT0H3ZM/A/apple-watch-magnetic-fast-charger-to-usb-c-cable-1-m">costs £29 on its own</a>. Make sure an authentic, USB-C puck is included and snaps into place correctly on the back of the watch.</p> 
<p><strong>Buttons</strong> – check the buttons and digital crown are in good working order and don’t need to be pressed too hard to function.</p> 
<p><strong>Sensors</strong> – the back of the Apple Watch contains a cluster of delicate sensors. Ensure they work correctly – can you see the LEDs of the heart-rate sensor light up?</p> 
<p><strong>Speakers</strong> – check the speakers are free of dirt and fluff, and function correctly for Siri, alarms and calls.</p> 
<p><strong>Wifi</strong> – the Apple Watch shares wifi details with the iPhone, so fully turn off Bluetooth on your iPhone in the Settings app when in range of your home wifi to check the watch can connect properly.</p> 
<p><strong>Water resistance</strong> – the watch needs to be properly sealed to maintain its water resistance. Has it been obviously opened, and does the refurbisher maintain the original 50m water resistance?</p> 
<p><strong>Warranty</strong> – what kind of warranty and support does the refurbisher offer?</p> 
<h2>Do not buy</h2> 
<p>Any <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/10/apple-watch-series-7-review-bigger-screen-faster-charging-still-the-best">Apple Watch Series 7</a> or older, as you simply won’t benefit from the software support for long before you’ll have to replace the device.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>We conduct real-world testing of smartwatches and their various features to ensure they meet expectations and compare to their rivals.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We change the straps, poke, prod and twiddle every button, dial and setting. We wear the smartwatches day and night, seeing how they feel on the wrist, how well they fit under and with clothes, whether they catch on objects in daily life, and how well they stay put during vigorous exercise.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We test their health metrics, track various activities, and compare them for accuracy. We do everything a typical smartwatch user would, picking up notifications, installing apps, sending messages, making calls, exercising, listening to music, monitoring our health and tracking our sleep. We see how long the battery lasts in general use and while exercising, whether it’s consistent and reliable, plus how long it takes to charge.</p>
