<p><strong>I work for a charity providing affordable sheltered housing for older people. In January 2024, we began refurbishing a building that was bequeathed to </strong><strong>us.</strong></p> <p><strong>We paid Thames Water to connect a water supply in February 2024. It wasn’t until November that </strong><strong>it informed us that </strong><strong>it would need permission from Transport for London (TfL) to close part of the road.</strong></p> <p><strong>Since then, there has been no progress. Thames Water blames TfL which, it claims, keeps asking for extra information and requires 12 working days to respond when it is submitted.</strong></p> <p><strong>The renovations are now complete but we are unable to </strong><strong>rent the properties </strong><strong>without a water supply. The delay could be </strong><strong>costing the charity up to £6,900 a month in revenue</strong><strong>.</strong></p> <p><strong>JS, </strong><em><strong>London</strong></em></p> <p>You first wrote to me at the beginning of March, 13 months after you had paid for the installation. Naively, I hoped that an overture from the press, highlighting the financial hit to your charity, might allow common sense to prevail over process.</p> <p>As I was wading in, TfL was requesting yet another document from Thames Water which required another 12 working days to process.</p> <p>Thames Water told me that TfL was to blame for repeatedly requesting amendments to its application for the road closure.</p> <p>A Thames Water spokesperson said: “We have been engaging with TfL to secure a date for the works to proceed. We recognise how important this is to the charity.”</p> <p>TfL, meanwhile, blamed it all on Thames Water for submitting incomplete applications. Its spokesperson said: “We have been working with Thames Water to resolve a number of issues with its application, and we continue to handle this in line with the longstanding agreements around permissions and timescales required for these works.”</p> <p>The good news was that, after my contact, an installation date was agreed for late May. The bad news: it never happened. It appears that Thames Water had omitted to arrange a traffic management plan. It also omitted to let you know that the works could not proceed.</p> <p>The company breezily told me you would have to wait until August for a new appointment and ignored my questions about compensation.</p> <p>Last month, a year and a half after you paid for the installation, the property was finally connected. You are now in negotiations about an appropriate payout from Thames Water.</p> <p><em>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
