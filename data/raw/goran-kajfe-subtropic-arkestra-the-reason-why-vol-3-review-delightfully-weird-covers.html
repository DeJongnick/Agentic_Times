<p>Led by the staggeringly prolific Swedish trumpeter <a href="http://gorankajfes.com/">Goran Kajfeš</a>, the Subtropic Arkestra are possibly the best of those many bands who meld Afrobeat, Ethio-jazz and big band funk. This is the third in the Arkestra’s Reason Why trilogy, and like the two earlier volumes, it features a delightfully weird mix of covers – obscure worldbeat gems, recent indie anthems, dippy psychedelic oddities – each creatively reinvented by a talented nine-piece.<br></p> <p> A skittery waltz by Ethiopian jazz pioneer Hailu Mergia becomes a slinky piece of horn-led funk, complete with woozy slide guitar; a pulsating piece of Afrobeat by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/01/orchestre-poly-rythmo-review-venue-london-west-africa-finest-bands-new-album">Benin’s Orchestre Poly-Rythmo</a> features an ecstatic free-jazz freakout by tenorist Per “Texas” Johansson; a hymnal reading of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/12/panda-bear-review-moma-ps1-boiler-room-sessions">Panda Bear’</a>s You Can Count On Me<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jan/12/panda-bear-review-moma-ps1-boiler-room-sessions"> </a>comes wreathed in shards of astral jazz. Like all of Kajfeš’s covers albums, researching the source material will send you down some very rewarding wormholes.</p>
