<div class="block-elements">    <p><strong>The rise of weight loss drugs could dampen demand for cocoa, analysts at Rabobank have predicted in a new report.</strong></p> <p>Rabobank believe cocoa prices will go through a bumpy ride in the coming year, having soared in 2024, before dropping in early 2025 and then recovering in recent weeks.</p> <p>This turbulence has led to a fall in cocoa consumption this year, they say, as elevated cocoa prices will lead to higher retail prices. Manufacturers have also employed “shrinkflation and skimpflation strategies” – shrinking their chocolate products or putting less cocoa into them.</p> <p><strong>Oran van Dort</strong>, commodity analyst for <strong>RaboResearch</strong>, says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p> “As a result, familiar chocolate products may become smaller and more expensive, with innovations focusing on minimizing cocoa use. Ingredients like wafers, nuts, dairy, cocoa butter equivalents, and sugar will become more prevalent, altering the consumer experience and potentially reducing chocolate’s presence in supermarket aisles.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Rabobank also suggests that a health-conscious consumer environment and increased use of weight-loss drugs also contribute to reduced demand.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-682f30788f0825240426796d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-22T14:12:07.163Z">3.12pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>As flagged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/may/22/uk-government-borrowing-jumps-april-rachel-reeves-bonds-inflation-economy-business-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-682f0a938f087ffe2e77229b#block-682f0a938f087ffe2e77229b">earlier</a>, <strong>Manchester</strong> <strong>United’s</strong> share price has taken a tumble (-8%) as investors react to last night’s Europa League defeat…</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/KieranMaguire/status/1925547481493807380">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Last night’s result has hit Manchester United’s share price reducing the market value of the club by $170m as price ⬇️7% <a href="https://t.co/2jBQS4ifLj">pic.twitter.com/2jBQS4ifLj</a></p>&mdash;

The good news was that borrowing in the 24/25 fiscal year was revised down to £148.3bn, meaning the overshoot compared to the OBR forecast was £11bn. With the public finances in a pretty dire state going into what is likely to be a much tougher Q2 and second half of the year for the economy, some fiscal consolidation in October, probably in the form of higher taxes, looks likely.</p> <p>“On the details, total government receipts rose by £5.1bn compared to April 2024 with the increase in NICs meant that compulsory social payments rose by £1.7bn. At the same time, expenditure rose by £4.2bn as inflation and pay rises raised pressure on government spending.</p> <p>“Looking ahead to the budget in October, the persistent over borrowing and under performance of the economy means some sort of fiscal consolidation is starting to look inevitable. Given the recent indications that there will be some sort of a U-turn on the cuts to winter fuel payments and the difficulty the government has had in getting even tiny reductions in welfare spending through parliament, it feels like any fiscal consolidation will come from higher taxes rather lower spending. Indeed, we expect a combination of higher taxes and slightly higher borrowing at the next budget.</p> <p>“The good news is that with interest rates likely to be around 4% at the time of the budget there is plenty of scope for the Bank of England to cut rates to offset the impact of any fiscal consolidation on the economy.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-682ee1008f080e3226b5957d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-22T08:49:11.044Z">9.49am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK private sector shrinking in May as firms cut jobs</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Britain’s private sector is shrinking for the second month running as factory output falls at the fastest rate in a year and a half, a new survey shows.</strong></p> <p>The latest poll of purchasing managers at UK companies found that private sector output is decreasing in May, although at a slower rate than in April.</p> <p>Manufacturing production fell at the fastest rate since October 2023, although this was moderated by a “fractional rise” in service sector output.</p> <p>UK firms reported that clients were cautious this month, due to business uncertainty, leading to a drop in new orders.
