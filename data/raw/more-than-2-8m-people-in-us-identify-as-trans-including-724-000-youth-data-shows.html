<p>More than 2.8 million people now identify as transgender in the US, including an estimated 724,000 youth, according to a new data analysis that is the largest of its kind to date.</p> <p>Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Williams Institute used federal surveys and data from state health agencies to identify the size and demographics of the trans population in each state.</p> <p>The analysis, shared with the Guardian and <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/">released on Wednesday</a>, documented thousands of trans youth living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The findings counter Donald Trump’s aggressive efforts to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/states-sue-trump-administration-transgender-youth-healthcare">deny the existence</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/11/trans-youth-california-care-trump">trans minors</a>, as his administration <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/03/trump-anti-trans-executive-orders/">removes</a> references to trans people across federal agencies and widely erodes protections and programs for LGBTQ+ communities.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/12/black-trans-travel-fund-trump-attacks">‘Changing lives’: Black Trans Travel Fund pushes forward amid Trump’s anti-trans attacks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The report builds on federal data collection efforts that the White House is now eliminating. The authors warn their study could be the last comprehensive portrait of the nation’s trans population for a decade or more as trans people are erased from vital US surveys, including <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/25/cdc-will-no-longer-process-transgender-data/">health reports</a> and <a href="https://justdetention.org/trump-doj-erases-trans-people-from-crime-data-surveys/">crime data analyses</a>.</p> <p>The Williams Institute primarily relied on data from 2021 to 2023 from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveys and records disclosed by state health agencies. Some of the key findings include:</p> <ul> <li><p>1% of the total US population ages 13 and older identifies as trans, including 0.8% of adults (more than 2.1 million people) and 3.3% of youth ages 13 to 17 (roughly 724,000 people).</p></li> <li><p>Young adults ages 18 to 24 are significantly more likely to identify as trans (2.72%) than those 35 to 64 (0.42%) and those 65 and older (0.26%).</p></li> <li><p>Of the 2.1 million trans adults, 32.7% (698,500) are trans women, 34.2% (730,500) are trans men and 33.1% (707,100) are trans non-binary people.</p></li> <li><p>The trans populations are fairly consistent across regions, with 0.9% of adults in the west, midwest and north-east identifying as trans, compared with 0.7% of adults in the south.</p></li> <li><p>Minnesota had the highest rate of adults who identify as trans (1.2%), and Hawaii had the highest rate of trans youth (3.6%), though the ranges were similar across states.</p></li> </ul> <p>“Trans people live everywhere and are represented in every state,” said Dr Jody Herman, senior scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute and co-author of the report, noting the total US trans population was greater than the individual populations of more than a dozen states. “This is a substantial population that has unique concerns and barriers to getting their needs met, and lawmakers need to keep that in mind.”</p> <p>The Williams Institute, a leading LGBTQ+ policy research center, has published national trans population counts <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/How-Many-People-LGBT-Apr-2011.pdf">since its 2011 report</a>, which was the first of its kind as state-level data on gender identity became available. The estimates are considered the best available data and were <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-477_2cp3.pdf">cited</a> by the US supreme court in its recent majority opinion upholding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/18/tennessee-supreme-court-gender-affirming-care-skrmetti">Tennessee’s ban on trans youth healthcare</a>.</p> <p>The quality and sources of the researchers’ data have improved from one report to the next, the researchers said, making it difficult to assess changes over time. But the researchers noted that the overall estimates of trans adults have remained relatively steady, while the latest data shows how younger people are now significantly more likely to identify as trans than older groups.</p> <p>There are many factors contributing to youth identifying as trans at higher rates, including that younger people are more likely to answer these kinds of survey questions, said Dr Andrew Flores, Williams Institute distinguished visiting scholar and associate professor of government at American University.</p> <p>“Younger people are growing up among other younger people who already hold more accepting attitudes toward LGBT and transgender people more broadly,” said Flores, a report co-author, citing increasingly visible signs of support, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/nov/28/florida-students-protest-trans-athletes-monarch-high-school">student walkouts in Florida</a> in protest of anti-trans policies. “In this generation, they might be more willing and safe to identify that they are transgender, because they don’t see as much of a harm or threat as older generations.”</p> <p>While some conservatives and anti-trans advocates have presented a reported rise in trans youth as a “<a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/21888/Study-finds-no-evidence-of-social-contagion-among?autologincheck=redirected">social contagion</a>”, suggesting youth are copying their peers, “the growth comes as people are now in an environment that allows them to fully express who they are,” Flores said.</p> <p>Shifting language also affects generational differences, he said, noting how older groups were more likely to identify as lesbian or gay while younger people are more likely to identify as bisexual or pansexual. And while older trans people are more likely to identify as men or women, younger trans people more frequently identify as non-binary.</p> <p>The report also found that the race and ethnicity of trans people was largely similar to broader US demographics, with Indigenous, Latino and multiracial adults slightly more likely to identify as trans than other groups.</p> <p>The Trump administration, which has widely <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/12/donald-trump-government-statistics-00505923">attacked</a> data collection efforts across government, has moved to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/25/cdc-will-no-longer-process-transgender-data/">remove trans identity questions</a> from two critical CDC behavioral health surveys and from Department of Justice <a href="https://theappeal.org/trump-doj-erases-trans-people-from-crime-data-surveys/">surveys</a> on crime victimization and sexual violence. The US Census Bureau has also taken steps to exclude gender identity from multiple surveys, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/21/nx-s1-5305265/census-lgbtq-sogi-data-robert-santos">according to the former director</a> who resigned in February.</p> <p>Those efforts followed Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-order-gender-sex">day-one executive order</a> “restoring biological truth” to the government, which suggested that trans identity was “false” and directed the state department to deny trans people <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/07/transgender-passport-state-department/">accurate passports</a>.</p> <p>The data loss will make it impossible for the Williams Institute to continue its analyses in their current form, and even if the next administration restored the surveys, the public would still be losing up to 10 years of data, which would be a devastating erosion of knowledge, the researchers said.</p> <p>“We didn’t really have decent national data until around 10 years ago, so we just very recently got a grasp on how many people identify as trans in the US and what their characteristics are,” said Herman. “For these data sources to just suddenly disappear, it is a major setback. The population is not going to go away; we’re just not going to know more about them than what we have from our current sources.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/trevor-project-lgbtq-youth-suicide-lifeline-trump">Trump cuts shut down an LGBTQ+ youth suicide lifeline. What happens now?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The data has frequently been cited by journalists, school boards, public health experts, civil rights lawyers, advocates fighting discriminatory legislation and lawmakers expanding trans rights. The researchers had hoped federal data could help illuminate how trans people were moving within the US as some have <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/trans-moving-press-release/">fled red states</a> due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/24/missouri-trans-youth-anti-lgbtq-bills">anti-trans laws</a>, but that will be hard to track without national surveys, they said.</p> <p>“In some policy circles, they say if you can’t be counted, you don’t count,” Flores added. “And for members of the LGBTQ+ community, to be able to see numbers that reflect their lived experiences is quite important.”</p> <p>Imara Jones, founder of news organization TransLash Media, said there was no easy fix for the loss of national data backed by federal resources. </p> <p>“It is meant to erase, and that erasure is meant to have real-world impacts, making it harder for people to be who they are,” Jones said.</p> <p>Flores said the institute and others were discussing ways to fill the gaps and continue data collection without the federal government: “We’re not just going to close up shop. We’re going to try to find a way to keep telling these stories and be persistent.”</p>
