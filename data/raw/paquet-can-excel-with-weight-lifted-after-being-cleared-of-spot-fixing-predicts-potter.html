<p>Graham Potter has said a weight was lifted off Lucas Paquetá’s shoulders when the West Ham midfielder was cleared of spot-fixing after a two-year Football Association process.</p> <p>Paquetá was at risk of a lengthy ban after the FA charged him last year with four counts of deliberately getting booked to influence betting markets so that friends and family members may benefit. The investigation came to light in August 2023, ending the Brazilian’s hopes of joining Manchester City that month, and had the potential to end the 27-year-old’s career.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/15/premier-league-2025-26-preview-no-19-west-ham-united">Premier League 2025-26 preview No 19: West Ham United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Confirmation of a regulatory commission finding the case against Paquetá to be not proved <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/31/west-hams-lucas-paqueta-cleared-of-spot-fixing-charges-brought-by-fa">arrived last month</a>. The Brazil international, who joined West Ham for £51m three years ago, has gone on to perform well <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/10/premier-league-fans-previews-our-club-by-club-guide-to-2025-26">in pre-season</a> and Potter senses that the former Lyon player’s mood has been lifted by no longer being under suspicion.</p> <p>“I think he’s done really well,” West Ham’s head coach said. “Admirable in terms of how he dealt with the situation. Like any human being there are good days and bad. But he’s managed to stay relatively consistent throughout it all. I think there’s a weight lifted off him. He’s been fighting for his career, essentially. When that’s away, then you get a lighter version.”</p> <p>It is unsurprising that Paquetá’s performances dipped after he was charged. He looked unfocused at times and was dropped at the end of last season. His talent is not in doubt though, and Potter is pleased to have him available. West Ham have no intention of selling Paquetá.</p> <p>“We’re delighted to have him,” Potter said. “We’re delighted that what’s been hanging over him has been cleared. It’s been an incredible test for him and the support he’s had from his family and from his teammates and from the club has been incredible. I’m sure he’ll say the same. But for Lucas it’s been a tough time.</p> <p>“He’s a player that we understand, we love, his quality is incredible. Our challenge is to help him bring that out to the best of his ability, to fit with what we’re trying to do. If we can do that he’s a massive asset for us.”</p> <p>West Ham, who open with a trip to Sunderland on Saturday afternoon, have made four signings and are looking to buy two midfielders. They are reluctant to return with an improved offer for Southampton’s Mateus Fernandes, whose £60m valuation is deemed unrealistic.</p> <p>Potter is not working with a big budget and stressed the need to remain compliant with profitability and sustainability regulations but insisted West Ham were capable of playing exciting football even if they do not add more energy and creativity in midfield.</p>
