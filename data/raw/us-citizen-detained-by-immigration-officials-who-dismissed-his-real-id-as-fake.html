<p>Authorities wrestled a US-born citizen to the ground, cuffed him and dismissed his so-called Real ID as “fake” during an arrest operation targeting undocumented people on Wednesday under the direction of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>, according to a viral video and reporting by Telemundo.</p> <p>Leonardo Garcia Venegas, 25, was at his construction job in Foley, Alabama, when officials arrived to arrest workers there. Garcia Venegas – who was born in Florida to Mexican parents – began filming the arrests with his mobile phone before officials reportedly knocked the device out of his hand and tried to arrest him as well.</p> <p>Video of the arrest shows three officials wrestling him to the ground, while he yells: “I’m a citizen!”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/23/trump-administration-ms-13-leaders-criminal-charges-deportation">Trump administration trying to dismiss MS-13 leader’s charges to deport him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to an interview with the Spanish-language US news outlet <a href="https://www.telemundo.com/noticias/noticias-telemundo-en-la-noche/inmigracion/video/empleado-de-la-construccion-estadounidense-narra-como-ice-lo-arresto-en-su-sitio-de-tmvo12932038">Telemundo</a>, officials took out his wallet, removed his ID – which complies with higher federal security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses as well as identification – and told him that it was fake.</p> <p>“They cuffed me,” he said. “They put the cuffs on quite hard.”</p> <p>Four people at the job site were arrested, including Garcia Venegas’s brother, who is undocumented.</p> <p>Officials removed the cuffs from Garcia Venegas hours later – after he gave them his social security number, verifying his US citizenship.</p> <p>“I feel really sad, honestly, and I feel a bit nervous for everything that’s happening,” said Garcia Venegas, referring to the Trump administration’s ongoing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a>-related crackdown.</p> <p>His cousin, also a US citizen, told Telemundo they both went through the process of acquiring the Real ID, undergoing “the protocols the administration is asking for”.</p> <p>“I feel sad because, even though we were born here, that doesn’t matter any more,” the cousin said. She added: “To have our skin color has, apparently, become a crime. And it has become a crime deserving of this type of treatment –&nbsp;as if we were real criminals.”</p> <p>In a statement to NBC News, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused Garcia Venegas of having “interfered” with the arrest during the operation.</p> <p>“Anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including US citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest,” the DHS’s statement to NBC said.</p> <p>It is unclear whether the officials who cuffed Garcia Venegas were local officials, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents or other members of federal law enforcement.</p> <p>Since Trump came into office, various federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and others, have been tasked with carrying out immigration enforcement operations. Some local police and sheriff’s departments have also been deputized to carry out federal immigration arrests.</p> <p>As the White House attempts to carry out a promise of “mass deportations” that vaulted Donald Trump to victory in November’s presidential election, a number of US citizens have been caught up in its dragnet.</p> <p>Some, such as Garcia Venegas, have been detained by officials, then released. But others, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/04/26/us-citizen-children-deported-ice/">including children</a>, have been deported.</p> <p>Although rare, the deportation of US citizens has also happened during prior administrations.</p>
