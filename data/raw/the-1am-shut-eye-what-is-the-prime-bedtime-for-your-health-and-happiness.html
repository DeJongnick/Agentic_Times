<p><strong>Name</strong>: Bedtime.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Bedtimes vary depending on how old you are, so if you’re a newborn …</p> <p><strong>A very clever, early-developing, Guardian-reading newborn</strong><strong>. </strong>If you <em>were</em> a newborn, you wouldn’t really have a bedtime; you’d sleep in bursts of a couple of hours, night and day.</p> <p><strong>They do need a lot of rest.</strong> But this is about adults – and a new study.</p> <p><strong>I was waiting for that, the new study. Go on.</strong> A survey of 2,000 Americans, conducted for a mattress company, found that the average time people fall asleep is 11.18pm.</p> <p><strong>Seems quite late</strong><strong>.</strong> For those who stayed up later than they planned, 29% said they were kept up by chores. But 21% said they stayed up because night was their favourite time of day. Anyway, the average American begins their going-to-bed routine at 10.15pm.</p> <p><strong>How long does that take?</strong> Twenty-one minutes. They’re tucked up by 10.36pm. Then it takes them 42 minutes to nod off, on average.</p> <p><strong>What are they doing? Reading? Scrolling? Tantric sex?</strong> The survey is about bedtimes, not what goes on in them.</p> <p><strong>And is there a prime time to go to bed?</strong> Good question.</p> <p><strong>Thank you.</strong> Research from 2021 suggests that going to sleep between 10pm and 11pm is linked to a lower risk of heart disease.</p> <p><strong>Better research than the </strong><strong>mattress-company </strong><strong>survey?</strong> More scientific, certainly, using data from more than 88,000 participants aged 43 to 74, published in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ehjdh/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ehjdh/ztab088/6423198#312273424">European Heart Journal</a>. But even so, as the <a href="https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/news/behind-the-headlines/sleep-time-and-heart-disease">British Heart Foundation points out,</a> it doesn’t prove cause and effect, just shows an association.</p> <p><strong>What else you got? </strong>A study from last year by researchers at Stanford University, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178124002415">published in Psychiatry Research</a>, which analysed the sleep patterns of nearly 74,000 adults.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/14/terrible-nights-sleep-heres-how-to-make-it-through-the-day-and-maybe-even-enjoy-it-one-step-at-a-time">Terrible night’s sleep? Here’s how to make it through the day – and maybe even enjoy it – one step at a time</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Sounds legit.</strong> It found that staying awake too late can be bad for your mental health.</p> <p><strong>What time? I need a time.</strong> They recommend lights out by 1am.</p> <p><strong>What!</strong> Too late? Then do what the twentysomethings are doing, apparently.</p> <p><strong>Which is?</strong> Going to bed at 9 o’clock.</p> <p><strong>What! How long are they staying there?</strong> Asleep? Nine hours and 28 minutes, on average. That was from analysis in 2022, up from eight hours and 47 minutes in 2010. It’s probably about 12 hours now.</p> <p><strong>No partying?</strong> A 19-year-old told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/wellness/early-sleep-bedtime-6ecd1d67">Wall Street Journal</a>: “Nothing good happens after 9pm.”</p> <p><strong>Generation Zzzzzzz. </strong>Of course, that might all change when they get a job … on the night shift.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Early to bed and early to rise makes a zoomer healthy, wealthy and wise.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Elon Musk tweets all night and he’s doing OK.”</p>
