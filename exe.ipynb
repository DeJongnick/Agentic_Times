       "[{'europe-s-farming-lobbies-recognise-need-to-eat-less-meat-in-shared-vision-report.html': '<h1>Europe’s farming lobbies recognise need to eat less meat in shared vision report</h1>\\n<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2024-09-04T11:19:05Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Ajit Niranjan &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Environment</div>\\n<p>Europe’s food and farming lobbies have recognised the need to eat less meat after hammering out a shared vision for the future of agriculture with green groups and other stakeholders.</p> <p>The wide-ranging report calls for “urgent, ambitious and feasible” change in farm and food systems and acknowledges that Europeans eat more animal protein than scientists recommend. It says support is needed to rebalance diets toward plant-based proteins such as better education, stricter marketing and voluntary buyouts of farms in regions that intensively rear livestock.</p> <p>The stakeholders also agreed on the need for a major rethink of subsidies, calling for a “just transition fund” to help farmers adopt sustainable practices, and targeted financial support to those who need it most.</p> <p>The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who commissioned the report to quell furious farmer protests at the start of the year, said the results would feed into a planned vision for agriculture that she will present in the first 100 days of her new mandate.</p> <p>“We share the same goal,” said Von der Leyen. “Only if farmers can live off their land will they invest in more sustainable practices. And only if we achieve our climate and environmental goals together will farmers be able to continue making a living.”</p> <p>Animal agriculture is one of the biggest drivers of climate breakdown and the destruction of natural habitats, but European leaders have made little effort to steer diets heavy in meat and milk to whole grains and plant-based sources of protein. The report did not set targets for meat production, such as culling herds, but called for support to help shift dietary habits, such as free school meals, more detailed labels, and tax reductions on healthy and sustainable food products.</p> <p>Agustín Reyna, the director general of the consumer group BEUC, said it wished the report’s recommendations on livestock and animal welfare were bolder but praised the overall vision as well-crafted and balanced. “Consumers are willing to play their part in the transition, yet they need a hand,” he said.</p> <p>Copa and Cogeca, the biggest farming lobby in Brussels, appeared to question the findings around meat after publication of the report. It called for “swift and coherent actions” but asked for “vigilance” on the place of livestock farming.</p> <p>The European Council of Young Farmers said the report did not always align with its narrative but praised the outcome of the dialogue as a welcome contrast from the atmosphere during the previous mandate and a solid basis for future work. “We are moving away from a methodology of defining objectives as high as possible for farmers to align with, to actually making steps into the transition in a collective and strategic way,” said its president, Peter Meedendorf.</p> <p>The final report of the strategic dialogue on the future of EU agriculture, which was put together after seven months of negotiations, concluded with 16-hour days in Brussels last week as two dozen stakeholders went through the text line by line to sketch out a common vision. Its mandate was to enable conditions that let farming and nature protection go hand in hand.</p> <p>Peter Strohschneider, who chaired the report and oversaw a similar process in Germany in 2021, said: “To put it bluntly, things have developed in such a way that all too often agricultural production and its natural preconditions have become entangled in a lose-lose constellation.”</p> <p>The recommendations include reform of the common agriculture policy (CAP) subsidies, which makes up one-third of the EU’s entire budget and hands out money to farmers based on the size of their farm rather than their need for support.</p> <p>Green groups and some scientists have criticised the scheme for prioritising meat production and incentivising environmental harm. In April, a study in the journal Nature Food <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/01/eu-four-times-more-money-farming-animals-than-growing-plants-cap-subsidy\">found</a> that the EU had made polluting diets “artificially cheap” by pumping four times more money into farming animals than growing plants.</p> <p>Ariel Brunner, the director of Birdlife Europe, said it was encouraging to see that the farm lobby supported the need for change in the sector. “This is a victory for our farmers, our environment, and our future – if politicians will have the courage and integrity to act on it.”</p> <p>The recommendations for reducing greenhouse gas pollution within farming focus on technological solutions such as new feed and better management of manure. The report also called on policymakers to define the agri-food sector as a “critical entity”, increase financial support for the sector and give it preferential treatment.</p> <p>Scientists have criticised the political debate around farming and nature – which accompanied sometimes violent protests in European capitals – for being riddled with misinformation.</p> <p>Marco Contiero, who leads agriculture policy at Greenpeace, said the negotiations started off “very polarised” but led to constructive engagement from almost all parties. He added: “If we are taken out of the usual state of confrontation – and unbalanced, unfounded statements – we see that we can agree on a large number of issues.”</p>'},\n",

Right outside his house is an 800 square metre plot with all sorts of produce – apples, pears, peppers, basil, beets and cauliflower, to name a few. During the winter months, he and his wife can pretty much survive off the vegetables stored in their freezer. Even after living in Oosterwold for a number of years, it’s something that still excites him.</p> <p>“Yesterday, I forgot to think about what to eat,” he says. “You walk through your garden and you find something and that’s what you eat.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ajlajournal.org/articles/almere-oosterwold-netherlands-a-dutch-utopia-in-the-making\">Oosterwold</a>, where de Kat has lived since 2017, is a 4,300 hectare (10,625 acre) urban experiment located east of Amsterdam, in a suburb of the city of Almere, where de Kat works as a municipal councillor. First visualised about a decade ago by a local network, it was established by local government and Oosterwold planners as a way to challenge the rigidity of Dutch city planning, giving people more freedom – and responsibility – over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/dec/15/almere-dutch-city-alternative-housing-custom-build\">urban design</a> process.</p> <p>The area, which has about 5,000 residents and a growing waiting list, is completely self-sufficient. Residents can build houses however they like, and must collaborate with others to figure out things such as street names, waste management, roads, and even schools. But the local government has included one extremely unusual requirement: about half of each plot must be devoted to urban agriculture.</p>    <p>“This rule – if you want to live in Oosterwold, you have to produce food on at least 50% of your property – is very unique thinking in the world, and makes it also an outstanding area in many ways,” says Jan Eelco Jansma, a researcher at Wageningen University &amp; Research, who <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837722001314#bbib24\">has studied</a> Almere for years and inspired the city to include urban agriculture in the planning of Oosterwold.</p> <p>Rositsa T Ilieva, the director of policy at the City University of New York’s Urban Food Policy Institute, also highlighted its novelty. “While other cities have integrated urban agriculture into planning, few have implemented it as a non-negotiable land-use requirement or handed so much responsibility for development to residents,” she said.</p> <p>Residents can be quite creative with the brief. Oosterwold, which has about 1,000 residential units, is a sprawl of all sorts of gardens, from greenhouses to pastures surrounded by moats. “Nobody is doing it in the same way,” de Kat says. “You have to find your own recipe.”</p> <p>Some, like de Kat, have turned their gardens into an Eden of sorts to provide for their own household unit. Other residents just plant a few apple trees or outsource by owning plots of land on site that are tended to by professional farmers. </p> <p>Others, such as Jalil Bekkour, have been able to capitalise on it. “I never had experience gardening my own food or anything like that,” he said. But he taught himself how to garden, and three years ago he <a href=\"https://atelierfeddan.com/\">opened his own restaurant</a>, Atelier Feddan, where 80% of the food is directly from Oosterwold. His newfound excitement for gardening and agriculture is palpable: he regards his garden as a “field lab” of sorts to help develop products for the restaurant.</p> <p>While the climate crisis threatens the area, it can also provide ample opportunity. As Bekkour explains, Oosterwold now has the same climate France had 40 years ago. Because of this, food crops such as avocados and citrus trees can easily be grown outside rather than in a greenhouse.</p> <p>Time is a constraint, as perfecting a plot takes extra care. “You fail and you try again,” Bekkour says.</p> <p>Residents also worry about the fact there is no real guidance about how to make your plot successful. “In the planning, it was kind of a bit laissez-faire,” says Jansma. “But if you want to develop such a new area in such an innovative way and at such a scale, you have to share responsibilities.”</p> <p>A new centre called the Food Hub has now opened, devoted to collecting and processing food as well as knowledge sharing. The centre is run by the Almere local authority as well as the Oosterwold food cooperative. Yolanda Sikking, the participation manager for Oosterwold, hopes it will help inspire residents to take more initiative.</p> <p>“Some people do it very well but others don’t,” she says. “We decided we have to stimulate more.”</p>    <p>The eventual goal is to provide 10% of Almere’s food, which many see as ambitious but hopefully doable in time.</p> <p>Residents and experts alike also emphasise the potential for replicability. “Some of the things that we do could be implemented in other places in the Netherlands and beyond,” says Jan-Albert Blaauw, a resident of Oosterwold and founder of the city’s food cooperative.</p> <p>“There are a lot of examples around the world where planners think about urban agriculture, but in fact still separate agriculture and urbanisation by developing agroparks or sites where agriculture can do what it does normally and prevent an encroachment in these areas,” he says. “But it still is excluding agriculture.”</p> <p>Ilieva believes that the participatory principles behind the Oosterwold plan and its implementation and local food production are widely applicable. “By prioritising agriculture as a land use, planners and residents together can work to reconfigure peri-urban spaces marked for residential development into vibrant, multifunctional areas that advance ecological, social, and economic goals,” she says.</p> <p>Lessons can be learned from other projects as well. Jason Hawes co-authored a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44284-023-00023-3\">2024 study</a> that found carbon emissions from urban agriculture can be higher than from conventional agriculture. While the study did not evaluate a community like Oosterwold, there were some relevant ideas to be gleaned from it.</p> <p>Hawes says: “For example, we found that infrastructure installed early in the farm-garden setup was a particularly important contributor to the carbon footprint of fruits and vegetables grown there, so it can be useful to prioritise long-term use of infrastructure as well as finding reclaimed or reused materials to support the initial construction.”</p>    <p>And it doesn’t necessarily have to start on as large a scale as Oosterwold did. “The first thing I tell people is to start small,” Bekkour says. “Start with the things you love to eat and the easy stuff.”</p> <p>De Kat says: “You can do this with a strong vision and strong person.” </p> <p>• This article was amended on 29 November 2024 to clarify that Oosterwold is east of Amsterdam, not “in the north-east of the Netherlands”, as a previous version said.</p>'},\n",
       " {'i-grew-up-on-american-food-trust-me-it-s-the-last-thing-europe-needs.html': '<h1>I grew up on American food. Trust me, it’s the last thing Europe needs</h1>\\n<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-06-20T04:00:24Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Alexander Hurst &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Opinion</div>\\n<p>All over European media, the take seems to be similar – that the EU is “<a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/china-uk-trade-deals-with-trump-pile-pressure-on-eu/a-72889691\">under pressure</a>” to conclude some sort of deal with the US in order to avoid Donald Trump’s 9 July deadline for the unilateral imposition of broad tariffs. What might be on the table in the attempt to secure that? In early May, the EU trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, was already suggesting that a deal to increase purchases from the US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d7c7a07-1232-4115-9dca-e99bb068c879\">could include</a> agricultural products – a possibility that <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/can-eu-secure-a-us-trade-pact-despite-trumps-new-tariff-threat/a-72543513\">seems to remain</a> even though Šefčovič later clarified that the EU was <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/21/eu-standards-on-food-are-not-up-for-negotiation-eu-trade-commissioner-sefcovic-tells-euron\">not contemplating</a> changing its health or safety standards.</p> <p>Since I have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/11/the-big-lesson-for-europe-trump-backed-down-under-pressure\">failed to Abba</a> (“Always be boldly acronyming”) and don’t have anything as good as Taco (“Trump always chickens out”) – coined by the Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong – at the ready, I’ll simply reach for the easy line: opening the door even slightly to more US food imports into the EU would leave a bad taste in all our mouths. Trump’s hostage-taking approach to trade should not be rewarded, certainly not with something that hits as close to home as food does.</p> <p>“The European Union won’t take chicken from America. They won’t take lobsters from America. They hate our beef because our beef is beautiful and theirs is weak,” declared the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, in April.<strong> </strong>Laughter aside, every time I go back to the US I become a vegetarian for the duration of my trip – even though US grocery store vegetables are themselves generally <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/2/12/10972140/fruits-vegetables-taste-better-europe\">big, blemish-free and bland</a>. Why? Call me paranoid, but I simply don’t want to ingest the same <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-024-00727-1\">growth hormones</a> that Lutnick’s “beautiful” meat probably contains traces of and that are banned in the EU.</p> <p>Growing up in Ohio, I experienced the full force of US food culture. It was the 90s, which meant that margarine was most definitely in and butter was out; an example that highlights how processed <em>everything</em> took root, including – in my vegetarian family – highly processed meat alternatives. The people around me meant well, but how do you fight a system that, from top to bottom, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/07/18/486051480/we-subsidize-crops-we-should-eat-less-of-does-this-fatten-us-up\">was designed</a> to push <a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-high-fructose-corn-syrup\">high fructose corn syrup</a> into practically everything (and most worryingly into school lunches)?</p> <p>To be fair, all of this has since generated a domestic backlash, but there’s an intense amount of momentum behind it still: almost without fail, I find that the standard sugar level in the US soars <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-fao-agricultural-outlook-2023-2032_08801ab7-en/full-report/sugar_f99ea815.html#chapter-d1e21827-8178d4e884\">far beyond</a> what I now find appealing. Even in places I wouldn’t expect to find added sugar at all, like pizza.</p> <p>And why would the Trump administration’s full-scale savaging of the US government’s administrative and regulatory capacity, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/how-does-us-food-safety-work-what-cuts-has-trump-made-2025-05-07/\">including the Food and Drug Administration</a>, increase anyone’s trust that what US regulation does exist is actually being followed?</p> <p>Some of you are perhaps rolling your eyes, thinking: Alexander Hurst, a naturalised French citizen, has gone full “chauvin”; converts are the worst. Except it’s not just me. There is an entire internet subgenre of content extolling the virtues of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bonappetitmag/video/7416391454450322730?lang=en\">French butter</a>, or involving Americans who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ipwkLWggUE\">come to France and realise</a> that <em>this</em> is what peaches, or strawberries, really taste like.</p> <p>Beyond the question of whether or not Europeans <em>want</em> to eat US agricultural output, a hypothetical trade deal would involve hugely negative climate impacts. The distance that food travels <a href=\"https://environment.ec.europa.eu/news/field-fork-global-food-miles-generate-nearly-20-all-co2-emissions-food-2023-01-25_en\">already accounts for 20%</a> of global agriculture-related emissions pollution, and <a href=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/09/20/European-imports-behind-much-of-world-s-food-production-emissions-reveal-new-data/\">Europe’s share</a> in imported agriculture emissions is already high. We need to be reducing it, not adding to it through foodstuffs carted unnecessarily across the Atlantic.</p> <p>How can we ask European farmers to accelerate their transition to regenerative agriculture (which offers the potential to <a href=\"https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-04538542v1/document\">drastically reduce</a> agriculture emissions) if, at the same time, they are being undercut by US producers who face far lower regulatory standards?</p> <p>“Europe already produces and grows everything it could possibly need. The last thing we want to see circulating is hormone-pumped beef or chlorinated poultry,” says Lindsey Tramuta, the author of <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/24170569/paris-restaurant-guide\">The Eater Guide to Paris</a>. “Even beyond the goods themselves, there’s the issue of distance: why bring food over from the US if Europeans can get their needs met from much closer to home?”</p> <p>Yannick Huang, who manages the Vietnamese restaurant Loan in Paris’s Belleville neighbourhood, agrees. “At a time when we’re trying to do organic, local, it’s pointless to want to import anything from the US,” he told me. Huang, who is obsessive about ingredient quality, only serves French beef. To him, US agriculture comes tainted with the connotation of “GMOs and other problems”.</p> <p>Hold on, you might say. Isn’t it inconsistent to oppose Trump’s tariffs while also promoting food protectionism? Fair point: it’s hard to find a “one size fits all” approach to globalisation. It has harmed some workers in wealthy economies while also <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization\">reducing the gap</a> between low-income nations and high-income ones. No country on Earth has a fully self-contained advanced semiconductor manufacturing supply chain, and in sectors where globalisation has become excessive, it might be even more <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/2024/why-trumps-tariff-proposals-would-harm-working-americans\">economically harmful</a> to roll back. None of that, though, means that things that have resisted becoming fully global should all of a sudden be opened up – food most of all.</p> <p>Ramzi Saadé is a Lebanese-Canadian chef whose Paris restaurant, Atica, is dedicated to a <a href=\"https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/1435617/atica-une-experience-artistique-et-culinaire-parisienne-signee-ramzi-saade.html\">fiercely regional approach</a> to haute cuisine. But taking his diners on a voyage of discovery doesn’t mean his food has to go on one too; despite focusing on first Basque, and now Corsican cuisine, he sources almost all of his ingredients from the area surrounding Paris. For a lamb dish involving 13 different elements, only the nepeta, a Corsican herb, had travelled, he said. “Is my role today to bring you Japanese culture via wasabi flown to Paris?” Saadé asked. “No, my role is to explain to you that it’s grated this way and put on fish for this reason, and I can do that with wasabi from France.” </p> <p>I couldn’t help but think that it’s actually far more interesting to do it his way – to interpret a cuisine rather than attempt to transpose it.</p> <p>We are what we eat. A cuisine is a medium of communication; it is, indelibly, tied up with the stories we tell about who we are. Perhaps that’s why it’s so disturbing to see food held hostage, or weaponised, in the pursuit of economic or geostrategic goals.</p> <p>Europe’s intense and varied regionality is an enormous part of how it eats and therefore what it is. Opening the market to mass penetration by US agriculture would, little by little, nibble away at that richness. It’s the kind of proposition that, if it ever makes it out of the kitchen, should be sent back straight away.</p> <ul> <li><p>Alexander Hurst is a Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> columnist</p></li> </ul>'},\n",
       " {'down-and-dirty-how-regenerative-farming-is-digging-into-microscopic-soil-life.html': '<h1>Down and dirty: how regenerative farming is digging into microscopic soil life</h1>\\n<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-08-29T09:00:06Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Ben Martynoga &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Environment</div>\\n<p>Nick Padwick hunches over a microscope, examining a sample of compost he has made on his Norfolk farm. “Look at that bad boy! That’s a bacteria-feeding nematode!” he exclaims. “Stunning fungal hyphae.”</p> <p>Padwick, the farm manager at Wild Ken Hill since 2018, is part of a growing movement of farmers taking a deep interest in the microscopic life forms upon which their livelihoods depend. Under this approach to regenerative farming, nurturing diverse soil communities – from bacteria and fungi to microscopic animals and worms – is seen as an essential prerequisite for growing healthy foods with minimal or no use of agrochemicals or soil-damaging machinery.</p> <p>For Padwick, 59, this marks a dramatic shift after nearly four decades in conventional agriculture, the very systems that experts now blame for devastating soils worldwide. “I really have been a part of it,” he admits. “I cringe every time I think of it.”</p>    <p>The stakes could not be higher. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/09/more-than-a-third-of-uk-agricultural-soil-degraded-by-intensive-farming-report\">Recent estimates</a> say more than 60% of EU agricultural soils are degraded, with about 40% of UK soils similarly damaged. Globally, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/07/1123462\">says 90%</a> of the world’s topsoils could be at risk by 2050, a crisis intensified by accelerating global heating.</p> <p>All this has implications for not just food security but biodiversity, water quality, flood mitigation, climate resilience and greenhouse gas emissions. As Prof Richard Bardgett, a Lancaster University soil ecologist and author, puts it: “Few things matter more to humans than their relationship with the soil.”</p> <p>A key inspiration for Padwick’s mission to revive his land was Dr Elaine Ingham, a soil microbiologist. Through her Soil Food Web School (SFWS), he learned that a fully functional soil food web is needed to build structure, nourish plants and fight pests naturally. That web includes a vast array of bacteria, fungi, protists, and tiny animals such as nematodes and springtails.</p> <p>Ingham’s approach is based on three key actions:</p> <ol> <li><p>Use microscopy to identify missing or imbalanced soil organisms.</p></li> <li><p>Create nutrient-rich compost from farm waste, such as straw and wood chips.</p></li> <li><p>Put this compost in mesh bags and steep them in water, like giant teabags, to make extracts that can reintroduce beneficial microbes to depleted soils.</p></li> </ol> <p>Farmers must then adopt management practices that protect these newly introduced organisms, allowing them to thrive and multiply.</p> <p>Scientists broadly accept the value of diverse soil ecosystems. “Having worked on this topic for decades,” says Bardgett, “I would say a more complex soil food web can only be a good thing for plant growth and resilience.”</p> <p>His scepticism, however, centres not on the principle but the practice; specifically, whether organisms from dilute compost extracts actually survive and thrive when introduced to new soils.</p> <p>Prof Duncan Cameron, a soil biologist at the University of Manchester, said he shared those doubts initially. His Manchester colleague, Dr Janice Lake, an independent research fellow, has been testing the hypothesis that beneficial soil ecosystems can be transplanted from compost extracts into soils. She partnered with Daniel Tyrkiel, an SFWS graduate who founded the Soil Ecology Lab in Hampshire, which sells compost products and soil analysis and consultancy services to a growing network of regenerative farmers.</p> <p>Lake’s recent preliminary greenhouse tests yielded promising results, not yet published. Barley and wheat treated with Tyrkiel’s compost extracts outperformed control crops. Field-scale trials this year will measure not just yields but several soil health indicators.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This needs to be seen as a national security issue, every bit as much as dealing with Putin.</p> <footer> <cite>Duncan Cameron</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bardgett, however, warns against viewing compost extracts as a quick fix. “My own view would be that it’s better to change the soil environment first, to make it more amenable for the organisms already in the soil to actually flourish,” he says. Otherwise, “most [of them] will simply die.”</p> <p>Padwick has embraced this holistic approach. While he uses compost extracts, he recognises they are just one element in a comprehensive system overhaul. He minimises mechanical cultivation, which disrupts soil fungi and larger organisms; plants diverse cover crops to nourish soil biology year-round; and maintains unusually wide field margins for biodiversity. These wild areas harbour beneficial predators that control agricultural pests. <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038071724002803\">Recent evidence</a> suggests they can also help sustain vital mycorrhizal fungi networks.</p> <p>A critical challenge for many farms transitioning to regenerative farming is that yields can drop sharply, at least in the short term. After eliminating chemical inputs, Padwick’s wheat production plunged from more than 7 tonnes per hectare to 1.5 tonnes/ha, before rising again to more than 3 tonnes/ha. Yet his business remains profitable because his input costs have been slashed and he sells premium products under the Wildfarmed brand, launched by the Groove Armada musician turned farmer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/05/diverse-farming-climate-wildfarmed-groove-armada\">Andy Cato</a>. And he is convinced yields will continue to rise as soil health improves: “It’s going to be another five years before we really start seeing how things can change.”</p> <p>Perhaps the strongest evidence of the soil food web approach gaining traction is its adoption by G’s Fresh Ltd, an intensive horticulture company headquartered in Cambridgeshire. “We are set on transitioning to regenerative farming practices entirely across the organisation by 2030,” says the product director, Julius Joel.</p>    <p>G’s Fresh produces 1.2bn packs of salad annually, supplying two-thirds of the UK’s lettuce and celery demand as well as supermarkets across Europe. Its retail contracts demand consistently high-quality crops with precise delivery schedules. Yield reductions are not an option.</p> <p>“We want to have our cake and eat it,” Joel says. “We’re aiming to improve resilience, enhance water infiltration, cut input costs, reduce emissions and grow profits. We think regenerative agriculture is going to do positive things in all these areas.”</p>    <p>The soil food web approach has even reached large-scale dairy production. Yeo Valley, the UK’s largest organic dairy business, has incorporated key principles into its established system. The Soil Ecology Lab has undertaken microscopy and soil analysis, andseeds have been treated with compost extracts before drilling.</p> <p>“Putting biology and food right in the seed bed … it has really helped us with the establishment of roots,” says Will Mayor, the farms development manager. “That’s got to be a benefit, and particularly when you’re going into a tough season like this one … it can cope with weather extremes.”</p> <p>Although, he notes: “You can’t reinvent agriculture. There is science to it. You have to fertilise [the soil], you have to make sure it’s healthy, and you have to suppress weeds in order to grow crops.” </p> <p>This tension between cutting-edge practice and scientific validation is something Bardgett recognises. Many regenerative farming practitioners are “racing ahead of the actual evidence base”, he says. “In some ways this is a good thing, because farmers are actually just going ahead and doing stuff.” He emphasises that scientific research must catch up in order to inform policies that can effectively promote soil health.</p> <p>Cameron goes further. “The government needs to actually wake up and realise that … the money that they’ve thrown at [improving soil health] is not even a sticking plaster.” Rather than being seen as a tangential problem, he believes boosting soil health is “the absolute front and centre of battling climate change”.</p> <p>“This needs to be seen as a national security issue,” he says, “every bit as much as dealing with Putin.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 29 August 2025 to correctly attribute credit to Dr Janice Lake for research into soil ecosystems.</p>'}]"
