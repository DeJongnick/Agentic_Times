<p>US forces struck another alleged drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean, killing three people, defense secretary Pete Hegseth has said, bringing the death toll from the Trump administration’s controversial campaign to at least 70.</p> <p>The US began carrying out such strikes – which some experts say amount to extrajudicial killings even if they target known traffickers – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/trump-venezuela-boat-lethal-strike">in early September</a>, taking aim at vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.</p> <p>The US strikes have destroyed at least 18 vessels so far – 17 boats and a semi-submersible – but Washington has yet to make public any concrete evidence that its targets were smuggling narcotics or posed a threat to the United States.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/06/venezuela-panama-invasion-trump">US military buildup off Venezuela coast stirs echoes of 1989 Panama invasion</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hegseth released footage on X of the latest strike, which he said took place in international waters like the previous strikes and targeted “a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization.”</p> <p>No US forces were harmed in the operation, he said.</p> <p>“To all narco-terrorists who threaten our homeland: if you want to stay alive, stop trafficking drugs.
