<p>A billionaire entrepreneur who led the first flight of an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/sep/15/spacex-launch-amateur-astronauts-passengers">all-private crew of astronauts</a>, and became the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/15/mission-complete-billionaire-returns-to-earth-after-spacewalk-jared-isaacman">first civilian to walk in space</a> earlier this year, has been nominated by Donald Trump to be the next leader of Nasa.</p> <p>If confirmed by the Senate, Jared Isaacman, also an experienced jet pilot with his own display team, will guide the space agency at a pivotal moment in its 76-year history as it moves closer to returning humans to the moon for the first time since 1972 and sending the first crews to Mars.</p> <p>The 41-year-old founder of the commercial aerospace defense company Draken International <a href="https://x.com/rookisaacman/status/1864346915183157636">said in a tweet</a> he was “honored” to receive Trump’s nomination, and would be “grateful” to serve.</p> <p>“Having been fortunate to see our amazing planet from space, I am passionate about America leading the most incredible adventure in human history,” he wrote.</p> <p>“On my last mission to space, my crew and I traveled farther from Earth than anyone in over half a century. I can confidently say this second space age has only just begun.</p> <p>“Space holds unparalleled potential for breakthroughs in manufacturing, biotechnology, mining, and perhaps even pathways to new sources of energy. There will inevitably be a thriving space economy … that will create opportunities for countless people to live and work in space. At Nasa we will passionately pursue these possibilities and usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.”</p> <p>Isaacman was the commander of September’s five-day orbital <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/sep/15/mission-complete-billionaire-returns-to-earth-after-spacewalk-jared-isaacman">Polaris Dawn mission</a> that saw him make the first spacewalk by a civilian, nearly 460 miles (740km) above Earth. He would succeed outgoing Nasa administrator Bill Nelson, a former space shuttle astronaut and Democratic senator for Florida who was appointed by Joe Biden in 2021.</p> <p>Nelson oversaw crucial advances in the Artemis program, including the pioneering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/nov/16/nasa-artemis-1-moon-rocket-launch-florida">November 2022 flight</a> of the Artemis 1 moon rocket, which is scheduled to land the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface by the end of 2026.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/trump-cabinet-picks-administration-appointees">Trump’s cabinet and White House picks – so far</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the nomination of Isaacman, who is a close friend of the SpaceX founder and Trump acolyte Elon Musk, will raise questions over the future of a key government-funded component of the Artemis program, namely the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/">Space Launch System</a> (SLS) rocket.</p> <p>Musk’s company has been progressing its own <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/trump-musk-spacex-starship-rocket-launch">Starship</a> heavy lift rocket in recent months, also designed for long-duration human spaceflight to the moon and Mars, and the commercial space industry is expected to become much more prominent during the second Trump administration.</p> <p><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113595378122687080">In a statement</a> announcing his pick on Wednesday, Trump praised Isaacman as “an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut”.</p> <p>“Jared’s passion for space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new space economy, make him ideally suited to lead Nasa into a bold new era,” Trump said.</p> <p>Lori Garver, who was deputy administrator of Nasa from 2009 to 2013 during the Obama administration, said in <a href="https://x.com/Lori_Garver/status/1864349318628393130">a post to X</a> that Isaacman’s nomination was “terrific news”. </p> <p>“[He] has the opportunity to build on Nasa’s amazing accomplishments to pave our way to an even brighter future,” she said.</p>
