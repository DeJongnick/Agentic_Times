<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/diddy">Sean “Diddy” Combs</a> says his behavior in connection with his conviction in July on federal prostitution-related charges was “disgusting” and “shameful”, and he apologized for it as he awaited <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/03/sean-diddy-combs-sentencing">sentencing</a> on Friday in connection.</p> <p>Combs also said that his domestic violence seen during the case was a burden that he would carry with him for the rest of his life.</p> <p>The 55-year-old rapper’s remarks came after one of the prosecution witnesses at the last minute pulled out of a plan to address the hearing.</p> <p>Combs<strong> </strong>chose not to testify at his trial earlier this year, when he was convicted by a jury on federal prostitution-related charges.</p> <p>The hearing in New York featured blistering criticism from the prosecution that Combs was painting himself as the victim, and, by contrast, loving tributes from his<strong> </strong>children and other family members, while the judge said he had<strong> </strong>not fully expressed remorse for the charge of transporting people for prostitution.</p> <p>Before sentencing, Combs’s attorneys asked for a sentence of no more than 14 months in prison, which, given time already served, would allow for his release before the end of the year. Federal prosecutors have pushed for a sentence no less than 11 years and three months.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/03/sean-diddy-combs-sentencing">Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs sentencing: what to know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The charges on which he was found guilty each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Combs had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/sean-diddy-combs-pleads-not-guilty-new-indictment">pleaded not guilty</a> to all of the charges.</p> <p>He has been unsuccessful since in asking the court to release him on bail and scrub his conviction. Combs has been in jail in New York since September last year.</p> <p>The hip-hop mogul, with a grey beard, entered court from federal custody, wearing a yellow sweater over a button-down shirt and dress pants, having received permission from the judge to wear “non-prison clothing” as he did throughout his trial. Combs offered signs of prayer to his family and hugged his lawyers as he walked to the defense table.</p> <p>A former personal assistant to Combs, referred to only by the pseudonym “Mia” throughout the trial, had been due to give a witness impact statement in court, but moments after the hearing started it was announced she no longer wished to speak.</p> <p>Instead, Mia submitted a victim impact statement that prosecutors asked the court to consider in Combs’s sentencing. According to the prosecution, Mia decided against speaking at the hearing because of a letter submitted by the defense this week that accused her of being a liar.</p> <p>That letter “can only be described as bullying”, prosecutor Christy Slavik, said in court. “It appears the defense is trying to drown out the voices of victims in favor of character witnesses.”</p> <p>The judge, Arun Subramanian, who oversaw the trial, agreed with Slavik and said the tone of the letter was “inappropriate”.</p> <p>Towards the back of the court, behind Combs’s relatives and fans, sat a woman who had been identified as victim No 3 in the case but did not testify during the trial. She is an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/12/sean-diddy-combs-trial-allegations-timeline">ex-girlfriend of Combs’s, Gina Huynh</a>, who in 2019 spoke to a blogger alleging emotional and physical abuse during her relationship with Combs. No legal case was filed.</p> <p>She submitted a letter to the judge before sentencing, disavowing the idea that she was a victim. She said she felt “pressured to feel like a victim” by prosecutors.</p> <p>Also in the courtroom was music producer Dallas Austin, and friends of the late Kim Porter, the mother of four of Combs’s children. Combs’s mother Janice, in a long blonde wig, smiled as the court broke for lunch, after a tense three and a half hours.</p> <p>Subramanian gave prosecutors the freedom to cite “acquitted conduct”, a term used refer behavior for which Combs was charged but found not guilty of by the jury <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/02/diddy-trial-verdict-sean-combs">in July</a>.</p> <p>“The court will be best to determine whether it qualifies as relevant conduct,” the judge said, per NBC News. “We consider all the facts to impose the sentence, but not greater than necessary.”</p> <p>Combes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/03/sean-diddy-combs-sentencing">was convicted</a> in federal court of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/02/diddy-trial-verdict-sean-combs">acquitted</a> of the most serious charges against him, racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, which carried the possibility of a life sentence.</p> <p>On Thursday night, Combs sent the judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/02/sean-combs-letter-sentencing">a letter apologizing</a>, talking about his suffering in jail and his struggles with addiction. He asked, in the letter, for a second chance.</p> <p>However, Subramanian said the “narrative” advanced by Combs and his lawyers that the case involved nothing more than transporting people across state lines to engage in consensual sexual activity was “flatly inconsistent with both reality and any acceptance of responsibility”.</p> <p>The judge added that Combs had expressed remorse for some of his conduct, but said he had not apologized for the prostitution offenses at the heart of the conviction.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/02/sean-combs-letter-sentencing">Combs pleads with judge in letter before sentencing, saying he was ‘reborn’ in jail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Slavik argued that the framing of the letter was Combs casting himself as “the victim in this scenario”, adding: “This is not a person who has accepted responsibility.”</p> <p>The judge said he agreed with probation officers that federal guidelines call for a sentence that ranged from just under six years in prison to just over seven years, but he said the guidelines were merely advisory.</p> <p>Slavik said the defense was improperly seeking to portray Combs’s conduct as a “minor consequence of a sex, drugs, and rock’n’roll lifestyle” and urged the judge to consider Combs’s abuse of his girlfriends.</p> <p>“To not account for it now would be to let the defendant get away with years of domestic violence and abuse,” Slavik said.</p> <p>In court, Quincy Brown, Combs’s eldest son, told the judge he and his siblings love their father unconditionally and that Combs has become a “changed man” who has learned his lesson.</p> <p>Chance Combs, his eldest daughter, spoke of that, too, and told the judge: “When we talk, he speaks with a clear mind and sense of purpose that I didn’t always hear before.” Combs cried and wiped away tears as his children spoke.</p> <p>Meanwhile, defense lawyer Nicole Westmoreland became emotional in court as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/oct/03/sean-diddy-combs-sentencing-trial-conviction-latest-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68dffb658f08d534bcbb5e89#block-68dffb658f08d534bcbb5e89">she talked</a> of Combs as a pioneer for Black men in music, who changed the industry and the culture.</p> <p>Brian Steel, one of Combs’s lawyers, described Combs as a “civil rights leader” and said his “good outweighs his bad, by far”.</p>
