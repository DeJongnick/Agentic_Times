<p>The secret to a good relationship may be staring smartphone users in the face.</p> <p>A new study <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0326189">published in the journal Plos One</a> found that using emojis in text messages makes people feel closer and more satisfied in their personal lives.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/sep/18/emoji-dumping-how-to-say-its-over-when-you-cant-be-bothered-with-words">Emoji dumping: how to say it’s over when you can’t be bothered with words</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Researchers at the University of Texas spoke to 260 people aged between 23 and 67 and asked them to read 15 text message exchanges that varied only in the presence or absence of emojis.</p> <p>Participants were instructed to imagine themselves as the sender of each message while focusing on the recipient’s<strong> </strong>replies<strong> </strong>to evaluate responsiveness, likability, closeness and relationship satisfaction.</p> <p>The study revealed that people who send emojis combined with text are seen to be more responsive in their relationships than people who send text alone.</p> <p>It also found emojis serve as nonverbal cues that signal attentiveness and emotional engagement.</p> <p>Luke McGregor, 42, and Amy Thunig-McGregor, 37, say being able to use emojis helps their family communicate better.</p> <p>Luke said he wasn’t a regular emoji sender at the start of their relationship and had to learn to start incorporating them into text messages to Amy.</p> <p>“I traditionally didn’t use emojis that much but when I first got [together] with Amy, I noticed them using them a lot, so there was a vulnerability or a hurdle I had to get over to start using them myself,” McGregor said.</p>    <p>“I wanted Amy to know that they were loved, and so to become a regular sender of emojis to Amy in order to communicate affection was at least initially a big deal for me.”</p> <p>Amy said emojis were a good tool to enhance their communication.</p> <p>“We’re both autistic as well for context … it helps us really be clear with tone and intention in a way that isn’t possible with just written text,” they said.</p> <p>Senior lecturer in psychology at Central Queensland University Dr Raquel Peel, who was not involved in the study, said sending emojis can be a creative alternative when people are unable to see their partner face to face.</p> <p>“I don’t think we can replace face-to-face interactions because we are talking about intimate partnerships and relationships, but we have to be realistic that this isn’t always possible,” Peel said.</p> <p>“So if you can’t meet face to face with your partner for whatever reason staying connected is important.</p> <p>“Using emojis is then an effective alternative.”</p> <p>Her advice was to not underestimate the value of communication in a relationship and to always try and stay connected to your partner in whatever way you communicate.</p> <p>“One thing that people also forget when I’m talking to them about relationships is the value of humour and having a bit of fun,” Peel said.</p> <p>“So if emojis can serve a purpose that way, which we know they can, it adds to the element of fun and connection through humour and that is really important.”</p>
