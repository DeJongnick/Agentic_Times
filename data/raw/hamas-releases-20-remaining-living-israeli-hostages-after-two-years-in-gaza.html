<p>All 20 remaining living Israeli hostages have been released by Hamas after more than two years in captivity in Gaza.</p> 
<p>Parents were reunited with sons and children with fathers as those held were handed over to the Red Cross before finally rejoining their families with the help of the Israeli army. Even before their release, Hamas had allowed some of the hostages to make video calls home on Monday morning.</p> 
<p>Emotional footage was shared by Israeli broadcasters to an estimated 65,000 people gathered in front of large screens on “hostages square” in Tel Aviv and to millions more watching the coverage at home.</p> 
<p>In a statement the family of Omri Miran, 48, who was abducted in front of his wife and two children during Hamas’s attack on Israel of 7 October 2023 at Nahal Oz kibbutz, said his return was a victory for “an entire people”.</p> 
<p>They said: “After more than 700 long, painful, and agonising days, Omri will finally receive from [his children] Roni and Alma a healing embrace. We want to thank the people of Israel from the bottom of our hearts for standing by us in the darkest hours and on days when this moment seemed like a distant and impossible wish. This moment, today, is not a personal victory but a victory of an entire people.</p> 
<p>“We also want to express our deep gratitude to the security forces and the heroic [Israel Defense Force] soldiers. We are at the beginning of a complex and challenging, yet moving, journey of recovery.</p> 
<p>“We remain committed to the struggle until the last hostage returns, and until the complete recovery of our beloved country. May Omri’s return mark the beginning of this recovery and the unity of our people.”</p> 
<p>The family of Matan Angrest, 22, an Israel Defense Force soldier captured when his tank was attacked by Hamas near the Gaza perimeter fence, who have been critical of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over the continuation of the war, praised Donald Trump.</p> 
<p>They said: “We can breathe again. Our Matan is home. Our beloved boy has been returned to us after two complex years, and we are so proud of him … A huge, historic, eternal thank you to the president of the United States and his team who worked with dedication and persistence for the rescue and return of our loved ones.</p> 
<p>“The joy in our family is mixed with sadness for those murdered and for those who were not returned alive.”</p> 
<p>Israeli ministers had approved overnight a list of 1,718 Palestinian prisoners set also to be released. That is due to follow the handover of 28 dead Israeli hostages.</p> 
<p>The day had begun with Hamas issuing a list of the 20 living hostages – all men – they intended to release. It provided the first firm confirmation to many of the families that their loved ones had not perished.</p> 
<p>Then the crowd at “hostages square” in Tel Aviv on Monday morning roared their approval shortly after 8.15am local time as it was announced from a stage that the first seven live hostages had been released to the Red Cross.</p> 
<p>Soon after, the crowd erupted again as it was announced that Air Force One carrying Donald Trump was flying over the square as the US president made his way to the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, in Jerusalem where he was due to give a speech later on Monday.</p> 
<p>The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, welcomed the release of the first hostages by Hamas and said Israel was awaiting the release of all remaining captives. “With thanks to God we welcome our loved ones. We are waiting for everyone – every last one,” Herzog said.</p> 
<p>At about 11am local time, the Israeli media reported that the final 13 missing living hostages had been received by the Red Cross.</p> 
<p>The crowd chanted their thanks to Trump, who is widely credited as bringing about the return of the hostages. On his arrival at the Knesset, Trump wrote a message in the guest book: “This is my great honour – a great and beautiful day. A new beginning.”</p>

</aside> 
<p>Speaking by the side of Netanyahu, Trump added: “As far as I’m concerned, the war is over.”</p> 
<p>Trump is expected to meet families of the hostages and may join some of those released by Hamas. He will continue to Egypt, where the office of the president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, said he would co-chair a “peace summit” on Monday with regional and international leaders.</p> 
<p>People have been gathering every day for the past two years at hostages square to show solidarity with the families of those in Hamas captivity after their abduction on 7 October 2023.</p>

<p>For two years, protesters occupied the square, which faces the Israeli military headquarters, and held rallies demanding hostages be returned from Gaza. </p> 
<p>Hundreds were there from the early hours of Monday and tens of thousands more joined them as the morning went on where they watched live footage of events from large screens on two sides of the square.</p> 
<p>Julie Kupershtein, the mother of hostage Bar Kupershtein, who was working at the Nova music festival as a paramedic when he was taken, spoke to her son in a video call before his release. She said: “Seeing my child after two years – everything is fine. Thank you to the soldiers, thank you to everyone.</p> 
<p>“We were in the compound, and suddenly I had a conversation, suddenly I saw Bar. I screamed to the sky. Crazy. To see them, these pure, righteous children, alive. I’m shaking all over.”</p> 
<p>Keir Starmer, the UK prime minister, said: “Today is the first, crucial phase in ending the war in the Middle East. Now we must deliver lasting peace and a secure future for the whole region. The UK is providing additional humanitarian aid for civilians in Gaza, and we will lead efforts to accelerate its reconstruction.”</p> 
<p>The EU’s foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, welcomed the release of the first of the hostages and praised Trump’s role in this “crucial milestone towards peace”, saying: “President Trump made this breakthrough possible.”</p> 
<p>The ceasefire and release of hostages and prisoners in exchange for a limited withdrawal by the Israeli military is just the first phase of a 20-point peace plan. The issues of the future of Hamas and Gaza and whether the militant group will disarm remain to be decided.</p>
