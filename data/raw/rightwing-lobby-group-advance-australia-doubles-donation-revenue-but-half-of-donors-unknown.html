<p>Advance Australia, the conservative lobby group that claimed success for defeating the voice referendum, more than doubled the amount of donations it received during the 2022-23 financial year.</p> <p>But the origin of almost half of the funds remains unknown.</p> <p>Political donations data, released by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on Thursday, showed Advance Australia received $5.2m in donations and other receipts in the year following the federal election – a significant increase on the $2.5m it received in 2021-22.</p> <p>Political parties and significant third parties, like Advance Australia, are only required to declare the source of donations and other payments that are above a certain threshold, which for 2022-23 was $15,200.</p> <p>It is also mandatory they declare the total amount of money they received. The difference between the sum of the donations declared with donations and the total amount <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/11/more-than-100m-donated-to-political-parties-from-hidden-sources-in-election-year">is so-called “dark money”</a> – essentially funds for which the source is not publicly known.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/02/dark-money-57m-of-donations-to-major-australian-parties-in-2022-23-of-unknown-origin">‘Dark money’: $57m of donations to major Australian parties in 2022-23 of unknown origin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of the $5.2m Advance Australia received in 2022-23, about $2.4m of it – or 47% – came from unknown sources.</p> <p>The group, a self-proclaimed rightwing answer to progressive campaign group Get Up, declared spending $4.5m on election expenditure in the year leading up to July 2023, which covered the first few months of official referendum campaigning.</p> <p>Advance had organised a series of fundraising appeals in the first half of 2023, including one with former fund manager and regulator donor <a href="https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/8151765/grassroots-anti-voice-group-boasts-500k-in-donations-after-financier-digs-deep/">Simon Fenwick, who agreed to match $250,000 in supporter donations</a> in April.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=docsdata&amp;key=1-FqJWRwIS-OUqIp50Oku9iKetCATACD5wcs-P8knIfs" data-alt="The sum of donations in dollars by donor name as declared by Advance Australia"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=docsdata&key=1-FqJWRwIS-OUqIp50Oku9iKetCATACD5wcs-P8knIfs">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The disclosure details show Fenwick’s Silver River Investment Holdings provided $400,000 in total in two donations over the year, making him the group’s second biggest donor in 2022-23.</p> <p>Advance Australia has pitched itself as a group representing Australian “battlers” against the “woke” elite. However, many of its financial backers are wealthy investors and businessmen.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The largest donation, a sum of $1m, came from a little-known Perth company, Hadley Holdings, which lists 94-year-old Brian Hadley Anderson and accountant Lena Hilton as directors.</p> <p>Anderson, who made his fortune in used car sales, <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/94yo-brian-hadley-anderson-gave-no-campaign-1-million-to-balance-corporate-australias-attack-on-nation-c-13433837">told the West Australian</a> he donated the money because he wanted to support Nationals senator Jacinta Price and no activist Warren Mundine, calling the voice proposal “divisive, undemocratic and discriminatory”.</p> <p>Other major donors included storage boss Sam Kennard’s Siesta Holdings Australia Pty Ltd, which donated two sums totalling $115,000, and Perth doctor Bryan Macfie, a member of the Institute of Public Affairs, who gave $100,000.</p> <p>Two companies, Sixmilebridge Pty Limited and Nedigi Pty Limited, which have previously given Advance Australia donations, tipped in $50,000 each.

Its largest donors were from estates – the late Geoffrey Lawson Hook’s estate donated $250,000 while the late David Walsh’s estate gave the group $125,000.</p> <p>The Centre for Australian Progress and poet Johanna Featherstone each offered $100,000 during the post-election year.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 3 February 2024. An earlier version incorrectly said $1.1m was 86% of $7.8m, when it is 14%.</p>
