<p>Enzo Maresca has said he has not spoken to Mykhailo Mudryk since the Football Association <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/mykhailo-mudryk-chelsea-could-face-four-year-ban-fa-charge-failed-drugs-test">announced on Wednesday</a> that the Chelsea winger has been charged with doping offences. Mudryk is facing a four-year ban if he is found guilty by the FA of taking a banned substance. </p> <p>Maresca said he still trusts the Ukraine international and plans to check on his welfare soon, but Chelsea’s head coach added that he has had no contact with the 24-year-old since May. “I spoke with Misha in Poland when we played the Conference League final,” he said. “I didn’t speak with him since that time. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/chelsea-jamie-gittens-mohammed-kudus-joao-pedro">Chelsea make Gittens top target and keep Kudus and João Pedro in sights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“To be honest, I didn’t see the news. They communicated to me last night. </p> <p>“The last time I spoke with Misha he was quite good. I didn’t see him worried or at least I didn’t see him not good. Since that day I didn’t speak with him, so I don’t know how he is now. But for sure in the next days and weeks we are going to have direct contact with him.”</p> <p>Mudryk has not played since November and was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/17/chelsea-mykhailo-mudryk-fails-drugs-test-provisionally-suspended">provisionally suspended the following month</a> after producing a positive A sample. It is believed the banned performance-enhancing substance meldonium was found in his system.</p> <p>“Misha is a Chelsea player,” Maresca said. “Until he’s not a Chelsea player, I will trust all the Chelsea players. It’s not just about Misha. It is in general.”</p> <p>Maresca said Chelsea would sign a winger regardless of the outcome of Mudryk’s case. They are keen on Borussia Dortmund’s Jamie Gittens and have made an inquiry for Lyon’s Malick Fofana.</p> <p>“We had already one entire season almost without Misha,” Maresca said. “We’re going to decide to go for a winger not because of Misha. It’s something quite clear that it’s a position that we need to improve.”</p> <p>Chelsea face Flamengo in scorching conditions in Philadelphia in their second game in the Club World Cup on Friday. The Brazilian champions are unbeaten in nine games in all competitions and have signed the former Chelsea midfielder Jorginho from Arsenal.</p>
