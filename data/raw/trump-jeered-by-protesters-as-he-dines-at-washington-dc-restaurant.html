<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> faced protesters shouting “Free DC! Free Palestine! Trump is the Hitler of our time!” as he dined at a Washington restaurant, videos posted online showed.</p> 
<p>The US president approached the shouting protesters in the restaurant, pausing a few feet away from them for a few moments, nodding and smiling without offering a response.</p> 
<p>Seconds later, Trump gestured for the area to be cleared out, saying: “Come on, let’s go.”</p> 
<p>Secret Service agents then moved the protesters, who waved Palestinian flags. Others in the restaurant can be heard booing or chanting “U-S-A! U-S-A!”</p> 
<p>Code Pink, a feminist activist group, <a href="https://x.com/codepink/status/1965581735950737806">claimed credit</a> for the protest. “While Trump, JD Vance, Marco Rubio, Pete Hegseth and others feasted at a steakhouse, we stood our ground and told them the truth: Free DC. Free Palestine. Trump is the Hitler of our time,” they wrote on social media.</p> 
<p>Trump had dinner on Tuesday at a seafood restaurant near the White House, promoting his deployment of the national guard and federalizing the police force in the nation’s capital.</p> 
<p>His motorcade traveled the short distance to Joe’s Seafood, Prime Steak &amp; Stone Crab on 15th Street in the Northwest quadrant of the city after weeks of the president boasting about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/mayor-national-guard-washington-dc">mobilizing federal authorities</a> and the military that he says have made Washington “a safe zone”.</p>

<p>Cheers were heard as the president stepped out of his limo, along with a smattering of boos and chants from protesters opposing US policy in support of Israel in its war with Hamas in Gaza.</p> 
<p>“We’re standing right in the middle of DC, which as you know about, over the last year, was a very unsafe place – over the last 20 years – and now it’s got virtually no crime,” Trump told reporters.</p> 
<p>He added that he would not have stood out “in the middle of the street” as recently as a couple of months ago.</p> 
<p>Eating dinner in public is a rare event for Trump, but Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, confirmed that he “and his team enjoyed crab, shrimp, salad, steak and dessert” for dinner at a restaurant blocks from the White House.</p> 
<p>Trump was joined by JD Vance, the vice-president; Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary; Marco Rubio, the secretary of state; Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff; Leavitt; and others.</p>

<p>Ahead of the meal, Trump told the press that “the restaurants now are booming” in DC, crediting his crackdown on the capital with national guard troops.</p> 
<p>In one video, Vance is seen shaking diners’ hands and telling them to enjoy their meal.</p> 
<p>In August, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/20/jd-vance-heckled-washington-dc">Vance was heckled</a> while handing out hamburgers to national guard troops in DC, with one man calling him a “Nazi”.</p> 
<p>Crime in DC was at a 30-year low when Trump sent in several thousand troops anyway.</p> 
<p>Although arrests have increased in the city since then, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/inside-trumps-dc-crackdown-swarms-agents-arrests-minor-offenses-2025-08-27/">Reuters analysis</a> showed federal agents have been “converging in large numbers on low-level crimes such as marijuana use and public alcohol consumption”.</p> 
<p>More than half of the cases federal agents were involved in were minor offenses, and authorities have struggled to make more serious gun and drug-related charges stick, with an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/us/trump-dc-national-guard-grand-juries-crime.html">unprecedented rate</a> of grand juries finding not enough evidence to indict in the first few weeks of the takeover.</p>
