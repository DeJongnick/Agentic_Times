<p>Extreme volatility plagued global <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/stock-markets">stock markets</a> on Monday, with Wall Street swinging in and out of the red as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> defied stark warnings that his global trade assault will wreak widespread economic damage, comparing new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">US tariffs</a> to medicine.</p> 
<p>A renewed sell-off began in Asia, before hitting European equities and reaching the US. It was briefly reversed amid hopes of a reprieve, only for Trump to threaten <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> with more steep tariffs, intensifying pressure on the market.</p> 
<p>On Wall Street, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 dropped by as much as 4.1% – entering bear market territory after falling more than 20% from its most recent peak, in February – before launching an extraordinary reversal to turn positive.</p>

<p>While markets were fleetingly boosted after Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House national economic council, signaled that Trump was open to considering a 90-day pause on tariffs for all countries but China, the relief did not last long. </p> 
<p>After hours of turbulent trading, the S&amp;P closed down 0.2%. The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 0.9%.</p>

<p>“We’re not looking at that,” Trump told reporters, when asked about the prospect of a pause. Pressed on whether the tariffs set the stage for negotiations with countries, or were permanent, he replied: “Well, it can both be true. There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations.”</p> 
<p>The FTSE 100 closed down 4.38% in London at 7,702.08 – the lowest close in more than a year - after the Nikkei 225 slumped 7.8% in Tokyo. Other major European also ended the day sharply lower, including Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC, which both fell more than 4%.</p> 
<p>Trump, who has previously used market rallies as a barometer of his success, tried to brush off the sell-off this weekend. “I don’t want anything to go down,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/president-trump-administration-news-updates-today">the US president said on Sunday</a>. “But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.”</p>

<p>He stood firm on Monday. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid!”</p> 
<p>As China prepares to retaliate, Trump threatened to further increase US tariffs on the country – an additional rate of 50% – if it hits back. All talks with Beijing over potential meetings have been “terminated”, he said.</p> 
<p>Major share indices have fallen dramatically since he unveiled his controversial plan to overhaul the US economy last week. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> imposed a blanket 10% tariff on imported goods this weekend, and is set to follow with higher tariffs on products from specific nations from Wednesday.</p>

<p>While senior figures in corporate America have been reluctant to criticize Trump since his inauguration in January, a handful have started to sound the alarm in recent days.</p> 
<p>Larry Fink, the CEO of the investment giant BlackRock, expressed concern on Monday over the threat of a downturn. “The economy is weakening as we speak,” he said at the Economic Club of New York, according to Bloomberg. “Most CEOs I talk to would say we are probably in a recession right now.”</p> 
<p>The JPMorgan Chase boss, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/jamie-dimon">Jamie Dimon</a>, one of the most influential executives on Wall Street, warned that Trump’s tariff plan was “likely” to exacerbate inflation. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.</p> 
<p>Dimon added: “The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.”</p> 
<p>The billionaire fund manager <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/bill-ackman-trump-tariffs">Bill Ackman</a>, who backed Trump’s campaign for the presidency, has also demanded the administration reconsider its plan. “We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.</p>

<p>Even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, a close ally of Trump, currently leading the so-called “department of government efficiency” inside the government, appeared to break with the administration on the issue. Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade adviser, “ain’t built shit”, Musk wrote on X, which he owns, this weekend.</p> 
<p>Navarro, for his part, insisted in a television interview on Monday morning that the stock market would find a bottom. Less than hour later, when New York opened for trading, the search continued.</p>

<p>The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite started the day down 4.3%, before switching in and out of the red. It ended the day broadly flat, up by 0.1%. The VIX “fear index” of volatility rose as high as 60 for the first time since August.</p> 
<p>Oil prices also came under pressure, with Brent and WTI benchmarks stooping to their lowest levels in four years, as growing economic tensions between Washington and Beijing stoked fears that a global downturn would challenge demand.</p> 
<p>Sir <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/richard-branson">Richard Branson</a>, co-founder of Virgin Group, argued the “predictable and preventable” market chaos would have “catastrophic” implications for people in the US and around the world, and claimed companies were already going bankrupt as a result of the weaker dollar and higher costs.</p> 
<p>“This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course,” Branson wrote on X. “Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come.”</p>
