<p>Keir Starmer is expected to announce plans for a UK digital ID scheme later this morning.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/26/keir-starmer-digital-id-cards-immigration-borders-reform-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68d64b538f0892d6aebac37c#top-of-blog">new digital ID</a>, will become mandatory as a means of proving the right to work under the plans, but people will not be required to carry or asked to produce it. It will be available to UK citizens and legal residents by the end of this parliament, reports the PA news agency.</p> <p>Starmer said, “The Digital ID is an enormous opportunity and will make it tougher to work illegally in the country making borders more secure.”</p> <p>“It will also offer ordinary citizens countless benefits, like being able to prove your identity to access key services swiftly – rather than hunting around for an old utility bill.”</p> <p>We would like to hear what people think about the introduction of a digital ID. Do you think it’s a good idea – do you have concerns?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="eb689996-ac01-4811-b693-87d5f2d99c36" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p><em><strong>If you’re having trouble using the form click <a href="https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/views_uk_digital_id_scheme">here</a>.
