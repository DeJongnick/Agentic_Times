<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a>’s government has refused a request by the beleaguered Marineland theme park to export its remaining 30 beluga <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/whales">whales</a> to China due to concerns that the whales will face further mistreatment.</p> <p>Marineland, an amusement park, zoo and aquarium in Niagara Falls, has one of the largest captive whale populations in the world, and has long been mired in controversy amid reports of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/14/last-captive-whales-canada-marineland-ontario-beluga-deaths">poor conditions</a> for the animals on display.</p> <p>Twenty whales, 19 belugas and one killer whale have died at the park since 2019, according to documents compiled by the Canadian Press.</p> <p>Marineland did not open for the summer season this year and has not responded to requests for comment, but in February a lawyer for the park said it was planning to “expeditiously” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/20/canadas-marineland-to-rehome-its-whales-and-dolphins-as-it-seeks-a-buyer">remove the remaining animals still on the grounds</a>.</p> <p>Chimelong Ocean Kingdom in China confirmed to CBC News that it was considering buying the belugas, but in a statement on Wednesday, Joanne Thompson, the federal minister of fisheries, said the request to export the whales had been denied.</p> <p>“I could not in good conscience approve an export that would perpetuate the treatment these belugas have endured,” she said, adding: “To approve the request would have meant a continued life in captivity and a return to public entertainment.”</p> <p>Thompson said: “Like many of you, I am angered that these whales have lived a life of captivity and as a result their health has deteriorated.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/14/last-captive-whales-canada-marineland-ontario-beluga-deaths">Five years, multiple deaths: what is happening at the home of the last captive whales in Canada?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What precipitated the park’s decline was a 2019 federal law that banned the sale, captivity and breeding of dolphins and whales. When the legislation was enacted, it meant that Marineland could not acquire any new animals.</p> <p>According to the Canadian Press, Ontario provincial inspectors have attended the park more than 200 times since 2020 and issued 33 orders for compliance.</p> <p>Marineland has previously said the belugas receive a high level of healthcare and round-the-clock-attention.</p> <p>Ontario’s premier, Doug Ford, said at a press conference last week that the province will “do whatever it takes” to give the remaining whales the “best life possible”. Speaking of Marineland he said: “It’s just terrible over there.”</p> <p>Phil Demers, who trained whales at the park from 2000 to 2012 before becoming an outspoken critic of the park, said that while he’s relieved the whales will not be sent to China, they remain at risk.</p> <p>The only viable alternative would be for the animals to live somewhere with strict laws that preserve their wellbeing. Demers said the United States is likely the best option.</p> <p>He said Canada has lacked the “political appetite” to actually hold Marineland to account and rescue the animals since the park opened in 1961. Despite the province’s investigation, it hasn’t led to the animals being relinquished into government custody – which Demers says needs to happen.</p> <p>“They’ve allowed it to sort of simmer on the back burner, and now we’re boiling over,” he said.</p>
