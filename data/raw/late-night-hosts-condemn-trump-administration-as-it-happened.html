The first amendment and the Communications Act expressly prohibit the Commission from censoring broadcast matter.”</p> <p>Trump, however, appears not to know this. When he was asked by a reporter if he intends to ask Brendan Carr, the FCC chair, “to weigh in on other late-night hosts that you have said should be off the air”, the president replied: “You know, when late-night host is on network television, there is a licensing.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqUAyCbKtp4"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JqUAyCbKtp4?start=478&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=478" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Donald Trump spoke to reporters about his misunderstanding of FCC licensing requirements for US TV networks on Thursday on Air Force One.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>“I’ll give you an example. I read someplace that the networks were 97% against me,” Trump added. “If they’re 97% against, they give me only bad publicity, or press, I mean, they’re getting a license, I would think maybe their license should be taken away.”</p> <p>Later in the exchange, the president restated his misunderstanding that networks have to be licensed by the FCC.</p> <p>“When you have a network and you have evening shows and all they do is hit Trump,” <a href="https://youtu.be/JqUAyCbKtp4?feature=shared&amp;t=1047">Trump said</a>. “That’s all they do. If you go back, I guess they haven’t had a conservative on in years or something somebody said. But when you go back and you take a look, all they do is hit Trump. They’re licensed. They’re not allowed to do that. They’re an arm of the Democrat party.”</p> <p>The president then ended the brief news conference by saying: “Thank you everybody. Have a good flight. Fly safely. You know why I say that? Because I’m on the flight.

Not only got rid of him, got rid of the whole franchise. ‘You’re not going to have to worry about anything, Larry. It’s all gone. It’s fine. Good night.’”<br><br>And then my good friend Jimmy Kimmel. You know, I just, I feel bad about this because we all see where this is going, correct? It’s managed media. And it’s no good. It’s silly. It’s ridiculous. And you can’t go around firing somebody because you’re fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office. That’s just not how this works.</p> </blockquote> <p>The editor of the Atlantic pressed Letterman on what Trump’s FCC chair called the “news distortion” in Kimmel’s monologue on Monday, the comedian’s claim that Maga Republicans were “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them”. The suspected gunman, Tyler Robinson, was a gun-owning Utahn, raised in a pro-Trump, Republican family, but evidence made public in charging documents suggests that he killed Kirk because he considered the far-right activist “evil”.</p> <p>“So what? We all make mistakes, I mean, good Lord,” Letterman replied. “Mistakes are going to be made. Hopefully it will improve. I think, sadly, it’s not going to improve. I’m not exactly in full-mind understanding of what Jimmy said, what he was trying to say, and what mistake was made. This is something that was predicted by our president right after Stephen Colbert.

If it were to take the unprecedented step of trying to revoke broadcast licenses, which are held by local stations rather than national networks, it would run headlong into the First Amendment and fail in court on both the facts and the law. But even the threat to revoke a license is no small matter. It poses <strong>an existential risk to a broadcaster</strong>, which by definition cannot exist without its license. That makes billion-dollar companies with pending business before the agency all the more <strong>vulnerable to pressure to bend to the government’s ideological demands</strong>. </p> <p>When corporations surrender in the face of that pressure, <strong>they endanger not just themselves, but the right to free expression for everyone in this country</strong>.
