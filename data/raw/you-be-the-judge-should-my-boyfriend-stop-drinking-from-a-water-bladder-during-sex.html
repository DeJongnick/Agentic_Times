<h2><strong>The prosecution: Leanne</strong></h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>It looks like a drip and reminds me of a&nbsp;hospital. If he needs a drink, a cup is more appropriate</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I’ve been with my boyfriend, Wes, for about a year and a half. We don’t live together, and last summer he built himself a four-poster bed, which I&nbsp;thought was really cool. But a few months ago he got one of those water bladders with a long tube and hung it&nbsp;from one side of the bed.</p> <p>He said it was practical, and at first&nbsp;I&nbsp;didn’t mind. I thought it was a&nbsp;joke. There were also moments when&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought it was practical too. Sometimes, when he was drinking from it, I thought: “I’ll have a drink from it as well.” But then I asked him if&nbsp;he was going to take it down, and he&nbsp;just brushed it off. </p> <p>One day, we were having an intimate moment and he whipped out&nbsp;the water bladder and started drinking from it. He should have been&nbsp;concentrating on me so I was annoyed, and now it’s banished.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. That’s acceptable – but it’s not for the bedroom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was just a huge turnoff. It looks like a drip and it reminds me of a&nbsp;hospital. When you’re with your partner that’s not the connotation you&nbsp;want. Hydration is important, but&nbsp;if Wes needs a drink during sex a&nbsp;water bottle or a cup of water is more&nbsp;appropriate. </p> <p>The water bladder was up for about two and a half months in total. That moment tipped me over the edge, and thankfully Wes listened to me. </p> <p>We have come to an agreement to&nbsp;keep it out of the bedroom, but I&nbsp;know that part of him wants it back.&nbsp;We are going to a festival this weekend and Wes says he is going to&nbsp;bring two water bladders. I won’t be&nbsp;drinking from one unless there’s an&nbsp;emergency.</p> <p>Wes loves hiking and biking, and uses a water bladder then. I think that’s acceptable as it’s what it was originally designed for –&nbsp;but it’s not for&nbsp;the bedroom. </p> <p>Even though we live separately, as&nbsp;I&nbsp;usually go to Wes’s place, I&nbsp;think he should listen to me when I&nbsp;say I’m not comfortable with something. He did take it down after&nbsp;that incident, but I know if I&nbsp;allowed it,&nbsp;the water bladder would&nbsp;go straight&nbsp;back up.</p> <h2><strong>The defence: Wes</strong></h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>I get that it was maybe </em><em>insensitive to do it during sex</em><em>, but </em><em>I didn’t expect her&nbsp;to be so bothered</em></p> </blockquote> <p>After building myself a four-poster bed while I was bored, I attached a&nbsp;water bladder I had lying around the&nbsp;house with a little bit of string, looping it over the top of the bed. I&nbsp;thought it was practical and funny. It&nbsp;was really hot recently, so it was a&nbsp;good way to stay hydrated.</p> <p>At first, Leanne drank from it with me when she came round to stay. She&nbsp;didn’t seem opposed to it. But then when I drank from it during an intimate moment she reacted really strongly. Things came to an abrupt halt there and then, and the water bladder was removed immediately. It&nbsp;felt like an overreaction in the face of&nbsp;something I thought was totally innocent. I get that it was bad timing and maybe a bit insensitive to do it during sex. However, I didn’t expect her to be so bothered.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>We are going to a festival soon and she’s banned me from using it in the tent too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It started out as “look at this fun idea”, and I thought: “Wow, I can drink hands-free.” But then Leanne said she didn’t like the imagery of it. I do get that the thought of me lying in bed with a tube stuck out of my mouth during sex isn’t very attractive. </p> <p>But we are going to a festival soon and she’s banned it in the tent too. She’s OK with me using it when we’re out and about, just not when I’m lying down inside the tent. I think it’s much more practical than a cup – there’s no risk of spillage. And surely a water bladder is appropriate in any context where you’re camping?</p> <p>If we are in the crowds for hours and Leanne runs out of water, and I’ve got litres left in the bladder, I think she’ll end up using it. It’s a different context to the bedroom, but it seems like the whole idea of the water bladder is totally corrupted for Leanne now.</p> <p>There’s not really a middle ground for her when it comes to the water bladder. I’ve suggested getting a smaller one, but to no avail. Ultimately, Leanne’s upset is more important than the convenience. If it means she is happier, then it’s worth it, but privately I think a water bladder is entirely functional. If she said I could hang it off the bed again, I 100% would.</p> <h2>The jury of Guardian readers</h2> <p><strong>Is a water bladder acceptable in the bedroom?</strong></p> <p>Water bladders have their place, but&nbsp;should not be used in the home, let&nbsp;alone during an intimate moment. Wes&nbsp;should focus on understanding Leanne’s feelings and how to use bladders appropriately, rather than&nbsp;trying to shoehorn them into every&nbsp;situation.<br><strong>Adnaan, 30</strong></p> <p>Leanne is well within her rights to ban the bladder from the bedroom and also from what functions as a bedroom while they are at the festival. This still leaves Wes plenty of opportunities to hydrate when he’s out and about, just not during sleep or sex!<br><strong>Harmony, 30</strong></p> <p>It’s entirely reasonable to ask that the water bladder isn’t used in the bedroom. Yet, I think it is totally normal to use it&nbsp;in most other contexts, including at a&nbsp;festival. Wes has been willing to make adjustments, so Leanne should let him drink in the tent.<br><strong>Lola, 25</strong></p> <p>Leanne has made it perfectly clear to Wes that she finds the water bladder distasteful, and it makes her uncomfortable. Relationships are about compromise – when your partner tells you they don’t like something, you stop doing it. There is no reasonable excuse to persist with this.<br><strong>Peter, 60</strong></p> <p>Wes isn’t a Formula One driver, he can take 10 seconds to drink from a glass. A&nbsp;bladder at a festival makes sense, but using one in the home is unnecessary. Leanne is right to come down hard on it, and Wes is right to concede.<br><strong>Matt, 30</strong></p> <h2><strong>Now you be the judge</strong></h2> <p><strong>In our online poll, tell us who should suck it up</strong></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Wes is guilty - Wes should stop being a drip.
