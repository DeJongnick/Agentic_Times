<p>Veggie burgers, tofu steak and cauliflower schnitzel will be off the menu if the European parliament gets its way after a vote on food names.</p> <p>MEPs voted on Wednesday by 355 in favour to 247 against to reserve names such as “steak”, “burger” and “sausage” exclusively for products derived from meat, a longstanding demand of farm unions.</p> <p>In order to come into effect, the idea would have to be approved by a majority of the EU’s 27 member states, which is far from certain.</p> <p>The vote is a victory for the French centre-right MEP Céline Imart, who drafted the amendment to legislation intended to strengthen the position of farmers in the food supply chain.</p> <p>Imart, who is also a cereals farmer in north-west France, said: “A steak, an escalope or a sausage are products from our livestock, not laboratory art nor plant products. There is a need for transparency and clarity for the consumer and recognition for the work of our farmers.”</p> <p>She argues the proposal is in line with EU rules that already ban the use of terms such as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40274645">“milk” and “yoghurt”</a> for non-dairy products.</p> <p>The European parliament rejected a ban on meaty names for plant-based products <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/23/european-farmers-lose-attempt-to-ban-terms-such-veggie-burger">in 2020</a>, but the 2024 elections shifted the parliament to the right, bringing in more lawmakers who seek close ties with farmers.</p> <p>Opposition was led by Green MEPs, who decried what they saw as a populist move to rename plant-based foods. “Veggie burgers, seitan schnitzel and tofu sausage do not confuse consumers, only rightwing politicians,” Thomas Waitz, an Austrian Green MEP, said after the vote. “This tactic is a diversion and a pathetic smokescreen. No farmer will earn more money or secure their future with this ban.”</p> <p>Even Imart’s centre-right European People’s party (EPP) is divided on the issue. The EPP’s group leader, Manfred Weber, said before the vote that the issue was not a priority for him and lawmakers had more important things to deal with. “Consumers are not stupid when they go to the supermarkets and buy their products,” he said.</p> <p>The proposal is opposed by leading German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, which fear that banning familiar terms would make it “more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions”.</p> <p>Germany is the largest market for plant-based products and these businesses fear they would be particularly affected by any move to change the names of plant-based foods.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/oct/04/warnings-imports-caged-hen-eggs-ukraine-poland-uk-biggest-suppliers">Warnings of imports of caged hen eggs as Ukraine and Poland become UK’s biggest suppliers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>France’s livestock sector strongly backs the proposals. “Without clear safeguards, consumers risk being misled by products that are disguised as meat but are not meat,” Jean-François Guihard, the head of Interbev, the French livestock and meat association, told AFP.</p> <p>France introduced a ban on words such as “steak” and “sausage” being applied to plant-based foods in 2020 but the European court of justice ruled the measure illegal under EU law in 2024. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/10/top-french-court-suspends-ban-on-using-word-steak-on-plant-based-foods">original French decree</a> introduced a ban on 21 terms used by butchers, including “ham”, “filet” and “prime rib”.</p> <p>Consumer groups say the measure has little support among shoppers. A 2020 survey of 11 EU member states by the European Consumer Organisation (<a href="https://www.beuc.eu/">BEUC</a>) found that most were not concerned about the use of meat-related names as long as a product was clearly labelled as vegetarian or vegan.</p> <p>Irina Popescu, a food policy officer at the BEUC, said the vote was disappointing and made little sense. “Almost 70% of consumers understand these names as long as products are clearly labelled vegan or vegetarian. Policymakers should focus on making packaging clear and understandable with trustworthy labels,” she said.</p> <p>The Austrian MEP Anna Stürgkh, a member of the centrist Renew group, said consumers were unlikely to be misled. “A beef tomato doesn’t contain any beef … Ladies’ fingers are not made of actual ladies’ fingers. Let’s trust consumers and stop this hotdog populism,” she said.</p>
