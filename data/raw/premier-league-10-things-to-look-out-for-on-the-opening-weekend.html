<h2>Slot concern over Liverpool vulnerability</h2> <p>A visit to an expectant Anfield, where Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitiké will be out to impress on their Premier League debuts, represents a daunting start for a Bournemouth team that have lost three-quarters of last season’s backline to the pulling power of Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool this summer. Defensive issues are not exclusive to Andoni Iraola before the Premier League opener, however. Arne Slot voiced concern over the champions’ pre-season vulnerability before and after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/10/crystal-palace-liverpool-community-shield-match-report">Community Shield against Crystal Palace</a>, when the absence of Ryan Gravenberch for family reasons was keenly felt. “Three times we lost the ball very simple in our midfield and three times they could counterattack us,” reflected the Liverpool head coach. Gravenberch will be missing again on Friday through suspension but Slot expects the team with the second-best defensive record in the Premier League last season to react as soon as the serious business begins. “Mixed teams, new players coming in, Virgil [van Dijk] being sick, Alisson not being there,” he listed as reasons for Liverpool’s recent difficulties on Thursday. “But all of this is not an excuse when we start the league. We will 100% be ready on Friday.” <strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Liverpool v Bournemouth, Friday 8pm (all times BST)</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Ramsey sale a blow for the romantics</h2> <p>The absence of Alexander Isak will invariably dominate the discourse at Villa Park on Saturday lunchtime but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/newcastle-close-to-signing-jacob-ramsey-from-aston-villa-for-40m-isak">Newcastle’s move for Jacob Ramsey</a> means there is another intriguing subplot. Villa selling Ramsey, who joined their academy aged six, frees them to strengthen after a slow summer – and pocket £40m of profit. But it also serves as a reminder of the demoralising financial landscape in the era of profitability and sustainability regulations. PSR rules have also dictated deals for Newcastle, namely Elliot Anderson – a star in waiting for England – and Yankuba Minteh joining Nottingham Forest and Brighton respectively last year. Unai Emery is a big admirer of Ramsey, who would have been in line to start for Villa this weekend, but ultimately money talks. The 24-year-old lived his dream: playing for his boyhood club. There is always romanticism on the eve of a new season but Ramsey’s imminent sale is a reminder that football is a business. <strong>Ben Fisher</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Aston Villa v Newcastle, Saturday 12.30pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>De Cuyper can sparkle on Brighton’s left</h2> <p>As usual, Brighton did their transfer business early this summer and it seems that Maxim De Cuyper has settled on the south coast already. The Belgium left-back, who joined from Club Brugge for £17.3m on a five-year deal, has been outstanding in pre-season as Fabian Hürzeler’s side have gone unbeaten. De Cuyper capped last week’s 2-1 win over Wolfsburg with a goal and has immediately struck up an understanding with Kaoru Mitoma down the left. Hürzeler is hoping Brighton could have another gem on their hands as they prepare to welcome Fulham in their opening match on Saturday. “I’m very impressed, because he integrated as a person quite quickly, and that’s something I don’t see that often in the football business,” the Brighton head coach said. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Brighton v Fulham, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Wilson can spoil party at rejuvenated old rivals</h2> <p>Sunderland have sold their entire complement of 38,000 season tickets this summer and their 49,000-capacity Stadium of Light will be full when West Ham arrive on Saturday. After eight years away from the Premier League – including a stint in League One – they are back in the big time and have prepared themselves with 11 summer signings, five aged 21 or under, acquired for a collective sum in excess of £132m. If turning all those new faces into a functioning team will stretch Régis Le Bris’s undoubted coaching talents to the maximum, locals have reason to fear one particular visitor who recently arrived at West Ham on a free transfer. The former Newcastle and England striker Callum Wilson is now part of Graham Potter’s squad and would like little better than scoring the winning goal while eclipsing Enzo Le Fée, Granit Xhaka and the rest of Le Bris’s top-tier new boys. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Sunderland v West Ham, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Yet another new era dawns at Spurs</h2> <p>Tottenham have had more eras than Taylor Swift but without quite the same success, so the start of yet another should barely register. However, the sense persists that in Thomas Frank they have found the right manager at the right time, someone able to inspire individuals and the collective while being equally adept at finding tactical edges and solutions ­– he appears already to have inculcated set-piece prowess into his new charges. But just as they played well <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/paris-saint-germain-tottenham-uefa-super-cup-match-report">against Paris Saint-Germain</a> then contrived to lose in a manner that could only be described as classic Spurs, so Burnley at home is precisely the kind of fixture they traditionally avoid winning. Nor will it be enough just to take the points: at the start of his tenure, Ange Postecoglou was extremely successful in their accumulation, but it was obvious the run couldn’t last, and it didn’t. Frank can buy himself time with good results, but over time, he must deliver a side that play dominant football. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Tottenham v Burnley, Saturday 3pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Newcomer Trafford gets City chance</h2> <p>How different will Manchester City look at Molineux? Pep Guardiola’s side finished last season strong, barring defeat in the FA Cup final, but City sought signings after conceding they were not aggressive in the market last summer. They have added six new faces and it will be interesting if James Trafford is preferred to Ederson in goal. Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki and Rayan Aït-Nouri could also all feasibly start, the last of those against his former club. Cherki may be the most exciting of City’s new signings but Guardiola’s goalkeeping decision feels most significant. Trafford has been given the No 1 shirt but what if Ederson, such an instrumental player across six Premier League title triumphs, stays put? This week City stopped short of denying interest in Gianluigi Donnarumma as a potential replacement for the Brazilian, who is into the final 12 months of his contract. Trafford is expected to start at Wolves and a solid debut could provide Guardiola with his answer. <strong>BF</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Wolves v Manchester City, Saturday 5.30pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>Chelsea’s new strikers to thrive without Jackson</h2> <p>Nicolas Jackson being unavailable would have presented Chelsea with a headache last season. They did not have suitable cover for the striker, who remains suspended after his red card against Newcastle in May, but depth in attack is no longer an issue. Liam Delap and João Pedro joined in the summer and are competing to lead the line when Crystal Palace visit Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Both forwards did well during Chelsea’s victorious Club World Cup campaign and impressed in last weekend’s friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Milan. João Pedro scored in both warm-ups, Delap came off the bench to score against Milan and no one noticed the absence of Jackson, who was left out of the squad after indicating a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/08/nicolas-jackson-tells-chelsea-he-wants-to-leave-as-newcastle-circle">desire to leave</a> before the window shuts. <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Chelsea v Crystal Palace, Sunday 2pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Can overachieving Bees and Forest sustain progress?</h2> <p>This fixture at the City Ground features two sides whose seasons feel hard to predict. Nottingham Forest were superb last term, expressing Nuno Espírito Santo’s tactical ideas to the nth degree and adding some much-needed variety to the league. Repeating the success, though, is a harder task: opposing players now have experience of facing them and analysts have had time to identify their weaknesses. Forest still look well placed to grow: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/26/tottenham-stunned-as-morgan-gibbs-white-signs-deal-to-stay-at-nottingham-forest">retaining Morgan Gibbs-White</a> is a coup and his midfield partnership with the excellent, still-improving Elliot Anderson is good enough to compete with any in the league. Brentford, meanwhile, have lost three stalwart players with perhaps another yet to depart, as well as the manager who was at the heart of everything. Chances are the club were prepared for Thomas Frank’s departure, their processes embedded so as not to be reliant on any individual. Yet replacing him is about more than that: Keith Andrews cannot just preside over a technocracy but must embody it with soul. <strong>DH</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Nottingham Forest v Brentford, Sunday 2pm</em></p></li> </ul>    <h2>New-look United and Arsenal stir memories of ’89</h2> <p>These teams met on the opening day of 1989-90. Manchester United were useless and under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/that-1980s-sports-blog/2019/oct/04/manchester-united-start-season-30-years-ago-newcastle">new ownership</a>, so had spent heavily (which sounds familiar to modern fans) while Arsenal were champions (less so). Just as Alex Ferguson told his board drastic measures were necessary, so too has Ruben Amorim, with three new attackers arriving at no little cost. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were bought as almost-sure things, Premier League-proven and hitting their peak, but more interesting is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/manchester-united-benjamin-sesko">purchase of Benjamin Sesko</a>, a 22-year-old physical freak who looks as if he plays on fast forward. Arsenal were also interested, but their need to win immediately meant they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/26/arsenal-complete-64m-deal-to-sign-viktor-gyokeres-from-sporting-lisbon">plumped for Viktor Gyökeres</a>, his ceiling lower and natural gifts fewer, but who is already the best version of himself. Which side got the better deal will not be evident after Sunday – in August 1989, United won 4-1, then finished 13th – but it will be fascinating to see how each acquisition integrates and fares. <strong>DH</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Manchester United v Arsenal, Sunday 4.30pm</em></p></li> </ul> <h2>Can Harrison and Calvert-Lewin steal Grealish spotlight?</h2> <p>It really will be a case of friends reunited when Leeds host Everton on Monday night. While Daniel Farke hopes to be able to include Dominic Calvert-Lewin in his matchday squad, the former Goodison Park centre-forward will not be the only familiar face to be greeted by the visiting manager, David Moyes. Leeds are returning to the Premier League after a two-year absence and their winger Jack Harrison has spent those two seasons on loan at Everton. This has not gone down well with many Elland Road regulars and Harrison has been audibly booed throughout pre-season. Can the 28-year-old win the West Yorkshire public over? Given that the last time Leeds were promoted, five years ago, Covid restrictions meant games were played at empty stadiums, there should be a party atmosphere but Moyes’s marquee summer signing, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/12/jack-grealish-joins-everton-on-season-long-loan-from-manchester-city">Manchester City loanee Jack Grealish</a>, will doubtless be determined to ruin it. All eyes will inevitably be on Grealish but this could also be a big night for Calvert-Lewin and Harrison. <strong>LT</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><em>Leeds v Everton, Monday 8pm</em></p></li> </ul>
