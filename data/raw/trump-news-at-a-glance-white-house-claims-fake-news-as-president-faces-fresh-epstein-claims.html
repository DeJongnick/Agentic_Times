<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is facing a widening crisis amid a report claiming that his name appears in US justice department files about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> as Congress subpoenas testimony from Epstein accomplice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>.</p> <p>The White House sought to downplay the relationship between the US president and the disgraced financier while Trump’s spokesperson denied an account <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/justice-department-told-trump-name-in-epstein-files-727a8038?mod=hp_lead_pos1">in the Wall Street Journal</a> that the president was told in May by attorney general Pam Bondi that he is named in the Epstein files. The report says the president was told that many other high profile figures were also named and states that being mentioned in the records isn’t a sign of wrongdoing.</p> <p>“The fact is that the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep,” spokesperson Steven Cheung said. “This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.”</p> <p>A federal judge, meanwhile, denied a justice department request to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein.</p> <p>Here’s more on these and the day’s other key Trump administration stories:</p>  <h2>Trump’s name reported to feature in Epstein files</h2>  <p>Attorney general Pam Bondi has pushed back against a report claiming that Donald Trump’s name appears “multiple times”&nbsp;in US justice department files about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, saying that&nbsp;“nothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution”.</p> <p>“As part of our routine briefing, we made the president aware of the findings,” Bondi and her deputy said in a statement.</p> <p>White House spokesperson Steven Cheung said in an emailed statement: “The fact is that the President kicked him out of his club for being a creep. This is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media.”</p> <p><a
