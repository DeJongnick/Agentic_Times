<h2><strong>Operation Dark Phone: Murder By Text</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4 </strong></p> <p>EncroChat was a mobile phone network – or “the dark web in your pocket” – used by organised crime gangs across the world. But in 2020, international authorities managed to hack these phones and read messages for 74 days, many of which revealed imminent threats to life, before the criminals realised. This astonishing four-part documentary speaks to insiders about how they did it and what happened next. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>Karen Pirie</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, ITV1 </strong></p> <p>The youthful detective who specialises in cold cases tries to solve the 40-year-old kidnapping of an oil heiress and her baby. Despite diving further into the victim’s life and meeting the baby’s dad, she hits a brick wall and gets threatened with having her case closed down. Can she prove her theory? <em>Alexi Duggins </em></p> <h2><strong>The Great American Songbook With Samara Joy</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Four </strong></p>    <p>This Prom should be a real crowd-pleaser: New York jazz singer Samara Joy is only 25 but has already won five Grammys with her faithful renderings of beloved old songs. Andi Oliver introduces a performance by Joy and her octet that celebrates the legacies of Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Charles Mingus and Oscar Peterson. <em>Jack Seale </em></p> <h2><strong>The Narrow Road to the Deep North</strong></h2> <p><strong>9.15pm, BBC One </strong></p> <p>The atmospheric epic about an Australian war hero reconciling with his past continues. In the present, Dorrigo (Ciarán Hinds) is having an affair – but his mind is taken back to another illicit yet poignant entanglement he had in the 40s (with Jacob Elordi playing his younger self). We also see the full horrors that he endured while building the Burma railway.<em> HR</em></p> <h2><strong>The Veil</strong></h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>It stars Elisabeth Moss and was created by Steven Knight but this spy thriller unfortunately doesn’t live up to its pedigree. MI6 agent Imogen (Moss) and terror suspect Adilah (Yumna Marwan) keep on with their uneasy journey – but with the CIA close to a breakthrough and Imogen suspicious of Adilah’s motives, something has to give. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Live sport</strong></h2> <p><strong>Women’s International Football: Euro 2025 Final, 3.30pm, ITV1/4pm, BBC One </strong>England defend their title at St Jakob-Park in Basel, Switzerland. </p>
