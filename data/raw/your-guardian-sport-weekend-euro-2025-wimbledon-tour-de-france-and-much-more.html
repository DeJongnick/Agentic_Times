Insight and regular updates for the Women’s Euro 2025 as England and Wales kick off their campaigns against France and the Netherlands, respectively. There’s also plenty at stake as the Club World Cup reaches the quarter-final stage, with Paris Saint-Germain v Bayern Munich and Real Madrid v Borussia Dortmund to come.

The seven-time champion has his eyes firmly on another title in SW19, with no time for thoughts of retirement. “I don’t pause to reflect, to be honest. I don’t have time. I would like to,” he said. “But I think that’s going to come probably when I set the racket aside and then sip margaritas on the beach with Federer and Nadal and just reflect on our rivalry and everything.” His third-round opponent on Saturday is fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic. This will be the fourth time they have faced each other and the 25-year-old is still seeking a first win over his nation’s sporting idol. <strong>John Brewin</strong>, <strong>Alex Reid</strong>,<strong> Billy Munday</strong> and <strong>Will Magee</strong> keep the updates flowing with <strong>Tumaini Carayol</strong> and the rest of our expert team on hand at SW19.</p>   <p>11am</p> <p>NSW Waratahs v British &amp; Irish Lions live</p> <p>Rugby union</p>  <p>After two wins, a step up for the Lions against the Waratahs in Sydney, with the tourists reeling from the news that Elliot Daly, one of their form players, will miss the rest of the tour after sustaining a fractured forearm in Wednesday’s 52-12 victory over Queensland Reds. Rather than replacing the versatile England back with a like-for-like utility player such as Wales’ Blair Murray or Scotland’s Tom Jordan, the head coach, Andy Farrell, has turned to his 33-year-old son Owen to fill the gap in his squad. It is a controversial decision given Farrell’s most recent Test appearance was in the bronze medal match at the 2023 World Cup, while his ill-fated 2024-25 season with French club Racing 92 was undermined by injuries and indifferent form. Farrell brings with him the experience and leadership accumulated during 112 caps for England, whom he captained from 2018 to 2023, and will be embarking on his fourth Lions tour. Bringing you all the live action and news updates will be <strong>Lee Calvert</strong>, with <strong>Robert Kitson</strong> and <strong>Angus Fontaine</strong> reporting from the Allianz Stadium.</p> <p>12pm</p> <p>Tour de France stage one</p> <p>Cycling</p>  <p>Join <strong>Amy Sedghi</strong> for our rolling blog as Tadej Pogacar begins his bid for a fourth Tour de France title, seeking to cement his status among cycling’s greatest all-rounders, with rivals Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel hoping to find a weakness in his armour. The race’s 112th edition begins in Lille, with Slovenia’s Pogacar, triumphant in 2020, 2021 and last year, aiming to join Britain’s Chris Froome in the elite club of four-time winners. That would edge him closer to the record five titles held by Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx and Miguel Indurain. The 26-year-old world champion’s spring classics campaign featured victories at the Tour of Flanders and Liège-Bastogne-Liège plus podium slots at Milan-Sanremo and Paris-Roubaix. His dominance continued at last month’s Criterium du Dauphine, where he claimed three stages and overall victory by 59 seconds. <strong>Jeremy Whittle</strong> is our race reporter in northern France.</p> <p>3pm</p> <p>British Grand Prix qualifying live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p><strong>Billy</strong> <strong>Munday</strong> is your guide for qualifying at Silverstone where the championship leader, Oscar Piastri, can still count on plenty of support as a McLaren driver but much of the crowd, and certainly the 10,000 in the sold-out Landostand, will be cheering more for his British teammate, Lando Norris. Norris won Piastri’s home grand prix in Melbourne in March, an added incentive for the Australian at Silverstone, and the pair are turning the season into a two-horse race as the campaign reaches the halfway point. Piastri is chasing a sixth win in 12 races while Norris arrives from Austria on a high after dominating every practice session he took part in, taking pole by a huge margin and holding off his teammate to win. <strong>Giles Richards</strong> reports from trackside.</p>   <p>5pm</p> <p>Wales v Netherlands live</p> <p>Women’s Euro 2025</p>  <p><strong>Emillia Hawkins</strong> is your host and <strong>Louise Taylor</strong> reports as<strong> </strong>Wales end their long wait for a major tournament appearance against the Netherlands in Lucerne. Wales, the lowest-ranked side at Euro 2025, but have been dealt a difficult opening game against a Netherlands team littered with WSL stars. Much has been made of Rhian Wilkinson’s side’s underdog credentials, and progression from a group consisting of England, France and Dutch will be anything but easy. But the 2017 winners have looked shaky in qualification and the run-in, failing to score more than one goal in any of their qualifying group matches.</p> <p>5pm</p> <p>Paris Saint-Germain v Bayern Munich</p> <p>Club World Cup</p>  <p><strong>Barry Glendenning </strong>is your host for this heavyweight clash between the Champions League winners and Harry Kane’s German champions. Back in November, Bayern a beat 10-man PSG 1-0 but Luis Enrique’s team have been on an upward curve since then, going on to thrash Inter 5-0 at the Wembley final. The French giants beat Inter Miami 4-0 in the round of 16 to set up the quarter-final with Bayern. <strong>Sid Lowe</strong> is our match reporter.</p> <p>8pm</p> <p>France v England live</p> <p>Women’s Euro 2025</p>  <p><strong>Scott Murray </strong>is your host as<strong> </strong>England begin the defence of their Euros title against a talented France side who are recovering their poise after years of division and underachievement. The Lionesses’ buildup was hardly harmonious with key players standing down, leaving their head coach, Sarina Wiegman, to face criticism about her personal approach. The 55-year-old could lift her third straight European trophy as a coach – and first away from home – having also led her native the Netherlands to glory on home soil in 2017 but believes she has a talented squad capable of repeating the feat achieved so memorably at Wembley just under three years ago. In Zurich are <strong>Suzanne Wrack</strong>, <strong>Tom Garry</strong> and <strong>Nick Ames</strong>.</p> <p>9pm</p> <p>Real Madrid v Borussia Dortmund live</p> <p>Club World Cup</p>  <p>Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 5-2 when they met in the Champions League at the Bernabéu in October, just four months after they had faced off in the final, with Madrid again triumphing. The Spanish club secured their place in the quarters by beating Juventus 1-0 while Dortmund edged out Monterrey 2-1 to clinch a place in the last eight. The Dortmund midfielder Jobe Bellingham will miss out on a first showdown with his brother, Jude, after picking up his second booking of the competition in the Monterrey tie. <strong>Alexander Abnos </strong>returns to provide minute-by-minute updates with<strong> Sid Lowe </strong>on match report duty.</p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>8am</p> <p>Euro 2025 matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p><strong>Emillia Hawkins</strong> and <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong> will look ahead to Sunday’s big matches in Group A as Norway take on Finland at 5pm in Sion, followed by Switzerland against Iceland at 8pm in Bern. They’ll also be covering those games live, minute by minute.</p> <p>11am</p> <p> England v India live</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p><strong>Taha Hashim</strong> and <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> are on hand for over-by-over coverage of the fifth day of the second Test at Edgbaston.</p>   <p>11am</p> <p>Wimbledon live</p> <p>Tennis</p>  <p>Join <strong>Daniel Harris</strong> and <strong>John Brewin</strong> for our rolling blog on day seven of the championships with light rain showers and a gentle breeze forecast.</p> <h2></h2> <p>12pm</p> <p>Tour de France stage two live</p> <p>Cycling</p>  <p><strong>Tom Bassam</strong> is at the tiller of our rolling blog for the 212km run from Lauwin-Planque to Boulogne-sur-Mer. Looking to make an early impact will be Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard, who is enjoying smoother preparation than last year when recovering from a serious injury. The 28-year-old, who won the Tour in 2022 and 2023, suffered a concussion during March’s Paris-Nice but rebounded to take second at the Dauphine. Vingegaard will be backed by a strong Visma-Lease a Bike team featuring the Giro winner Simon Yates, 2023 Vuelta champion Sepp Kuss, two-time Paris-Nice winner Matteo Jorgenson and Wout van Aert.</p>   <p>3pm</p> <p>British Grand Prix live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton will always be the sentimental favourite at Silverstone. The last two races have been won by British drivers – George Russell for Mercedes in Canada and then McLaren’s Lando Norris last weekend. Could Hamilton make it three and send the crowd crazy? The 40-year-old won with Mercedes last year for a record ninth time and taking that tally into double figures, in what will be his first home appearance in the Italian team’s scarlet livery, would be something else. Ferrari are the only top-four team without a win this season, other than Hamilton’s Shanghai sprint success, and the seven-time world champion has yet to stand on the podium for his new employers after going 13 races without a top-three finish, a career low. Time to turn it around before an adoring home ground then, with <strong>John Brewin</strong> gripping the wheel of our lap-by-lap blog.</p> <p>5pm</p> <p>Norway v Finland live</p> <p>Women’s Euro 2025</p>  <p>Sion’s Stade Tourbillon plays host to an all-Nordic clash as the second round of group stage games get under way. Gemma Grainger’s Norway have just beaten the hosts 2-1 while Finland were also victorious in their opening game, as a Katariina Kosola screamer earned them a 1-0 win over Iceland.</p> <p>8pm</p> <p>Switzerland v Iceland live</p> <p>Women’s Euro 2025</p>  <p>Hosts Switzerland will be looking to bounce back following their defeat in their opener against Norway. Likewise, Iceland are seeking their first points after a loss in their first game against Finland.</p>
