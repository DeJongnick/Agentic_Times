<h1>WNBA 2025 season predictions: Can anyone topple the New York Liberty?</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-05-16T11:12:07Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Bryan Armen Graham, Stephanie Kaloi, Andrew Lawrence and Tiana Randall &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Sport</div>
<h2>Paige Bueckers is …</h2> <p><strong>… H-O-T-T-O-G-O! </strong>The 23-year-old rookie star showed zero signs of freshman jitters in the preseason, playing with the signature poise that made her the No 1 pick. Slotted as an opening-night starter, she’s primed to be Dallas’s primary playmaker with her efficiency and comfort on the court setting her apart early. <strong>Bryan Armen Graham</strong></p> <p><strong>... a really exciting prospect who is going to surprise people this season, but perhaps not for the reason a lot are thinking. </strong>It’s tempting to consider Bueckers’ potential this year based on the rookie year Caitlin Clark had, but the two athletes play a very different game and are very different people. Bueckers is going to be in the league a long, long time, and should be given the space to show us all what she’s made of.<strong> Stephanie Kaloi</strong></p> <p><strong>… all-in on Dallas.</strong> She’s barely been in the Metroplex a month, and already she’s been spotted behind the glass for the Dallas Stars’ NHL playoff push in a green sweater. It goes to show how committed she is to giving local sports fans a reason to forget about the Cowboys’ woes and the Luka trade, and don’t be surprised if she becomes the next Dallas star to take home rookie of the year honors after the Cowboys’ Micah Parsons. <strong>Andrew Lawrence</strong></p> <p><strong>... will need to adjust to a different role at the pro level.</strong> Bueckers was the record-breaking leader of the UConn Huskies, leading Geno Auriemma’s team <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/06/uconn-win-ncaa-womens-tournament-2025">to an NCAA championship</a> in her final season. Now with Dallas, she’ll likely take a backseat to veteran Arike Ogunbowale. Her role may shift to more of a facilitator, complementing Ogunbowale’s scoring prowess. This backcourt duo should position Ogunbowale as the star, with Bueckers as her trusted sidekick. <strong>Tiana Randall</strong></p> <h2>What I’m most looking forward to</h2> <p><strong>The evolution of the Indiana Fever under Caitlin Clark’s leadership.</strong> With strategic veteran additions like DeWanna Bonner and Natasha Howard, and a new head coach in Stephanie White, the Fever are poised to transition from a promising team to legitimate contenders. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>This season is absolutely one of the most exciting in recent memory.</strong> There are tons of things I’m most looking forward to: seeing how Natalie Nakase figures out how to unlock the Valkyries earlier in the game, witnessing what might be one of the greatest Indiana Fever seasons in franchise history, and watching the women in the league collectively step into their power and demand their worth with the upcoming CBA negotiations. This is a very, very exciting time for the W. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>The new-look LA Sparks.</strong> Until Luka was shipped to Los Angeles, the biggest basketball trade going was the one that sent Kelsey Plum to the Sparks a day earlier. After suffering their first single-digit win season in franchise history, the Sparks are hoping Plum can reprise her championship-winning chemistry with top scorer Dericka Hamby and reignite Cameron Brink – the outstanding big whose rookie season was cut short by an ACL tear. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p><strong>I’m eager to see Kate Martin step into her leadership role with the expansion Golden State Valkyries.</strong> Despite being overshadowed by Caitlin Clark at Iowa and a star-studded Aces roster, Martin’s playmaking ability shined through. With a fresh start, along with new coaches and ownership, it’s her chance to rise or fold under pressure. <strong>TR</strong></p>    <h2>Biggest offseason development</h2> <p><strong>The Aces’ acquisition of Jewell Loyd in a major three-team trade. </strong>This move aims to bolster their offensive firepower and support A’ja Wilson as they seek redemption after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/07/las-vegas-aces-dynasty-new-york-liberty-wnba-playoffs">a disappointing 2024 semi-final exit</a>.<strong> BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Clearly, <a href="https://people.com/caitlin-clark-working-in-gym-fans-wowed-arm-muscles-11695023">Caitlin Clark’s arms</a>! </strong>But in all seriousness, that <a href="https://www.wnba.com/news/phoenix-mercury-acquire-thomas-sabally">monster four-team trade</a> involving the Mercury, Sun, Fever and Wings is going to be looked back on as the catalyst that sparked whatever happens this season. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>Surely it was <strong>the harassment and bullying scandal that engulfed the Seattle Storm</strong> just as the season ended. The juiciest news line to come out of it was the suggestion that coach Noelle Quinn cut back on Jewell Loyd’s minutes expressly to prevent the perennial all-star from earning a scoring-related performance bonus from Nike. Even though Loyd’s agent would dispute that story, it ultimately resulted in her trade to Las Vegas – where she figures to flourish alongside reigning MVP A’ja Wilson. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p>The offseason shook things up, highlighting <strong>two new teammate couples</strong>: Isabelle Harrison and Natasha Cloud (Liberty) and Dijonai Carrington and Nalyssa Smith (Wings). While professionalism is expected, past incidents suggest personal bonds can blur competitive dynamics. Smith once defended Carrington in on-court confrontations, even against her own teammates. It’s uncharted territory for the league. Will these dynamics impact team chemistry? <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>The surprise team will be …</h2> <p>How about the <strong>Dallas Wings</strong>?<strong> </strong>After a challenging 9–31 season, the infusion of talent like Bueckers, Dijonai Carrington and Myisha Hines-Allen, combined with new leadership, positions them as potential disruptors in the league.<strong> BAG</strong></p> <p>I think the <strong>Golden State Valkyries</strong> are really going to surprise people. I have been saying this for months: being an expansion team in 2025 is not the same as being an expansion team in 2008. Judging Golden State by Atlanta Dream’s early struggles is a mistake. This team has all the backing from a financial and staffing perspective they could hope for: from 18,000-strong crowds at preseason games to a solid roster of talent that is hungry to prove detractors wrong. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Phoenix Mercury</strong>. Sure, they lost franchise pillars Diana Taurasi to retirement and Brittney Griner to free agency – but incoming all-stars Satou Sally and Alyssa Thomas should have no trouble filling those voids while playing alongside team cornerstone Kaleah Copper – a finals MVP in 2021 with the Chicago Sky. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Washington Mystics</strong> missed the playoffs last year as the 11th seed, but there’s real progress happening. Rookies Sonia Citron and Kiki Iriafen are meshing well with veterans like Britney Sykes and Aliyah Edwards. Their strong preseason showing against the Indiana Fever hints at top-three seed potential, with sharp communication, smart passing and disciplined shot selection. <strong>TR</strong></p>    <h2>One bold prediction</h2> <p><strong>The Valkyries will defy expectations and secure a playoff spot in their debut WNBA season.</strong> Despite projections as a bottom-three team, their aggressive defensive playstyle and emerging chemistry will push them past more established franchises, making them the league’s biggest surprise of 2025. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>The Fever will win the Commissioner’s Cup in the turning point of the season for Caitlin Clark.</strong> The new Indiana line-up is exciting but the team will take a few weeks to gel; by the time the in-season tournament rolls around in mid-June, they’re going to be a very different beast. The Lynx won it last year and it was a springboard to their run to the WNBA finals; expect the same for the Fever this season. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>The Connecticut Sun, who are exploring a potential sale and relocation, wind up moving to Philly for big money</strong>, giving the athletic department at the University of South Carolina yet another reason to worry about losing Dawn Staley. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p><strong>I predict the Aces will struggle with a “too many cooks in the kitchen” dilemma this season</strong>, similar to the Lakers’ star-studded 2025 roster. With Jewell Loyd joining Chelsea Gray, A’ja Wilson and others, I’m not sure Becky Hammon can optimize each player ... or if former stars will accept reduced roles. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>Most Valuable Player</h2> <p>One year after becoming only the second player to win the MVP trophy <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/awards/awards_2024.html">by a unanimous vote</a>, <strong>A’ja Wilson</strong> remains the engine of the Aces’ title pursuit. With Becky Hammon’s system built around her dominance and the addition of Jewell Loyd to lighten the offensive pressure, Wilson will edge Collier and Clark in a close race to become the first four-time MVP in WNBA history. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>I am not the type of person who thinks a new person should win MVP just because someone else has won it a few times already. And just like the Liberty are the best team in the league until proven otherwise, A’ja Wilson is the top player until someone else shows they’re moving in on her spot. Having said that, if/when the Fever take home the Commissioner’s Cup title, <strong>Caitlin Clark</strong> will become a serious MVP threat. I think she’ll win it this season. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Caitlin Clark</strong>. She’s rested, stronger and a much smarter player from her bruising rookie campaign. What’s more, she’ll only benefit from playing alongside veteran newcomers Sydney Colson, Natasha Howard and DeWanna Bonner – among Clark’s biggest ops last season. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p><strong>Napheesa Collier</strong>. I feel like she’s been passed up for the opportunity for way too long. For one, her playmaking ability is what led the Lynx to the finals last year, where they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/oct/20/new-york-liberty-wnba-champions-game-report">came within a couple plays</a> of winning it all. With her knowledge, on-ball skills, team leadership and what she’s done with her off-season training with Unrivaled, I think she’s the easy pick this year. <strong>TR</strong></p>    <h2>Playoff semi-finalists</h2> <p>Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Indiana Fever, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty, Seattle Storm. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p>Indiana Fever, Las Vegas Aces, Minnesota Lynx, New York Liberty. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2><strong>Your champion will be …</strong></h2> <p>Redemption is the word for the <strong>Minnesota Lynx</strong>. After a heartbreaking one-possession loss in the 2024 WNBA finals, Cheryl Reeve’s squad returns its full starting lineup, anchored by MVP contender Napheesa Collier. The addition of Karlie Samuelson’s three-point shooting boosts an already cohesive roster. Despite losing Dorka Juhász for the season and Kayla McBride’s late arrival, the Lynx remain loaded, with Diamond Miller and Alissa Pili poised for breakout seasons. In a league spotlighting New York’s firepower and Indiana’s rising star Caitlin Clark, it’s the Lynx who look best positioned to finish the job. A year wiser and driven by unfinished business, Minnesota is primed to seize the moment and win a record fifth WNBA title in 2025. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Indiana Fever. </strong>A few key elements have to fall into place, but the Fever have potential that’s off the charts. Whether you like her or not, it’s difficult to deny that Clark is more than a generational talent: she’s playing basketball unlike <em>any</em> woman who has come before her. Her ability to shoot off the dribble from so far, at any point and any time, is unprecedented in the women’s game, and the rest of her team is talented and complete, to the point that their wins and losses will be based on their <em>own </em>synergy. The Fever are hungry, they are the most complete team in the league, and now it’s just a matter of putting the puzzle together. And coach Stephanie White might just be one of the strongest masterminds in the game right now. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Minnesota Lynx</strong>. They’ve got the best coach (Cheryl Reeve), arguably the best all-around player (Napheesa Collier) and a core that’s still smarting over last season’s narrow loss to New York in the WNBA finals. If they can start as well as they finished the 2024 season and keep the momentum going through September, there’s no reason why they shouldn’t be the team throwing the confetti party this time around. <strong>AL</strong></p> <p>With the addition of Natasha Cloud and the return of French Olympian Marine Johannès, I think the <strong>New York Liberty</strong> will not only be entertaining to watch but will also feed off each other, focusing on more structure and defensive depth. Sabrina Ionescu is a three-point star with shot-making ability, and with Johannès, who can do what Ionescu does if not better, the team gains even more depth and offensive power. They’ve already seen the benefits of being champions, not just socially but also through tangible rewards: numerous brand partnerships, a new practice facility and a stronger roster. I think they’ll be chasing that feeling for as long as they can. <strong>TR</strong></p>
