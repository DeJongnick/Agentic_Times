When mass unemployment struck in the 1980s, Norman Tebbit advised people to follow the example of his father, who responded to the 1930s depression by getting on his bike and looking for work. During the early years of the coalition, five ambitious backbenchers co-authored<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19300051"> a book </a>called Britannia Unchained saying British workers were “among the worst idlers in the world”. All of the authors later became ministers, three achieved ‘great office of state’ level (Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel and Dominic Raab) and one became prime minister (Liz Truss).</p> <p>Now another Tory has trode down this path. In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20gkme83mxo">an interview</a> with the BBC’s Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast, <strong>Chris Philp</strong>, the shadow home secretary, said.</p> <p>Asked if he thought a “belief in hard work” was missing today, Philp replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>I do a bit. There are nine million working age adults who are not working. And as we compete globally with countries like, you know, South Korea, China, India, you know, we need a work ethic. We need everybody to be making a contribution. … we need to lift our game and to up our game.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In reponse, a <strong>Labour</strong> spokesperson said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Chris Philp was the architect of the Liz Truss budget which crashed the economy and sent family mortgages rocketing.</p> <p>After the Conservatives’ economic failure left working people worse off, it takes some real brass neck for the Tory top team to tell the public that it’s really all their fault.</p> </blockquote> <p>In fact <strong>Philp</strong> dealt with this allegation in his interview. He was chief secretary to the Treasury under Truss, and at the time of the mini-budget. He said that when the mini-budget was being planned, he argued that the tax cuts it contained had to be balanced by spending cuts. His advice was ignored, he said.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>I was making the case that tax cuts…need to be accompanied by spending control or spending reductions … in order to show that the books are being balanced and to avoid the market reaction that we saw …</em></p> <p><em>I made that case internally … but it wasn’t unfortunately listened to. I think had my suggestions been listened to a bit earlier, then there was a there’s a much higher chance that [the mini-budget] would have worked. And it’ll be always a matter of regret that those points weren’t taken on board.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>In his account of the Truss premiership, Truss at 10, Anthony Seldon also describes Philp as one of the Tories trying to make the mini-budget more balanced.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-01-31T11:51:57.906Z">at 11.51am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-679cac2b8f082de27d7ffd7a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-01-31T10:59:39.362Z">10.59am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Why Tories think fifth anniversary of Brexit should be celebrated</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Since only around one person in 10 thinks Brexit has been a success, it is worth recording why the <strong>Conservative party</strong> says the fifth anniversary is worth celebrating.

It is five years to the day since the UK left the European Union. Despite complaints from some of the pro-Brexit papers, Keir Starmer and the government are not planning anything today to mark the occasion – which is not surprising because polling suggests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jan/29/reeves-economic-growth-speech-pmqs-heathrow-uk-politics-live-news-updates?page=with:block-679a3ccd8f082bd5ac0edef4#block-679a3ccd8f082bd5ac0edef4">only 11% of the population believe that it has been a success</a>, and most people now think that, when voters followed the advice of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Nigel Farage, they made a mistake.</p> <p>Still, in some parts of British politics Brexit has long ceased being a policy option, and become more of a cult, and some supporters of Brexit have been marking the anniversary with statements defending the policy. But, in the Conservative party, that has all gone a bit haywire.</p> <p>Yesterday afternoon the Conservative party released an embargoed press release from <strong>Priti Patel</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, saying Tories were celebrating the fifth anniversary. She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Five years ago today, the Conservatives honoured the democratic will of the British people and Got Brexit Done.</p> <p>Since then, our country has reaped the benefits—securing new trade deals with dynamic, fast-growing markets across the world and reclaiming sovereignty from Brussels. This has allowed us to reform or revoke 2,500 EU laws, ensuring Britain’s future is shaped by our own parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Patel was also recording an interview with <strong>Harry Cole</strong>, political editor of the Sun, for his Never Mind the Ballots TV show, and she got into trouble when asked by Cole why immigration had soared since the UK left the EU. Cole confronted her with this graph and said that, while the Tories had ended free movement for Europeans, they “threw the borders open for the rest of the world”. He said net migration was going up to 1.2m a year, and claimed the new arrivals were going to “take jobs that you promised were going to go to Sun readers and people who voted for Brexit”.</p>    <p>Patel said at one point she was “not fine” with those figures. But, generally, she defended the rise in net migration, saying that Brexit was always about having a new immigration policy and that, with a points-based system, the UK was now able to take in “the brightest and the best”.</p> <p>To compound her error (in CCHQ terms), when asked if she would apologise to Brexit voters “for the fact that you misled them [about what would happen to migration numbers]”, Patel refused, saying the question was “totally disortionary”.</p> <p>Here is the key exchange.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/TalkTV/status/1885030856399688086">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Totally distortionary!&quot;<br><br>Watch the moment Priti Patel earns herself a telling off from Tory leader Kemi Badenoch, after denying the previous government had “thrown open our borders” to the rest of the world.<br><br>📺WATCH: <a href="https://t.co/Io5NfLjlZB">https://t.co/Io5NfLjlZB</a><a href="https://twitter.com/MrHarryCole?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MrHarryCole</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSun?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheSun</a></p>&mdash; Talk (@TalkTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/TalkTV/status/1885030856399688086?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Patel was home secretary for three years during this period and was concerned to defend her record. She was right to say that, while some people were voting for Brexit in 2016 for lower immigration, others were less concerned about numbers and more interested in just having a migration system over which the UK government had full control. But her line was at odds with what Kemi Badenoch has been saying about the Tories’ immigration policy, and she was quickly rebuked by her leader. As <strong>Kevin Schofield</strong> reports<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/badenoch-slaps-down-priti-patel-for-defending-last-tory-governments-immigration-record_uk_679bc344e4b0ea7115657bd8"> for HuffPost UK</a>, <strong>Badenoch’s spokesperson</strong> issued a statement saying in effect that Patel was wrong.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>As Kemi said when she committed to a hard cap on visas in November, under her leadership the Conservative party will tell the truth about the mistakes we made.</p> <p>While the last Conservative government may have tried to control numbers, we did not deliver.</p> </blockquote> <p>Patel also ended up issuing <a href="https://x.com/pritipatel/status/1885013240456835212">a clarification statement on social media</a> that was almost as embarrassing as Peter Mandelson’s recent kowtow.</p> <p>So, it’s not a happy Brexit day so far in Toryland.</p> <p>The Commons is not sitting this morning, and the political diary is relatively empty.
