<p>A Republican push to dismantle clean energy incentives threatens to reverberate across the US by costing more than 830,000 jobs, raising energy bills for US households and threatening to unleash millions more tonnes of the planet-heating pollution that is causing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-crisis">climate crisis</a>, experts have warned.</p> <p>A major tax bill passed by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a>-held House of Representatives on Thursday morning will, as currently written, demolish key components of climate legislation signed by Joe Biden that has spurred a record torrent of renewable energy and electric vehicle investment in the US.</p> <p>Under the reconciliation bill, tax credits for cleaner cars will end this year, with incentives for wind, solar and even nuclear energy projects scaled down and then eliminated by 2032. Clean energy manufacturing tax credits will be axed by 2031, while Americans seeking to upgrade their homes to cleaner or more energy efficient appliances will get no further subsidy after the end of this year.</p> <p>“This bill is worse than what people envisioned – it pulls the rug out from facilities banking on these incentives, it raises everyday household costs by hundreds of dollars and undercuts any sort of action on climate change,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan climate policy thinktank.</p>    <p>“You can’t overstate how significant this will be in weakening the US’s position. With inflation, tariffs and rising electricity use, it really couldn’t come at a worse time. It’s a really damaging bill.”</p> <p>Since the passage of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, more than $320bn has flowed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/31/clean-energy-spending-republicans-trump">mostly to Republican-held districts</a> in the form of new clean energy development and electric car construction. A further $522bn in investment is in the pipeline but is now menaced by the Republican bill’s removal of tax incentives.</p> <p>“You’re talking about half a trillion dollars of investment at risk from these changes,” said Orvis. “Over 10 years, we found that these changes would reduce US GDP by over $1tn.”</p> <p>The legislation also follows months of attacks on green spending from the Trump administration, including the end of energy efficiency programs and climate-focused grantmaking and loans.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/LqqTr/2/" data-alt="A stacked bar chart showing how the proposed reconciliation bill is expected to increase energy bills"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/LqqTr/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“If you take all of that together, all of these pieces have the same effect: it’s going to increase prices on everybody,” one former senior Department of Energy official said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/21/nasa-giss-lab-trump-shut-down-james-hansen">Godfather of climate science decries Trump plan to shut Nasa lab above Seinfeld diner: ‘It’s crazy’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Republicans wrangled over how far to slash the IRA’s tax credits.The bill as it stands will cause Americans’ energy bills to spike by stymying new renewable energy – often the cheapest form of new electricity generation – the non-partisan thinktank <a href="https://energyinnovation.org/report/assessing-impacts-of-the-2025-reconciliation-bill-on-u-s-energy-costs-jobs-health-and-emissions/">Energy Innovation calculated</a>. The average household will see their bills rise by more than $230 by 2035. This comes on top of the cost of tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, who has attempted to aggressively push the US to “drill, baby, drill” for more oil and gas at the expense of solar and wind, which he has called “ugly” and “disgusting” and barred from federal lands and waters.</p> <p>“This will all come at the expense of the environment,” said Orvis.</p> <p>The new bill will also cause the US to emit 260m tonnes more pollution than it would’ve otherwise in 2035, which is more than the entire annual emissions of Spain. While emissions would still decline overall, the US is cutting pollution far too slowly to avert the worst impacts from the heatwaves, floods, drought and other disasters fueled by global heating.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kKzhe/1/" data-alt="A line chart showing how the reconciliation bill could undermine efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kKzhe/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>And the legislation will cost the US 830,000 jobs by 2030 compared with the status quo, Energy Innovation found. That includes the direct loss of jobs in fields such as solar panel manufacturing and electric vehicle production, indirect job loss from the decreased investments and lower clean energy demand, and induced cuts resulting from consumer spending cuts attributable to layoffs, higher fuel costs, and other third-order effects.</p> <p>“The Inflation Reduction Act was carefully crafted to create good-paying jobs in deindustrialized communities, underserved communities, and coal communities. We have seen that it is doing just that, creating good jobs you don’t need a college degree to get and opening up pathways to the middle class across the nation,” said Ted Fertik, vice-president of manufacturing and industrial policy at climate and labor advocacy group Blue Green Alliance. “Killing the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act is a direct attack on working Americans.”</p> <p>Other experts have also warned about the devastating consequences of the legislation. By 2028, the reconciliation bill would kill approximately 300,000 jobs in the solar and energy storage sectors, found <a href="https://underthreat.seia.org/threat/">an analysis from the industry group Solar Energy Industries Association</a> (SEIA) released on Monday.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/hoo79/1/" data-alt="Line chart showing how the proposed reconciliation bill would slash hundreds of thousands of domestic jobs "> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/hoo79/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Organized labor is <a href="https://jacobin.com/2025/05/building-trades-ira-climate-biden">increasingly speaking out against</a> the megabill.
