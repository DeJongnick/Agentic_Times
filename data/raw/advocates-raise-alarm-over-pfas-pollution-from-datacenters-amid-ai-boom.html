<p>Datacenters’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/10/energy-demands-from-ai-datacentres-to-quadruple-by-2030-says-report">electricity demands</a> have been accused of delaying the US’s transition to clean energy and requiring fossil fuel plants to stay online, while their high level of water consumption has also raised alarm. Now public health advocates fear another environmental problem could be linked to them – Pfas “forever chemical” pollution.</p> 
<p>Big tech companies like Google, Microsoft and Amazon often need datacenters to store servers and networking equipment that process the world’s digital traffic, and the artificial intelligence boom is driving demand for more facilities.</p> 
<p>Advocates are particularly concerned over the facilities’ use of Pfas gas, or f-gas, which can be potent greenhouse gases, and may mean datacenters’ climate impact is worse than previously thought. Other f-gases turn into a type of dangerous compound that is rapidly accumulating across the globe.</p>

<p>No testing for Pfas air or water pollution has yet been done, and companies are not required to report the volume of chemicals they use or discharge. But some environmental groups are starting to push for state legislation that would require more reporting.</p> 
<p>Advocates’ concern increased in mid-September when the Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-prioritizes-review-new-chemicals-used-data-center-projects-supporting-american">announced</a> it would fast-track review of new Pfas and other chemicals used by datacenters. The datacenter industry <a href="https://www.datacenterfrontier.com/sponsored/article/33035570/understanding-pfas-concerns-for-two-phase-cooling-of-data-centers">has said</a> the Pfas it uses causes minimal pollution, but advocates disagree.</p> 
<p>“We know there are Pfas in these centers and all of that has to go somewhere,” said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, an attorney with the Earthjustice non-profit, which is monitoring Pfas use in datacenters. “This issue has been dangerously understudied as we have been building out datacenters, and there’s not adequate information on what the long term impacts will be.”</p> 
<p>Pfas are a class of about 16,000 chemicals most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. The compounds have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment.</p> 
<p>Environmental advocates say the datacenters increase Pfas pollution directly and indirectly. The chemicals are needed in the centers’ operations – such as its cooling equipment – which almost certainly leads to some on-site pollution. Meanwhile, Pfas used in the equipment housed in the centers must be disposed of, which is difficult because the chemicals cannot be fully destroyed. Meanwhile, a large quantity of Pfas are used to produce the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/24/pfas-toxic-waste-pollution-regulation-lobbying">semiconductors housed in datacenters</a>, which will increase pollution around supporting manufacturing plants.</p> 
<p>The revelations come as the US seeks an edge over China as the industry leader in AI, and there has been little political interest in reining in the centers’ pollution.</p> 
<p>“The US and China are racing to see who can destroy the environment most quickly,” said Lenny Siegel, a member of Chips Communities United, a group working with industry and administration officials to try to implement environmental safeguards. “If we had a sensible approach to these things then someone would have to present some answers before they develop and use these systems.”</p> 
<p>Two kinds of cooling systems are used to prevent the semiconductors and other electronic equipment stored in datacenters from overheating. Water cooling systems require huge volumes of water, and <a href="https://cleanwater.org/publications/data-centers-threat-minnesotas-water">chemicals</a> like nitrates, disinfectants, azoles and other compounds are potentially added and discharged in the environment.</p> 
<p>Many centers are now switching to a “two phase” system that uses f-gas as a refrigerant coolant that is run through copper tubing. In this scenario, f-gas is not intentionally released during use, though there may be leaks, and it must be disposed of at the end of its life.</p> 
<p>The datacenter industry has claimed that f-gas that escapes is not a threat because, once in the air, it <a href="https://ozone.unep.org/system/files/documents/2023_ATMO-Network_Nairobi_HansPeterArp.pdf">turns into a compound called Tfa</a>. Tfa is considered a Pfas in most of the world, but not the US. <a href="https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/66717b9a01103d79c57ccb54">Recent research</a> has found it is more toxic than previously thought, and may impact reproductive systems similar to other Pfas.</p> 
<p>Researchers in recent years have been <a href="https://www.pan-europe.info/sites/pan-europe.info/files/public/resources/reports/Report_TFA_The%20Forever%20Chemical%20%20in%20the%20Water%20We%20Drink.pdf">alarmed</a> by the ever-growing level of Tfa in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/16/detroit-tfa-forever-chemical">air</a>, <a href="https://pan-europe.email-provider.eu/link/3xt9c0vpiv/sjcp2aqn2o/hmphfsarnd/df12o4firx/rag99rvout">water</a>, human <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/may/01/rapidly-rising-levels-of-tfa-forever-chemical-alarm-experts">blood</a> and elsewhere in the environment. Meanwhile, some f-gases are potent greenhouse gases that can remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years. But f-gasses are lucrative for industry: about 60% of all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/pfas">Pfas</a> manufactured from 2019 to 2022 were f-gas.</p> 
<p>Different Pfas are also applied to datacenters’ cables, piping and electronic equipment. The chemicals are volatile, meaning they can simply move into the air from the equipment.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, any of that equipment or Pfas waste that is intentionally removed from datacenters either ends up in landfills, where it can pollute local waters, or is incinerated, according to industry documents. But incineration does not fully destroy Pfas compounds – it breaks them into smaller pieces that are still Pfas, or other byproducts with unknown health risks.</p> 
<p>Datacenters are a “huge generator of electronic waste, with frequent upgrades to new equipment”, said Mike Belliveau, the founder of the Bend the Curve non-profit who has lobbied on toxic chemical legislation.</p> 
<p>“The processing and disposal of electronic waste is a major source of global harm,” he added.</p> 
<p>F-gas producer Chemours is using the boom in AI and datacenters as justification for increasing production at its Parkersburg, West Virginia, and Fayetteville, North Carolina, plants.</p> 
<p>Both plants have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/27/chemours-pfas-pollution-lawsuit">accused of</a> polluting their regions’ water, soil and air, and poisoning drinking water. Residents in both regions say they’ve <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jul/12/north-carolina-pfas-toxic-forever-chemicals-cancer">been sickened by Chemours’s pollution</a>. Chemours’s expansion plans have been met with opposition over fears that its pollution will also increase.</p> 
<p>A new coalition of Minnesota environmental groups is working with state lawmakers to develop legislation that would require companies to report on their use of Pfas and other chemicals in the cooling process.</p> 
<p>Legislators in state hearings have asked tech companies which chemicals are used in datacenters and how they are disposed of, but “the answers are not satisfactory”, said Avonna Starck, Minnesota state director for Clean Water Action, which is spearheading the effort.</p> 
<p>“There’s so much you just don’t know and we’re at the whim of these big corporations and what they’re willing to tell us,” Starck said. “We think the community has a right to know these things.”</p>
