    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - In 1993, when Marseille beat Milan. They remain the only French club to have won the competition., 2:A - When it comes to wins in the three Grand Tours, Italian riders lead the way with 85. France (51), Spain (48), Belgium (33) and Great Britain (11) make up the top five. , 3:B - He needed three stitches on his forehead. Keane is on something of a hot streak, having also won the Israeli league last year with Maccabi Tel Aviv., 4:B - Blackstenius was due a good result in a final – she has lost two Olympic finals with Sweden., 5:D - The other three won playoff finals this season., 6:B - A ball boy fetched them from the dressing rooms. “It probably relaxed me going into the match because it was such a funny thing,” she said. “I’m just happy to get through. I’ll remember my rackets next time.” , 7:A - “It’s tough on Emma as I still feel everyone is living in 2021,” said Petchey. “The games have changed massively. The balls are four times heavier than back in 2021 and Emma isn’t the biggest hitter. If you can’t put the ball through the court on a windy, heavy clay court day against someone like Iga, you’re going to get into all sorts of trouble.” , 8:C - Gilmour and McTominay joined Napoli on the same day., 9:C - Reina was given a standing ovation as he left the pitch., 10:B - Rozentals says he started posting “spicy content” to fund his “ultimate dream of going to the Olympics”. He has made more than £100,000 this year on the site – a lot more than the £16,000 funding available from Paddle UK – but his dream may be drifting down the drain. , 11:A - The East Midlands is leading the way. , 12:D - Fiorentina lost the European Cup final in 1957, the Cup Winners' Cup final in 1962, the Uefa Cup final in 1990 and the Conference League final in 2023 and 2024. , 13:B - Spanish teams were on a run of 27 straight wins against teams from other countries – dating back to Liverpool beating Alavés 5-4 in the Uefa Cup final in 2001. , 14:D - Tyson was 20 years and four months old when he became world champion in 1986; Itauma passed that age on Saturday., 15:C - The 17-year-old says his grandmother, Fatima, keeps his feet on the ground. When he offered to buy her a house she refused, saying she preferred to stay in Rocafonda, the working-class neighbourhood in Mataró, a coastal town north of Barcelona. True to his origins, Lamine Yamal celebrates his goals with his hands forming the numbers 304, the Rocafonda postal code. By the way, he is a big fan of Eminem.</p>
