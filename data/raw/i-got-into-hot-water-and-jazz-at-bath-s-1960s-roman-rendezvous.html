<p>Amanda Hart, director of archaeology at the Roman baths in Bath, need not go back to Seneca to find evidence of music at the baths (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/20/singing-in-the-bath-summer-gigs-bring-noise-back-to-baths-roman-attraction">Singing in the bath: summer gigs bring noise back to Bath’s Roman attraction, 20 July</a>).</p> <p>In 1963, as part of the Bath festival, a Roman Rendezvous was&nbsp;held in the evenings at the great bath, when a jazz group played. There was dancing, food on&nbsp;offer, and – best of all – swimming&nbsp;in the bath.</p> <p>I was doing my teacher training at Newton Park (now Bath Spa University) and this event was the festival highlight for me, as I sat up to my neck in very hot water, chatting to friends and revelling in the music, the fun – and the thought that I was following in the footsteps of well-to-do Romans!<br><strong>Barbara Penrose</strong> <br><em>Leicester</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
