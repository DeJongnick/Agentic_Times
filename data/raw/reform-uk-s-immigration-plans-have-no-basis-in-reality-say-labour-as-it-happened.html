Most of the public agree it is fair that people living here can apply to settle permanently after five years. The uncertainty this proposal creates for people who have already built their lives here – Hongkongers, EU citizens who came before Brexit and others – is unfair and must be resolved with urgency.</p> <p>The government needs to speed up its own consultations on citizenship reforms to reduce that anxiety. It should immediately make clear that it rejects in principle and practice Reform’s proposals to remove and unsettle the status and rights of people who hold settled status now.</p> <p>Public attitudes research by Focaldata for British Future finds that 59% of the public, (and 64% of 2024 Labour voters) agree that migrants living in the UK and paying taxes should be eligible to apply for citizenship after five years or less.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://x.com/stellacreasy/status/1970137512271101985">From</a> the Labour MP <strong>Stella Creasy</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Reform’s call to deport ALL people who legally make a life here - paying taxes, forming families, volunteering and even being elected - needs calling out. </p> <p>Contrary to Farage, ILR doesn’t = criminal. They ARE net contributors to our economy.</p> <p>An expensive, hateful &amp; stupid plan.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/colinyeo.bsky.social/post/3lzfyy6am5c2f">From</a> <strong>Colin Yeo</strong>, an immigration barrister, in response to a poster on Bluesky saying the plan is impossible</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It’s quite do-able from a legal perspective. I don’t think dismissing Reform in this way is wise. Voters need to understand that this stuff can happen if they vote for it - and that it would be morally, socially, culturally, economically disastrous. So they shouldn’t vote for it.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It’s not a gimmick. It’s a repudiation of 75 years of integration. It’s a betrayal of the Windrush generation. It’s unfair and it’s un-British.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Mass deportation is possible. It’s important to understand what it would really involve. Both the ideology of racial and national purity that drives it and what carrying it out really means in practice. Camps, barbed wire, goon squads, depossessed people who lose everything they know</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://x.com/BNHWalker/status/1970070722463793518">From</a> the New Statesman’s <strong>Ben Walker</strong></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Abolishing indefinite leave to remain makes it personal. Meat to the core who’ve never met an immigrant but uncomfortable to a great many more. V easy for opponents to humanise this.

The SNP’s auditors, Johnson Carmichael, also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/apr/07/snps-auditor-resigns-after-police-raid-on-sturgeon-and-murrells-home">quit after more than a decade in the role.</a></p> <p>Swinney has been credited with restoring stability to the party’s management and governance, but the challenge of preparing for the 2026 Holyrood elections remains significant. The SNP’s once-feared electoral machine now appears out-dated and underpowered.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68d150388f08d2eb8068d395" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/peterwalker"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-22T13:42:44.833Z">2.42pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Lib Dems call for British laws to be 'Trump-proofed' to stop ministers lobbying on behalf of foreign governments</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Peter Walker is a senior Guardian political correspondent.</em></p> <p>The Liberal Democrats have called for new measures to stop government ministers lobbying on behalf of foreign powers in yet another attack on Nigel Farage and Reform at the party’s conference in Bournemouth.</p> <p>It came in a speech by <strong>Calum Miller</strong>, the party’s foreign affairs spokesperson, who billed as a way of “Trump-proofing” the UK.

(See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/22/reform-labour-keir-starmer-nigel-farage-immigration-latest-uk-politics-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d1181b8f0860647077a116#block-68d1181b8f0860647077a116">10.52am</a>.) That won’t bother the Reform UK leader. As he showed at the press conference, he enthusiastically embraces controversy, and, like Donald Trump, he is quite happy to leverage chaos and outrage as a way maximising the attention grab.</p> <p>Farage was interesting in landing two big-picture messages: that legal immigration has been bad for the economy of the UK, contrary to mainstream economic thinking; and that Reform will go much further than other parties by getting rid of indefinite leave to remain, requiring “hundreds of thousands” of people to leave or face deportation.</p> <p>On the first point, here is a chart showing why economists and politicians have for years regarded controlled immigration as an economic benefit. Put simply, native Britons are a drain on the taxpayer until they start working (because they have to be educated etc, while paying no tax), while migrants normally arrive as working-age adults. This chart, from a <strong>Migration Observatory</strong> <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-in-the-uk/">report</a>, says that it is only if an average-wage migrant worker lives to be 92 or older that they become a net cost to the taxpayer.</p>    <p>Farage is arguing that this consensus view is wrong. But he is basing this claim on a figuure in a Centre for Policy Studies report that has been withdrawn by the thinktank. </p> <p><strong>Jonathan Portes</strong>, the professor and former government economist, has written a detail critique of the CPS paper and he has posted a link to it on Bluesky.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Portes' tweet">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bluesky-embed&quot; data-bluesky-uri=&quot;at://did:plc:td7ymvnnntooulzpovf6u6sd/app.bsky.feed.post/3lzfsoicfbk2z&quot; data-bluesky-cid=&quot;bafyreihnwf4uwd4xea3lfl4wocv6mc2a7tj2m7hdvkrkesvvwyhe3emb6q&quot; data-bluesky-embed-color-mode=&quot;system&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;My analysis here not only explains why the CPS numbers are wrong - but estimates that if they&amp;#x27;d got their own arithmetic right, they would have concluded that migrants are a large long-term fiscal *benefit*.

Reform says that it will not just get rid of indefinite leave to remain for future applicants; it will rescind it for people who currently qualify.</p> <p>Understandably, there were a lot of questions about the essential unfairness of retrospective legislation of this kind, and whether Farage would be happy to see pensioners, or Ukrainians, deported as a result. <strong>Farage</strong> relished the row. <strong> </strong>“You talk to me about a sense of fair play,” he told one reporters. “Yes, you’re quite right, a fair play to British people who’ve been priced out of the market.”</p> <p>But it remains to be seen whether Farage will remain committed to this aspect of the policy. He has a track record of turning up to events like this and making provocative announcements, only for the more extreme bits to be dropped soon afterwards. Stopping small boats in two weeks? That turned out to mean <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c237k55y90ko">two weeks after a Reform government passed the legislation </a>(which could be months after a general election). And when the party said at one of these press conferences child asylum seekers would be swiftly deported under its plans, that idea was<a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/farage-rows-back-on-deporting-women-and-child-asylum-seekers"> dropped within 24 hours</a>.</p> <p>If Farage does row back a bit, he will get more publicity, the chance to sound a tiny bit more reasonable – while still leaving his party with a policy that would jolt British immigration policy in a more extreme direction than anything seen in decades.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68d134bb8f089a94dc150c09" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-22T11:44:24.540Z">12.44pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">EU nationals in UK with settled status won't be affected by plan to scrap indefinite leave to remain, Reform says</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>During the press conference, <strong>Zia Yusuf</strong>, Reform UK’s head of policy and head of government efficiency, said that the plan to revoked indefinite leave to remain would not cover EU citizens who are allowed to remain in the UK permanently under the settled status scheme agreed after Brexit.</p> <p>When asked if they would be covered, Yusuf said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The answer is no, in terms of EU settled status.</p> <p>But there is a caveat, There are a lot of EU nationals in this country you who are drawing on universal credit.

In a post on social media it says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Today’s Reform announcement falls apart as the think tank it based its numbers on says they are wrong and “should no longer be used”.</p> </blockquote> <p>In his <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15120275/NIGEL-FARAGE-No-one-voted-migrants-British-people-first.html">Daily Mail article </a>about his plans, <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Under Reform, welfare will only be for UK citizens. No foreign nationals will be entitled to any benefits.</p> <p>Our changes will save British taxpayers at least £234bn over the lifetime of these migrants. That is four times our total defence budget, or double what is spent on education.</p> </blockquote> <p>This figure came from a report published by the <strong>Centre for Policy Studies</strong>, a pro-Conservative thinktank. Highlighting the number of migrants who came to the UK between January 2021 and January 2024 and who would be eligible for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) by the end of the decade, <a href="https://cps.org.uk/media/post/2025/recent-migration-wave-may-cost-country-billions-warns-cps/">it said</a>:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In our central scenario, 801,000 migrants from the post-2020 wave gain ILR, the vast majority by the end of this decade </p> <p>It is likely that many of these migrants, both workers and dependants, will represent a long-term cost to the taxpayer. Using the Office for Budget Responsibility’s assumptions about migrant earnings, our central estimate of the lifetime net fiscal cost is £234bn – equivalent to a bill of £8,200 for every UK household, spread out over several decades. However, it could be very considerably more.</p> </blockquote> <p>But today the CPS put out<a href="https://x.com/CPSThinkTank/status/1970037960461484168"> a statement </a>saying it has withdrawn that figures. It says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>As part of announcing a package of policies on Indefinite Leave to Remain, Reform UK have alluded to research published by the Centre for Policy Studies in February of this year. Part of the research calculated a ballpark figure for the financial cost of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who will soon be eligible to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR). </p> <p>After the CPS’ report was published, the Office for Budget Responsibility revised their definitions of some of the fiscal data contained within our report, meaning that the overall cost estimates should no longer be used. The CPS has been in communication with the OBR and other experts for clarity and will be publishing an updated estimate in due course. </p> <p>The changes do not impact our analysis of the visa data or projections for the numbers likely to gain ILR on different visa routes.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is why Labour says the plan has fallen apart.

Last month Reform UK unveiled<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/nigel-farage-plan-deport-asylum-seekers-scorn-from-legal-experts"> its “Operation Restoring Justice”</a> plan for the mass deportation of people living in Britain without permission to be here. It was aimed at illegal immigrants, but <strong>Nigel Farage</strong>, the Reform leader, proposed deportation on an unprecedented scale , without being clear as to quite how many people would be affected. Today he is committing Reform (which is currently well ahead of other parties in national opinion polls) to an even more draconian approach. He says Reform would abolish indefinite leave to remain – the immigration status that allows people to remain in the UK for as long as they want, often the first step towards citizenship.</p> <p>Crucially, this would not just be for new applicants; it would be retrospective, applying to people who already have indefinite leave to remain. Instead, people would have to apply for a five-year visa, with tougher conditions.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15120275/NIGEL-FARAGE-No-one-voted-migrants-British-people-first.html">an article</a> for the Daily Mail, Farage says this policy is intended to reverse what he calls “the Boriswave” – the huge increase in legal migration that happened when Boris Johnson was prime minister.</p> <p>The Johnson government allowed the number of people getting work visas to soar largely to compensate for the fact that EU workers were leaving because of Brexit, which was the policy that Farage arguably did more than anyone else to make happen. But he does not address this point in his article.</p> <p>Instead, he says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Today, I can announce that Reform will go even further.</p> <p>We will abolish indefinite leave to remain (ILR) status, which grants migrants the right to live, work and study in the UK permanently with full access to Britain’s health and benefits system.</p> <p>This threatens to bankrupt our bloated welfare state.</p> <p>We will rescind ILR statuses that have already been granted. We will also restore the treasured status of British citizenship.</p> <p>Why is this so urgent? Starting from January 2026, if nothing is done to stop it, those 3.8 million migrants will become eligible for ILR.</p> <p>Let’s be clear, these migrants are not doctors, engineers or entrepreneurs. Many of those eligible for ILR never work and never will. Many are young and old dependants who followed family members here. They are now a burden on the welfare state …</p> <p>Once we abolish ILR, foreign nationals who want to work here will have 180 days to apply for a tough, new five-year renewable visa. They will have no right to benefits or healthcare without insurance.
