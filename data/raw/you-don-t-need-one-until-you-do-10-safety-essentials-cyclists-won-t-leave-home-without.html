<p>How many cyclists does it take to change a lightbulb? Three. One to climb the ladder, two to stand at the bottom arguing about whether or not they should be wearing a helmet.</p> <p>I joke, of course. But there’s no denying cycling safety is a complex and divisive topic. Personally? I enjoy my rides more when I feel visible and protected. Thanks to a disappointing absence of thoughtfully executed cycling infrastructure in much of the UK, this often means leaning on gadgets and gizmos to offer something resembling peace of mind.</p> <p>I’ve tested a lot of cycling safety kit over the years, and I’ll be the first to admit that plenty of it is gimmicky at best. But every now and then, something genuinely useful comes along – something I’d never ride without again. </p> <p>I’m not alone in this. From semi-professional road racers to office commuters, lots of cyclists own safety products they swear by. Below are some top recommendations from them and from me.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Cycling safety essentials</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Radar</strong></h2> <p>When I first heard about this thing, I scoffed. What’s wrong with just looking over your shoulder? It mounts to the seat post of your bike and alerts you to objects approaching from behind, giving you a rough idea of speed and proximity via a paired <a href="https://www.decathlon.co.uk/sports/mountain-biking/gps-and-cycle-computers">bike computer</a> or smartphone.</p> <p>I first tried it five years ago, and I haven’t ridden without it since. It’s no substitute for having your wits about you, but it gives you time to react to potential close passes and stops you from being startled when cars seem to appear out of nowhere. It’s not much use in the city, but for those who ride on fast, rural roads, it’s invaluable.</p>    <p><strong>Garmin Varia RVR315</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-GB/p/669024/pn/010-02254-00/" > £129.99 at Garmin </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Garmin-Varia/dp/B08FTGNF43" > £119.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Camera</strong></h2> <p>You don’t <em>need</em> one … until you do. If you’re involved in an incident, it’s your word against theirs. Having footage of the event can help with legal proceedings and insurance. It also means you can report instances of dangerous driving and, in theory, be taken seriously.</p> <p>I find drivers give me a wider berth and pass more carefully when I’m using mine. Helmet-mounted is my preference, but you can also get ones that are integrated with a front or rear light. <strong>Simon</strong> </p>    <p><strong>Cycliq Flysport 12</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://cycliq.co.uk/products/fly12-sport" > £319 at Clycliq </a>      <p><strong>GoPro Hero</strong><strong>12</strong> <strong>Black</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://gopro.com/en/gb/shop/cameras/hero12-black/CHDHX-121-master.html" > £349.99 at GoPro </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/GoPro-HERO12-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B0CF3VVTLG" > £295 at Amazon </a> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/31/best-pannier-handlebar-bike-bags">Hit the road with the best bike panniers and handlebar bags</a> </p> </aside>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Incident detection system</strong></h2> <p>Incident detection comes in many shapes and sizes. Many modern bike computers and fitness wearables have this technology built in, but it’s also available via standalone devices that can be clipped on to a helmet or slipped into a pocket while riding.</p> <p>They can be configured to notify a contact of choice when an impact is detected. I had a bad crash last year that left me dazed at the side of the road, and my wife was calling before I’d even had time to process what just happened. This makes it very useful for long-distance rides in rural locations.</p> <p>Specialized’s ANGi Crash Sensor is a relatively affordable option for those who don’t have this feature already on a bike computer or smartwatch. Connect it to the Specialized app and you’re good to go. If there’s no signal, it can be set to alert your nearest and dearest if you don’t make it back from a ride in a set time, sending them your last known GPS location. </p>    <p><strong>Specialized ANGi Crash Sensor</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cyclestore.co.uk/specialized_angi_crash_sensor-ID_76820" > £38.99 at Cyclestore </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Specialized-ANGi-Crash-Sensor_210131.htm" > £45 at Tredz </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Compact bell</strong></h2> <p>I might have overthought this, but the tone of my Knog Oi bell feels slightly less abrasive than other bells, so I’m more inclined to use it, and I find pedestrians are less startled by it. The low-profile design means it’s extremely unobtrusive on the bars too – I barely notice it’s there. <strong>Jamie</strong></p>    <p><strong>Knog Oi classic bell</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.halfords.com/cycling/bike-accessories/mirrors-bells-and-horns/knog-oi-classic-bike-bell-100227.html" > From £11.99 at Halfords </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cyclesuk.com/shop/accessories/sub/safety/knog-oi-classic-large-145021/option/" > £16.99 at Cycles UK </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Rearview glasses</strong></h2> <p>Motorists have wing mirrors. They also have steel cages protecting them from impact. If anyone needs mirrors, it’s cyclists. I used to ride with one mounted on the end of my handlebar, but my HindSight rear-view sunglasses offer a much neater solution. When wearing them, all I have to do is glance to the side and I can see what’s behind me. And they’re sunglasses too. Two birds, one stone. <strong>Claire G</strong></p>    <p><strong>HindSight Artemis glasses</strong> </p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://hindsight.store/products/artemis" > £159.99 at Hindsight </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Gloves</strong></h2> <p>Your hands can get badly injured even from relatively minor falls while biking, yet I see so many people who wear gloves only in the winter. I always wear those that offer good palm protection, even in summer. They’ll not only save your hands from road rash in the event of a crash but will also keep them more comfortable on the handlebar during long rides. <strong>BR </strong></p>    <p><strong>Spatzwear</strong><strong> Aero Glovz </strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/aero-glovz-race-gloves-long-finger/_/R-p-e1749e7d-0ca4-4bda-bf7d-a5e1ea7eb337" > £11.99 at Decathlon </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/SPATZ-Aero-Glovz-Finger-Gloves/dp/B0DQ95HJRB" > £29.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>StVZO</strong><strong> front light</strong></h2> <p>Cycling without lights is a bad idea, especially when it’s dark or visibility is poor, but riding with unsuitable lights can be dangerous too. Some of them spray out light in all directions, which can dazzle oncoming cars.</p> <p>In Germany, there’s a ‘Straßenverkehrs-Zulassungs-Ordnung’ or road traffic licensing regulation relating to this, which says that front bike lights must have a cut-off, so that the beam pattern stays below a certain level. This helps you to see and be seen, without dazzling other road users. Search the web for StVZO bike lights and you’ll find lots of options. </p>    <p><strong>Lezyne Power STVZO Pro 115</strong><strong> front light</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Lezyne-Power-STVZO-Pro-115-Front-Light_238082.htm" > £55 at Tredz </a>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Integrated rear-</strong><strong>light helmet</strong></h2> <p>I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve accidentally left my rear light on charge at home. Since buying a helmet with an integrated rear light, it’s no longer a concern. I always wear a helmet, which means I always have my light. In some cases, they’re more expensive than a regular helmet, but when you take into consideration what you’d be likely to spend on both items individually, it makes sense to combine the two. <strong>NQ</strong></p>    <p><strong>Halfords commuter helmet</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.halfords.com/cycling/bike-helmets/adult-bike-helmets/halfords-commuter-helmet-medium-336411.html" > £30 at Halfords </a> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/13/best-bike-lights">The best bike lights to see and be seen when cycling in the dark, tried and tested</a> </p> </aside>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Wearable lock</strong></h2> <p>It’s more for security than safety, but the locks that wrap around your waist are great. I’ve been using one for years now. It keeps the bike secure when I’m out and about, and I don’t have to worry about carrying it in a bag – it’s designed to be worn like a belt. <strong>Graeme </strong></p>    <p><strong>Hiplok Lite wearable chain lock</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.halfords.com/cycling/bike-accessories/bike-locks/hiplok-lite---wearable-chain-lock-126122.html" > £43.89 at Halfords </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hiplok-Unisex-Wearable-Bicycle-Multicolour/dp/B009O01E5C" > £39.04 at Amazon </a>  <p><em><strong>For more, check out our roundup of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jan/21/best-bike-locks">the best bike locks</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Hi-vis vest</strong></h2> <p>I bought a hi-vis vest for a fiver from Halfords. We travel on our bikes a lot in the dark, whether it’s commuting in the UK, winter rides or on bikepacking trips. It’s especially helpful for the latter, as you never know what kind of roads you’ll end up on. Paired with our bike reflectors and lights, it makes us feel safer. <strong>Hannah Foster </strong></p>    <p><strong>Halfords hi-vis waistcoat</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.halfords.com/cycling/cycling-clothing/jackets-and-gilets/halfords-hi-vis-waistcoat---medium-481427.html" > £5 at Halfords </a>  <p><em><strong>For more, read the Filter’s guide to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/oct/14/how-to-make-bike-last-longer">how to make your bike last longer</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Paddy Maddison is a consumer journalist, outerwear enthusiast and exercise addict.
