<p>A rise in the number of sweet, food-scented perfumes on the market could be linked to an increase in the use of weight-loss medication, <a href="https://store.mintel.com/report/the-future-of-fragrance">according to</a> the market research firm Mintel.</p> <p>Food-inspired fragrances, with scent profiles that feature vanilla, coffee and caramel and referred to in the industry as “gourmand” perfumes, have surged in popularity in the past three years. Launches of sugary-scented, dessert-themed fragrances increased by 24% last year alone, Mintel said.</p> <p>The rise in popularity is happening alongside the increased use of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/28/demand-for-weight-loss-drugs-is-becoming-unsustainable-say-pharmacists">GLP-1 medications for weight loss</a>, such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jun/30/perfume-boom-gen-z-independent-brands">‘Smellmaxxing’ and ‘frag heads’: how the gen Z perfume boom came up roses for indie brands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Fragrance brands may increasingly explore such notes to address GLP-1-driven appetite suppression,” said Clotilde Drapé, a global beauty analyst at Mintel, as consumers “strive to stay lean while enjoying decadent, food-inspired scents”.</p> <p>Mintel’s Future of Fragrance 2025 report predicts a further resurgence in sweet scents, tied to increased weight-loss medication use. “Online discussions have linked GLP-1 medications to changes in appetite and sensory experiences, potentially driving interest in sensory stimulation like fragrances,” Drapé said.</p> <p>Gourmand perfumes are trending heavily among younger consumers online. Google and TikTok searches for “gourmand fragrances” have shown year on year growth of +170% in the US since 2023, according to the New York-based consumer research firm Spate.</p>    <p>In April the singer, songwriter and actor Sabrina Carpenter released the fragrance Me Espresso, the latest addition to her gourmand-centred perfume line. It is described as a sugary iced coffee in olfactory form, with notes of espresso, biscuit and whipped cream. The Fragrance by Sabrina scents also include Sweet Tooth, Caramel Dream and Cherry Baby and are all shaped like chocolate bars, adding to the dessert-themed experience.</p> <p>“Generally speaking, it’s a gen Z-inspired fragrance trend,” said Amanda Carr, a fragrance writer at the website We Wear Perfume.</p> <p>For younger generations, with recently acquired spending power, gourmand is an accessible gateway into the perfume market. “It’s like a baked cake or a sweet treat. It’s very easy for somebody who’s new to fragrance to understand it,” says Carr.</p> <p>“Vanilla does hang about, it’s a very heavyweight note. So it seems like a good value for money fragrance, and that appeals to gen Z as well.”</p> <p>The global fragrance market continues to boom, with an expected annual growth of 3.3% in 2025, according to the data company Statista.</p> <p>Popular trends shared on TikTok include “scent layering”, which involves buying multiple scented body care products, from body oil to lotions, to boost the longevity of the fragrance.</p> <p>Drapé said “mood-boosting” is the top reason for using fragrance in the UK, driving the popularity of sweet scents that are linked with indulgence.</p>
