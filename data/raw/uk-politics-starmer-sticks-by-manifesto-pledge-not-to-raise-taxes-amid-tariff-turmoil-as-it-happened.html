The alternative could see us locked out of reliable, consistently-priced sources of steel.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Julian Lewis</strong>, another Tory, urged the government to nationalise the factory. He said the minister “shouldn’t waste the opportunity of a lifetime to have the parties of the right urging a party of the left to nationalise a British industry.” He added:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Seize the opportunity, keep the blast furnaces, and, if necessary nationalise them for good.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jones</strong> replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I have not failed to notice the slightly odd position that we find ourselves in today and I would just repeat that we are looking at all options.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-67f3f0128f08e0f1eb0320b2" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-07T15:40:56.232Z">4.40pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">What Starmer said in his speech about using industrial policy to help life sciences sector</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here is the passage from <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>’s speech where he talked about measures to support the life sciences sector. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/07/keir-starmer-speech-trump-us-tariff-turmoil-car-industry-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-67f3d8558f08d7b767193762#block-67f3d8558f08d7b767193762"> 2.54pm</a>.) He cited this as an example of how the government will be using industrial policy to protect business (one of his strategies for dealing with the Trump tariffs – see<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/07/keir-starmer-speech-trump-us-tariff-turmoil-car-industry-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-67f39f6f8f08e0f1eb031cf0#block-67f39f6f8f08e0f1eb031cf0"> 12.30pm</a>.)</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In the coming days and weeks, we are going to use industrial policy to shelter British business from the storm.</p> <p>Take our life sciences sector, another shining example of British brilliance. An absolutely pivotal part of our export economy. We’re going to back them, as well.</p> <p>We’re going to rip up the red tape. Cut the stifling bureaucracy that slows down clinical trials. Now Britain used to be better at this but we’ve taken our foot off the pedal. </p> <p>The latest data says it takes over 250 days to set up a clinical trial. I’m going to slash that to 150. </p> <p>And on top of that, I can also announce – a new investment up to £600m in a new Health Data Research Service. A welcome partnership with the Wellcome Trust strengthening the genome cluster in Cambridge.</p> <p>Making sure that patient data in our NHS is unlocked for the public good. An opportunity for growth – but more importantly to save lives with cutting edge medicine and Britain is so good at this.</p> <p>We saw that in the pandemic. And we now need to pick up the pace again. This country has never waited around for history to shape us. We have shaped history – and we will do so again now.</p> </blockquote> <p>The full text of the speech is now <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-remarks-at-jaguar-land-rover-7-april-2025">on the No 10 website </a>(although they call it “remarks”, not a speech, which is an admission that it wasn’t one of his finest).</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-67f3e5478f08054ffed41fcf" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-07T15:25:19.958Z">4.25pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Starmer's speech - snap analysis</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>With the global stock market’s response to the Trump tariffs changing minute by minute, it would have been unreasonable to expect Keir Starmer to give a considered, and fixed, response to the crisis in that speech. Which is just as well, because he didn’t.</p> <p>In many respects, the speech this afternoon was surprisingly shallow. Other than the electric cars policy announcement briefed overnight, the only news it contained was what sounded like a back-of-the-envelope life sciences pledge (see<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/07/keir-starmer-speech-trump-us-tariff-turmoil-car-industry-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-67f3d8558f08d7b767193762#block-67f3d8558f08d7b767193762"> 2.54pm</a>). Almost everything he said about the economy he had already set out over the past few days. The most striking feature, perhaps, was the extent of his praise for the “brilliance” of the car workers he was addressing. Some viewers may think he overdid it, but he was probably thinking about his dad, and it sounded fairly genuine.</p> <p>As explained earlier, there are at least five strands to the government’s response to the tariffs crisis. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/apr/07/keir-starmer-speech-trump-us-tariff-turmoil-car-industry-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-67f39f6f8f08e0f1eb031cf0#block-67f39f6f8f08e0f1eb031cf0"> 12.30pm</a>.) The only one that did not get much of a mention was the anticipated trade deal with the US. As <strong>Kate McCann</strong> from Times Radio<a href="https://x.com/KateEMcCann/status/1909244092296413556"> points out</a>, this may indicate a change of thinking over the past week.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Interesting but subtle shift of emphasis by Starmer in answering @ChrisMasonBBC. Asked if Gov can shield people from Trump PM says UK will continue to work on a potential UK/US trade agreement BUT this is the time to step up on our side. Last week the trade deal was the answer...</p> </blockquote> <p>All four other measures are still very much in the mix. But Starmer did not say a lot about reducing trade barriers and, especially given what No 10 was saying earlier (see <a href="https://x.com/KateEMcCann/status/1909244092296413556">1.01pm</a>), anyone hoping for Britain to take the lead in some global, anti-Trump free trade alliance will be disappointed. Mostly Starmer was focusing on making British industry more resilient, and helping sectors particularly affected by tariffs. But there was not much detail on this, and these policies may end up looking a lot like the pro-growth agenda that Starmer was committed to anyway.</p> <p>If it is hard to categorise Starmer’s stance, that may be because he is averse to being too ideological. In <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk-politics/2025/04/keir-starmers-middle-way-on-globalisation">an astute New Statesman article</a>, <strong>George Eaton</strong> argues that Starmer is adopting his own version of the third way on globalisation.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>New Labour was sceptical of or even hostile to public ownership – Starmer is renationalising the railways and has launched the first new publicly owned company since the 1970s: GB Energy (the fate of the Chinese-owned British Steel, threatening 2,700 jobs, will be a test of the government’s interventionism). Blair cherished the UK’s “flexible” labour market, Starmer’s Employment Rights Bill heralds a more regulated model. Tax and spending are on a similarly European trajectory.</p> <p>But there is one Blairite concept – “the third way” – that might help illuminate Starmer’s outlook. Blair was seeking to chart a course between Thatcherism and traditional social democracy. Today, as his speech in the West Midlands will make clear, Starmer is rejecting both protectionism and free-market liberalism.</p> <p>“There are two wrong paths to go down in this era,” a No 10 strategist told me. “One is defending the status quo, defending institutions as they are, saying there’s a few things that we can do differently but the grown-ups are in charge. The other path you can go down is destroying those institutions, that’s the way of the populist right. We don’t think that stopping global trade is the answer.”</p> </blockquote> <p>There may be a logic to this. But that does not make Starmer’s strategy compelling. Here are two very different commentators on the speech – making broadly the same point.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/lewis_goodall/status/1909243776075194705">From</a> <strong>Lewis Goodall</strong> from the News Agents podcast</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Starmer’s speech is strong on diagnosis. Weak on prescription. Because Britain just isn’t economically powerful enough on its own to offer one</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In terms of Britain’s response we’re not going to retaliate with tariffs. We don’t have the heft of the EU’s trade bloc so our leverage is limited, even as a threat. We don’t have the export flows China has. So if Starmer is serious about protecting British industry then you’re going to need money. Therefore the only real question is whether the fiscal rules are relaxed. Starmer didn’t give an unequivocal no on that today.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href="https://x.com/JohnJCrace/status/1909241555845603618">From</a> <strong>John Crace</strong>, the Guardian’s sketchwriter</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Keir Starmer has just said ‘Our future is in our hands’.</p> <p>Not sure he has grasped the situation</p> </blockquote>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-08T07:18:06.659Z">at 8.18am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67f3df808f08d7b7671937b9" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-07T14:45:23.327Z">3.45pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Starmer signals fiscal rules won't be changed, saying 'there's enough uncertainty as it is'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>During the Q&amp;A Sam Coates from Sky News asked <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> if he could pledge to keep Rachel Reeves’s fiscal rules “exactly as they are” for the whole of this parliament.</p> <p>Starmer replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The fiscal rules were put in for a purpose, and that is because Liz Truss tried an experiment with this country of putting to one side fiscal rules and checks and balances. And that caused a massive impact on the lives of working people as inflation and interest rates went through the roof.</p> <p>We are not prepared to inflict that kind of damage on working people. That’s why we put the fiscal rules in the first place, to create that kind of stability.</p> <p>It’s why we were able to invest at the budget and set out, as we did, the steps for the future in the spring statement. Now is the time to build on that …</p> <p>So the reaction to the challenges of the last few days is not for us to say, ‘Well, the first thing we’ll now do is put to one side our fiscal rules.’ It is to remind people why we put them in place in the first place, which is to create the certainty that we need. </p> <p>There is enough uncertainty and insecurity as it is. Our job is to calmly and pragmatically take forward these really important steps today for our country. </p> </blockquote> <p>That was a strong argument for not changing the fiscal rules. But, because Starmer did not explicitly rule out changing the fiscal rules, lobby correspondents at first thought there might be some significance in the omission.</p> <p><strong>Alex Wickham</strong> from Bloomberg <a href="https://x.com/alexwickham/status/1909244285884457216">said:</a></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Keir Starmer does not commit to fiscal rules remaining completely unchanged for the full Parliament, asked by @SamCoatesSky</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Harry Cole</strong> from the Sun <a href="https://x.com/MrHarryCole/status/1909248393223745956">said:</a></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>PM commits to the tax lock.... some debate over whether the fiscal rules survive too</p> </blockquote>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/MrHarryCole/status/1909248393223745956">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PM commits to the tax lock.... some debate over whether the fiscal rules survive too</p>&mdash; Harry Cole (@MrHarryCole) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrHarryCole/status/1909248393223745956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2025</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <p>Someone seems to have had a word to clear this up, because <strong>Wickham</strong> subsequented posted <a href="https://x.com/alexwickham/status/1909253567807959406">this.</a></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>No10 stresses fiscal rules are iron clad and non negotiable</p> </blockquote>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/alexwickham/status/1909247208353935377">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(No10 saying don’t get excited about this) <a href="https://t.co/8wZub7KEtR">https://t.co/8wZub7KEtR</a></p>&mdash; Alex Wickham (@alexwickham) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwickham/status/1909247208353935377?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2025</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <p>And <strong>Cole</strong> posted<a href="https://x.com/MrHarryCole/status/1909250084417556506"> this.</a></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>No10 insist there is no debate about the Fiscal Rules...</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-67f3db988f08e0f1eb031fbe" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-07T14:17:25.479Z">3.17pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Starmer says UK will need more steel and 'all options on the table' to protect Scunthorpe steel plant</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Q: What measures will the government take to protect the Scunthorpe steelworks?

He has been saying this at least since last Thursday, when he spoke about the tariffs at a Q&amp;A with journalists at Labour’s local elections campaign launch. The speech this afternoon is being described as the PM’s most considered response so far to the global economic turmoil generated by the tariffs, but we have already heard quite a lot from Starmer on this topic already, in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/05/keir-starmer-nobody-wins-from-trade-war/">a Sunday Telegraph article</a> yesterday and in No 10 briefings on the calls he had with world leaders about the situation over the weekend.</p> <p>Is there a coherent strategy? On the basis of what he has said so far, there are at least five elements in the mix at the moment. </p> <p><strong>1) Push for a trade deal with the US.</strong> Starmer has ruled out immediate retaliatory tariffs, and the government is still hoping to negotiate a trade deal with the US. Last week Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said he hoped this would lead to the US lifting the 10% tariffs on all UK imports, but yesterday, on the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, refused to confirm that having a deal would led to the tariffs being removed.</p> <p><strong>2) Push further and faster for growth.</strong> Starmer was elected on a commitment to prioritise growth, and he has argued that the global economic situation makes this more important than ever. But, in terms of talking about the policies that might deliver this, mostly Starmer has been highlighting policies that were already in the pipeline.</p> <p><strong>3) Help sectors most affected by tariffs.</strong> The automative industry is specifically at risk, because cars are subject to 25% tariffs, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/backing-british-business-prime-minister-unveils-plan-to-support-carmakers">today’s announcment</a> is a sector-specific intervention. In his Times article Starmer says: “This is just the first of a series of pro-growth measures we’ll be delivering to provide certainty, stability, and support for industry.”</p> <p><strong>4) Make British industry more resilient.</strong> Even before she became chancellor, Rachel Reeves was arguing that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/may/24/boris-johnson-police-partygate-covid-lockdown-rishi-sunak-keir-starmer-pmqs-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-646e349d8f087efbd541ddfc#block-646e349d8f087efbd541ddfc">globalisation in its old form was dead</a> and that industrial policy had to make the UK less reliant on imports. She called this “securonomics”, and the Trump tariffs have arguably made the case for this even stronger. Starmer echoed this in his <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/05/keir-starmer-nobody-wins-from-trade-war/">Sunday Telegraph article </a>at the weekend, where he wrote: “We stand ready to use industrial policy to help shelter British business from the storm.”</p> <p><strong>5) Strengthen trade links with other free trade countries.</strong> Starmer is being urged by people like Jim O’Neill, the former Treasury minister, and Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, to respond to the Trump tariffs by developing a free trade “coalition of the willing” with non-US economies. Arguably this approach would contradict 4). But there is some evidence Starmer is exploring this. In a read-out of Starmer’s call with the Canadian PM Mark Carney at the weekend, No 10 said both men agreed on “the importance of free and open trade between like-minded nations”. And, talking to the Australian PM Anthony Albanese and the Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, Starmer said “it has been clear for a long time that like-minded countries must maintain strong relationships.”</p> <p>In summary, the Trump tariffs crisis has not really prompted a change of course, more an intensification of policies that Starmer was pursuing anyway. But we are only five days into Trump’s economic “new era”. The Starmer response is likely to evolve.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67f3abc78f08d7b76719353f" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-07T10:46:19.478Z">11.46am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Reform UK promised that a “special guest” would appear at its press conference in Doncaster this morning, alongside the party leader Nigel Farage and its mayoral candidate for the city, Alexander Jones.

We’re giving them the flexibility they need to hit the target in a way that works for them while keeping our manifesto commitment to end sales of petrol cars by 2030.</p> <p>That means no British-based manufacturers should have to pay a fine — or pay foreign firms for EV credits. But, as a backstop, we’re also going to cut the fines by 20 per cent. Any money we do raise will be invested straight back into supporting Britain’s automative industry.

As prime minister, there is nothing more important than being able to show the nation, when a crisis hits, that you are responding pro-actively, that you have a plan to cope, and that you are not just passive and helpless. Today is unusual because <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> is responding to a crisis caused by someone who is purportedly an ally, but in other respects the crisis response is familiar; “government will protect you”, the PM will say.</p> <p>Starmer will be giving a speech early this afternoon and here is <strong>Pippa Crerar</strong>’s overnight preview story about what he is going to say.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/06/government-uk-industry-tariff-turmoil-keir-starmer-carmakers-electric-vehicles">Government will step in to support key industries amid tariff turmoil, says Starmer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Starmer will focus in particular on the car industry, which has been hit by 25% tariffs on exports to the US. He will say:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Global trade is being transformed so we must go further and faster in reshaping our economy and our country through our Plan for Change …</p> <p>Now more than ever UK businesses and working people need a government that steps up, not stands aside. That means action, not words. So today I am announcing bold changes to the way we support our car industry.</p> </blockquote> <p>The announcement involves changes to the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate, the set of relatively complex rules setting targets for car manufacturers to ensure they transition to producing electric vehicles and stop selling new petrol and diesel cars by 2030. The 2030 target stays (more or less – the government is exempting micro-volume supercar brands, like McLaren and Aston Martin). But manufacturers will be allowed to sell full hybrid cars until 2035, and fines for firms that don’t meet the ZEV (zero emission vehicle) targets will be reduced. Companies will also get more flexibility in how they meet these targets. The <strong>Department for Transport</strong> has the details in a news release<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/backing-british-business-prime-minister-unveils-plan-to-support-carmakers"> here.</a></p> <p>The motor industry has welcomed these changes – as far as they go. But it has also described them as quite modest, and likely to have only a limited impact given the challenges it is facing.</p> <p>According to the Financial Times, Lisa Brankin, managing director of <strong>Ford</strong> in the UK, said the announcement was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/95b9bfbd-78eb-4875-be3c-5bd051e1f177">“a small step in the right direction,”</a> but added: “It is not the giant leap required to address the especially challenging electric vehicle market conditions”.</p> <p>The <strong>Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders</strong> said much more was needed. In<a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/smmt-statement-on-changes-to-zero-emission-vehicle-mandate/"> a statement</a> Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We await full details of the regulatory amendments but, given the potentially severe headwinds facing manufacturers following the introduction of US tariffs, greater action will almost certainly be needed to safeguard our industry’s competitiveness. UK-US negotiations must continue at pace, while the long-awaited industrial and trade strategies should prioritise automotive and be delivered at speed.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in an interview on the Today programme this morning <strong>Robert Forrester</strong>, CEO of Vertu motors, one of the UK’s biggest car dealerships, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There are lots and lots of words in the announcement, but it doesn’t really address the major issues. The electric vehicle targets up to 2030 remain in place. The fines have been changed, but it’s still £12,000 pound fine for every petrol and diesel car up to 2030 that’s sold above the zero emission targets. That’s billions of pounds to manufacturers, and manufacturers face a choice with, adding the pressure on of tariffs, of either paying significant fines or rationing petrol and diesel cars. Nothing has really changed here. This is real tinkering.</p> </blockquote> <p>For a sense of how serious the Trump tariff challenge actually is, do read <strong>Graeme Wearden</strong>’s business live blog.
