<p>President Donald Trump claimed a key victory in a US appeals court Monday as a divided three-judge panel decided he is allowed to deploy federal troops to the city of Portland, Oregon.</p> <p>Trump had claimed the right to send the national guard to the liberal stronghold for the purported purpose of protecting federal property and agents. The ruling marks an important legal victory for Trump as he continues to send military forces to Democratic-led cities.</p> <p>Oregon attorney general Dan Rayfield spoke out against the ruling, saying that if it’s allowed to stand, Trump would have “unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification”.</p> <p>“We are on a dangerous path in America,” he added.</p>  <h2>Oregon governor urges appeal court review of national guard decision</h2>  <p>Oregon governor Tina Kotek, has called on a federal appeals court to review and overturn a decision made by a three-judge panel on Monday that would permit <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/us-news/donaldtrump">Trump</a> to deploy federalized national guard troops to the streets of Portland against the wishes of state and local officials. Kotek said she hoped the full ninth circuit court of appeals vacates the panel’s 2-1 decision, as the dissenting judge, Portland-based Susan Graber, urged her colleagues to do.</p> <p>“I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek told reporters. </p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/court-ruling-trump-national-guard-portland"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Comey asks judge to dismiss criminal charges</h2>  <p>Former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi">FBI</a> director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey">James Comey</a> formally asked a federal judge to dismiss criminal charges against him, arguing he was the victim of a selective prosecution and that the US attorney who filed the charges was unlawfully appointed.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/james-comey-charge-dismissal-request"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>The White House is a work zone now</h2>  <p>Construction of the president’s $250m White House ballroom appears to be underway.
