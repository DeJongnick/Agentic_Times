<p>The justice department’s pardon attorney, who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/11/doj-official-fired-mel-gibson-gun">recently fired</a>, has claimed on social media that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s recent wave of pardoning white-collar criminals has erased more than “$1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans” to the public purse.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lawyer.oyer/video/7499153750968290603">TikTok video</a>, Liz Oyer, who has said that she was terminated in March after <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Oyer%2C+Gibson&amp;as_sitesearch=www.theguardian.com">refusing</a> to comply with an order to restore the gun rights of the actor Mel Gibson – a supporter of Trump’s – explained that “when you’re convicted of a financial crime like fraud or embezzlement, the law requires you to pay back the money that you stole. It’s called restitution.”</p> <p>However, she said, “the president has the power to pardon which can wipe out your entire sentence including your obligation to pay back the money.”</p> <p>Oyer alleged: “In total, Donald Trump has granted pardons that have wiped out over $1bn in debts owed by wealthy Americans who have committed fraud and broken the law.”</p> <p>In the video, Oyer highlights the case of Michele Fiore, a former Republican politician from Nevada, who was <a href="https://news3lv.com/news/local/trump-pardons-michele-fiore-noting-her-conservative-advocacy-amid-wire-fraud-conviction">convicted of wire fraud last year.</a></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="video of woman with glasses speaking">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lawyer.oyer/video/7499153750968290603&quot; data-video-id=&quot;7499153750968290603&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@lawyer.oyer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lawyer.oyer?refer=embed&quot;&gt;@lawyer.oyer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;More on Donald Trump’s $1 billion in pardons. Today, let’s talk about Michele Fiore, pardoned for stealing from a memorial fund for fallen police officers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;♬ original sound - Liz Oyer&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7499153893318986542?refer=embed&quot;&gt;♬ original sound - Liz Oyer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>She was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/former-las-vegas-city-councilwoman-convicted-charity-fraud-scheme">accused</a> of misusing more than $70,000 she raised to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/former-las-vegas-city-councilwoman-convicted-charity-fraud-scheme">build statues in honor of two slain police officers</a>. Instead of building the statues, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/former-las-vegas-city-councilwoman-convicted-charity-fraud-scheme">prosecutors said</a> that she used the funds on “personal and political expenses”.</p> <p>The White House <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-pardon-michele-fiore-nevada-fraud-cf56ef8b302b8111e47cf52d5a606d19">pardoned Fiore</a>, and according to Oyer, this released her from repaying those funds.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lawyer.oyer/video/7499517172797197614">different video,</a> Oyer pointed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/28/trump-pardons-nikola-founder">Trump’s pardon of Trevor Milton</a>, the founder of an electric vehicle startup, who was convicted of fraud in 2023 and sentenced to four years in prison.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/01/liz-oyer-trump-pardons-restitution-1-billion/">Washington Post reported that</a> the judge had not yet determined the restitution amount, but that federal prosecutors estimated that Milton owed more than $680m to defrauded shareholders.</p> <p>Notably, Milton and his wife contributed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/28/trump-pardons-nikola-founder">more than $1.8m to a Trump re-election</a> campaign.</p> <p>Oyer said his pardon erased the restitution being sought.</p> <p>The Post reported that Oyer added up the alleged restitution amounts for the relevant individuals convicted of stealing.</p> <p>The newspaper also noted that some of Trump’s pardon recipients had not yet been sentenced, so their owed amounts had not been finalized by the courts.</p> <p>Additionally, the Post reported that Trump <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-pardoned-bitmex-co-founders-white-house-official-says-2025-03-28/">pardoned the cryptocurrency exchange HDR Global Trading (BitMEX),</a> which eliminated <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/global-cryptocurrency-exchange-bitmex-fined-100-million-violating-bank-secrecy-act">a $100m fine</a> against the exchange for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act. Trump also <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-pardoned-bitmex-co-founders-white-house-official-says-2025-03-28/">pardoned several company executives who had pleaded guilty to financial crimes.</a></p> <p>Oyer told the Post it was “unprecedented for a president to grant pardons that have the effect of wiping out so much debt owed by people who have committed frauds”.</p> <p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.</p> <p>Last month, Oyer, who served in Joe Biden’s administration, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/liz-oyer-mel-gibson-us-marshals">testified before Congress</a> about her termination and the Trump administration’s treatment of the justice department and law firms.</p> <p>According to Oyer’s lawyer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/liz-oyer-mel-gibson-us-marshals">the justice department had planned</a> to send armed US marshals to deliver a letter to her home warning her about testifying.</p>
