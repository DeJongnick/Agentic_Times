<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position: </strong>6th (NB: this is not necessarily Ed Aarons’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> <p><strong>Last season’s position: </strong>17th</p> <h2>Prospects</h2>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--thumbnail" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/tottenham-kit/giv-32554tYnNr0kGKmB2/" data-alt="Tottenham kits"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/08/tottenham-kit/giv-32554tYnNr0kGKmB2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The sacking of Ange Postecoglou after he ended Tottenham’s 17-year wait for a trophy by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/europa-league-final-tottenham-manchester-united-match-report#:~:text=370-,Guardian%20Pick,%2C%20I'm%20well%20chuffed.">winning the Europa League</a> divided opinion among supporters, although the appointment of the experienced Thomas Frank has been generally received with enthusiasm. Not even that night in Bilbao was enough to save Postecoglou after Spurs ended last season 17th – their lowest placing since 1977 – having lost 22 games. But Frank, after cutting his teeth with a Brentford team that consistently punched above their weight, deserves the chance to show what he can do with more resources after the chair, Daniel Levy, opted for the Dane over candidates such as Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola or Fulham’s Marco Silva.</p> <p>Frank will know a good start is imperative if Tottenham are to build on the momentum of their Europa League triumph that also secured Champions League qualification. The departure of the captain, Son Heung-min, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/06/son-heung-min-los-angeles-sign-spurs-lafc">for Los Angeles</a> symbolised the end of an era in north London and there is plenty of work to do to make sure they are equipped to challenge on all fronts. Mohammed Kudus, Mathys Tel and João Palhinha – who should add some much-needed bite in central midfield after joining on loan – have bolstered a squad since weakened by the knee injury sustained by James Maddison. A move for Morgan Gibbs-White failed to materialise after Nottingham Forest dug their heels in and Spurs have rekindled interest in Eberechi Eze of Crystal Palace, having also targeted Manchester City’s Savinho.</p> <p>If Frank can secure more attacking additions he should at least be able to make Tottenham contenders for the top six again and satisfy Levy’s short-term remit of competing at the highest level in every competition, not just one.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/TzxDa/1/" data-alt="How they finished in the past five seasons"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/TzxDa/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>The manager</h2> <p>Frank has become known as one of English football’s most personable managers in his seven years at Brentford but don’t let that fool you into thinking he doesn’t have a ruthless side. Over a crab starter and sole meunière prepared by Gary Lineker in January for the BBC’s Football Focus, Frank admitted he does lose his temper on occasions: “When something is really irritating you, it’s just a burst. Boom.” Tottenham fans will welcome another manager who provides his teams with a clear identity and has an ambition to play attacking football but who also recognises the value of being tough to break down.</p> <h2>Off-field picture</h2> <p>It has also been a summer of change in the boardroom at Spurs after the appointment of Vinai Venkatesham as the chief executive – he held the same role at their north London rivals Arsenal until last summer – after the departure of the long-serving executive director Donna-Maria Cullen. Levy and Spurs’ owner, Enic, have made no secret that they have been on the lookout for investors over the past few years, and there have been talks over selling lucrative naming rights to the stadium, which has hosted NFL, boxing, rugby and Kendrick Lamar among other things this year.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/5Wv8R/1/" data-alt="Last season’s results"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/5Wv8R/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Star signing</h2> <p>Kudus is the first player <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/09/spurs-agree-deal-buy-mohammed-kudus-west-ham">to join Spurs from West Ham</a> since Scott Parker in 2011, when the midfielder left a club that had finished bottom, and the forward’s arrival has excited supporters despite his disappointing final campaign at the London Stadium. The Ghana international showed during his first season after signing from Ajax in 2023 that he has the ability to thrive in the Premier League when utilised correctly, even if there were only glimpses of his talent as West Ham struggled under Julen Lopetegui and Graham Potter. It will be intriguing to see whether Frank regards Kudus as right-winger or has plans to use him more centrally as well – a position the 25-year-old has previously said he favours.</p>    <h2>Stepping up</h2> <p>Mikey Moore has joined Rangers and the 18-year-old Croatia defender Luka Vuskovic looks poised to depart on loan as well despite starring in pre-season. But Frank will be relishing the chance to work Archie Gray after missing out on signing the versatile teenager from Leeds last summer when in charge at Brentford. Gray, who made three appearances for England’s Under-21s in the summer as they won the European Championship in Slovakia, was even pressed into emergency duty at centre-back for Spurs last season during a defensive injury crisis but will hope to establish himself in his favoured central midfield position.</p> <h2>A big season for …</h2> <p>There were rumours at the start of the summer that Cristian Romero might have played his last game for Tottenham amid strong interest from Spain, in particular Atlético Madrid. The 2022 World Cup winner ended up staying and has been chosen as the captain after Son’s departure. Romero struggled with injuries last season, making 18 appearances in the Premier League, but the 27-year-old has improved his disciplinary record and forms a strong partnership at the back with Micky van de Ven when both are fit.</p>
