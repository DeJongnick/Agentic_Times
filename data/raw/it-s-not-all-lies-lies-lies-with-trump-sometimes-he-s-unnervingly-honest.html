<h1>It’s not all lies, lies, lies with Trump – sometimes he’s unnervingly honest</h1>

<p>Channel 4 will be marking Donald Trump’s visit to the UK with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/channel-4-donald-trump-uk-state-visit-reel-of-untruths">what it describes</a> as “the longest uninterrupted reel of untruths, falsehoods and distortions ever broadcast on television”. It will play more than 100 of Trump’s lies or misleading statements in a segment called Trump v The Truth. All his greatest hits, from false claims about the price of eggs to disgusting lies about the US spending millions on condoms for Hamas, packaged together.</p> <p>Obviously we’ve got to be fair and balanced here, though, haven’t we? Gotta show both sides. So I think it’s only right that Channel 4 also broadcast a 10-second segment covering all of the truthful and astute things the president has said. It’s not just lies, lies, lies: occasionally the man can be surprisingly wise. Only this week, for example, <a href="https://x.com/patriottakes/status/1967233388147847434">a video circulated online</a> of Trump telling attendees of a gala at one of his golf clubs: “Smart people don’t like me, you know?” He added: “And they don’t like what we talk about.” No lies detected there.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/channel-4-donald-trump-uk-state-visit-reel-of-untruths">Channel 4 to mark Trump’s UK visit with ‘longest uninterrupted reel of untruths’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And then there are Trump’s thoughts on the fate of his immortal soul. Last month, early on a Tuesday morning, the president <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/us/politics/trump-heaven.html">dialled into Fox &amp; Friends</a> and said he is trying to stop the war in Ukraine so that God can save him a spot in paradise. “I want to try and get to heaven, if possible,” he explained. “I’m hearing I’m not doing well. I am really at the bottom of the totem pole.” While it’s impossible to fact-check exactly where Trump is on God’s waiting list, I suspect he has made a correct assessment of the situation. And I think all the dead children in Gaza, which Trump has said he wants the US to take over and turn into a luxury resort, might agree.</p> <p>Trump has also been blunter about the political process than some of his predecessors. While running for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trumps-surprisingly-honest-lessons-big-money-politics/story?id=32993736">president in 2015</a>, he matter-of-factly said that he had used his money to influence politicians. “I gave to many people before this,” he said during a Republican candidates’ debate. “And you know what, when I need something from them two years later … I call them. They are there for me. That’s a broken system.” Truer words have never been spoken; certainly not by Trump.</p> <p>• Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
