  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has voiced support for Donald Trump’s proposal for Ukraine and Russia to freeze the war at the current frontlines, calling it “a good compromise” even as he acknowledged Moscow has made clear it will not accept the arrangement. </strong>“I think that was a good compromise, but I’m not sure that Putin will support it, and I said it to the president,” Zelenskyy said on a visit to Oslo, part of a tour of Scandinavia to seek additional military support.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that Ukraine aims to receive and start using Swedish Gripen jets next year.</strong> “For our army, Gripens are a priority. It is about money, about manoeuvres,” he told a joint press conference with Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson during a visit to Linkoping.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The world must now increase pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for the war in Ukraine to end, Kristersson told a press conference.</strong> Standing next to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Kristersson said that Sweden “stands very united behind you and the Ukrainian people”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russia is implementing a methodical campaign to destroy Ukraine’s energy system and is targeting repair teams working at energy facilities after the initial strikes, energy minister Sviltana Hrynchuk said on Wednesday. </strong>Russia launched 405 drones and 28 missiles in its second major round of attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities so far this month, killing six people in Kyiv and the surrounding region and cutting off electricity across the country, officials said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Plans to hold <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest">a summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Budapest</a> have been put on hold as Ukraine and its European allies rallied in pushing for a ceasefire without territorial concessions from Kyiv.</strong> The White House said there were now “no plans” for the US president to meet his Russian counterpart “in the immediate future” as a round of diplomacy at the end of last week failed to yield any significant progress towards ending the war.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Several people were killed and many more wounded as Russia launched more than 400 air attacks across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> between Tuesday and Wednesday. </strong>A drone hit a kindergarten in Kharkiv, killing at least one person.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russian Tu-22M3 long-range bombers conducted a scheduled flight over neutral waters in the Baltic Sea, Russian state-run news agency RIA reported, citing the defence ministry. </strong>At various stages of the mission the bombers were escorted by fighter jets from foreign countries, the ministry was cited as saying.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russia said on Wednesday it had carried out a major training exercise involving nuclear weapons, a day after the United States announced a delay in plans for a second summit between presidents <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> and Donald Trump. </strong>The Kremlin released video showing general Valery Gerasimov, head of the general staff, reporting to Putin on the drills.

   <li><p><strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy will visit Brussels and London later this week after meetings held in Norway and Sweden on Wednesday, a senior Ukrainian official told Agence France-Presse (AFP).</strong> The official said multiple meetings would be held in the European capitals, including on energy amid repeated Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy facilities.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Louvre in Paris reopened on Wednesday, three days after thieves made off with jewellery worth an estimated €88m ($102m) in a spectacular heist that has raised urgent questions over security lapses at the museum.</strong> Reuters reports that visitors queued to enter through the Louvre’s glass pyramid for the first time since Sunday’s brazen robbery, in which hooded assailants broke through a second-floor window using a stolen movers’ lift before making off with jewels from the royal collection.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy will have two police officers stationed in nearby cells while he is in prison to ensure he comes to no harm, France’s interior minister said on Wednesday. </strong>Sarkozy on Tuesday began a five-year sentence after being convicted of conspiring to raise campaign funds from Libya, arriving at La Sante prison in Paris - a stunning downfall for a man who led the country between 2007 and 2012.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Shots were fired outside Serbia’s parliament building in Belgrade and one person was injured, local media reported. </strong>Eyewitness footage shared with Reuters showed armed security officers approaching a tent outside parliament, one of several erected this year by supporters of president Aleksandar Vučić during anti-government protests.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has voiced support for Donald Trump’s proposal for Ukraine and Russia to freeze the war at the current frontlines, calling it “a good compromise” even as he acknowledged Moscow has made clear it will not accept the arrangement.</strong></p> 
  <p>“I think that was a good compromise, but I’m not sure that Putin will support it, and I said it to the president,” Zelenskyy said on a visit to Oslo, part of a tour of Scandinavia to seek additional military support.</p> 
  <p>The US president had earlier this week told reporters on Air Force One “they can negotiate something later on down the line. But I said cut and stop at the battle line”. He was speaking shortly before a planned summit with Vladimir Putin was put on hold after Russia said its goal of seeking the whole of the eastern Donbas region, including areas held by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, had not changed.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s latest remarks were seen as a modest win for Zelenskyy. The US leader has repeatedly wavered on key aspects of the war, including whether a ceasefire should come before broader peace talks, and at times appearing to consider Putin’s demands for Ukraine to give up more land.</p> 
  <p>Most recently, Trump had dashed Ukraine’s hope he would send Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv after a phone call with Putin.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy and his senior officials have previously acknowledged that Ukraine is unlikely to regain all of its occupied territory through military means, and have privately told Washington and European partners they would be open to freezing the frontlines. Still, Zelenskyy’s public endorsement of such a plan marks a notable shift from his earlier stance, when Kyiv vowed to reclaim all land lost to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a>.</p> 
  <p>Russia, meanwhile, has made clear its maximalist position hasn’t changed, appearing to reject Trump’s fresh proposal to freeze battle lines.</p> 
  <p>Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s longtime foreign minister, said on Tuesday: “Washington now starts to say that we must stop [the conflict] immediately, that we should no longer discuss anything, that we should stop, and let history judge.”</p> 
  <p>Moscow has consistently rejected extended ceasefire proposals, arguing they would give Ukraine time to rearm and regroup at a time when Russian forces are making battlefield advances.</p> 
  <p>“You see, simply stopping would mean forgetting the root causes of this conflict,” Lavrov said.</p> 
  <p>Those “root causes”, according to Moscow, refer to its sweeping demands that would undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty – including full control over the Donbas region, limits on Kyiv’s armed forces, and a say in its domestic affairs.</p>

  <p><strong>In other news, Slovakia has reported an outbreak of bird flu on a poultry farm in the northern part of the country, the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) said on Wednesday, as Europe faces a seasonal upturn in the deadly disease.</strong></p>

  <p>The spread of bird flu has raised concerns among governments and the poultry industry after it killed or led to the culling of hundreds of millions of poultry in recent years, disrupting supply, fuelling higher food prices and raising the risk of a new pandemic.</p>

  <p>In a post on X, the Ukrainian president said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Today we have a new package of energy support from Norway – already the third this year – amounting to about $150m for gas purchases this winter. Energy support is extremely important. I thanked Norway for this assistance and prime minister @jonasgahrstore [Jonas Gahr Støre] personally during our meeting. </p> 
   <p>I informed him about the consequences of today’s Russian attack. I am grateful for Norway’s solidarity and condolences. We discussed Ukraine’s needs for air defence systems and missiles for them, as well as other steps that can strengthen Ukraine during the winter. </p> 
   <p>We also discussed our defence cooperation separately – the production of drones and missiles, and the expansion of the PURL initiative. We coordinated our positions and upcoming meetings to be held in Europe this week. We are very grateful for the great support of the Norwegian people – air defence systems, missiles for these systems – all of this saves lives.</p>

  <p>The possibility of supplying <strong>Gripen fighter jets</strong> to <strong>Ukraine</strong> has been under consideration over the past two years but was put on hold to allow <strong>Kyiv</strong> to focus on the introduction of <strong>American-made F-16 fighters</strong> that it began deploying last August.</p> 
  <p>“We have started the work to obtain Gripens to Ukraine and expect the future contract to allow us to acquire no less than 100 such jets,” Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.</p> 
  <p>Ukrainian pilots have been in Sweden to test the Gripen and help smooth any eventual export of the jets, a rugged and relatively low-cost option compared to aircraft such as the <strong>US F-35</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The Gripen has been in commission since 1996 and Saab has produced about 280 of the planes in total.</p>

  <p>Later on Wednesday the museum’s director will appear before the <strong>French Senate</strong> to answer lawmakers’ questions.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Galerie d’Apollon</strong>, the ornate gilded hall that was robbed, remains closed.</p> 
  <p>Amid rising frustration in <strong>France</strong> that no senior official has taken responsibility, French interior minister <strong>Laurent Nuñez</strong> said there had clearly been security failures and culture minister <strong>Rachida Dati</strong> had launched an administrative inquiry. Nuñez told Europe 1 radio:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There was a burglary at the Louvre, some of the most precious jewels in France were stolen. So obviously it’s a failure, there is nothing else I can say.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But he added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The alarm system worked perfectly, as soon as the window was attacked, it was activated. Police were notified, and within three minutes they were on the scene. The whole system worked, it didn’t fail, but what happened has happened.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He declined to comment on the police manhunt, but said he was confident the perpetrators would be found.</p> 
  <p>Dati came under fire after saying in parliament on Tuesday there had not been any security lapses.</p>

  <p><strong>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy will have two police officers stationed in nearby cells while he is in prison to ensure he comes to no harm, France’s interior minister said on Wednesday.</strong></p> 
  <p>Sarkozy on Tuesday began a five-year sentence after being convicted of conspiring to raise campaign funds from Libya, arriving at La Sante prison in Paris - a stunning downfall for a man who led the country between 2007 and 2012.</p> 
  <p>Interior minister Laurent Nunez told Europe 1 radio that two police officers who are part of the security detail protecting former presidents will be stationed permanently in neighbouring cells throughout Sarkozy’s incarceration, Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p>“The former president of the republic is entitled to protection because of his status. There is obviously a threat against him, and this protection is being maintained while he is in detention,” Nunez said.</p> 
  <p>He added that the officers would remain at Sarkozy’s side throughout his incarceration “as long as it is necessary”. The officers will be members of a team doing rotating shifts in the prison, French media reported.</p> 
  <p>Sarkozy will be held in La Sante’s isolation unit, where inmates are housed in single cells and kept apart during outdoor activities, meaning he should not be in contact with other inmates.</p>

  <p>In a post on his X account, Zelenskyy said that seven people had also been injured in the strike and were receiving medical care.</p>

   <p>There is no justification for a drone strike on a kindergarten, nor can there ever be. Clearly, Russia is growing more brazen. These strikes are Russia’s spit in the face to everyone who insists on a peaceful resolution. Thugs and terrorists can only be put in their place by force.</p>

  <p>Member states of the <strong>European Union (EU)</strong> must preserve exclusive jurisdiction on national security matters, the <strong>Italian</strong> prime minister said on Wednesday, as <strong>Rome</strong> faces scrutiny from <strong>Brussels</strong> over its use of special powers to shield strategic assets.</p> 
  <p>Italy is among countries within the bloc that have made extensive use of golden power legislation to protect sectors such as banking, defence and telecommunications.</p> 
  <p>Reuters reported this month that the EU was expected to act against the government of prime minister <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong> as part of a push against EU countries hampering bank consolidation in Europe.</p> 
  <p>Speaking about defence matters during an address to parliament before an EU leaders summit this week, Meloni stressed that it was up to member states to decide on their security, echoing similar remarks by economy minister <strong>Giancarlo Giorgetti</strong> this month.</p> 
  <p>According to Reuters, Meloni said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is, and must remain, the member states who are the decision-makers in this process.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The comments came after European commissioner for financial services <strong>Maria Luis Albuquerque</strong> told newspaper Corriere della Sera that she will be in Rome on Thursday and will probably hold talks with Giorgetti.</p> 
  <p>In July, Italy’s second-biggest bank, <strong>UniCredit</strong>, withdrew its offer for smaller rival <strong>Banco BPM</strong> blaming government intervention for scuppering the €15bn ($17.5bn) transaction.</p> 
  <p>The EU will order Italy to withdraw the terms set by Rome to clear UniCredit’s failed bid, while challenging the overall golden power legislation through a separate infringement procedure, sources have told Reuters.</p>

   <p>I don’t want to have a waste of time, so I’ll see what happens.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Putting the Budapest summit on hold represents the end of a short diplomatic cycle that began with a call last Thursday between Trump and Putin.</p> 
  <p>During that call, Putin reportedly proposed giving up parts of <strong>Kherson</strong> and <strong>Zaporizhzha</strong> provinces occupied by Russian forces, in return for all of <strong>Donetsk</strong>, a heavily fortified area long sought by <strong>Moscow</strong> but considered by Kyiv to be the gateway to central <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p>

  <p>He shared his condolences to the families and loved ones of the six people killed and 17 injured. Two children were among those killed in the strikes, he added.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy called for stronger sanctions on Russia, long-range capabilities and “coordinated diplomacy among all our partners”. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Russian words about diplomacy mean nothing as long as the Russian leadership does not feel critical problems.</p>

  <p>Here is his full statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Another night proving that Russia does not feel enough pressure for dragging out the war. Our air defence forces, mobile fire groups, and drone interceptor crews were working all night and into the morning. Ordinary cities have been under fire, primarily our energy infrastructure, but many residential buildings have also been hit. There were fires in Zaporizhzhia and hits on homes in Kyiv. The Kyiv, Odesa, Chernihiv, Dnipro, Kirovohrad, Poltava, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia, Cherkasy and Sumy regions were under attack. As of now, 17 people are known to have been injured. Unfortunately, six people were killed, among them two children. My condolences to their families and loved ones.</p> 
   <p>Russian words about diplomacy mean nothing as long as the Russian leadership does not feel critical problems. And this can be ensured only through sanctions, long-range capabilities, and coordinated diplomacy among all our partners. It is high time the European Union adopted a strong sanctions package. We also count on strong sanctions measures from the United States and the G7, from all those who seek peace. It is very important that the world does not remain silent now and that there is a united response to Russia’s vile strikes. </p> 
   <p>Everyone who is now helping Ukraine with air defence systems and missiles for them is protecting lives. We are grateful for that. And everyone who helps Ukraine with long-range capabilities will bring the end of the war closer.</p>

  <p><strong>Ukrainian</strong> president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> is due to discuss a possible export deal at <strong>Swedish</strong> defence industry group <strong>Saab</strong> on Wednesday, said Swedish prime minister <strong>Ulf Kristersson</strong>, who will join him at the factory.</p> 
  <p>Saab is the maker of the <strong>JAS 39 Gripen</strong> fighter jet, the <strong>GlobalEye</strong> surveillance aircraft, missile systems, anti-tank infantry weapons and other equipment.</p> 
  <p>According to Reuters, Kristersson told Swedish Radio:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The entire meeting takes place at Saab in Linkoping. We will discuss a major possible Swedish export deal.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Linkoping is a key manufacturing hub of Saab, where it produces the Gripen. Kristersson declined to specify if Gripen would be discussed, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>However, he told public broadcaster Swedish Radio: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When it comes to flying capability in the midst of the ongoing war, it is radar reconnaissance aircraft that are the major contribution.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Sweden said last year it was donating two radar surveillance and command aircraft to Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>The Swedish government said in a statement ZelenskYy and Kristersson would present news regarding defence exports at a joint press conference. A spokesperson for the prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to Reuter’s request for further comment.</p> 
  <p>Kristersson said this month that he and Zelenskyy had discussed <strong>Kyiv</strong>’s interest in Gripen at a meeting of <strong>European</strong> leaders in <strong>Copenhagen</strong>. He said at the time donations of the fighter jet were not on the cards.</p> 
  <p>The possibility of supplying Gripens to Ukraine has been under consideration over the past two years but was put on hold to allow Kyiv to focus on the introduction of <strong>US</strong>-made <strong>F-16 fighters</strong> that it began deploying last August. Still, Ukrainian pilots have been in Sweden to test the Gripen and help smooth any eventual export of the jets, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>On Wednesday, a Saab spokesperson referred all questions about the event to the government, according to Reuters.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Overnight Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv kills six people, including children</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Russian</strong> drones and missiles have pounded the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> capital and other cities, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/kyiv-russian-missile-drone-strike-attack-people-killed">killing six people in the </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/kyiv-russian-missile-drone-strike-attack-people-killed">Kyiv</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/kyiv-russian-missile-drone-strike-attack-people-killed"> region</a>, including a six-month-old baby, a 12 -year-old girl and a woman, and damaging key energy facilities and several high-rise residential buildings.</p> 
  <p>The attacks lasted most of Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/kyiv">Kyiv</a> was hit by at least four ballistic missiles. A series of loud explosions could be heard across the city.</p> 
  <p>Towards dawn and the beginning of the morning rush hour, air defences targeting Russian drones was audible above the sound of traffic.</p> 
  <p>The latest attack came as it was reported that Ukraine had launched a substantial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/ukraine-war-briefing-storm-shadow-missiles-hit-gunpowder-plant-in-russia">attack on a major chemical plant in </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/ukraine-war-briefing-storm-shadow-missiles-hit-gunpowder-plant-in-russia">Bryansk</a></strong>, in <strong>south-western Russia</strong>, with <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/22/ukraine-war-briefing-storm-shadow-missiles-hit-gunpowder-plant-in-russia">Storm Shadow missiles</a></strong>, which are supplied by <strong>Britain</strong> and <strong>France</strong>. Ukrainian drones also hit Russia’s <strong>Mordovia</strong> region.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, plans to hold <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest">a summit between </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest">Donald Trump</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest"> and </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest">Vladimir Putin</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest"> in </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest">Budapest</a></strong> have been put on hold as Ukraine and its <strong>European</strong> allies rallied in pushing for a ceasefire without territorial concessions from Kyiv.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>White House</strong> said there were now “no plans” for the <strong>US</strong> president to meet his Russian counterpart “in the immediate future” as a round of diplomacy at the end of last week failed to yield any significant progress towards ending the war.</p> 
  <p>More on these stories in a moment, but first here are some other key developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Preparations for a meeting in Budapest between Trump and Putin are still ongoing, Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán said on Wednesday, a day after the summit was put on hold.</strong> The planned meeting was paused as Moscow’s rejection of an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine cast a cloud over attempts at negotiations.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>On Wednesday, Trump is expected to hold talks at the White House with Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte.</strong> The military alliance has been coordinating deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, many of them bought from the United States by Canada and European countries.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European diplomats have said countries were working with Ukraine on a new proposal for a ceasefire along current battle lines</strong>. One told Reuters the proposal included a reference to a peace board that would be chaired by Trump, while another said it would be modelled on the US 20-point plan on Gaza. Thirty five allies of Ukraine will meet on Friday in London for a summit among countries willing to provide long-term support to Kyiv.</p></li>
