  <p><strong>ABC welcomes decision not to convict ATO whistleblower</strong></p> 
  <p>The ABC has welcomed the decision not to convict ATO whistleblower, <strong>Richard Boyle</strong> and again called for strengthened whistleblower protections.</p> 
  <p>Boyle gave information to investigative journalist <strong>Adele Ferguson</strong> in 2018 on tactics used on taxpayers who owed money that resulted in a joint Nine and Four Corners investigation in 2018.</p> 
  <p>ABC director of news <strong>Justin Stevens </strong>said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We acknowledge the seriousness of these offences. However, Boyle had principled intentions, and his actions were in the public’s interest. His allegations were vindicated. He received no personal gain and has paid a high personal price for his whistleblowing.</p> 
   <p>If it wasn’t for whistleblowers such as Richard Boyle coming forward to journalists, there are many important issues affecting people’s wellbeing and livelihoods that the public would never know about.</p>

  <p><strong>Human rights organisations condemn noncitizen deportation bill</strong></p> 
  <p>The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre and the Human Rights Law Centre are among the organisations condemning legislation introduced into parliament this week that removes procedural fairness for noncitizens the government is seeking to move to third countries.</p> 
  <p>In legislation introduced in the parliament on Tuesday, the home affairs minister said the changes will address the cohort who have remained in Australia following the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/21/australia-deal-to-resettle-nzyq-cohort-members-in-nauru-challenged-in-high-court-ntwnfb">NZYQ high court decision</a>.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Procedural fairness is a fundamental principle in many areas of decision-making. However, these provisions can and are being used by noncitizens to delay and frustrate their removal, at cost to the commonwealth in circumstances where it is neither necessary nor appropriate for it to continue to apply.</p> 
   <p>The amendments in this bill are largely directed at noncitizens who have come to the end of any visa processes, and who are on a removal pathway.</p> 
   <p>These provisions are primarily directed to noncitizens who have exhausted all legitimate avenues to remain in Australia – and for whom removal is the only remaining outcome under Australian law.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said the purpose of the law should be clear to give effect to removal as swiftly and effectively as possible.</p> 
  <p>The human rights organisations say the bill would “strip migrants and refugees of their legal rights” when sending them to third countries such as Nauru, and was “yet another attempt at rushed law-making”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Jana Favero</strong>, deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The decisions are serious and lifelong. We are talking about people being permanently deported to places like Nauru. Decisions like this must not be made without fundamental legal safeguards. This legislation is clearly designed to manipulate the law so that the government is not accountable to the courts.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Josephine Langbien</strong>, associate legal director at the Human Rights Law Centre, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This legislation would save the government from having to consider basic questions like whether someone can access the medical care they need in Nauru, or whether they would be permanently separated from their families. By eliminating safeguards that are designed to ensure fairness and accuracy, the government is showing that it does not care if it gets these life-changing decisions wrong.</p>

  <p><strong>Family of girl killed in Stonehaven bus crash release statement</strong></p> 
  <p>The family of <strong>Milla Killeen</strong>, the 12-year-old girl killed in the bus crash at Stonehaven in Victoria yesterday, have released a statement and a photo to the media.</p> 
  <p>The family said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Our whole family are struggling to come to terms with the loss of our beloved Milla.</p> 
   <p>We were made aware of the crash quite quickly, but it wasn’t for several hours that our worst fears were realised - Milla was the one that was sadly taken.</p> 
   <p>She was a beautiful soul with the whole world in front of her.</p> 
   <p>Milla had the patience of a saint.</p> 
   <p>She was so kind and protective of those she loved, especially her younger brother.</p> 
   <p>Milla was thriving at school where she loved learning new languages.</p> 
   <p>It brought us great joy when she would come home and try to teach her nan bits of Indonesian or Japanese that she’d learned throughout the day.</p> 
   <p>Milla was very artistic, enjoyed drawing and designing lots of different things and she loved her sport.</p> 
   <p>She used to play junior footy but lately had been focusing on basketball where she reached representative level and was about to play in a final on Friday night.</p> 
   <p>Milla was a passionate supporter of the Geelong Football Club, and we will always remember her sitting in the stands with her mum and pa, cheering for the Cats.</p> 
   <p>We don’t know why this has happened.</p> 
   <p>It’s difficult to describe all the emotions we feel right now but we are supporting one another and now ask that our family’s privacy is respected.</p>

  <p><strong>Age assurance company to brief on technology trial next month</strong></p> 
  <p>We’re all awaiting the release of the final report of the age assurance technology trial that will inform what technology the social media sites will use to keep under 16s off their services from December.</p> 
  <p>The report has been with the federal government since the start of the month, but there haven’t been any indications on when it’ll be released.</p> 
  <p>There is a sign it may be imminent, however, with the head of the trial, <strong>Tony Allen</strong>, posting on LinkedIn that there will be a series of briefings on the outcome of the trial in Australia and New Zealand towards the end of September. <br><br>The office of the communications minister, <strong>Anika Wells</strong>, was approached for comment.</p> 
  <p>The trial has kept quiet about its findings, mostly, since the report was finalised, amid concerns about leaks to media.</p>

  <p><strong>Taylor defends focus on Marles meeting</strong></p> 
  <p>The shadow defence minister, <strong>Angus Taylor</strong>, has defended the Coalition focusing on whether the defence minister, <strong>Richard Marles</strong>, did meet with his US counterpart or not, arguing it was important whether Aukus and the US alliance are strong.</p> 
  <p>He told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing that there had been conflicting statements, and there was a material issue:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think the material issue here is what progress are we making ensuring Aukus, ensuring the US alliance at a time which is the most dangerous since the second world war, authoritarian regimes are flexing their muscles and we need a strong alliance and we need a strong Aukus. We want to see progress on this and that is why we are asking the questions and questions need to be continued to be asked of the defence minister and of the prime minister.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said the government should be offering to seriously fund the defence force.</p>

  <p><strong>Marles’s US meeting was ‘productive’, assistant minister says</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Matt Thistlethwaite</strong>, the assistant minister for foreign affairs, has said the meeting between the defence minister, <strong>Richard Marles</strong>, and his US counterpart, <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>, was “productive” and dismissed attention on whether it was a “happenstance” or a meeting from the Coalition.</p> 
  <p>Thistlethwaite told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing Marles told him the meeting was productive, and the government believes the alliance is going well and strong.</p> 
  <p>Asked why the Pentagon initially described it as happenstance, the assistant minister said that was a question for the Pentagon.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I don’t know about that statement put out, [but] we can confirm the meeting occurred and Richard also met with <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> and the vice president <strong>JD Vance</strong>. Critical minerals, treaty relationship, issues internationally were discussed.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said a meeting had been requested with US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and that “is all we can do”.</p> 
  <p>He questioned the “priorities” of the opposition in raising it during question time, rather than a specific question on Aukus, when the government has been focused on the cost of living for Australians in parliament this week.</p>

  <p><strong>Federal government condemns planned anti-immigration rallies</strong></p> 
  <p>The Albanese government has condemned anti-immigration rallies scheduled for this weekend, saying the “brand of fight-right activism grounded in racism and ethnocentrism” has no place in modern Australia.</p> 
  <p>A series of so-called March for Australia rallies are planned in cities across the country on Sunday to protest against “mass migration”.</p> 
  <p>In a statement on Thursday, the minister for home affairs, <strong>Tony Burke</strong>, said there was “no place in our country for people who seek to divide and undermine our social cohesion”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We stand with modern Australia against these rallies – nothing could be less Australian.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The multicultural affairs minister, <strong>Anne Aly</strong>, said “multiculturalism was an integral and valued part of our identity”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We stand with all Australians, no matter where they were born, against those who seek to divide us and who seek to intimidate migrant communities. We will not be intimidated.</em></p> 
   <p><em>This brand of far-right activism grounded in racism and ethnocentrism has no place in modern Australia.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The shadow multicultural affairs minister, <strong>Paul Scarr,</strong> earlier this week condemned a pamphlet promoting the rallies that referenced Indian migrants.</p> 
  <p>Scarr said at the time:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>So I am compelled to rise in this place at the earliest opportunity to call it out and to condemn it and say that the language and references to Australians of Indian heritage is unacceptable. It is outrageous ... it seeks to divide Australians at a time when we need to unite.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Whether or not he thinks Folbigg innocent is ‘irrelevant’ to payout calculation, NSW AG says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The innocence of <strong>Kathleen Folbigg</strong>, jailed for two decades after the deaths of her four children, was “irrelevant” to the calculation of a $2m payout, the NSW attorney general says.</p> 
  <p>Folbigg was jailed in 2003 before being released and having her convictions quashed in 2023, when fresh scientific evidence cast reasonable doubt over her guilt.<br><br><strong>Michael Daley</strong> did not meet with her before announcing the payment offer on 7 August, telling a budget estimates hearing on Thursday that “it would not have assisted” him in determining the amount offered.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The best way to deal with ex gratia payments is to deal with the objective facts. When you meet with people seeking ex gratia payments, it raises expectations.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Daley said he did not plan to meet with her now that “the matter has concluded”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><br>I can’t see any point in doing that. I don’t want to hold any hope out to her that she can come in and ask for that figure to be varied because I think the premier has indicated quite clearly, on a number of occasions, that it won’t be.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Labor has been under pressure to explain how it arrived at the $2m figure, after experts suggested it should be five to 10 times higher.<br><br><strong>Lindy Chamberlain</strong>, jailed for four years before authorities agreed a dingo had likely taken her baby from an Uluru campsite, was awarded $1.7m, including legal costs, in 1992. That sum would be worth $4 million today.<br><br>But Folbigg’s case stood alone, Daley suggested.<br><br>Medical evidence, which led to her release and acquittal in 2023, did not exist at the time of her trial.<br><br>“That was a huge factor,” the attorney general said.<br><br>“What set this matter apart was there was no proven malfeasance on the part of the state.”<br><br>He said he followed a process to determine the amount offered.<br><br>Whether he considered Folbigg innocent or guilty was “completely irrelevant” to his decision.</p>

  <p><strong>Minister pays tribute to 12-year-old Milla Killeen, killed in bus crash outside Geelong</strong></p> 
  <p>Victorian education minister <strong>Ben Carroll</strong> has told Victorian parliament’s question time the student killed in a bus crash outside Geelong on Wednesday was 12-year-old <strong>Milla Killeen. </strong>He told the chamber:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Her parents would have sent her off to school, [but] she died on the Hamilton Highway when her bus rolled over. My deepest sympathies go out to Milla’s parents, family members, friends and fellow students during this heartbreaking time. I spoke with Christian College Geelong principal, Dr <strong>Mathilda Joubert,</strong> yesterday. She described Milla as a beautiful person with an infectious personality, a talented basketballer, who had only recently represented her college at the state basketball championships. She was a treasured member of the college. Milla, and her loss, I know, has been deeply felt by all the students and staff.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Killeen’s basketball team also posted a tribute on social media. They said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Milla was a cherished part of our girls program at Try Boys, and her absence will be profoundly felt by everyone who had the privilege of knowing her.</p> 
   <p>With her easygoing nature and infectious smile, Milla had a special way of lighting up every room she walked into. She quickly endeared herself to teammates, coaches and the wider community, not just as a talented player ... but as a beautiful soul who brought joy wherever she went.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Deputy Nationals leader, <strong>Kevin Hogan</strong>, now takes the stand and asks the prime minister what he’s doing to repair the “deteriorating relationship” with the US and Israel.</p> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> says he finds it “extraordinary” that the opposition asks a question about the “deteriorating relationship” with the US when a US congressman is in the room.</p> 
  <p>The opposition benches are getting pretty loud today, we can hear some shouts of “300 days” – in reference to Albanese not having secured a face to face meeting with Trump. Albanese takes a shot at the opposition’s choice of questions today:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We had a question to the deputy prime minister alleging, somehow, like the fake moon landing or something, that meetings held by the deputy prime minister with the vice president of the United States ...</p>

  <p><strong>Alex Hawke</strong>, manager of opposition business, stands up and tells Albanese to answer the current question.</p> 
  <p>Albanese jokes that he thought Hawke would be asking for “an extension of time” (it’s a rinse and repeat jibe – see <strong>Josh Butler</strong>’s post below). He ends by saying the relationship between the US and Australia should be above partisan politics.</p>

  <p>A lot to unpack in the House from this interaction between Marles and Taylor just now. Labor MPs always ham it up when Taylor asks a question, and jeered at his initial question.</p>

  <p>When Marles shot back at the Coalition to call Taylor “Captain Conspiracy”, manager of opposition business <strong>Alex Hawke</strong> leapt to his feet, prompting an explosion of laughter from those on the Labor benches, with numerous MPs raising their hands and waving in mock surprise. Labor MPs have also mocked Hawke’s relatively occasional interruptions and calls for points of order.</p> 
  <p>“Give him an extension [of time]!” Albanese jeered at Hawke. It’s a callback to earlier in the week, when Hawke asked for Albanese to have an extension of time, to talk more about the government’s antisemitism response.</p>

  <p><strong>Marles’s trip to US a ‘magical mystery tour’, Angus Taylor says</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Angus Taylor</strong> says he “can’t make heads or tails” of deputy prime minister <strong>Richard Marles’s</strong> trip to the United States.</p> 
  <p>As we’ve been bringing you, there’s been a lot of back and forth over whether he and US defence secretary, <strong>Pete Hegseth,</strong> had a meeting or not.</p> 
  <p>A US defence spokesperson told Nine it was a “happenstance” event, but the chief Pentagon spokesperson told Guardian Australia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/trump-administration-pentagon-walks-back-claim-richard-marles-didnt-meet-pete-hegseth">it was a meeting and had been organised in advance</a>.</p> 
  <p>Taylor tells Sky News that, whatever it was, there’s still little detail on what that meeting involved.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It truly has been Richard Marles’ magical mystery tour, and it would be good for you [Marles] to front the media and explain what happened, what the outcomes were.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked whether the US administration should take some responsibility for the communication mishap, Taylor says the administration is “concerned, as I am actually, that we have an administration here in Australia, a government here in Australia that is underfunding defence”.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW transport minister challenged on toll revenue from sinkhole-plagued road</strong></p> 
  <p>Returning to NSW budget estimates, transport minister <strong>John Graham</strong> has been asked why the financial forecasts in this year’s state budget include toll revenue from the troubled M6 motorway project.</p> 
  <p>As Guardian Australia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/29/could-the-m6-be-sydneys-unbuildable-motorway-due-to-sinkholes-and-a-reverse-fault">has reported</a>, the opening of the “unbuildable” motorway in Sydney’s south has been pushed back from 2025 until at least late 2028, following geological issues including a 245-metre section plagued by sinkholes.</p> 
  <p>NSW Liberals deputy leader<strong> Natalie Ward</strong> asks: “How many cars are going through the M6 ... to generate those tolls?”</p> 
  <p>Graham says: “That’s why there’s zero revenue assumed for the current financial year.”</p> 
  <p>The transport minister says the government’s expectation at the time of the budget in June was that the first stage of the motorway would be generating revenue from users in the “outer years” of the forecast, which extends to 2028-29.</p>

  <p>The news that <strong>Richard Boyle</strong> will avoid jail time is a “small ray of light” at the end of a “sorry saga”, the Human Rights Law Centre has said.</p> 
  <p>HRLC associate legal director, <strong>Kieran Pender</strong>, said the court’s ruling today was a wake-up call for the Albanese government to do more to protect whistleblowers.</p> 
  <p>Pender said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Today concludes a sorry saga that has been devastating for Richard Boyle and undermined Australian democracy. While the no-conviction sentence is a small ray of light, this never should have happened. Richard Boyle made the brave decision to speak up when he witnessed wrongdoing, for years he has faced prosecution and punishment.</p> 
   <p>The Albanese government must not stand idly by as whistleblowers are punished, they must act with urgent law reform and the establishment of a whistleblower protection authority, to ensure prosecutions like this never happen again.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW transport minister: ‘highly likely’ work has been redone on delayed metro extension</strong></p> 
  <p>The NSW transport minister, <strong>John Graham</strong>, is appearing before budget estimates today, where the opposition has sought to pin him down on the opening dates of additions to Sydney’s high-speed metro network.</p> 
  <p>Extensions to the existing city line, via Sydenham to Bankstown in the inner west, as well as a line connecting the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/09/sydneys-second-airport-is-nearly-built-but-will-the-airlines-and-people-come">new Western Sydney airport</a> to the city’s rail network, have been pushed back by delays, including industrial disputes with the rail unions resolved <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/30/relief-for-a-million-daily-commuters-as-nsw-government-and-rail-unions-reach-pay-deal-after-months-at-odds">earlier this year</a>.</p> 
  <p>Graham says it is “highly likely” that construction work to convert stations and platforms on the Bankstown extension, originally promised to open late this year, has had to be redone, contributing to delays. He has not committed to a more precise completion date for the multibillion dollar project than some time in 2026.</p> 
  <p>“It’s not that the government is hiding information. We are clear that it will open in 2026, that’s the best information we’ve got at the moment and as we move to the high-speed testing, we will be really clear with those communities.”</p> 
  <p>He also would not commit to a start date for the airport line, originally planned to open alongside the new terminal in 2026, but which has been delayed by up to a year, in part because of a dispute with the private consortium building the line.</p>

  <p><strong>Qantas’ share price jumps to record high as profit soars</strong></p> 
  <p>Qantas has achieved a record market value of $18bn after revealing a big boost to its profit margin by holding ticket prices steady in 2024-25 while enjoying lower fuel costs.</p> 
  <p>Early trading after the company handed down its annual earnings results saw Qantas’ share price jump 10% to a record high. It was worth just half as much a year ago.</p> 
  <p>Results released on Thursday showed the group’s operating margin picked up over the year from 10.4% to 11.1%. Jetstar grew its margin for the third year in a row, to 13.7% and as high as 16% for domestic flights.</p> 
  <p>Across the group, ticketed passenger revenue and ticket sales both rose by about 7%, reaching nearly $17bn from 56m tickets, so unit revenue held steady.</p> 
  <p>Costs fell for the second year in a row as fuel prices slipped, meaning air fares surged relative to the price of jet fuel, confirming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/14/qantas-cancels-flights-at-double-the-rate-of-virgin-competition-watchdog-finds">analysis from the competition watchdog</a> earlier in August.</p> 
  <p>All those profits will mean shareholders receive $400m in dividends on top of the $400m payout awarded in February, which was the company’s first dividend payment since 2019. A share buy-back meant earnings per share is at the highest since the pandemic began.</p>

  <p><strong>Chalmers speaks about removing nuisance tariffs</strong></p> 
  <p>Today has definitely been a slower start to the day than yesterday (probably linked to last night’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/aug/27/midwinter-ball-2025-in-pictures">Midwinter Ball)</a>, but <strong>Jim Chalmers, Don Farrell</strong> and <strong>Tim Ayres</strong> are now up doing a press conference about those nuisance tariffs.</p> 
  <p>Chalmers says removing the nuisance tariffs is an important step and “capitalises on the momentum” built from the economic roundtable.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>These nuisance tariffs often do more harm than good. Nuisance tariffs push up compliance costs, they push up input costs, they push up prices for consumers as well. This decision that we are announcing jointly today is all about making it easier for business and governments when it comes to these nuisance tariffs.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Farrell says tariffs are the “top word” being used around the world right now – it’s a bit of a dig at the US, and says the government is focused on free trade.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’re putting out money where our mouth is right here with these changes.</p>

  <p><strong>Government to ditch 500 more nuisance tariffs</strong></p> 
  <p>The government will abolish 500 more nuisance tariffs, following last week’s economic roundtable discussion.</p> 
  <p>What is a nuisance tariff, you ask?</p> 
  <p>Great question, the Productivity Commission defines them as tariffs that “raise little revenue for the government, have negligible benefits for Australian producers, but impose compliance costs on businesses”.</p> 
  <p>The treasurer, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> has announced he’s got a list of 500 nuisance tariffs to ditch, including levies on TVs, tyres and wine glasses, and will consult on the proposed list.</p> 
  <p>Chalmers says the full list of tariffs to be removed will be in next years’ budget.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>With this reform, we’ll have removed around 1,000 tariffs over two years and streamlined approximately $23bn worth of trade, saving Australian businesses $157m in compliance costs annually.</p>

  <p>The idea was canvassed at last week’s roundtable, so no surprises that it has been announced today.</p>

  <p><strong>Coalition pushes to remove PM’s power to determine parliamentarian staffing numbers </strong></p> 
  <p>The Coalition is trying to push forward legislation that would remove power from the prime minister to determine staffing numbers for parliamentarians.</p> 
  <p>The prime minister cut staffing numbers from the independents in their previous term of government, and then cut the opposition’s staffing numbers this term, a move which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/24/anthony-albanese-criticised-for-vindictive-move-after-coalition-mps-see-staff-numbers-slashed">labelled “vindictive” by the Coalition</a>.</p> 
  <p>In the Senate a little earlier, Cash accused the prime minister of “undermining democracy”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Parliament isn’t the prime minister’s private office, and it is the people’s house. And those who are not on the govt benches have an obligation to the Australian people to ensure that the actions of the government are properly scrutinised … <strong>Mr Albanese has treated parliamentary staffing like a political weapon.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Coalition’s bill, which will receive support from some independents on the crossbench (but is unlikely to get over the line), would legislate a minimum number of staff for the opposition, minor parties and independents.</p> 
  <p>The Greens leader, <strong>Larissa Waters</strong> says that the government has given the Greens just 3% of the government’s staffing levels, despite receiving a national vote of 12% and 35% of the government’s vote at the last election.</p> 
  <p>But while not supporting the prime minister’s power to pick staffing levels, she accuses the Coalition of trying to “entrench” the power of the major parties. Under the Coalition’s bill, a minor party with more than eight members would still only get 5% of the government’s staffing levels.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s completely inappropriate that minor party and independent parliament staffing is at the discretion of the prime minister. Under the current arrangements the government of the day can disempower minor parties and independents and use staffing allocations punitively … the model proposed by the Coalition however, is more of the same.</p>

  <p>Qantas’ net profit rose by a third to $1.6bn in the year to June as customer numbers surged and Jetstar revenue surged while fuel costs fell.</p>

  <p>Underlying earnings rose more than $200m to $2.6bn, with Qantas domestic flights contributing $1bn of that. Jetstar saw its contribution to underlying earnings rise for third year in a row, to $769m, as the cheaper alternative brought on new plane fleet.</p> 
  <p>Qantas’ loyalty program also delivered underlying earnings of over $550m, after an increased number of customers earned 222bn frequent flyer points but redemeed only 185bn of them.</p>

  <p><strong>Labor’s Dan Repacholi and Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie call for faster implementation of national firearm registry</strong> </p> 
  <p>There are growing calls from within parliament for the government to accelerate the implementation of a national firearm registry, after the deadly shooting of two police officers in Victoria this week. Two officers were killed and another is in hospital, while the alleged shooter is still at large.</p> 
  <p>Earlier on the Today show, Labor MP – and former Olympic shooter – <strong>Dan Repacholi</strong> and Nationals senator – and shooting enthusiast – <strong>Bridget McKenzie</strong> were on a joint ticket on accelerating a national register.</p> 
  <p>State, territory and federal governments agreed to establish a national firearms registry after a national cabinet meeting in December 2023 but it’s only due to take effect in 2028.</p> 
  <p>Repacholi said he knows the issue “intimately” and that the work is happening to get the registry established.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We need to make sure that we know where our firearms are in this country … We’ve got to get the states and territories to all work together because they’re the ones that ultimately look after firearms registrations for their states.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>McKenzie said a registry is needed but it must be secure.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When Dan, as an Olympian and a Commonwealth Games shooting athlete goes to compete in different states, it’s a problem. If we had have had Albury police head down to Porepunkah, being from NSW, they might not have been able to appreciate that this guy had firearms. So we do need a national firearms register.</p> 
   <p>We don’t need law-abiding firearm owners like Dan and I’s personal details leaked like we’ve seen from some states, because then organised crime can come and get our firearms. So we need it to be secure.</p>

  <p>The two organisations, which had 259 employees in total throughout the trial, implemented a 32-hour working week for a year without any loss in pay or benefits for staff, while committing to maintaining standards of service.</p> 
  <p>Staff at the two organisations reported less work-related stress and greater satisfaction with their jobs and work-life balance.</p> 
  <p>Almost all (98%) workers at one of the agencies believed the four-day week trial improved motivation and morale, while there was a decrease in workers taking time off sick and a 25% fall in those taking sick days for psychological reasons.</p>

  <p>Speaking to RN Breakfast, <strong>Mark Sofer</strong>, who was ambassador to Australia between 2017 and 2020, says he wasn’t surprised at the allegations Iran was behind two antisemitic attacks. He also says attacks could have been carried out by Iran in other nations, not just Australia.</p>

And so, anyone who claims to the contrary basically is probably doing so just to score points internally with their own electorate or externally, I don’t know.

  <p>Jumping back to <strong>Tim Wilson</strong>’s interview on RN, the opposition small business spokesperson says he’s concerned about unintended consequences from the government’s penalty rates legislation.</p> 
  <p>The legislation is being debated in the Senate, and Wilson says there’s some confusion of whether there will be changes made retrospectively to existing award arrangements.</p> 
  <p>He says the workplace minister, <strong>Amanda Rishworth</strong>, said that it wouldn’t apply retrospectively, but Wilson says when asked in the Senate yesterday, cabinet minister <strong>Murray Watt</strong> had a different message.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They’ve said there’s not going to be any unintended consequences. In the House of Representatives, the minister said that there would be no retrospective changes to existing award arrangements to the awards from the legislation. In the Senate, the minister acting for Minister Rishworth is saying something different.

  <p>Watt told the Senate on Wednesday:</p>

   <p>Just as today there will be unions and employer groups seeking to vary terms and conditions in an award – either to raise pay rates, reduce pay rates, add conditions or take away conditions – then I’m sure some people will make use of this provision once it’s passed.</p>

  <p><strong>Sally Sara</strong> says that other workplace laws, like the right to disconnect, haven’t led the “sky to fall in”, according to Rishworth. Wilson accuses Rishworth of “hyperventilation”, and says no one had argued the sky was going to fall in.</p>

  <p><strong>International reputation of Australian universities declining, new report finds</strong> </p> 
  <p>Australia’s international education market is stagnating, a new report suggests, amid warnings a “stringent policy environment” is deterring prospective students from enrolling.</p> 
  <p>The global student flows research, released by higher education analyst <strong>QS Quacquarelli Symonds</strong> on Thursday, found Australia risked losing its leading study destination position if visa settings and graduate outcomes didn’t meet the expectations of international students.</p> 
  <p>It forecasted Australia’s international education sector would stagnate under current settings compared with global competitors, with an annual rise of 2% compared with around 10% prior to the pandemic.</p> 
  <p><strong>Jessica Turner</strong>, chief executive of QS Quacquarelli Symonds, said the reputation of Australian institutions among academics and employers had been in long-term decline.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Education exports contributed around $50bn in 2023/24.</p> 
   <p>However, a more stringent policy environment – where the country’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/01/labor-international-student-visa-fee-change">student visa fee</a> has become the most expensive in the world and visa allocations are set at individual institutions – could depress the 2% growth forecast in coming years.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The report projected total international enrolments would stand at about 770,000 by the end of the decade across higher education, English language and non-award courses.</p> 
  <p>The figure is well below the federal government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/11/international-students-australia-numbers-rising">revised target of 295,000 annual places</a> from next year, equating to more than 1.1 million students by 2030.</p> 
  <p>The new National Planning Level granted an additional 25,000 places compared with 2025 after Labor’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/27/albanese-government-international-student-cap-university">international student cap</a> failed to receive Coalition backing last year.</p>

  <p><strong>Tim Wilson suggests evidence of IRGC actions in Australia ‘was clear earlier’</strong></p> 
  <p>The Coalition has been critical of the government for not listing the IRGC as a terrorist organisation sooner, but is facing its own questions as to why the previous Coalition government didn’t do so.</p> 
  <p>Liberal MP <strong>Tim Wilson</strong>, was on ABC RN Breakfast earlier and said the evidence for the government to list the IRGC has prevalent over the last two and a half years.</p> 
  <p>When asked whether the previous Coalition government should have done more, Wilson says they listed Hezbollah and Hamas as terrorist organisations.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Obviously, these things come down to the advice at different times to make sure that we accumulate the evidence to do so … we always welcome the decision of the government to have taken this step at this time. And the most important thing is that the actions have been taken now, even if we wish that had have been done earlier because we believe the evidence was clear earlier.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Host <strong>Sally Sara</strong> pushes Wilson, saying that Asio’s evidence of Iran’s involvement in two antisemitic attacks in Australia has only come out now. <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> said on Tuesday that he was briefed by Asio on Monday, and then promptly pulled diplomats out of Australia’s embassy in Tehran on Monday night. Wilson says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s been pretty clear they’ve [Iran] been involved in trying to inflame tensions in Israel and around the world. That is what has now come to light explicitly since in the past couple of days, but it’s been pretty clear since [7 October 2023].</p>

  <p>There’ll likely be more reaction today to the listing of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terror group, and to the expulsion of the Iranian ambassador.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Usman Khawaja to meet prime minister to discuss gambling ads</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Australian cricketer <strong>Usman Khawaja</strong> will today meet the prime minister to discuss gambling ads, before a roundtable discussion with public health experts and doctors.</p> 
  <p>Khawaja, who will also speak to <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> about the war in Gaza, has been critical of the close association between sport and the wagering industry, given the potential for social harm.</p> 
  <p>Khawaja will also attend the roundtable discussion with crossbenchers<strong> David Pocock</strong> and <strong>Kate Chaney,</strong> the Australian Medical Association, the Australia Institute, public health expert <strong>Samantha Thomas </strong>and people with lived experience of gambling harm.</p> 
  <p>The group is calling on the federal government to adopt the recommendations of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/29/australias-had-two-more-years-of-gambling-ad-harm-since-the-murphy-report-its-time-for-labor-to-show-some-courage">a parliamentary inquiry led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy,</a> which called for a ban on gambling ads and inducements, among many other changes.</p> 
  <p>Earlier this week, when asked why it had taken more than two years to respond to the inquiry, Albanese told parliament the government was mindful “of whether people just go offshore” to continue gambling. Offshore gambling service are banned in Australia and not subject to consumer protections.</p> 
  <p>Thomas, who will deliver a short speech at the event, said that argument should not delay reforms.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Despite industry rhetoric, there is limited independent evidence to suggest that ad bans would lead to a mass exodus to illegal markets. Independent analysis also shows that we don’t need gambling ads to protect free-to-air television and big media brands. If we are to move forward in Australia, we must also disrupt industry influence over policy.</p>
