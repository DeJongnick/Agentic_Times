<p>An extra layer of poignancy was associated with the death of Jimmy Bone this week. An individual who made a huge contribution to Scottish club football, the robust forward’s only goal for his country came in Copenhagen’s original Parken. Denmark 1 Scotland 4 in October 1972. The Scots, then briefly under the management of Tommy Docherty, had set themselves on course to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, ending an absence of 16 years.</p> <p>Come Friday, Copenhagen is again the venue. The painful wait this time stretches back to 1998. Togo, North Korea, Panama, Saudi Arabia and Wales have featured in the World Cup since Scotland last did. Steve Clarke will shortly become the longest-serving Scotland manager by games overseen. Scotland have a Ballon d’Or nominee – in respect of Scott McTominay’s country represented if not of birth – and six games to determine their 2026 fate.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/04/from-fast-risers-to-fallen-giants-world-cup-2026-qualifiers-to-watch">From fast risers to fallen giants: World Cup 2026 qualifiers to watch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is this to be Clarke’s slowest of final steps or a lusty skip into the pantheon of Scotland greats? The answer will be apparent by November. Clarke has 540 minutes to deliver automatically what would by a distance be the finest achievement of his career. Nobody should underestimate the scale of this task.</p> <p>It has been clear for some time that Clarke views the end of this World Cup cycle, and his contract, as a natural time to conclude a tenure which began in 2019. Whether that inevitable departure is healthy is a point for debate. The more serious, lingering notion the 62-year-old has to disprove is that he is presiding over a team that peaked long before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/14/germany-scotland-euro-2024-match-report">numbing experience of Germany</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/24/scotland-exit-with-a-whimper-with-worrying-questions-about-future-of-the-team">the last Euros</a>. Scotland <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/nov/19/scotland-steve-clarke-nations-league-upbeat-mood-comment">rallied over the latter stages</a> of their subsequent Nations League campaign but the paucity of performance in losing home games <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/23/scotland-greece-nations-league-playoff-match-report">against Greece</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/06/scotland-iceland-international-friendly-match-report">and Iceland</a>, conceding three goals in each, had red flags flying high above Hampden Park. Clarke’s rare public pronouncements have not quietened grumbling in the stands, which exists partly through familiarity breeding contempt. Greece, an emerging youthful force, again lie in wait in this qualifying section.</p> <p>Scotland’s desire to end their World Cup hiatus is palpable and how the tournament would benefit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jun/28/scotland-fans-euro-2024-philipp-lahm">from a tartan invasion</a>. Clarke’s success in raising standards is similarly plain. However, there are unavoidable reasons for scepticism. So many of them, in fact, that Clarke’s challenge, starting against Denmark on Friday, is substantial. The Scottish Football Association will revert to panic mode when it eventually comes to sourcing Clarke’s successor. The lack of discernible playing talent will render this job a hard sell. Scotland’s clubs either play a part in or do not care about the broader picture, as the lengths gone to in sourcing journeymen in the recent transfer window shows.</p> <p>Scotland’s goalkeeping scenario is more national emergency than dilemma. Liam Kelly does not play for Rangers, Zander Clark surely will soon not be playing for Hearts and Angus Gunn has had no game time since lasting seven minutes of that loss to Iceland in June. Clarke will probably turn to Gunn against Denmark, which is akin to damning the 29-year-old with faint praise. The Nottingham Forest back-up keeper has failed to convince in Scotland colours.</p>    <p>The central defence is weak in international context. That Andy Robertson is no longer a guaranteed starter at left-back for Liverpool need not be a huge issue, but it suggests his star is fading. Kieran Tierney’s return to Celtic has been notable only because of obvious physical limitations, which led on Thursday to his withdrawal through injury. The attack is either untried at this level (Kieron Bowie and George Hirst) or lacks scoring punch (Che Adams). Hence continued reliance on Lyndon Dykes. Giddy excitement over Ben Gannon-Doak ignores the fact the 19-year-old still has to gain a foothold in club football, as Clarke has regularly pointed out.</p> <p>There are strands of hope. Aaron Hickey’s return after a horrible period out with serious hamstring problems should alleviate worries at right-back, where Scotland had been scratching for a solution. The midfield, spearheaded by McTominay, is more than adequate for international football. Clarke’s conundrum there is in accommodating so many talented players. It must also be recognised that Denmark away is precisely the sort of fixture Scotland tend to revel in, with backs against the wall and organisation not in doubt. Even a point would be a fine outcome before Monday evening’s must-/surely-will-win meeting with Belarus in deepest Hungary. Scotland’s last meeting with Denmark four years ago witnessed arguably the finest performance of Clarke’s tenure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/15/scotland-denmark-world-cup-2022-qualifying-match-report">and a 2-0 win</a>.</p> <p>In 1972, Scotland were on the crest of a wave. Billy Bremner, Martin Buchan, Peter Lorimer; Kenny Dalglish and Joe Harper replaced Lou Macari and Bone. Copenhagen triggered a run in which the country reached six out of seven World Cups. There are parallels as another section begins in the Danish capital. It is just that the fundamental differences feel so hard to shake off.</p>
