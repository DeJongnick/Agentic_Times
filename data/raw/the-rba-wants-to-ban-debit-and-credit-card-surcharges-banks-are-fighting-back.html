<p>Banks have threatened to increase credit card fees and make it harder to earn rewards if the Reserve Bank of Australia’s proposal to ban card surcharges goes ahead.</p> <p>Is this the end of credit cards, which are already being used less frequently? And what will become of loyalty programs?</p> <h2><strong>Bank backlash</strong></h2> <p>The RBA, which oversees the payments sector, wants surcharges eliminated for debit and credit payments, a recommendation welcomed by consumer groups.</p> <p>Card charges have become increasingly unpopular in recent years, with shoppers regularly paying fees on everyday transactions regardless of whether they use a debit or a credit card.</p> <p>In submissions made public this week, the big four banks condemned the central bank’s proposal, warning it could lead to higher annual card fees, shorter interest-free periods and diminished card rewards.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/24/churning-hacking-revolving-transacting-in-the-credit-card-points-game-who-wins">Churning, hacking, revolving, transacting: who wins in the ‘credit card points game’?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Westpac accused the federal government, which pushed for more consumer-friendly payment policies before the 2025 general election, of failing to make it clear to consumers that they could bear the cost of the elimination of surcharges.</p> <p>“Neither the government nor the RBA have openly and transparently told the 17 million Australians who have a card in their wallet that the proposal … would result in arguably the biggest change in the market since [credit cards’] introduction,” the bank’s submission says.</p> <p>Other industry players say the banks’ warnings are credible, with the owner of Square and Afterpay, Block, describing costlier credit cards as an “intended outcome”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The RBA proposal would wipe all surcharges, meaning people with low-cost debit cards would no longer be vulnerable to paying the same fees as exclusive rewards-generating credit cardholders.</p> <p>The current system effectively subsidises credit card users at the expense of debit card users, a system deemed unfair by the RBA and consumer groups, including Choice, which is backing the RBA’s reforms.</p> <p>“There are a lot of stakeholders who make a buck out of the payments system and I’m not surprised to see some of them trying to preserve their position, but ultimately the RBA has to stick to its guns,” Choice’s head of policy, Morgan Campbell, said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/20/as-more-australians-save-banks-are-cutting-interest-rates-for-deposits-faster-than-the-rbas-offical-cash-rate">As more Australians save, banks are cutting interest rates for deposits faster than the RBA’s official cash rate</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The end of credit card rewards?</strong></h2> <p>Opaque and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/24/churning-hacking-revolving-transacting-in-the-credit-card-points-game-who-wins">tricky rewards schemes</a> have been funded by banks’ underlying fees and would have to be reduced, according to senior payments systems experts, who asked not to be named.</p> <p>“Does it make any sense that you get rewarded for paying for something? The whole system is built on tricking people,” one said.</p> <p>Bank-to-bank transaction fees include costs such as cardholder reward programs, which are responsible for nearly a third of the credit fees despite having no connection to transaction costs, <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/review-of-retail-payments-regulation/issuer-cost-study/2025-08/pdf/issuer-cost-study.pdf">RBA analysis</a> found.</p> <p>Big banks say credit cards are important for household spending and cashflow.</p> <p>Credit card usage, however, is already falling, with four times more debit accounts than credit accounts in the system.

A final decision is expected by December.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
