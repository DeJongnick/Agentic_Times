<p>Good afternoon. The federal government has agreed to pay $475m in additional compensation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/04/robodebt-victims-win-record-settlement-centrelink-government-compensation">to roughly 450,000 victims of the robodebt scandal</a>, in the largest class action settlement in Australian history.</p> 
<p>The government announced on Thursday it had agreed to settle Knox v the commonwealth – an appeal from the original 2020 robodebt class action settlement. The appeal was launched last year after a royal commission exposed fresh evidence that commonwealth officials who ran the debt-raising scheme knew it was unlawful but proceeded anyway.</p> 
<p>The total settlement is $548.5m, with up to $60m set aside to administer the scheme and $13.5m to cover the applicants’ reasonable legal costs.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, at some point, President Trump will work out that he’s being ‘played’ by Putin.” – Tony Abbott</p> 
<p>The former prime minister has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/sep/04/australia-politics-live-bob-carr-daniel-andrews-beijing-putin-question-time-labor-coalition-anthony-albanese-sussan-ley-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-68b904d58f08020a75f131ff#block-68b904d58f08020a75f131ff">penned his inaugural blog post on the popular platform Substack</a>. The musings are focused on Trump’s presidency, which he describes as “even more transactional and unpredictable than the first” – though he maintains it’s “better” to have Trump in the top job than Kamala Harris.</p>
