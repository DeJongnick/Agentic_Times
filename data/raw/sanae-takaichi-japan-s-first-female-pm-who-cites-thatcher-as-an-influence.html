<p>When candidates for the leadership of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) were invited during a debate to say a few words in English, Sanae Takaichi kept her contribution brief. “Japan is back,” she declared.</p> <p>The 64-year-old rightwinger, who has cited Margaret Thatcher in her quest to build a “strong and prosperous” Japan, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/04/sanae-takaichi-expected-to-become-japans-first-female-pm-after-winning-ruling-party-leadership">beat her centrist rival, Shinjiro Koizumi, in a runoff election</a> at the LDP headquarters in Tokyo on 4 October.</p> <p>On Tuesday, eight decades after the end of the second world war, she made history by becoming the country’s first female prime minister, receiving 237 votes in an election in parliament’s 465-seat lower house and then winning a similar vote in the less powerful upper house.</p> <p>Her victory was secured after the LDP, which has governed Japan for most of its postwar history, agreed on Monday to form a coalition with the rightwing Japan Innovation party, known as Nippon Ishin.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/japan-leadership-next-pm-shinjiro-koizumi-sanae-takaichi-liberal-democratic-party-debate">Generational change or gender breakthrough, whoever Japan’s next PM is will have a mountain to climb</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The result is redemption for Takaichi, who last year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/japan-shigeru-ishiba-prime-minister-liberal-democratic-party">ran unsuccessfully</a> against the previous prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba. Her second challenge for the leadership briefly faltered after criticism of her unsubstantiated claims, made during a debate, that foreigners were physically abusing “sacred” deer in Nara, where she has been an MP since 1993.</p> <p>It also represents a victory for the right of the LDP, which has spent the past year licking its wounds under the more moderate Ishiba.</p> <p>Takaichi has a direct ideological connection with the former prime minister Shinzo Abe, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/08/shinzo-abe-japans-former-prime-minister-dies-after-being-shot">who was assassinated in 2022</a>, sharing his revisionist views on Japan’s wartime conduct – a position that could cause friction with Japan’s neighbours.</p>    <p>Takaichi has been critical of China and makes regular pilgrimages to Yasukuni, a shrine in Tokyo that honours Japan’s war dead, including convicted war criminals. She has displayed similarly conservative credentials on social policy: she opposes same-sex marriage and allowing married couples to use separate surnames – a move popular with voters that she says would undermine traditional family values. She is similarly dismissive of the idea of reigning empresses.</p> <p>Abe also looms large in her economic policy. Takaichi has said she supports aggressive public spending to stimulate the world’s fourth-biggest economy. She has, though, headed off a potential conflict with the US president, Donald Trump – whom she will meet in Tokyo next week – by dropping suggestions that she would try to renegotiate a trade and investment deal with the US. Trump has agreed to lower tariffs on Japanese cars and other items in return for $550bn in Japanese investment.</p> <p>Her focus on migration – a subject that occupied the first eight minutes of a 15-minute campaign speech – is seen as an attempt to win back voters who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/28/japan-election-results-2024-ldp-cdp-ishiba-noda">abandoned the LDP in national elections last October</a> and this July in favour of rightwing minor parties, including the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/19/japanese-first-sohei-kamiya-sanseito-party-nationalist-mini-trump-population-crisis-bites">up-and-coming Sanseito</a>.</p> <p>During her campaign, Takaichi called for restrictions on non-Japanese people buying property and a crackdown on illegal immigration – a view shared by Ishin.</p> <p>A fan of the Hanshin Tigers baseball team, Takaichi played drums in a heavy metal band while at university and counts scuba diving and watching martial arts among her hobbies.</p>
