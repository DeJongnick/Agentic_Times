<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has once again delayed implementing sweeping <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">tariffs</a> on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a>, announcing another 90-day pause just hours before the last agreement between the world’s two largest economies was due to expire.</p> <p>On Monday, the US president signed an executive order extending the deadline for higher tariffs on China until 10 November, officials confirmed to Reuters.</p> <p>Chinese officials said earlier in the day they hoped the United States would strive for “positive” trade outcomes on Monday, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/12/china-us-agree-pause-trade-war-trump">90-day detente</a> reached between the two countries in May was due to expire.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/trumps-china-trade-truce-extension-spurs-market-rally">Trump’s China trade truce extension spurs market rally</a> </p> </aside>  <p>China’s commerce ministry, in a statement on early Tuesday, said it will suspend additional tariffs on US goods for 90 more days, after Trump signed an executive order extending the tariff truce.</p> <p>China will maintain its tariffs on US goods at 10%, the statement said, and take action to address non-tariff barriers facing American products. China will also postpone for 90 days the addition of US firms it had targeted in April to trade and investment restriction lists.</p> <p>“We hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state … and strive for positive outcomes on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” a foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said in an earlier statement on Monday.</p> <p>Chinese and US officials said they <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-tariffs-trump-explain-deadline-d4384094ecc50c7a838b2d6bd5cc2e21">expected</a> the pause to be extended after the most recent round of trade talks held last month in Stockholm. Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said last week the US had “the makings” of a trade deal with China and that he was optimistic about a path forward.</p> <p>Failure to reach a deal would have major consequences. Trump had threatened tariffs on China as high as 245%, with China threatening retaliatory tariffs of 125%, setting off a trade war between the world’s largest economies.</p> <p>On Sunday, Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/11/business/us-china-trade-tariffs-deal.html">posted</a> on TruthSocial that China should quadruple its purchases of soybeans from the US to help reduce the trade deficit between the US and China.</p> <p>Currently, US exports to China are subject to tariffs of about 30%, with imports from China subject to a baseline tariff of 10% and a 20% extra tariff in response to fentanyl smuggling <a href="https://www.hklaw.com/en/insights/publications/2025/05/president-trump-announces-preliminary-trade-agreements-with-uk-china">allegations</a> against China. Some products are taxed at higher rates. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/10/nvidia-amd-china-chip-sale-revenues">Nvidia and AMD agree to pay 15% of China chip export revenues to US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Federal Reserve and many economists have argued that the tariffs will push up prices in the US. Goldman Sachs strategists <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-china-trade-stocks-tariffs-3087154b">calculate</a> that US consumers have absorbed 22% of tariff costs through June 2025. That share is expected to rise to 67% if recent tariffs follow the same pattern as earlier ones.</p> <p>Before the tariff deadline, chipmakers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nvidia">Nvidia</a> and AMD <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/10/nvidia-amd-china-chip-sale-revenues">agreed</a> to pay the US government 15% of their revenue from advanced chips sold to China in exchange for export licenses to the market.</p> <p>Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-bid-cut-nvidia-amd-095017313.html">told Bloomberg</a> of the deal: “What we are seeing is in effect the monetization of US trade policy in which US companies must pay the US government for permission to export. If that’s the case, we’ve entered into a new and dangerous world.”</p> <p><em>Associated Press and Reuters contributed </em><em>reporting</em></p>
