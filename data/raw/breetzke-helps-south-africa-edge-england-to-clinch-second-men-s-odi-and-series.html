<p>It has been a South African summer at Lord’s. After the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/14/south-africa-complete-historic-win-over-australia-world-test-championship-final-cricket">World Test Championship triumph</a> in June came a second to savour at the home of cricket: a narrow five-run win under lights that sealed their first one-day international series victory on English soil for 27 years.</p> <p>As the tourists kept the celebrations in check – this was never going to top the final at the same venue three months ago – England reflected on a fifth ODI series defeat from their last six. They improved on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/02/england-south-africa-first-odi-match-report">Tuesday’s Headingley howler</a>, even if it would have been hard to have played any worse.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/04/england-v-south-africa-second-mens-one-day-international-live">England given target of 331 to beat South Africa: second men’s one-day international – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Set 331 to win, Harry Brook’s side made 325 for nine through a spirited effort that did crackle at times. Jacob Bethell tucked into Keshav Maharaj en route to 58 from just 40 balls, Joe Root finessed a classy 61 before being stumped. And after Jos Buttler’s brisk 61 from 51, they needed 75 from the last 45 balls of the chase with four wickets in hand.</p> <p>But the Proteas always felt ahead and ultimately prevailed. A yorker from Lungi Ngidi had lit up Buttler’s stumps and, despite some late blows from Will Jacks (39) the regular fall of wickets then left the lower order too much to do. It finished with Jofra Archer needing 16 off the final over from Senuran Muthusamy – only to fall just short.</p> <p>Two-nil down, England now head to Southampton on Sunday hoping for a consolation win before the T20s that follow. This was their eighth defeat from 11 ODIs since Brendon McCullum’s brief was expanded to include the white-ball teams – their only wins this year coming against West Indies, who are ranked ninth in the world to England’s eighth.</p> <p>“It’s easy to say that, but in my eyes that’s just an excuse,” said Brook, when asked if fatigue or the switch from 100-ball cricket were relevant. “Slipping into any format is difficult. But we’re all good enough cricketers to be able to make that change and adapt as quickly as possible.”</p> <p>A bit went England’s way, too, be it Brook winning the toss after a morning of rain or an outfield that quickened up in the second innings. Wiaan Mulder, whose figures of three for 33 helped derail the home side at Headingley, was missing after an overnight illness. Saqib Mahmood coming in for Sonny Baker also meant more experience for England.</p> <p>But South Africa were unperturbed, their imposing 330 for eight built on another bright start from Aiden Markram (49) and a fourth-wicket stand from Matthew Breetzke (85) and Tristan Stubbs (58) that put on 147 in just 126 balls. Dewald Brevis then lit the afterburners, the 22-year-old smoking 42 from 20 to underline his remarkable hand-eye talent.</p> <p>Archer ran through his variations for four wickets but, not for the first time, the standout bowler was Adil Rashid. Sending down 10 overs for just 33 runs – and hit for just one boundary – the leg-spinner tickled Temba Bavuma’s outside edge with a beauty and removed Markram with a sharp return catch. In a parallel universe, this would augur well for the Ashes.</p>    <p>Although, as dreamily as Rashid bowled, there was no obvious need for South Africa to take him on. One of the hallmarks of Brook’s captaincy has been to pack the batting and winkle out 10 overs using part-time spin. Bethell did snuff out Brevis with his left-arm darts but, sending down five overs apiece, he and Jacks were taken for a combined 112 runs.</p> <p>Breetzke was among those to cash in, returning from a hamstring niggle to become the first man in ODI history to pass 50 in each of his first five innings. The right-hander unfurled some eye-catching shots, including one silky inside-out six off Bethell, only to be mugged by an Archer slower ball.</p> <p>It meant South Africa went into the last 10 overs on 240 for four, a useful platform from which to accelerate, only for the set Stubbs to be run out two overs later after a calamitous mix-up with Brevis. The youngster atoned at least, his late flurry of three fours and three sixes – plus a handy 32 from Corbin Bosch – leaving England needing to break a record at Lord’s.</p> <p>Their bid to do so faltered immediately, Jamie Smith pushing hard at an inswinger from Nandre Burger first ball for an edge behind – the first of three for the slippery left-armer. Ben Duckett also lacked fluency, penned in for a 33-ball 14 and bowled by Maharaj reverse sweeping.</p> <p>In came Bethell at 66 for two in the 13th over to continue a right-left combination with Root and finding some form at the end of a personally challenging summer. Taking 19 runs off an over from Maharaj, Bethell gave the innings momentum only to slash Bosch to backward point.</p> <p>When Root followed soon after – Maharaj reasserting himself – England’s chances hinged on one of Brook, Buttler or Jacks seeing it home. But the tourists kept plugging away, Muthusamy removing Brook for 33 via a leading edge and Burger shutting down Jacks and Brydon Carse.</p> <p>Much will be made of England’s balance, even if South Africa’s XI was set up much the same. The Proteas are a more developed and confident side, however, and Lord’s has proved inspirational for them this summer.</p>
