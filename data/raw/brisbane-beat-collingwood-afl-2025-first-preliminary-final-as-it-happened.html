But, this time, the past two AFL premiers are playing for a spot in the decider against Geelong next Saturday.</p> <p>This is the first time the duo have faced off in a preliminary final, after the Lions won a pair of classic grand finals in 2002-03, and the Pies took the honours in a 2003 qualifying final sandwiched between. More recently, they shared their two clashes so far this season with the Pies making an early-season statement with a 52-point win at the Gabba, while the Lions turned the tables for a 27-point triumph at this same venue in round 21.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe">During finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The reigning premiers are in their fourth consecutive preliminary final and seeking a third straight grand final spot, while the Pies are just as familiar with this stage – this is their third trip to the penultimate week of the season in coach Craig McRae’s four-year reign.</p> <p><strong>First bounce will be at 5.15pm local time / AEST</strong>.
