<h2>Borderlands 4</h2> 
<p>The boisterous “looter shooter” series returns, bringing ridiculously powerful weapons, a cool new hoverbike and a vast planet to explore, while dealing with the threat of a ruthless cosmic dictator known as the Timekeeper. It’s been five years since the last instalment, and developer Gearbox has massively updated the signature cartoon visuals to bring us the next generation of sci-fi comic book anarchy. <br>• <em>Released </em><em>12 September</em><em>; </em><em>PC, PS5, Xbox</em><em>, </em><em>Switch (3 October)</em></p> 
<h2>Silent Hill f</h2> 
<p>Looking to scare yourself stupid as the long dark nights draw in? The first completely new instalment in Konami’s psychological horror series for over a decade has been cautiously welcomed by fans – but the proof will be in the (extremely bloody) pudding. Set in 1960s Japan, it follows high-school student Hinako Shimizu as her home town becomes shrouded in a dense fog filled with freakish monsters. <br>• <em>25 September</em><em>; </em><em>PC, PS5, Xbox</em></p> 
<h2>EA Sports FC 26</h2> 
<p>The superlative footie simulation heads back on to the pitch, sporting a revived game engine with an emphasis on fluid animation, super smart computer-controlled teammates and of course accurate up-to-date teams and players. Designed in conjunction with fans and pro footballers it’s a marked improvement on last year’s edition. <br>• <em>26 September</em><em>; </em><em>PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox</em></p> 
<h2>Ghost of Yōtei</h2> 
<p>The sequel to acclaimed samurai adventure Ghost of Tsushima takes place 300 years later in the early 17th century, with vengeful ronin Atsu on the trail of a renegade samurai warlord and his clan. Expect another sombre and challenging epic, combining authentic combat and leisurely exploration beneath the beautiful and imposing Mount Yōtei. <br>• <em>2 October</em><em>; </em><em>PS5</em></p> 
<h2>Battlefield 6</h2> 
<p>Billed as a spiritual successor to the excellent Battlefield 4, this pulverising first-person shooter is set during a modern-day global conflict, abandoning the sci-fi shenanigans of its predecessor, Battlefield 2042. Early previews of the game’s online multiplayer mode have been promising, with incredibly intense battles and detailed scenic destruction. <br>• <em>10 October</em><em>; </em><em>PC, PS5, Xbox</em></p> 
<h2>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</h2> 
<p>If you need a little light in your life as the evenings darken, Nintendo and developer Game Freak have the answer, a fresh instalment in the Pokémon series, set in the French-themed Lumiose City, a peaceful place to explore during the day, a hive of ambitious Pokémon trainers at night. Expect the usual blend of cosiness and gentle challenge. <br>• <em>16 October</em><em>; </em><em>Switch</em></p> 
<h2>Keeper</h2> 
<p>So few video games these days give you the chance to play as a sentient lighthouse with a friendly seabird assistant – thank goodness kooky San Francisco studio Double Fine is here to address the shortfall. It promises an emotional tale of companionship and metamorphosis, set in a mythical seaside realm. <br>• 17 <em>October</em><em>; </em><em>PC, Xbox</em></p> 
<h2>Ninja Gaiden 4</h2> 
<p>Set in a near-future Tokyo awash with the blood of fallen warriors, the latest hack-and-slash adventure from Team Ninja dials up the gore and introduces a new character, the young ninja prodigy Yakumo. This is an unapologetically tough old-school brawler, designed to be played at a lightning pace. <br>• <em>21 October</em><em>; </em><em>PC, PS5, Xbox</em></p> 
<h2>Once Upon a Katamari</h2>

<p>Created by designer and artist Keita Takahashi, the Katamari series of surreal puzzle games require players to collect a variety of familiar objects into huge balls in order to repair broken planets. Once Upon a Katamari is the first new instalment for 14 years, bringing a whole new generation into this bright, weird and funny universe. <br>• <em>24 October</em><em>; </em><em>PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox</em></p> 
<h2>Goodnight Universe</h2> 
<p>Nice Dream, the LA-based team behind Bafta award-winning game Before Your Eyes, returns with another <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/aug/13/goodnight-universe-psychic-baby-before-your-eyes-pc-game">offbeat, emotionally intelligent adventure</a>, this time centring on six-month-old baby Isaac whose burgeoning psychic powers capture the attention of a shadowy government agency. Like its predecessor, the game makes interesting use of webcams, lending a cinéma vérité feel to the narrative. <br>• <em>11 November</em><em>; PC, PS5, Switch, Xbox</em></p>
