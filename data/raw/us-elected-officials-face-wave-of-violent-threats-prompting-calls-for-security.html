<p>A fresh wave of violent threats and incidents targeting elected officials broke out in the US this week, prompting more urgent calls for increased security measures just days after the killing of a Minnesota state legislator and the shooting of another.</p> <p>Amid a series of attacks involving federal and local officials, the latest incidents included death threats against Zohran Mamdani, the New York mayoral candidate, a purported road rage attack on Max Miller, the Ohio congressman, and an alleged kidnapping attempt targeting Paul Young, the mayor of Memphis.</p> <p>The New York police department (NYPD) hate crimes task force is investigating multiple death threats against Mamdani, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/18/establishment-democrats-zohran-mamdani-new-york">Muslim democratic socialist candidate</a> in the final stretch of his campaign and endorsed by national figures such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/bernie-sanders-zohran-mamdani-new-york-city-mayor-primary">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/aoc-nyc-mayoral-race-endorsements">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>. The intimidation included threats to blow up his car and Islamophobic voicemails left at Mamdani’s office in the city’s Queens borough.</p>    <p>“The violent and specific language of what appears to be a repeat caller is alarming and we are taking every precaution,” his campaign said Thursday, blaming the threats on “dehumanizing, Islamophobic rhetoric designed to stoke division and hate”.</p> <p>Miller contacted the US Capitol Police after being “run off the road” by a man displaying a Palestinian flag who allegedly yelled “death to Israel”. Miller, who is Jewish and on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/mar/12/jewish-republican-trump-haitian-immigrants-holocaust">US Holocaust Memorial Council</a>, said the incident occurred while driving in his congressional district and that he knows the identity of his alleged assailant, who also threatened to kill his family.</p> <p>Early on Friday afternoon, a man was arrested in connection with the incident.</p> <p>The suspect was named as Feras Hamdan, 36, of Westlake, near Cleveland, and authorities said he turned himself in to police and is due to appear in court, <a href="https://www.cleveland19.com/2025/06/20/westlake-man-charged-road-rage-incident-with-congressman-max-miller/">according to</a> local media reports.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Memphis police arrested 25-year-old Trenton Abston on charges including stalking and attempted kidnapping after he allegedly scaled a wall at Young’s residence in Tennessee with what police described as a “nervous demeanor”. Officers recovered “a taser, gloves, rope and duct tape” from the suspect’s vehicle.</p>    <p>The string of incidents came just days <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/minnesota-lawmaker-killings-misinformation-rightwing">after the killing</a> of Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota Democratic state representative, and her husband Mark, with John Hoffman, a state senator, and his wife seriously wounded in a separate attack by the same gunman last Saturday as anti-Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/no-kings-protests">“No Kings” protests</a> were getting underway <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/no-kings-protests-trump-military-parade">for millions</a> across the country. The suspect, Vance Boelter, 57, was captured after a large manhunt and faces murder charges, amid reports that he is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/minnesota-lawmaker-killings-misinformation-rightwing">an extremist</a> and was pro-Trump and anti-abortion.</p> <p>The discovery of a hit list containing “dozens and dozens” of Democratic politicians’ names in Boelter’s car has sent new shockwaves through the political community. Hillary Scholten, a member of Congress from Michigan, cancelled a public town hall, citing safety concerns.</p> <p>The escalating threats have left congressmembers from both parties <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/congress-security-minnesota-shooting">demanding additional security funding</a> and enhanced protection measures in recent days, as fears grow that political violence is becoming normalized across American politics. The Capitol Police requested nearly $1bn in funding for next year, while Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, posted that “the violence and threats against elected officials has drastically increased” and called for more money to protect lawmakers.</p> <p>Capitol Police <a href="https://www.uscp.gov/media-center/press-releases/uscp-threat-assessment-cases-2024">investigated 9,474 threats</a> to lawmakers and their families last year, an increase of nearly 1,500 compared with 2023, which have escalated over the last five years but peaked in 2021. Only <a href="https://democrats-cha.house.gov/media/press-releases/chairman-steil-and-ranking-member-morelle-request-doj-assistance-threats">eight convictions were made</a> over the threats in 2024, according to a bipartisan letter from Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin representative, and Joseph Morelle, a New York representative, sent Tuesday to the Department of Justice.</p> <p>Mike Johnson linked the violence to broader political rhetoric. “What happened to Max [Miller] this morning is yet another outrageous example of unhinged rhetoric inspiring unstable people to threaten and attack elected officials,” the House speaker said. “We must turn down the temperature in this country.”<br></p>
