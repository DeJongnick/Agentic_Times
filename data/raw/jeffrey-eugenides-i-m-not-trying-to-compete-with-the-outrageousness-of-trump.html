<p>In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina, or the subprime mortgage crisis, or the succession of the first black president by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/16/the-guardian-view-on-donald-trump-beyond-the-moral-pale" title="">reality TV star braggart</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/jeffrey-eugenides" title="">Jeffrey Eugenides</a> wrote: “One’s country was like oneself, the more you learned about it, the more there was to be ashamed about.” That sentence constitutes the dark heart of a&nbsp;sly yet pathos-packed tale called “Great Experiment” in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/24/fresh-complaint-jeffrey-eugenides-review-short-stories" title=""><em>Fresh Complaint</em></a>, his recently published first collection of short stories. Twelve years on, surely American national shame is greater than any personal shame?</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/24/fresh-complaint-jeffrey-eugenides-review-short-stories">Fresh Complaint by Jeffrey Eugenides review – men behaving badly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Oh it’s gotta be equal,” Eugenides sighs. “We all have a slave history past,” and then he laughs sadly. “I think that kind of inventory is endless in both directions – personally and nationally. Right now, perhaps it’s easier to pay attention to the national side of things, but they kind of go hand in hand, don’t they? There are going to be personal blots that plague you as you try to figure out how to negotiate and navigate current events and meet your fellow citizen on the street. A nation is just a bunch of people, so all the problems that happen in the nation are personal, on some level.”</p> <p>He’s speaking in a library in a new building on the campus of Princeton University, where Eugenides, who is now 57, has taught for a decade. The building is not quite finished: with a proper sign yet to come, someone has scrawled “unisex” on a sheet of paper and taped it to the toilet door – a reminder of how much campus life, if&nbsp;not US life at large, has changed in the last 10 years.</p> <p>When Eugenides was on tour for his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview15" title="">novel <em>Middlesex</em></a>, which won the Pulitzer prize in 2003 and remains the most beloved by his readers, he often had to&nbsp;explain what “intersex” meant. The book, which double-helixes ancient myth with cutting-edge science, is the story of Calliope, who’s raised as a girl and becomes a man, Cal. In interviews, Eugenides used the phrase “hermaphroditic imagination”, by which he meant a writer’s ability to inhabit both male and female perspectives.</p> <p>That hermaphroditic imagination is&nbsp;at play in the final, title story of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/05/fresh-complaint-jeffrey-eugenides-review" title=""><em>Fresh&nbsp;Complaint</em>,</a> in which a middle-aged, white British professor and a teenage Indian-American girl are granted equal, compassionate weight. We live&nbsp;in a time of acute anxiety about&nbsp;who&nbsp;has a right to tell whose stories. <em>Fresh Complaint</em> is a sensitive, subtle and painful take on the sexual power dynamics between student and&nbsp;professor.</p> <p>None of that, however, would necessarily stop an aggrieved Twitter user excoriating a white, middle-aged American man for writing in the voice of a teenage girl of colour. “I became a&nbsp;fiction writer for maximum freedom of imagination,” Eugenides says, with calm conviction. “I think most writers feel that way. We don’t want to be limited. You know, internally, what you can and can’t do, for the most part. So when you’re searching around for different characters, sometimes you know, ‘I just can’t go there’ – you can feel it in your head, imagination stymied – and so you don’t do it. That’s the only thing that I respect. I don’t respect someone outside telling me what I’m able to do and what I’m not. Every writer I know, of every race and persuasion, has always told me the same thing. So the only question is, can you do it and will it ring true?”</p>    <p>The stories in <em>Fresh Complaint</em> ring truest in their depictions of human failure. In “Great Experiment”, an intelligent and hitherto scrupulous poet is perturbed by the sudden wealth around him. Eugenides, who was living in Chicago when he wrote it, remembers wondering: “How are all these guys making all this money, why is everyone getting all this money, I’m not getting all this money!” He laughs. “And so, I&nbsp;started writing this story and made it about a poet who feels this is happening to him and he’s driven to a – it’s kind of a <em>Breaking Bad</em> before <em>Breaking Bad</em>.”</p> <p>Like his fictional poet, Eugenides started reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/apr/03/classics.history" title="">Alexis de Tocqueville’s prophetic <em>Democracy in America</em></a>, the classic early 19th-century study of the nation’s new government. “I knew something strange was going on in the country and I wanted to counterpose that to what the country had wanted to&nbsp;be and in a certain case was in its beginnings,” he says. “Now it seems to me that story is even more relevant because we’re in an even worse state and further from any sort of ideal.” As his character observes: “Victory was what counted, power, muscularity, doublespeak if necessary. You saw it in the way people drove, in the way they cut you off, gave you the finger, cursed. Women and men alike, showing rage and toughness.”</p> <p>The incumbent president may seem like a grotesque incarnation of this bullying aggression. The question now impelling and stymieing US fiction is how to respond to a world that, in its absurdity and horror, seems to have superseded reality. Eugenides points out that this feeling is not exclusive to the Trump era. He cites the 1961 essay <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/30/fiction-compete-donald-trump-presidency-fake-news-alternative-facts" title="">Writing American Fiction</a> in which a&nbsp;youngish <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/philiproth" title="">Philip Roth</a> sees Richard Nixon on TV as “a satiric literary creation” and admits to feeling a “professional envy”. “So he felt that back in the tame 60s!” says Eugenides. “It’s even more the case now.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/jeffrey-eugenides-adam-thurlwell-conversation">In conversation: Adam Thirlwell meets Jeffrey Eugenides</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nonetheless, he does not, unlike Roth, feel, “in competition with events”. In fact, “sometimes I think that I don’t even want to stay abreast of what’s happening because if you take in the same nutrition as everyone else you’ll produce the same …” he hesitates, delicately, “… milk.” He laughs. “I’m going for ‘milk’.” He continues: “It’s not my main worry: trying to compete with the outrageousness of Trump with something outrageous of my own. Right now, I think we’re in need of a certain amount of calm and tranquillity, and that’s what I try to provide with writing. I’m more and more interested in clarity and thoughtfulness in fiction, rather than in spectacle or gimmickry. Just a voice that’s companionable and speaking to you on some reassuring level.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/07/jeffrey-eugenides-adam-thurlwell-conversation" title="">Eugenides</a>, who was born in Detroit in 1960, grew up, “around rusted, rotting factories and that’s all there was”. He’s been pondering how his traditionally Democrat home state of Michigan fell to Trump in January. “If you grow up in the midwest and you see all of your cities falling apart, the industries moving off and you don’t think you’re getting ahead you might veer wildly in your votes.”</p> <p>He talks about the difficulty of maintaining an openness to other people’s experiences. “How do you react, in a country that’s so divided, politically? Do you demonise the other? Do you try and empathise and understand the other people? It calls for a level of empathy that is hard to maintain. Human beings don’t want to do it so much outside of their tribe. In order to move forward as a diverse society you have to be able to think of everybody as part of your tribe, and that’s just hard for human beings to do.” What about the events in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/25/charlottesvilles-after-neo-nazis" title="">Charlottesville</a> this summer, though? Does he think empathy should be extended to white supremacists? “I&nbsp;think you have to be ready to oppose actions and belief systems, but maybe not oppose the people who have those belief systems, and maybe have the belief that there is some possibility of redemption, at least in enough of those people that then the country begins to pull together again.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>'I’m going to be cheerful from now on,' I said. And she [Joyce Carol Oates] replied: ‘Usually you’re so sombre'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s an ethically sound answer, the sort that Mitchell Grammaticus in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/12/marriage-plot-jeffrey-eugenides-review" title=""><em>The Marriage Plot</em>, Eugenides</a>’ third novel, might give. Mitchell travels to India to volunteer with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/03/pope-denounces-sin-of-indifference-before-mother-teresa-canonisation" title="">Mother Teresa</a> as part of a rigorous spiritual reckoning. Faced with having to deal with a sick man’s bedpan, and knowing he will “regret this moment for a long time, maybe for&nbsp;the rest of his life”, he&nbsp;runs, “up the&nbsp;steps to the bright, fallen world above”. As a young man,&nbsp;Eugenides also volunteered in Mother Teresa’s centre in Kolkata. Like Mitchell, he felt&nbsp;he failed. The words “bright fallen world above” seem to contain a perverse sort of redemption for Mitchell, a&nbsp;reconciliation to living in a fallible world, partially absolved by&nbsp;brightness.</p> <p>“Yeah I guess it’s that, but it’s also, gaudy things are ‘bright’,” he says, adding, “I’m not built for the sun.” And yet he’s just made a commitment to, well, sunniness. This announcement comes proudly. Fellow Princeton faculty member <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/09/joyce-carol-oates-interview-people-think-i-write-quickly-but-i-actually-dont" title="">Joyce Carol Oates</a> recently noted how cheerful he seemed. “And I&nbsp;said, ‘Yeah, I’ve decided I’m going to&nbsp;be cheerful from now on. I just decided.’ And she said: ‘Usually you’re so sombre.’ So I’ve had three days now&nbsp;of this vow of cheerfulness. I can imagine some kind of ‘moody’, maybe. But uniformly sombre? That seemed a&nbsp;bit strong. Maybe I’ve been in her novels as a sombre person and didn’t recognise myself!”</p> <p>For all the brio of his inventiveness and the originality of his ambition, there is a sombre current in his novels – not moodiness, but moral seriousness. In <em>The Marriage Plot</em>, Mitchell reads <em>The Interior Castle</em> by Saint Teresa of Ávila, a mystic 16th-century text in which the soul is compared to a crystal palace. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/oct/06/fiction.impacprize" title="">Speaking about <em>Middlesex</em></a> in 2007, Eugenides said: “I&nbsp;saw the entire structure of the book in crystalline form inside my head. The elegance of this structure bewitched me. When I&nbsp;felt like giving up – and I&nbsp;did almost give up, many times – the thought of that crystal palace in the distance kept me plodding.”</p> <p>Does a novel, then, have the same profundity for him as a human soul? “I&nbsp;think there are correspondences. Saint Teresa talks about this palace made of crystal, but most of the time you’re outside the palace and you’re a&nbsp;slimy creature crawling through weeds trying to get into the palace and cleanse yourself and little by little trying to get to the centre of its&nbsp;radiance.”</p> <p>He pauses. “That’s what it feels like writing a novel. One would hope you’re&nbsp;purifying your soul as you’re purifying your work. That sounds a&nbsp;bit&nbsp;exalted. I&nbsp;don’t think writers are exemplars of behaviour, but I don’t know any other way to analyse my life,&nbsp;to see myself more clearly, make changes about my behaviour …” He brightens: “… become cheerful because I decide to – other than writing.”</p> <p>•&nbsp;<em>Fresh Complaint</em> by Jeffrey Eugenides is published by Fourth Estate.
