<p>Kylian Mbappé has admitted the football world would have “disgusted” him long ago if he did not have a ­passion for playing the game. The France and Real Madrid forward also said he would never encourage a child of his to follow in his footsteps.</p> <p>In a long and occasionally bitter interview, Mbappé told L’Équipe: “I’m fatalist about the world of football, but not about life. Life is won­derful. Football is what it is.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/09/world-cup-qualifying-armenia-republic-of-ireland-norway-haaland-portugal-ronaldo">World Cup qualifying: Armenia stun Republic of Ireland while Norway hit 11</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I like to say that people who go to the stadium are lucky to <em>only</em><strong> </strong>come and see a show and not know what’s going on behind the scenes. ­Honestly, if I didn’t have this passion, the ­football world would have disgusted me a long time ago.</p> <p>“That’s the world we live in, and we can’t change it. I will never advise a child of mine to step into the&nbsp;­football&nbsp;world.”</p> <p>The interview to mark a revamp of L’Équipe magazine appeared hours after Mbappé scored his 52nd goal in 92 appearances for France, in a 2-1 win against Iceland, and beating Thierry Henry’s scoring record.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/jul/16/kylian-mbappe-real-madrid-football-transfer">Mbappé left Paris Saint‑Germain</a> last year after a conflict that is still not resolved and is the subject of legal action. Mbappé has withdrawn his complaint of harassment against the club, but is claiming €55m in alleged unpaid salary and a bonus. PSG claim Mbappé agreed to waive the €55m when he moved to Real Madrid and have made a counter‑claim of €98m.</p> <p>“The more money you have, the more problems you have,” the 26-year-old forward told L’Équipe.</p> <p>“Some people don’t see that your life has changed; they want to hold on to the image of you as a child, when you were with them. But you’re not the same person any more. You have responsibilities, commitments, a job, people to answer to …”</p> <p>Of his dispute with PSG, he said he had no wish to harm the club where he made his name. “It’s my right, it’s&nbsp;employment law. I signed an employment contract. I just wanted to be paid. I have nothing against PSG,&nbsp;I love the club, I have friends there, but this is the only way to get what I’m owed, something I’ve earned through the sweat of my brow.”</p> <p>In the special edition headlined “Kylian Confidential”, Mbappé talks of his childhood and career and is seen in family photographs. “I often say that people don’t know me,” he said. “A lot of what is said about me is far from the truth. Some people spend their entire careers waiting for recognition or for people to really know who they are. You have to learn to live with that.</p> <p>“You waste a lot of energy if you spend your time fighting it, and you’ll never win. When you look at the great French athletes, they’ve all been torn apart by public opinion at some point. I think it’s a necessary part of the ­process, and I’m fine with that.”</p> <p>Asked if he felt fans expected too much of him, Mbappé said: “I’ve never wanted to accept failure, so I don’t mind being criticised for it. I’m very hard on myself, more so than most people, so I’m very comfortable with that.”</p>
