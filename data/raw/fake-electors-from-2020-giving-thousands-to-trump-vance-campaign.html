<p>The people who served as fake electors in an effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election have continued to donate to Donald Trump, JD Vance and other Republicans since then, campaign finance records show, underscoring the role they continue to play in US politics.</p> <p>Some fake electors face criminal charges for their actions. Some continue to hold key government roles.</p> <p>Meshawn Maddock, a former co-chair of the Michigan Republican party, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?committee_id=C00770941&amp;committee_id=C00828541&amp;committee_id=C00867937&amp;committee_id=C00873893&amp;contributor_name=meshawn+maddock&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2024&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2022&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&amp;max_date=08%2F14%2F2024">has given more than $1,800</a> to Trump and allied fundraising groups this campaign cycle, according to federal campaign finance records. Maddock is one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/18/michigan-false-electors-charged">16 fake electors in Michigan</a> who were criminally charged by Dana Nessel, the Democratic Michigan attorney general, last summer and <a href="https://www.mlive.com/politics/2023/07/former-michigan-gop-co-chair-pleads-not-guilty-in-trump-electors-case.html">has pleaded not guilty</a>. Tyler Bowyer, who has also pleaded not guilty for his role as a fake elector in Arizona, <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?committee_id=C00770941&amp;committee_id=C00828541&amp;committee_id=C00867937&amp;committee_id=C00873893&amp;contributor_name=Tyler+Bowyer&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2022&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2024&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&amp;max_date=08%2F14%2F2024">donated</a> $645 this year to Trump.</p> <p>“It is incredibly rare for politicians to accept campaign contributions from people under indictment,” said Michael Beckel, the research director at Issue One, an election watchdog group. “It’s generally not good optics for politicians to accept money from people accused of serious wrongdoing. Political candidates generally don’t want to be tied to convicted or accused felons. Yet in certain circles, association with the people who served as fake electors for Donald Trump in 2020 may be a badge of honor.”</p> <p>“Former President Trump likely has fewer qualms about accepting campaign cash from people under indictment for serving as fake electors in 2020 than the typical politician,” he added.<strong> </strong></p> <p>David Hanna, a fake elector from Georgia who was not criminally charged, has given at least $25,000 to Trump this year.</p> <p>In 2021 and 2023, Hanna also donated more than $6,000 combined to JD Vance’s senate campaign. Daryl Moody, another fake elector in Georgia who was not charged, donated $2,900 in 2022 to Vance. Vance, Trump’s running mate, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/jd-vance-stands-certifying-2020-election-voter-fraud-rcna161984">has been</a> supportive of Trump’s efforts to overturn the election and has said that if he had been vice-president in 2020, he would have used his power overseeing the joint session of Congress to recognize fake slates of electors.</p> <p>“It doesn’t take a lot of work to figure out that Donald Trump and JD Vance are keeping extremist election-deniers in the fold as reliable henchmen and women to challenge the results of the fall election,” said Brandon Weathersby, a spokesperson for American Bridge 21st Century, a Super Pac that supports Democrats and initially flagged the donations to the Guardian.</p> <p>“They’ve taken thousands of dollars in donations from fake electors and welcomed them with open arms to the Republican national convention last month. Trump and Vance are actively selling out our democracy in exchange for the power to enact their Project 2025 agenda the day they step into the White House.”</p> <p>The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Several Republicans running for the US House have also received donations from fake electors. Eli Crane, a Republican representative from Arizona, in 2023 <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/receipts/individual-contributions/?committee_id=C00618371&amp;committee_id=C00770941&amp;committee_id=C00783142&amp;committee_id=C00783175&amp;committee_id=C00784934&amp;committee_id=C00828541&amp;committee_id=C00867937&amp;committee_id=C00873893&amp;contributor_name=jim+lamon&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2024&amp;two_year_transaction_period=2022&amp;min_date=01%2F01%2F2021&amp;max_date=08%2F14%2F2024">received $2,900</a> from Jim Lamon, a fake elector who faces criminal charges there. Yvette Herrell, a New Mexico representative, has accepted more than $3,000 from Rosie Tripp, who served as a fake elector in the state. In 2022, Herrell also received $2,900 from Deborah Maestas, a former New Mexico Republican party chair who served as a fake elector in 2020.</p> <p>The campaigns of Crane and Herrell did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>In addition to continuing to donate to candidates, fake electors continue to play key roles in the Republican party. Michael McDonald, a fake elector criminally charged in Nevada, is the chair of that state’s Republican party (a Nevada judge <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nevada-republicans-fake-electors-indictment-trump-9d06ffc619314f85e0bdb321b820a557">threw out the case</a> against the Nevada electors last month, and the attorney general is appealing). At least 18 fake electors also served as party delegates at the Republican national convention in Milwaukee last month, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/10/politics/fake-electors-get-tapped-as-gop-convention-delegates/index.html">CNN</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/18/nx-s1-5044313/election-deniers-fake-electors-rnc-delegates-arizona">NPR</a> and a <a href="https://www.news8000.com/news/politics/at-rnc-wisconsin-fake-electors-find-new-role-as-delegates/article_6ac2b7ac-02fa-52df-a46c-b70844100f85.html">local news report</a>.</p> <p>In Wisconsin, Robert Spindell, a fake elector, continues to serve as one of three Republicans on the bipartisan Wisconsin elections commission, the body that oversees voting in the state. In Georgia, Burt Jones and Shawn Still, both of whom were fake electors, respectively serve as lieutenant governor and a state senator.</p> <p>Full slates of fake electors in Nevada, Michigan and Arizona face criminal charges for their activities. A handful of fake electors were charged in Georgia, while those in Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Wisconsin have not faced charges. In Wisconsin, the fake electors reached a civil settlement agreeing that they would not serve as electors again in 2024.</p>
