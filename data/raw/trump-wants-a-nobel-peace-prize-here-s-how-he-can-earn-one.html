<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s instinctive deference to the Israeli government is at odds with his self-image as an expert <a href="https://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/180675/">dealmaker</a>. Much as it may seem laughable that the president <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/01/trump-nobel-peace-prize-obsession">wants</a> the Nobel peace prize, his quest may be the best chance we have for securing any US government regard for the rights and lives of Palestinians in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>.</p> <p>Trump currently seems to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/14/hamas-says-it-will-free-israeli-us-hostage-in-potential-breakthrough-in-ceasefire-talks">endorse</a> the strategy of the Israeli prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, of trying to pummel Hamas into accepting defeat. To <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-hostages.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">force</a> Hamas to release its remaining hostages and to disband its diminished military force, Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/why-has-israel-resumed-large-scale-airstrikes-on-gaza">resumed</a> Israel’s strategy of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/27/un-israel-food-starvation-palestinians-war-crime-genocide">starving</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/19/israeli-strikes-latest-bloody-chapter-in-war-of-extraordinary-civilian-casualties">bombing</a> Palestinian civilians. In less than a week, about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/strikes-gaza-kill-85-overnight-bringing-total-israel-broke-ceasefire-n-rcna197430">600</a> Palestinians have already been killed.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5klgv5zv0o">second phase</a> of the ceasefire was supposed to have led to the release of Hamas’s last hostages in return for the freeing of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and a permanent end to the fighting. Instead, the Israeli government has unilaterally changed the terms. It wants the hostages released and Hamas dismantled without committing to end the war. Hamas has rejected that one-sided ultimatum, evidently worried that Netanyahu would then resume attacking Palestinian civilians unimpeded.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/26/trump-signal-chat-middle-east-opinion">What the accidentally leaked war group chat reveals about the Trump administration | Moira Donegan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is not an idle fear. The point of the renewed attacks may not be simply to wrest concessions from Hamas. The vast majority of the hostages freed so far have been released after negotiations rather than by military action, and most families of the hostages, prioritizing survival of their loved ones, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/19/israel-gaza-war-hostage-families/">want</a> a negotiated solution.</p> <p>Rather, Israel’s aim may be to advance the project of expelling Palestinian civilians from Gaza, the longtime dream of the Israeli far right. Already the defense minister, Israel Katz, is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-gaza-hamas-katz-annex-idf-palestinian-witkoff-rcna197434">threatening</a> to seize and annex parts of Gaza, and Netanyahu is reportedly planning a new and larger <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/23/israel-gaza-war-plans/">ground</a> invasion. Now that Trump has endorsed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-plan-to-take-over-gaza-strip-netanyahu-visit">forced permanent deportation</a> of 2 million Palestinians from Gaza – a massive war crime and crime against humanity – Netanyahu may feel he has a green light to pursue that callous strategy.</p> <p>Tellingly, the far-right Israeli politician Itamar Ben-Gvir has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/itamar-ben-gvir-reenters-israel-politics-gaza-conflict-escalates-2025-03-18/">rejoined</a> Netanyahu’s governing coalition as <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/cabinet-reappoints-ben-gvir-as-police-minister-ignoring-attorney-generals-objections/">police minister</a> now that the temporary ceasefire, which he opposed, has ended. Head of the pro-settler, nationalist-religious Jewish Power party, Ben-Gvir has long been unabashed about his desire to “solve” the conflict in Gaza by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/far-right-israeli-lawmaker-praises-trumps-comments-resettlement-gazans-2025-02-05/">getting rid</a> of the Palestinians. And we should recognize that Gaza would most likely be just a prelude to the occupied West Bank.</p> <p>In these circumstances, a deal with Hamas seems unlikely. Why would Hamas capitulate if that would permanently separate the Palestinian people from their homeland?</p> <p>Netanyahu and Trump may <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/23/israel-gaza-war-plans/">calculate</a> that overwhelming military force, if applied with sufficient brutality, would force Hamas’s hand. That has long been the Israeli strategy. Trump has even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/trump-resumes-sending-2000-pound-bombs-to-israel-undoing-biden-pause">resumed</a> delivery of the enormous 2,000lb bombs that Joe Biden had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/08/us-weapons-shipment-pause-israel-idf-rafah-gaza-hamas-war-palestine">suspended</a> because Israel was using them to indiscriminately decimate entire Palestinian neighborhoods.</p> <p>The international criminal court prosecutor has already <a href="https://thetimes.co.uk/article/ca7cecd6-f471-4d08-b584-eb5b9f96338d?shareToken=7de8f895ceb8dd9e4dcaa2952af1e670">hinted</a> that this indiscriminate bombardment may be the next focus of his war-crime charges. Trump himself would be at risk of being charged for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/26/icc-arrest-warrants-netanyahu-israel">aiding and abetting</a> these atrocities – an eventuality that would not lead to his immediate jailing but would severely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/09/trump-icc-sanctions">limit</a> his ability to travel to the 125 governments that as members of the ICC would have an obligation to arrest him. (Trump might ask Vladimir Putin about how it felt <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/19/vladimir-putin-to-miss-south-africa-summit-amid-row-over-possible-arrest">not to be able to attend</a> the August 2023 Brics summit in South Africa for fear of arrest.)</p> <p>Hamas has so far shown no inclination to succumb to this war-crime strategy, and the surrounding Arab states have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/trump-gaza-egypt-jordan.html">rejected</a> becoming a party to another Nakba, the catastrophic forced displacement of Palestinians in 1948. The big question is whether Trump comes to recognize that a deal, not forced surrender, is the most likely way out of the current horrors in Gaza that he had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/nov/24/trump-golf-tiger-woods">vowed</a> to end.</p> <p>For now, Trump’s deference to Israel seems firm, but one should never take anything for granted with Trump. If there is any constant to his rule, it is that his self-interest overcomes concern for others.</p> <p>That’s where the Nobel prize comes in. If Trump wants to be known as the master of the deal, it won’t be by underwriting more Israeli war crimes.</p> <p>Trump alone has the capacity to force Netanyahu to adopt a different approach. Despite Israel’s <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/us-aid-israel-four-charts">dependence</a> on US military assistance, Netanyahu got away with ignoring Biden’s entreaties to curb the starvation and slaughter of Palestinian civilians because the Israeli leader knew that the Republican party had his back. But Trump has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/14/us/politics/trump-republicans-congress-power.html">become</a> the Republican party. If he pressures Israel, Netanyahu has nowhere to the right to turn.</p> <p>That is how Trump played <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/opinion/trump-gaza-cease-fire.html">a decisive role</a> in securing the temporary ceasefire that began shortly before his 20 January inauguration. He could do the same thing now to force Netanyahu toward a more productive, less inhumane path.</p> <p>What might that look like? The best option remains a two-state solution – an Israeli and Palestinian state living in peace side-by-side. The main alternatives would be rejected by Israel (recognition of the “<a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/middle-east/israel-palestine-one-state-solution">one-state reality</a>” with equal rights for all) or most everyone else (the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution">apartheid</a> of endless occupation).</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/20/donald-trump-gaza-protests-us-universities-palestine-arrest-sanctions">Trump has turbocharged the attacks on free speech at US universities. I have seen it first-hand | Sandy Tolan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/world/middleeast/saudi-israel-relations.html">said</a> that he will not normalize relations with Israel, which Trump craves, without a Palestinian state. Both the Saudis and the Emiratis have also insisted on a state as a condition for financing the rebuilding of Gaza.</p> <p>But wouldn’t a Nobel peace prize for Trump be preposterous? No more so than the one granted, however controversially, to Henry Kissinger. He had directed or approved war crimes or mass atrocities in Vietnam, Cambodia, East Timor, Bangladesh and Chile, but the Nobel committee honored him nonetheless for concluding a peace deal with Vietnam and withdrawing US forces. A Trump pivot away from Netanyahu’s endless war would be no more surprising than Kissinger’s about-face.</p> <p>Admittedly, it would be foolhardy to bet on Trump becoming an advocate for a Palestinian state, but it is worth recognizing that his personal ambitions could lead him in that direction. It speaks to the topsy-turvy world of Trump that the Palestinians’ best hope in the face of an Israeli government that respects no legal bounds is to play up what it would take for Trump to secure his coveted Nobel. We must persuade Trump to do the right thing for the wrong reason.</p> <ul> <li><p>Kenneth Roth, the former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton’s School of Public and International Affairs.
