    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:C - In the USA – where the bulk of the 104 games will be played next summer., 2:C - It was a different time altogether. Gordon Brown was the prime minister, Fabio Capello was the England manager, and Manchester United had appeared in the last two Champions League finals., 3:B - It will be their first time at the tournament since 2010., 4:B - The story was embarrassing for Cardiff City, whose stadium hosted the game. “It’s something I’ve not seen in my 36 years,” said the club’s head of operations. “We’ve had a stray dog on the pitch but this was something new, a freak of nature. We pick up litter and food like half-eaten burgers straight after games. Everything is put away. They say you are never too far from a rat, especially in cities, and this one managed to get in. People have seen a rat on the pitch as quite funny, but it does have serious undertones.”, 5:A - Depay has 54 goals (two more than Robin van Persie) and 35 assists (two more than Wesley Sneijder) for the Netherlands. , 6:B - The message from the manager said: “I am the coach of the Cape Verde national team. I would like to know if you would be interested in joining the team. We are renewing the group and we intend to be present at the 2022 World Cup, which would be historic. The team is good, and the environment is good too. I await feedback. I speak English if necessary.” , 7:C - New Zealand are the only team of the four to concede a goal on their way to qualification – in an 8-1 victory over Vanuatu. , 8:B - If they win the World Club Challenge, they will seal a quadruple. , 9:A - “It’s a huge honour and a privilege to be named Luton Town manager,” he said. “It feels like a full-circle moment for me. I was eight when I first came to Luton as a boy, so I guess you could say it’s fate that my first full-time club managerial position is at this club. I couldn’t be more delighted to be here.” , 10:C - “It is unreal what just happened,” said Vacherot. “I have no idea what is happening right now. I am not even dreaming, it is just crazy. There has to be one loser but I think there are two winners today. One family that won and I think for the sport of tennis, the story is unreal.” Arthur Rinderknech, the losing finalist, added: “Valentin, you gave everything. I am so happy for you. Two cousins are stronger than one.” , 11:B - Richardson suffered a fractured eye socket in his pre-game warm-up when an elastic stretch band snapped a pole, causing it to hit him in the face. , 12:B - Littler was beaten by Beau Greaves, who has become the first woman to reach the final of the World Youth Championship. Her nickname is Beau ‘n’ Arrow. Superb. , 13:B - The Arsenal left-back played for Jamaica in a friendly against France last year but has now declared for England. , 14:A - The event sold out some time ago. , 15:C - Williams beat Shaun Murphy 10-3 to win the Xi’an Grand Prix at the age of 50 years and 206 days – surpassing Ray Reardon’s record set in 1982., 16:B - So called because of its autumnal billing. , 17:C - It was her 48th goal for her country.</p>
