<p>When Stephanie Devine was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016, many aspects of her life changed. More than a decade later, one of the challenges she faced would transform her career and purpose.</p> <p>“I was unable to find a non-wired bra in a natural fibre and proper cup size,” she says. “The only ones available were nursing bras.”</p> <p>Fast forward five years and, while Devine’s health had improved, she hadn’t forgotten her disappointment. She began to look into bra alternatives for women going through similar experiences. What she found was an industry in dire need of a revolution.</p> <p>As Devine soon discovered, making changes in the textile industry wasn’t easy, especially in the midst of a pandemic. But support from PayPal in the form of a loan helped her achieve her dream of creating a 100% plastic-free bra.</p> <h2>Tackling an industry with a waste problem</h2> <p>“The more research you do, the more you’re aware of textile waste,” Devine says. “Bras are little things, but they’re almost all 100% plastic. They’re made from nylon and polyester.”</p>    <ul> <li><p>Stephanie Devine, CEO and founder, The Very Good Bra</p></li> </ul> <p>The textile waste figures in Australia are shocking: in 2020-21, an estimated 860,000 tonnes of textile waste was generated in Australia, including more than 300,000 <a href="https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/The-Australia-Institute-Textiles-Waste-In-Australia-Web.pdf" rel="nofollow">tonnes</a> of clothing.</p> <p>Reducing bra waste, Devine says, isn’t straightforward. Because textiles are typically made from complex mixtures of fibres, they are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200710-why-clothes-are-so-hard-to-recycle" rel="nofollow">notoriously difficult</a> to recycle, and bras are no exception.</p> <p>“I worked out that the only thing I could do is make it botanically circular,” she says, “so at the end of life it was safe to bury in the garden compost, or worm, and it wouldn’t leave a trace afterwards.”</p> <p>But there was a problem: sourcing the elements Devine needed that are typically derived from plastic. Only one elastic manufacturer in the world makes 100% natural rubber elastic. Her hook and eye pieces, for clasping the bra closed, would have to be custom-made. Devine learnt she would also need to provide specialty organic cotton thread to manufacturers herself.</p> <p>Undeterred, she went for it. In 2018, Devine launched The Very Good Bra via Kickstarter, a bra made from 100% natural fibres, including the threads and labels, with certified organic dyes, elastic made from natural tree rubber and easily removable metal clasps, designed for function and comfort.</p> <h2>Delivering a Very Good Bra during unprecedented times</h2> <p>Devine’s idea was sound and her business took off. Orders for her organic cotton, wire-free bras began to flood in from around the world.</p> <p>But in 2020, disaster struck, as it did for small enterprises globally. Covid threw Devine’s plans into disarray. “My sales just stopped for three days,” she says. “The dollar was dropping. Suppliers were saying all the freight channels were shutting down.” With rising costs and plummeting sales, Devine’s plans to change the very fabric of the textile industry looked perilous.</p> <p>“I thought, ‘I’m going to need some money’.”</p> <p>Devine explored overdraft options with her bank, but after being asked to use her house as security, she looked elsewhere. For a while she had been getting emails from PayPal about its business loan product. So, knowing that her business deserved to succeed, she applied for a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/au/workingcapital/" rel="nofollow">PayPal Working Capital</a> business loan.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Simon Banks, managing director, PayPal Australia</p></li> </ul> <p>Unlike some other loans, PayPal Working Capital uses existing business information – such as how much revenue a business is bringing in – to make a decision about funding. PayPal Australia’s managing director, Simon Banks, says the loan offers financing through a purely digital underwriting process.</p> <p>“[It uses] PayPal account and sales history, rather than an application process, which makes it very quick,” he says. “We can analyse a merchant’s prior performance and estimate future performance based on the data we hold ourselves. Funding is provided in minutes as PayPal is leveraging its own data with no external credit check and small businesses don’t have to provide personal assets, like their homes, as security.”</p> <h2>Support for entrepreneurs to reach their full potential</h2> <p>“For many small-medium businesses, they require financing urgently, so this can put a strain on their finances and resources, whether this be in the development phase or hoping to grow their business,” Banks says. “PayPal Working Capital was developed to fill this void.”</p> <p>Borrowers pay an agreed, fixed fee per month, with no late fees or penalties for early or extra repayments. PayPal lends up to 40% of a business customer’s annual sales through its platform – up to $230,000 for their first loan and $350,000 for subsequent loans.</p> <p>“As small-medium businesses remain one of our key priorities,” Banks says, “we really want to help them through this cost-of-living crisis.”</p> <p>In today’s less certain market, maintaining financial stability is a challenge for many entrepreneurs. But with a capital injection, Devine was able not only to continue to sell bras, but also to pursue a wider impact on circular textiles.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Stephanie Devine has spent three years working with academics and industry to drive the development of a new Australian Standard</p></li> </ul> <p>She has spent three years <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2023/mar/22/compostable-textiles-australia-world-first-standard-for-composting-biodegradable-fabric-material">developing</a> a new Australian standard for compostable textiles that would allow them to be commercially processed as part of food waste, and is working with German manufacturers on a 100% organic cotton lace.</p> <p>“There’s not always a lot of money left to try and do more innovative and exciting things that will grow sustainability and the customer appetite for it,” she says. “In a small business like mine that is so environmentally conscious, it broadens that idea. And the more reach we have, the more good things we sell.”</p> <p>It’s progress, she says, that has been made possible by PayPal.</p> <p>“It really is a great system,” she says. “It’s that non-traditional lending where they understand the money that comes into your business and they’re not afraid to lend against it. It made a huge difference to me.</p> <p>As for the future, Devine has plans to expand her brand around the world.</p> <p>“More people globally are searching for better and more sustainable products. I’m trying to make it more mainstream, so that more people can do the right thing and have a better outcome for the rest of us on the planet.”</p> <p><em><strong><a href="mailto:justinecostigan@gmail.com">Learn more about how PayPal is supporting small businesses</a>.</strong></em></p>
