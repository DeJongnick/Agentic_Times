<p>Why are people on the left so exercised about how we pay for social care? After all, better-off care home residents who pay their own way are each quietly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/30/funding-shortfall-uk-care-homes-close-watchdog" title="">subsidising to the tune of £12,000 a year</a> those with fewer assets who are funded by councils that negotiate lower fees. What could be more socialist?</p> <p>The truth is that this is an unofficial, unregulated and profoundly unfair tax levied not by the state but, with the state’s connivance, by private care businesses that declare it the only way to make a broken system work. It is also a tax – and a system – unknown to alarming numbers: as a <a href="https://www.demos.co.uk/project/a-good-retirement/" title="">survey</a> published today shows, one in four middle-aged people still think that care and support is free, rising to more than one in three when you include those who aren’t sure.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/30/funding-shortfall-uk-care-homes-close-watchdog">£1bn funding shortfall may force UK care homes to close, says watchdog</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The state of social care shames us all. When the minister responsible, Jackie Doyle-Price, slipped into the Commons one morning last week to administer the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42266076" title="">last rites</a> to the latest attempt at reform, she was marking 20 years of failure. It was in 1997 that the then Labour health secretary, Frank Dobson, launched <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/feb/25/interview-stewart-sutherland" title="">a royal commission</a> on the issue with a warning that things “cannot be allowed to continue for much longer”.</p> <p>Since then we have had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/oct/09/strategy-adult-social-care-crisis" title="">a dozen white and green papers</a> and plenty of warm words from all sides, but no action – at least none in England, the rest of the UK having gone <a href="https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/integrated-care-northern-ireland-scotland-and-wales" title="">separate ways</a>. And we shouldn’t expect action any time soon: another green paper setting out proposals is now promised next summer and, as Doyle-Price said, “it is right that we take the time needed to debate the many complex issues and listen to the perspectives of experts and care users”.</p> <p>But is it right? Do we not know what must be done? We could, for sure, profitably spend the next six months exploring the future of care and support for all who need it. But this will be a green paper on older people alone – a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/nov/17/government-plans-social-care-reform-opportunity-missed" title="">parallel programme of work</a>” is planned on younger adults with support needs – and we are knee-deep in consultation findings, analysis and blueprints for a way forward on funding care in old age. It is obvious that any settlement will rest on three pillars.</p> <p>First, shared responsibility between the individual and the state. Today’s survey findings for the thinktank Demos, based on the views of more than 2,000 people aged 40-69, show that 57% think the individual has the greater responsibility to finance their care and only 36% believe the state should foot the bill. Demos says opinion has been moving steadily away from state responsibility. Only one in 20 of us is making sufficient savings provision for potential care costs. However, Demos is calling for a public awareness campaign and development of insurance models that the finance sector has so far failed to make available on any scale. The report is independent but sponsored by insurer Legal &amp; General.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2017/nov/02/social-care-funding-cant-take-any-more-setbacks-it-needs-reform-now">Social care funding can't take any more setbacks. It needs reform now | Jane Ashcroft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Second, a cap on individual responsibility. It was a £72,000 cap on lifetime liability for care costs, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/17/lifetime-cap-care-costs-deferred-2020 such a mess" title="">first announced in 2013</a> and due to take effect in 2020, that Doyle-Price formally killed off last week. In reality it had been dead in the water since the June general election, when Theresa May <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/22/theresa-may-u-turn-on-dementia-tax-cap-social-care-conservative-manifesto" title="">got into such a mess</a> trying to reopen the policy. Doyle-Price said the green paper proposals would include “a limit on the care costs that indivduals face”. One <a href="https://www.independentage.org/policy-and-research/research-reports/will-cap-fit" title="">recent suggestion, </a>which would certainly improve public understanding, would be to set a cap – perhaps at £100,000 – to cover all payments, including board and lodging as well as care costs.</p> <p>Third, the settlement requires more government funding for social care. While the state will not pick up the entire tab, applying a cap will carry costs – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jul/04/andrew-dilnot-expects-shift-elderly-care-proposals not mentioned in budget" title="">estimated at £1.7bn a year</a> when first proposed in 2011 – and councils have had to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/25/budget-backlash-tories-nhs-social-care-cash %C2%A36bn cut" title="">cut £6bn from social care budgets</a> over the past seven years. After<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jun/28/social-care-cuts-to-continue-in-spite-of-1bn-boost-english-councils-say" title=""> last month’s budget</a> failed to mention it, local government’s 2018-19 finance settlement is due any day. Why not make a start?</p> <p><strong> </strong></p>
