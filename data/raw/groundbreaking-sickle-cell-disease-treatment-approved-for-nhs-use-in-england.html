<p>A “groundbreaking” £1.65m treatment offering a potential cure for people in England living with sickle cell disease has been approved for use on the NHS, the medicines watchdog has announced.</p> <p>Campaigners welcomed news of the approval of the one-time gene therapy, known as exagamglogene autotemcel, or exa-cel, which edits the faulty gene in a patient’s own stem cells. </p> <p>The NHS estimates that 50 patients, older children and adults with a severe form of the disease, who are suitable for a stem cell transplant but without a matched donor, will each year receive the cutting-edge treatment. </p> <p>Clinical trials for exa-cel have indicated that the therapy can stop painful sickle cell crises, which occur when blood vessels become blocked, with researchers finding that there was a “functional cure” in 96.6% of participants who received the treatment.</p> <p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence originally rejected the treatment last March, saying it needed further detail regarding the effectiveness of the treatment.</p> <p>The condition is more prevalent in people with an African or Caribbean family background, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/sickle-cell-disease/">according to the NHS</a>. In England, about 17,000 people are living with the disease. Of those, 4,000 are believed to be eligible for the new treatment.</p> <p>Sickle cell disease changes the shape of blood cells into crescents, hindering blood flow. Sufferers experience severe painful episodes, which can require hospital admission. Life expectancy can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7511000/">20 to 30 years shorter</a> than in the general population.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/01/nhs-error-meant-hundreds-of-parents-did-not-know-childrens-sickle-cell-status">NHS error meant hundreds of parents did not know children’s sickle cell status</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Toby Bakare, 35, from south London, who has sickle cell disease but received a stem cell transplant, said: “It’s a great day, so many people living with sickle cell disease will now have access to a treatment that gets rid of pain [that] is a blight on your life. I’m lucky I had a sister who was a match.</p>    <p>“Not everyone with sickle has that option so gene editing for those people is a huge step forward. It’s been a long road, but having a transplant has transformed my quality of life for the better.”</p> <p>Mehmet Tunc Onur Sanli, 42, from London, who was diagnosed with sickle cell disease at 11, said: “Not having to go to hospital for regular transfusions or taking medicine any more would be a dream to me – gene therapy could offer that – but there’s still a lot to consider in terms of the side-effects that could come with this treatment and whether it would be the right choice for me.”</p> <p>Prof Bola Owolabi, the director of the National Healthcare Inequalities Improvement Programme at NHS England, said:<strong> </strong>“This represents a monumental step forward in the treatment of people with sickle cell disorder, which is a condition that mostly affects people of Black African and Black Caribbean heritage. This groundbreaking therapy, available on the NHS, represents a very real prospect of a cure for this devastating disorder.</p> <p>“The NHS remains committed to rolling out new, innovative treatments to narrow the gap in healthcare inequalities, and this cutting-edge therapy could give patients facing severe sickle cell disorder the hope of a much brighter future.”</p> <p>John James OBE, the chief executive of the Sickle Cell Society, said: “We are absolutely thrilled to see this groundbreaking gene therapy treatment available on the NHS from today. The significance of this milestone for the sickle cell community cannot be understated – today’s result will give hope to many and is the result of determined campaigning.</p> <p>“We remain dedicated to our commitment to advocating for improved treatment options and better outcomes for all those affected by this condition. For now, we take a moment to celebrate this historic milestone – a turning point in the fight against sickle cell that promises to change lives for the better.”</p> <p>Yasmin Sheikh, the head of policy and public affairs at Anthony Nolan, said: “This groundbreaking decision to fund the UK’s first ever <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/31/gene-therapy-hailed-as-medical-magic-wand-for-hereditary-swelling-disorder">Crispr-based therapy</a> for patients with sickle cell disorder represents a leap forward in the treatment of this debilitating and life-threatening condition.”</p>
