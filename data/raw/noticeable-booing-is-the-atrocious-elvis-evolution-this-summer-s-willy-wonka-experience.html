<p><strong>Name:</strong> Elvis Evolution.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> New this week.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Up to 12 shows a day at Excel London, until December.</p> <p><strong>What is it? </strong>A “first of its kind” production, <a href="https://elvisevolution.com/">according to its creators</a>, “celebrating the life and work of Elvis Presley.”</p> <p><strong>Celebrating it how? </strong>With a “walk-through experience” combining “cutting-edge digital technology, live actors and musicians, mind-blowing multimedia and heart-pounding music”.</p> <p><strong>So is it holograms of Elvis and that? </strong>Not exactly, no.</p> <p><strong>Can you be more specific? </strong>You really have to see it to describe it, and that will set you back at least £75.</p> <p><strong>At least? </strong>VIP tickets are more like £300.</p> <p><strong>And what have the people who have seen it said? </strong>Different things.</p> <p><strong>Like what? </strong>“Absolutely atrocious,” was the assessment of one attender.</p> <p><strong>Not quite two thumbs up, then. </strong>“It was a shambles from start to finish, there was no Elvis; it was just a video of him that you could watch on YouTube,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20prvvgypyo">a VIP ticket holder told the BBC</a>.</p> <p><strong>Oh dear. </strong>Then again, some fans seem to have really enjoyed it, with one saying she “<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/music/article/elvis-ai-tribute-live-show-m263p2msb">loved every minute</a>”.</p> <p><strong>What about the </strong><strong>reviews? </strong>Decidedly mixed. The Telegraph gave it one star and described it as “a limp assembly of video, actors, a live band and indifferently recreated sets”. Time Out was much <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/elvis-evolution-review">more positive, giving it three stars</a>, but also alluding to “a noticeable amount of booing”.</p> <p><strong>How do you explain the discrepancy? </strong>It appears to be a matter of expectations. When the show was announced last year, the creators, Layered Reality, suggested it would use AI and holographic projection to create a lifesize digital Elvis, leading to obvious comparisons with the hugely successful virtual reality extravaganza <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/26/abba-voyage-review-jaw-dropping-avatar-act-thats-destined-to-be-copied">Abba Voyage</a>.</p> <p><strong>But it’s nothing of the kind? </strong>“We ultimately took the creative decision not to mimic Elvis’s performances,” said a company spokesperson. “Instead, we use AI to upscale archive footage.”</p> <p><strong>What does that mean? </strong>Reviews suggest they have dressed up some footage from Elvis’s 1968 comeback TV special and built a show around it (which includes visits to three separate themed bars selling expensive drinks).</p> <p><strong>Sounds more like an escape room. </strong>Some visitors have drawn comparisons to that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/feb/27/glasgow-willy-wonka-experience-slammed-as-farce-as-tickets-refunded">Willy Wonka experience fiasco in Glasgow last year</a>. </p> <p><strong>Is it really that bad? </strong>They certainly have a problem on their hands. On Sunday, the show had to be stopped after <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/35966318/pensioner-dragged-by-security-elvis-show/">an audience member who allegedly kept shouting “This is bollocks!”</a> was dragged from the venue by security.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “We’re caught in a trap – we can’t walk out.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Elvis has left the building.”</p>
