<h1>Children to be banned from having YouTube accounts as Albanese government backflips on exemption</h1>

<p>Children will be banned from having YouTube accounts from December, with the federal government backflipping on an earlier decision to exempt the video platform from the national under-16s social media restrictions.</p> 
<p>The decision, to be confirmed by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, and the communications minister, Anika Wells, on Wednesday, is likely to set off a furious reaction from the Google-owned YouTube, which will hold a major event for politicians in Parliament House on Wednesday night.</p> 
<p>YouTube argued it operated differently to other platforms and had been given an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/21/labor-social-media-ban-under-16s-details-what-is-covered-which-platform">exemption to the world-leading under-16s social media ban</a> by the former communications minister Michelle Rowland. But newly installed minister Wells has taken <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/">advice from the eSafety commissioner</a> that the video platform should be included in the rules as it poses a threat to young people.</p> 
<p>The more tightly curated YouTube Kids app will still be spared from the ban, which is due to take effect on 10 December.</p>

<p>“The Albanese government is giving kids a reprieve from the persuasive and pervasive pull of social media while giving parents peace of mind,” Wells said in announcing the move.</p> 
<p>“There’s a place for social media, but there’s not a place for predatory algorithms targeting children.”</p> 
<p>YouTube will be included as one of the age-restricted social media platforms, alongside Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and others. Last month, the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, citing a survey of 2,600 children, said nearly four in 10 children had reported exposure to harmful content on YouTube – “the most frequently cited platform in our research”.</p> 
<p>Inman Grant noted that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/25/should-youtube-be-included-in-australias-under-16s-social-media-ban-heres-what-you-need-to-know">children would still be able to view YouTube videos</a> when logged out as the legislation was limited to preventing children from having accounts.<strong> </strong></p> 
<p>The under-16s ban comes into force in December, with platforms to face fines of up to $49.5m if they fail to take “reasonable steps” to stop children from opening accounts.</p> 
<p>Some major tech platforms have privately raised concerns about a lack of information about what they must to do to meet the “reasonable steps” test, including what new barriers or verification methods they must add to their services. The government is expected to share more information and guidance about such steps in coming months.</p>

<p>“Social media has a social responsibility and there is no doubt that Australian kids are being negatively impacted by online platforms so I’m calling time on it,” Albanese said.</p> 
<p>“Social media is doing social harm to our children, and I want Australian parents to know that we have their backs.”</p> 
<p>The government on Wednesday will table a set of rules in parliament about which online services will not be captured under the social media ban, making clear that gaming platforms, messaging apps and health services will not be included.</p> 
<p>YouTube had previously been given a carveout from the social media ban, with former minister Rowland telling parliament that the video platform would be lumped alongside the likes of ReachOut’s PeerChat, Kids Helpline’s MyCircle and Google Classroom, apps “that can be shown to function like social media in their interactivity but operate with a significant purpose to enable young people to get the education and health support they need”.</p> 
<p>Meta, TikTok and Snapchat had strongly criticised the YouTube carveout, arguing it functioned similarly to their services and should not be treated differently, calling for a “level playing field”. TikTok called YouTube’s exemption a “sweetheart deal”, saying it was “irrational and indefensible”.</p> 
<p>YouTube last week wrote to the government, vowing to consider legal action if it was included in the ban.</p> 
<p>“YouTube is a video sharing platform, not a social media service, that offers benefit and value to younger Australians,” a spokesperson said on Sunday.</p> 
<p>Albanese said on Sunday the government would make its decision “independent of any of these threats that are made by the social media companies”.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday night Google will hold its annual “Google at Parliament House” event, a popular function spruiking Google products. Previous instalments have featured the Wiggles as entertainment, while invitations seen by Guardian Australia advertise local act the Rubens for this week’s lineup.</p> 
<p>Invitations spruik that guests can “hear from partners, businesses and meet some of Australia’s most beloved YouTube Creators, including the Mik Maks and Never Too Small”. Large numbers of politicians and political staffers attend the event each year.</p> 
<p>Wells said the government remained committed to the legislation.</p> 
<p>“We want kids to know who they are before platforms assume who they are,” she said.</p> 
<p>“There is no one perfect solution when it comes to keeping young Australians safer online – but the social media minimum age will make a significantly positive difference to their wellbeing.”</p>
