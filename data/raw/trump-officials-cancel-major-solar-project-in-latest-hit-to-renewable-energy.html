<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has killed a huge proposed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/04/trump-clean-energy-cuts-democrat-states">solar power project</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nevada">Nevada</a> that would have been one of the largest in the world, indicating that the White House plans to attack not only <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/windpower">wind power</a> but all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/renewableenergy">renewable energy</a>.</p> 
<p>On Thursday, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) changed the status of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/23/us-solar-energy-transition-land">Esmeralda 7</a> project to say its environmental review has been “<a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2020804/510">cancelled</a>”, the climate publication Heatmap <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/esmeralda-7-canceled-nevada-solar?utm_campaign=heatmap_am&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--CpT8Gwxiq5a7QEtKdFelple7fVwNWk8nj4O4AHIve0D_2mXXz87nFNdjpYLS9YvluiQaEb1GCApvdg6oeacqKDz0b99SLjOSigga7ilUOzg_Xzvs&amp;_hsmi=384580979&amp;utm_content=384580979&amp;utm_source=hs_email">first reported</a>.</p> 
<p>The super project in southern Nevada was set to cover 185 sq miles – a footprint close to the size of Las Vegas – and include seven solar projects proposed by different companies, including NextEra Energy Resources, Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power and Invenergy. Together, the network of solar panels and batteries was set to produce 6.2 gigawatts of energy, enough to power nearly 2m homes.</p> 
<p>Asked to comment, the interior department appeared to leave open the possibility that at least parts of the project could be resubmitted for review. In an email, a spokesperson said: “During routine discussions prior to the lapse in appropriations, the proponents and BLM agreed to change their approach for the Esmeralda 7 Solar Project in Nevada. Instead of pursuing a programmatic level environmental analysis, the applicants will now have the option to submit individual project proposals to the BLM to more effectively analyze potential impacts.”</p>

<p>The developers’ joint proposals were <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/biden-harris-administration-advances-clean-energy-projects-western-public-lands">permitted</a> by Joe Biden. Even once <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> re-entered the White House this year, the process appeared to be <a href="https://heatmap.news/sparks/esmeralda-7-solar-project-blm-trump">moving forward</a> when his BLM advanced a draft environmental impact statement. But the process has since come to a standstill, with the BLM failing to issue a final environmental impact statement or record of decision for the project.</p> 
<p>Reached for comment, a spokesperson for NextEra Energy Resources said: “We are in the early stage of development and remain committed to pursuing our project’s comprehensive environmental analysis by working closely with the Bureau of Land Management.”</p> 
<p>The Guardian has also contacted Leeward Renewable Energy, Arevia Power and Invenergy for comment.</p>

<p>In an executive order on day one, Trump directed a pause on new renewable energy authorizations for federally owned land and water. Then in February he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-land-management-kathleen-sgamma">appointed</a> Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Colorado-based oil industry trade group Western Energy Alliance, to head the BLM, which manages a quarter of a billion acres of public land concentrated in western states.</p> 
<p>In July, as part of an attempt to win support for his tax and spending bill, Trump issued another <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/ending-market-distorting-subsidies-for-unreliable-foreign%E2%80%91controlled-energy-sources/">order</a> aimed at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/24/trump-wind-power-threats-homes">halting renewable projects</a>, which called on the Department of the Interior to review its policies that affect wind and solar, and gave the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, final decision-making power on whether such projects could proceed.</p> 
<p>The following month, the president said his administration would not approve solar or wind power projects. “We will not approve wind or farmer destroying Solar,” he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115061417084982814">posted on Truth Social</a>. “The days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!”</p>
