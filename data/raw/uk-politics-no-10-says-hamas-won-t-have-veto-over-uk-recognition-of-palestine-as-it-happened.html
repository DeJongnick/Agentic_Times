Whereas with most of his answers Farage was keen to lean into rightwing opinion (and then some), on this, perhaps mindful of the need not to embarrass his new recruit, Farage backed her up.</p> <p>He said one problem with government is that ministers often have no experience of the issues for which they are responsible. He went on: “I personally have never worked in a prison, so I can’t answer it.” But he said Frake had worked in prisons at the highest level, and that she thought it was all about risk assessment.</p> <p><strong>Frake</strong>, who was at the press conference, agreed. She said everyone in prison “deserves to be treated with humanity and decency, and that includes female prisoners and it includes trans prisoners”. Prisons were used to dealing with issues like this by carrying out risk assessments, she said.</p> <p>In response <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>, who unlike Farage does have a close interest in this issue, posted <a href="https://x.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1952347463534203172">a clip of the Farage answer on social media</a> with a message saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>A reminder that <a href="https://twitter.com/Conservatives?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Conservatives</a> are the ONLY party standing up for women-only spaces.<br><br>After the Supreme Court judgment, we shouldn’t be hearing anymore about men being put in women’s prisons.

You have much to be proud of in all of the work you have undertaken but I am especially heartened by the effect of your leadership on advancing support for the Gaelic language.</p> <p>We all wrestle with the inevitable conflicts between family and public life and I sympathise with the dilemmas you have faced. I wish you, Ali and your family well and much happiness in the years ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p>In her own tribute, <strong>Jackie Baillie</strong>, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, thanks Forbes for her service as an MSP. She went on:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Of course, as much as being an MSP is a privilege, it is also a demanding job which can make for a difficult balance between our working and personal lives. In that spirit, I wish Kate all the very best in her future endeavours and hope that she can enjoy spending time with her family.</p> <p>But it cannot have escaped the notice of voters that many of the SNP’s former rising stars are abandoning the stage, often to be replaced by defeated names of yesteryears and anonymous party apparatchiks. </p> <p>Kate Forbes was the future once - but now, like many of her counterparts in the SNP, she can see the writing on the wall. The truth is this is a tired government with no vision and no ideas.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Alex Cole-Hamilton</strong>, the Scottish Lib Dem leader, said his party would be fighting hard to win Forbes’s constituency, Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Kate and I were both elected to the Scottish parliament in 2016 and there have been several occasions when we’ve worked well together on shared interests since. I wish her family well for everything that comes next.</p> <p>This is a top target seat for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, having won the equivalent seat at Westminster last year.

A very able minister, she has the conspicuous advantage of having a powerful coterie of allies in cabinet – mostly women ministers close to Nicola Sturgeon. </p> <p>Swinney was openly dismissive of Flynn’s potential challenge when he was asked about it after he unveiled the SNP’s slate of Holyrood candidates some months ago – an event where McAllan was prominent and Flynn absent.</p> <p>However, Flynn, an Aberdeen MP closely allied to Alex Salmond’s former aides, who trades in what he sees as a robustly realist defence of North Sea oil and gas jobs, has a power base too in the wider party.</p> <p>If he becomes prominent in a post-election SNP government, Swinney will face pressure to give him a ministerial role, and that will then put serious strains on any putative partnership with the pro-independence Scottish Greens at Holyrood.</p> <p>Like their sister party in England and Wales, the Scottish Greens are embroiled in a live leadership contest. Depending on the result in May, Swinney’s fortunes could well hinge on Green cooperation, and they, for now, are his best bet to hold onto power.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68909d858f08bce4d11a4a6f" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-04T11:51:02.178Z">12.51pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Q: Are you worried that some of the comments made by George Finch earlier might prejudice a future trial, putting a conviction at risk?</em></p> <p>(This is a reference to comments that I did not report here, when covering Finch at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/aug/04/uk-politics-labour-conservative-reform-nigel-farage-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68908b908f0839e8ae1351e6#block-68908b908f0839e8ae1351e6">11.36am</a>, because some of what said did seem to pose a contempt of court risk.)</p> <p><strong>Farage</strong> said he was not concerned about this.

During August, when parliament is not sitting and the tap of domestic news is running dry, opposition parties often like to run campaigns. Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, is following this model with gusto and today, for the third week in a row, he is holding a press conference on the subject of crime. Reform’s success in the polls is almost entirely down to the fact it advocates hardline policies to cut immigration and small boat crossings and Farage is trying explicitly to link this issue to crime, arguing that asylum seekers are disproportionately likely to be criminal.</p> <p>The Conservative party don’t have a single theme for their summer campaigning. (Yesterday Kemi Badenoch was campaigning <a href="https://x.com/Telegraph/status/1951771010220593563">about the uselessness of the Liz Truss mini-budget</a>, a topic where the nation largely agrees.) But in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/03/uk-ministers-to-spend-extra-100m-stopping-small-boat-crossings">an overnight announcement </a>from the government about new measures to crack down on small boat crossings, they have also been depicting these migrants (whose numbers, of course, increased dramatically while they were in office) as a threat to public safety. In a statement released overnight <strong>Chris Philp</strong>, the shadow home secretary, said: “This weak Labour government has lost control of our borders, and we now see rapes and sexual assaults by illegal immigrants reported on a near daily basis.” And, in an interview on the Today programme this morning, <strong>Robert Jenrick</strong>, the shadow justice secretary, doubled down on this claim. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I am afraid there is increasing evidence of a serious link between illegal migration, migration generally, and crime, particularly sexual crime against women and girls.</p> <p>In London, 40% last year of all of the sexual crimes were committed by foreign nationals, despite the fact that they only make up 25% of the population.</p> <p>And some of the data that – we’re seeing we don’t have good data at the moment – some of the data we’re seeing is very striking. Afghans and Eritrean nationals are 20 times more likely to be convicted of a sexual crime than a British national.</p> <p>These are very shocking statistics.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Farage</strong> recently told the New Statesman, for <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/cover-story/2025/07/where-is-robert-jenrick-going">an interesting, lengthy profile</a> written by Harry Lambert, that he thought Jenrick would “almost certainly” end up to the right of him on migration by the next election. “I suspect he will probably go further – that’s just my instinct for someone who wants to make noise,” Farage said.</p> <p><strong>Angela Eagle</strong>, the minister for border security and asylum, has been giving interviews this morning, and on the Today programme she suggested that there was not firm data to back up the claims that Jenrick was making. She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>[Jenrick] did actually say that we don’t have good data at the moment, and yet he’s asserting with great certainty data points, and I don’t know where he’s got them from. So it’s difficult for me to criticise from a data point of view. But he’s admitted in that interview that we don’t have good data.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if she thought that the Tories were “playing with fire” by linking asylum seekers with sexual crime, Eagle replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think that we need to deal with all crimes, all sexual crimes, regardless of who has perpetrated them in the same way. And we need to crack down on violence against women and girls, which is why we’ve actually got Jess Phillips, a minister, whose entire job is about doing that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if she was open to discussing possible links between immigration and crime, Eagle replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I don’t mind having debates about anything, but I think we haven’t got good data on this, and I think that we’ve got to look at the principle. And that is that we’ve got to deal with all sexual criminality, whoever perpetrates it, in an almost colour blind way.</p> <p>If a girl has been abused by somebody or has been subjected to a vile sexual crime, it doesn’t really matter what the colour of the skin of the perpetrator is.</p> </blockquote> <p>As Eagle said, it is hard to assess the truth about the link between immigration and crime because the data is complicated, and in some respects limited. But one person who has tried is the researcher and scientist <strong>Emma Monk</strong>. On<a href="https://monkdebunks.substack.com/p/are-small-boat-migrants-really-24x"> her Substack blog </a>she recently published an analysis of the claim that some people arriving in the UK on small boats are 20 times more likely than Britons to be criminal. This is a claim that Jenrick referenced, describing it as “shocking”. Monk argues that it is shockingly inaccurate – or “ludicrous on multiple fronts”, to use her words. Her whole post is worth reading, but here is her conclusion.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>As you can see, the claim that migrants arriving on small boats are 24x more likely to end up in prison was an easy manipulation of available statistics. It wasn’t entirely fabricated - they can point to ‘official statistics’ to claim credibility - but it’s clearly misinformation all the same.</p> <p>A Tory MP briefed it to a right-wing newspaper, which published it unquestioningly. That was picked up by the rest of the right-wing media ecosystem, and now the 24x figure is firmly in the minds of those who want to believe it, and is being repeated all over the internet, and across dinner tables and garden fences.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are only two items in the diary for today.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, holds a press conference.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p>(For readers who keep asking why we feature the Reform UK press conferences, but not the Lib Dem ones, or the Green party ones, the answer is simple; they are not holding any.)</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media.
