<p>Australian renters now need an annual income of $130,000 to comfortably rent an average unit, with even six-figure earners facing housing costs exceeding 30% of their income in capital cities and many regional areas, a new report has found.</p> <p>The 2025 Priced Out report by national housing campaign Everybody’s Home showed a single person needs to earn at least $130,000 a year to comfortably afford the median national weekly rent for a unit ($566).</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/10/retirees-who-rent-really-struggling-financially-researchers-say-and-the-problem-is-getting-worse">Retirees who rent ‘really struggling’ financially, researchers say – and the problem is getting worse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to SEEK, the average salary in Australia is about $98,000 per year, while the report said the median salary was about $72,592.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The report, which analysed rental affordability for Australians earning between $40,000 and $130,000 a year, found rental stress had now extended well beyond low-income earners.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=safeharbour&amp;key=7fdcb232-dc38-4899-9161-aa432be8b1aa" data-alt="A graphic showing the percentage of their income people in different parts of Australia spend on rent"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/superyacht/index.html?location=safeharbour&key=7fdcb232-dc38-4899-9161-aa432be8b1aa">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Rental stress is defined as a person spending more than 30% of their income on rent.</p> <p>An income of more than $130,000 is needed to escape rental stress across capital cities, the report found, with Sydney and the Gold Coast among the most unaffordable cities in Australia.</p> <p>Middle-to-high-income Australians are increasingly struggling to find affordable homes. People earning $70,000 a year would have to spend more than half of their income (52%) on the national median unit rent.</p> <p>Even renters earning $100,000 per year – well above the median income of $72,592 – are struggling in locations across Australia, spending 38% of their income on rent.</p> <p>Everybody’s Home spokesperson Maiy Azize said a $100,000 salary “used to be considered a secure income” but “people on this wage are struggling in both cities and regional areas because rents are so staggeringly high”.</p> <p>“The situation is even more dire for those on lower incomes, with people earning $40,000 per year facing extreme rental stress nationwide,” she said.</p> <p>“They are facing rents that are up to 119% of their income, putting a stable home out of their reach.”</p> <p>Everybody’s Home urged the government to boost social housing and scrap investor tax handouts, such as negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount.</p> <p>“It is unfair to spend billions of dollars propping up investors and pushing up costs while people on low and middle incomes are left behind,” Azize said.</p>
