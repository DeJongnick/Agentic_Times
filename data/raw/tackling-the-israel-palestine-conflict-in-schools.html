<p>Re schools being scared to teach the Arab-Israeli conflict (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jan/17/schools-are-scared-to-teach-the-arab-israeli-conflict-in-history-lessons">17 January</a>), while parental backlash can feel daunting, it often presents a unique opportunity for understanding and growth. </p> <p>Since the early 2000s, respectful intellectual debate has been fading from public discourse. Topics like Israel-Palestine highlight the erosion of democratic norms such as free speech and open dialogue. Many young people feel silenced or confined to echo chambers that can fuel Islamophobia, antisemitism and other prejudices. Schools must not fall victim to this trend. </p> <p>Over the past year, the education programme run by <a href="https://solutionsnotsides.co.uk/">Solutions Not Sides</a> has brought Palestinian and Israeli peacebuilders to more than 100 schools, engaging 11,000 students and sparking some initial concerns from parents. But school leaders who engaged parents turned these challenges into meaningful conversations. Inviting parents to understand our work first-hand replaced misperceptions with clarity. The result? Students experienced eye-opening sessions.</p> <p>Education on complex issues must be impartial, but not taking a side doesn’t mean not taking a stand. Values like equality, non-violence and rejecting hate guide our work. We can collaborate with teachers to empower students to navigate these topics with confidence and care.<br><strong>Sharon Booth</strong><br><em>Executive director and founder, Solutions Not Sides</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
