 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Our live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live US politics coverage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news">here</a>. Here is a summary of the key developments from today:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The Trump administration said it will permit use of Covid vaccines by adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions in the fall, raising questions about whether some people who want a vaccine will be able to get one.</strong> The FDA framework, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A federal judge said that the Trump administration appeared to have violated his April court order by deporting a Burmese immigrant to South Sudan without giving him sufficient time to contest the removal, especially given the risk of being sent to a country that is not his own.</strong> Judge Brian E Murphy in Boston made the remarks during a hearing in Federal District Court after immigration attorneys raised alarm that at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/20/trump-administration-deported-migrants-south-sudan">one other immigrant may also have been deported to South Sudan</a> without due process.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump announced $25bn for his “Golden Dome” defense initiative. </strong>The funding, included in what the president has dubbed his “big, beautiful bill”, will go toward an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/20/trump-appoints-michael-guetlin-golden-dome">expansive air defense system designed to shield the entire US</a>. Trump confirmed that Space Force general Michael Guetlein will oversee development of the ‘Golden Dome’ antimissile shield. “We’re talking about $175bn total cost of this when it’s completed,” Trump said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Defense secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a “comprehensive review” of the United States’ chaotic military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, an evacuation operation in which 13 US service members and 150 Afghans were killed at Kabul’s airport in an Islamic State bombing</strong>. It was unclear how Hegseth’s review would differ from the many previous reviews that have been carried out – including by the US military, the state department and even Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The secretary of state, Marco Rubio, told the Senate foreign relations committee that the number of visas he has revoked was “probably in the thousands”, adding that he believed there was still more to do.</strong> “I don’t know the latest count, but we probably have more to do. A visa is not a right, it’s a privilege.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Department of Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, couldn’t correctly state what habeas corpus is when pressed to define the concept by the Democratic US senator Maggie Hassan. </strong>Asked what habeas corpus is, Noem claimed it’s “a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country and suspend their right to –”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A group of fired federal workers held a sit-in on the House-side steps of the US Capitol in an effort to pressure members of Congress to do more to reign in Doge’s “harmful and illegal cuts to federal programs”. </strong>According to the Fork Off Coalition, the group includes “federal employees illegally terminated by Doge; contractors on cancelled federal contracts; and other workers harmed by Doge”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump defended the justice department’s decision to charge the Democratic representative LaMonica McIver of New Jersey for allegedly assaulting law enforcement officers earlier this month.</strong> McIver faces a felony assault charge over a physical confrontation with Ice officials outside an immigrant detention facility in New Jersey.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>US senator Chris Van Hollen has accused the Trump administration of “making a mockery” of the US refugee process, turning it into a system of “global apartheid” by granting asylum status to white Afrikaners, while turning away refugees from war-torn countries, including Sudan, where he said a genocide is currently unfolding. </strong>The first group of 59 Afrikaners began arriving in the US last week after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/20/marco-rubio-tim-kaine-south-africa">Trump claimed the Afrikaners were victims of “unjust racial discrimination”</a> and granted them asylum status.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr said earlier that the MAHA commission report Donald Trump tasked him with producing would come out on Thursday. </strong>Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to “Make America Healthy Again,” during Kennedy’s swearing in ceremony on 13 February and tasked it with investigating chronic illness and delivering an action plan to fight childhood diseases, starting with a report due within 100 days.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump pressed Republicans in Congress to unite behind his sweeping tax-cut bill, but – despite his very optimistic front – apparently failed to convince a handful of holdouts who could still block a package that encompasses much of his domestic agenda. </strong>In a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/20/trump-capitol-republicans-bill">Trump bluntly warned Republicans in the House of Representatives</a> not to press for further changes to the sprawling bill, which would cut taxes and tighten eligibility for the Medicaid health program.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr defended his management of the ongoing measles outbreak in the US, telling Republican senator Jerry Moran, of Kansas, that he’s urging people to get vaccinated against the virus, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/trump-the-next-100-days/5308932-live-updates-trump-house-republicans-biden/">The Hill reports</a>. </strong>Moran asked Kennedy what the Department of Health and Human Services needed in order to best respond to the outbreak, which has surpassed 1,000 cases.</p></li>

  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/andrew-cuomo-investigation-doj.html">The New York Times</a> reports that the Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation of former New York Governor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/andrew-cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a>, after Republicans accused him of lying to Congress about decisions he made during the coronavirus pandemic while in office.</p> 
  <p>The inquiry, begun about a month ago by the US attorney’s office in Washington, according to the news outlet. The investigation comes after senior Justice Department officials in February demanded the dismissal of an indictment of the city’s current mayor, Eric Adams, on corruption charges.</p> 
  <p>In March, Cuomo entered the New York City mayoral race in an attempt to resurrect a seemingly dead political career. Cuomo fell from grace after he issued a controversial directive early on in the pandemic that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/16/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-nursing-homes-deaths-new-york">barred nursing homes from refusing to accept patients</a> just because they’d had Covid-19.</p> 
  <p>More than 9,000 recovering coronavirus patients were released from hospitals into nursing homes under the directive, which was rescinded amid speculation that it had accelerated outbreaks.</p> 
  <p>Cuomo later resigned in August 2021 after a state attorney general’s report concluded he had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/10/andrew-cuomo-resigns-sexual-harassment-intimidation">sexually harassed multiple women</a>, including current and former state employees.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">New Trump vaccine policy limits access to Covid shots</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Trump administration said it will permit use of Covid vaccines by adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions in the fall, raising questions about whether some people who want a vaccine will be able to get one.</p> 
  <p>Top officials for the Food and Drug Administration laid out new standards for updated Covid shots, saying they’d continue to use a streamlined approach to make them available to adults 65 and older as well as children and younger adults with at least one high-risk health problem.</p> 
  <p>But the FDA framework, <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929">published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, urges companies to conduct large, lengthy studies before tweaked vaccines can be approved for healthier people. </p> 
  <p>It’s a stark break from the previous federal policy recommending an annual Covid shot for all Americans six months and older. In the paper and a subsequent online webcast, the FDA’s top vaccine official said more than 100 million Americans still should qualify for what he termed a booster under the new guidance.</p> 
  <p>Scientific advisers to the FDA are slated to meet Thursday to decide on the composition of the Covid vaccine to be made available in the fall.</p>

  <p>The Department of Homeland Security criticized Minnesota Governor <strong>Tim Walz</strong> for comparing immigration enforcement officers under President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> to the secret police force of Nazi Germany in a <a href="https://mediaspace.umn.edu/media/t/1_85aah0ps">commencement speech</a> over the weekend.</p> 
  <p>DHS assistant secretary <strong>Tricia McLaughlin</strong> said likening ICE officers to the Gestapo is “sickening” in a <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/19/dhs-hits-back-tim-walzs-dangerous-rhetoric-comparing-ice-gestapo">statement</a>.</p> 
  <p>“Governor Walz’s comments comparing ICE agents to the Gestapo is sickening,” McLaughlin said. “This type of rhetoric and demonization of ICE officers has led to our officers facing a 413% increase in assaults.”</p> 
  <p>The comments came during the Democrat’s commencement speech at the University of Minnesota Law School graduation ceremony on Saturday. </p> 
  <p>“Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo is scooping folks up off the streets,” Walz said in his remarks.</p>

  <p>Republican Rep. <strong>Nancy Mace</strong> of South Carolina shared a photo today of what she described as a “naked silhouette” of herself, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/20/nancy-mace-assault-allegation-00361021">Politico</a> reports, claiming it was a still from a video secretly recorded by her former fiancé without her consent.</p> 
  <p>During a House subcommittee hearing, Mace alleged that the video was one of several taken by her ex-fiancé, Patrick Bryant. In response, Bryant issued a statement denying the accusations and calling them “false” and “outrageous.” </p> 
  <p>Mace first named <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/11/nancy-mace-rape-allegations-house-speech">Bryant and three other men in a February speech on the House floor</a>, where she accused them of sexual abuse and other sex-related crimes. During that address, she revealed she was a survivor of sexual assault and stood beside a display showing the names and photos of the four men, with the word “PREDATORS” printed across the top.</p>

  <p>Senators <strong>Chuck Grassley</strong> and <strong>Amy Klobuchar</strong> introduced a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25949063-dav25801/">resolution</a> today urging Russia to return abducted Ukrainian children before any peace agreement to end the war is finalized.</p> 
  <p>In a <a href="https://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/grassley-klobuchar-lead-bipartisan-resolution-calling-for-return-of-kidnapped-ukrainian-children-prior-to-any-final-peace-agreement">statement</a>, Grassley condemned Russian President <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> for launching what he called an “inhumane and unprovoked attack on Ukraine,” accusing him of abducting thousands of children to “brainwash and Russify them” in an effort to erase their cultural identity. “The United States ought to demand these children are returned before inking a deal to end the war in Ukraine,” he said.</p> 
  <p>The resolution, which has bipartisan backing, was co-sponsored by senators <strong>Joni Ernst</strong>, <strong>Dick Durbin, Roger Wicker</strong>, and <strong>John Fetterman</strong>. Its fate on the Senate floor remains uncertain.</p>

  <p>“It sounds like this deportation would be a violation of my preliminary injunction,” Judge Murphy said. </p> 
  <p>He ordered Justice Department attorney <strong>Elianis N Perez</strong> to alert everyone involved in the flight that they could face criminal contempt charges if the court’s order was ignored. </p> 
  <p>He also directed her to determine the plane’s location and whether it could be turned around.</p>

  <p>Former President <strong>Joe Biden’s</strong> last known prostate cancer screening was in 2014, according to several <a href="https://x.com/KellyO/status/1924928468719952263">reports</a>.</p> 
  <p>The revelation that Biden hasn’t undergone screening in a decade adds context to his diagnosis of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/19/joe-biden-prostate-cancer-thanks">advanced prostate cancer</a> that has metastasized to the bone.</p> 
  <p>Biden, 82, and his family are reviewing treatment options. The cancer appears to be hormone sensitive, allowing for effective treatment, according to his office.</p> 
  <p>Asked about Biden during an appearance at the White House, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> said, “it takes a long time to get to that situation” and that he was “surprised that the public wasn’t notified a long time ago.”</p>

  <p>The US Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into hiring practices at the city of Chicago, according to a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/media/1400811/dl?inline">letter sent to the Chicago mayor’s office</a>.<br><br>The probe’s announcement comes after Mayor <strong>Brandon Johnson</strong> spoke at a Chicago church on Sunday to outline his vision for the remainder of his term. During the speech, Johnson praised the number of Black people in top positions in his administration. </p> 
  <p>The speech garnered immediate attention on social media, including calls from conservatives and others to investigate. The letter outlines what the Trump administration and some MAGA activists have identified as race-based hiring that they say discriminates against white candidates.<br><br>The DOJ’s Civil Rights Division is looking into whether the city has habitually violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race.<br><br>“Considering these remarks, I have authorized an investigation to determine whether the City of Chicago is engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination as set forth above,” the letter signed by assistant attorney general for <strong>Harmeet K Dhillon</strong> said. “If these kind of hiring decisions are being made for top-level positions in your administration, then it begs the question whether such decisions are also being made for lower-level positions.”</p>

  <p>The Republican-controlled Senate swiftly approved the “No Tax on Tips Act” today, endorsing a proposal that has gained popularity since President <strong>Donald Trump </strong>promoted it during his 2024 campaign.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/s129/BILLS-119s129is.pdf">bill</a> sets a new tax deduction of up to $25,000 for cash tips, provided those tips are reported by workers to their employers for payroll tax withholding. </p> 
  <p>The benefit is limited to employees earning $160,000 or less in 2025, with that income cap set to adjust for inflation in future years.</p> 
  <p>Introduced in January by Republican Senator <strong>Ted Cruz</strong>, the legislation also drew bipartisan support, with Nevada’s Democratic Senators <strong>Jacky Rosen</strong> and <strong>Catherine Cortez Masto</strong> among its cosponsors.</p> 
  <p>“Hard working families in Nevada and all across this country are struggling to make ends meet because of rising costs on everything, from groceries to housing, all of which has been made worse by Donald Trump’s tariffs that are driving prices even higher,” <a href="https://x.com/SenJackyRosen/status/1924933653894701465">said Rosen</a>.</p>

So far, Russia has very few troops along the frontier, and the Finns say that none of this is much of a threat.</p>

  <p>The Congressional Budget Office estimated this month that just the space-based components of the Golden Dome could cost as much as $542 billion over the next 20 years.</p> 
  <p>Additionally, Democratic lawmakers have voiced concern about the procurement process of the Golden Dome missile defense shield and the involvement of Trump ally <strong>Elon Musk’s</strong> SpaceX, which has emerged as a frontrunner alongside Palantir and Anduril to build key components of the system.</p> 
  <p>In a <a href="http://warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_from_senator_warren_repcasartodepartmentofdefenseinspectorgeneralongoldendomeinvestigation.pdf">letter</a> sent to the acting US Defense Department Inspector General, a group of lawmakers, led by Senator <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> and congressman <strong>Greg Casar</strong>, requested a probe into the origins of the procurement process.</p> 
  <p>“If Mr. Musk were to exercise improper influence over the Golden Dome contract, it would be another example of a disturbing pattern of Mr. Musk flouting conflict of interest rules,” reads the letter.</p> 
  <p>The Golden Dome plan includes a massive array of surveillance satellites and a separate fleet of attacking satellites that would shoot down offensive missiles soon after lift-off.</p> 
  <p>Trump, who said the project would be completed by the end of his term in January 2029, said Alaska will be a big part of the program and named Florida, Georgia and Indiana as also benefiting from the project.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>US immigration officials appear to have begun deporting migrants from Myanmar and Vietnam to South Sudan, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>Immigrant rights advocates accused the Trump administration of deporting around a dozen migrants in violation of a court order and asked a judge to order their return.</p> 
  <p>The advocates made the request in a motion directed to a federal judge in Boston who had barred the Trump administration from swiftly deporting migrants to countries other than their own without first hearing any concerns they had that they might be tortured or persecuted if sent there.</p> 
  <p>Lawyers for a group of migrants pursuing the class action lawsuit before US District Judge <strong>Brian Murphy</strong> said they learned that nearly a dozen migrants held at a detention facility in Texas were flown to South Sudan on Tuesday morning.</p>

  <p><strong>Trump visits Capitol to urge House Republicans to pass ‘big, beautiful bill’</strong></p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> traveled to the Capitol on Tuesday to insist that the fractious House Republican majority set aside their differences and pass his wide-ranging bill to enact his taxation and immigration priorities.</p> 
  <p>In a speech to a closed-door meeting of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a> lawmakers in Congress’s lower chamber, the president pushed representatives from districts in blue states to drop their demands for a bigger State and Local Tax (Salt) deduction, and also sought to assuage moderates concerned that the legislation, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, would hobble the Medicaid health insurance program.</p> 
  <p>“I think we have unbelievable unity. I think we’re going to get everything we want, and I think we’re going to have a great victory,” Trump said as he left the meeting.</p> 
  <p>But it is unclear if the president’s exhortations had the intended effect ahead of the Monday deadline that House speaker Mike Johnson has set to get the bill passed through the chamber, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> control by a mere three votes. Following his meeting, at least one key lawmaker said he remained opposed to the bill as written, while others announced no changes to their position.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Space force general will lead project slated to cost $175bn</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> confirmed that Space Force general <strong>Michael Guetlein</strong> will oversee development of the ‘Golden Dome’ antimissile shield.</p> 
  <p>“We’re talking about $175bn total cost of this when it’s completed,” Trump said. “This is very important for the success and even survival of our country. It’s a very evil world out there.”</p> 
  <p>The project stems from a January executive order that called for an “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/25/trump-iron-golden-dome">Iron Dome for America</a>”, taking cues from Israel’s Iron Dome, designed to counter short-range threats using technology. US military officials have described the Golden Dome as a “system of systems”, combining traditional defenses with emerging, largely untested technologies.</p> 
  <p>Trump said the “Golden Dome” will take two-and-a-half to three years to be completed. But the option that Trump chooses will determine its timeline and cost. The $25bn coming from Republicans’ budget bill is only set to cover initial development costs. The final price tag could exceed $540bn over the next two decades, according to the congressional budget office.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Pete Hegseth orders 'comprehensive review' into 2021 US Afghanistan withdrawal</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Defense secretary <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong> has ordered a “comprehensive review” of the United States’ chaotic military withdrawal from <strong>Afghanistan</strong> in August 2021, an evacuation operation in which 13 US service members and 150 Afghans were killed at Kabul’s airport in an Islamic State bombing.</p> 
  <p>It was unclear how Hegseth’s review would differ from the many previous reviews that have been carried out – including by the US military, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/30/us-afghanistan-war-military-pullout-report-biden-trump">state department</a> and even <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives.</p> 
  <p>Reuters reports that Hegseth could be accused of politicizing the matter. The Biden administration, which oversaw the 2021 pullout, mostly blamed the resulting chaos on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/06/white-house-blames-trump-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-chaos">lack of planning and reductions in troops by the first Trump administration</a> following a 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw American forces.</p> 
  <p>On the campaign trail, Trump frequently criticized Biden and his administration for the withdrawal.</p> 
  <p>In a memo, Hegseth said that after three months of reviewing the withdrawal, a comprehensive review was needed to ensure accountability for this event. He wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This remains an important step toward regaining faith and trust with the American people and all those who wear the uniform and is prudent based on the number of casualties and equipment lost during the execution of this withdrawal operation.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a statement accompanying the memo, he said Pentagon spokesperson and senior adviser <strong>Sean Parnell</strong> would lead the review. Other individuals who served in Afghanistan, such as <strong>Lt Col Stuart</strong> <strong>Scheller</strong>, who was publicly critical of the withdrawal while he was in the Marine Corps, would be a part of the review panel.</p> 
  <p>Senior US military officials, including then-defense secretary <strong>Lloyd</strong> <strong>Austin</strong> and then-top US general <strong>Mark</strong> <strong>Milley</strong>, have already appeared before lawmakers.</p> 
  <p><strong>US Central Command</strong>, which oversees operations in the Middle East, has also carried out an investigation into the Islamic State attack that killed the 13 US troops and dozens of Afghans during the last few days of the withdrawal.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Marco Rubio defends Trump administration's admission of white Afrikaners as 'refugees'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The secretary of state, <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, defended the Trump administration’s decision to <strong>admit 49 white Afrikaners from South Africa as refugees</strong> after Hillary Clinton’s former running mate, <strong>Tim Kaine</strong>, claimed they were getting <strong>preferential treatment because of their skin colour</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Kaine, a Democratic senator from Virginia, challenged Rubio to justify prioritising the Afrikaners while cancelling long-standing refugee programmes for other groups that have been more documented as victims of conflict or persecution.</p> 
  <p>The clash between the two men was Rubio’s most combative exchange in his first appearance before the Senate foreign relations committee since his unanimous approval by senators in confirmation hearing in January.</p> 
  <p>“Right now, the US refugee program allows a special program for Afrikaner farmers, the first group of whom arrived at Dulles airport in Virginia not long ago, while shutting off the refugee program for everyone else,” said Kaine.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Do you think Afrikaner farmers are the most persecuted group in the world?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In response, Rubio said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think those 49 people that came <strong>surely felt they were persecuted</strong>, and they’ve passed every sort of check mark that had to be checked off in terms of meeting their requirements for that. They live in a country where farms are taken, <strong>the land is taken, on a racial basis</strong>.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Trump has falsely asserted that white farmers in South Africa are undergoing a “genocide”.</p> 
  <p>Kaine asked why Afrikaners were more important than the <strong>Uyghurs</strong> or <strong>Rohingyas</strong>, who have faced intense persecution in China and Myanmar respectively, and cited the cases of political dissidents in <strong>Cuba</strong>, <strong>Venezuela</strong> and <strong>Nicaragua</strong>, as well as <strong>Afghans</strong> under the Taliban.</p> 
  <p>“The problem we face there is the volume problem,” Rubio said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If you look at all the persecuted people of the world, it’s millions of people. They can’t all come here.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked why Afrikaners were a special case, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Because <strong>it’s a small subset, it’s a new issue</strong>, and the president identified it as a problem and wanted to use it as an example. But that’s different from having these refugee programs that were basically spending money to put people up in communities and accommodate them, and it was acting as a magnet to millions of people.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Kaine called the claims of persecution against Afrikaner farmers “completely specious” and pointed to the existence of Afrikaner ministers in South Africa’s coalition government, including the minister for agriculture.</p> 
  <p>He also contrasted the current refugee designation of Afrikaners with the absence of such a programme for the country’s Black majority during the apartheid era.</p> 
  <p>“There never has been a special programme for Africans to come in as refugees to the United States,” Kaine said, pointing out that special categories were allowed for people being persecuted for religious reasons under communist regimes. “[But] <strong>we’ve never allowed a special program to allow Africans into the United States in an expedited refugee status until now</strong>,” he said, “Afrikaner farmers living in a nation governed by a government of national unity that includes the main Afrikaner party.”</p> 
  <p>Referring to the US statutory standard of recognising a refugee claim as being a “well-justified fear of persecution”, Kaine asked:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Should that be applied in an evenhanded way? For example, should we say if you’re persecuted on the grounds of your religion, we’ll let you in if you’re a Christian but not a Muslim?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Rubio replied that US foreign policy did not require evenhandedness, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>The United States has a right to allow into this country and prioritise allowance of who they want to allow to come in.</strong> We’re going to prioritise people coming into our country on the basis of <strong>what’s in the interests of this country</strong>. That’s a small number of people that are coming.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Kaine responded: “So you have a different standard based on the color of somebody’s skin. Would that be acceptable?”</p> 
  <p>Rubio replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You’re the one talking about the colour of their skin, not me.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>US senator <strong>Chris Van Hollen</strong> has accused the Trump administration of “making a mockery” of the US refugee process, turning it into a system of “global apartheid” by <strong>granting asylum status to white Afrikaners, while turning away refugees from war-torn countries, including Sudan</strong>, where he said a genocide is currently unfolding.</p> 
  <p>The first group of 59 Afrikaners began arriving in the US last week after Trump claimed the Afrikaners were victims of “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/08/trump-cuts-aid-to-south-africa-over-racial-discrimination-against-afrikaners">unjust racial discrimination</a>” and granted them asylum status. The move comes as the US has lifted legal protections in the US for refugees from many war torn countries.</p> 
  <p>Speaking in a Senate foreign relations committee hearing, Van Hollen, a Democrat, said he had voted to confirm <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> because he believed the secretary of state would defend democracy and human rights abroad — but said that he had “done the opposite”.</p> 
  <p>Van Hollen contrasted the decision by the Trump administration to dismantle the majority of <strong>USAID’s</strong> foreign assistance programs with the decision to allow Afrikaners to claim asylum in the US, calling it “despicable”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

 <h2 class="block-title">Senate confirms Charles Kushner - father of Trump's son-in-law Jared - as ambassador to France</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Charles Kushne</strong>r, the father of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s son-in-law <strong>Jared</strong>, has secured <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">US Senate</a> confirmation to serve as the nation’s ambassador to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a>.</p> 
  <p>The elder Kushner’s confirmation late on Monday came a little more than four years after Trump, during his first presidency, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/23/donald-trumps-latest-wave-of-pardons-includes-paul-manafort-and-charles-kunsher">pardoned</a> him from his conviction on charges of tax evasion and other federal crimes.</p> 
  <p><strong>Cory Booker</strong> of New Jersey was the only Democratic senator to vote in support of the nomination. His vote came after <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> and <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong> – his wife and the president’s daughter – <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/07/ivanka-trump-fundraiser-cory-booker-094288">held</a> a fundraiser for Booker as he successfully ran for the Senate in 2013.</p> 
  <p><strong>Lisa Murkowski</strong> of Alaska defected from her fellow Senate Republicans to vote against Charles Kushner’s appointment to the French ambassadorship, though that did not impede him from being <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5308588-senate-confirms-charles-kushner-ambassador-france/amp/">confirmed</a> by a 51-45 vote.</p> 
  <p>Kushner had been asked about his crimes during his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuFd1eiojdc">confirmation hearing</a> before the Senate foreign relations committee.</p> 
  <p>He pleaded guilty in 2005 to 18 charges that included tax evasion, retaliating against a federal witness and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission. The witness tampering charge <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/05/nyregion/democratic-donor-receives-twoyear-prison-sentence.html">involved</a> his hiring a sex worker to seduce his brother-in-law, who was cooperating with federal authorities. Kushner arranged to secretly record the encounter between the sex worker and his brother-in-law and then send the footage to his sister, the other man’s wife.</p> 
  <p>Trump pardoned Kushner for those crimes in December 2020 after <strong>Joe Bide</strong>n had defeated him in that year’s election. </p> 
  <p>“My misjudgment and mistake was over 20 years ago,” Kushner said. “Since then, I’ve been pardoned by President Trump. But I don’t sit here before you today and tell you I’m a perfect person. I am not a perfect person. I made a very very, very serious mistake, and I paid a very heavy price for that mistake.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump appears to have failed to get Republican holdouts behind his tax bill</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Earlier today, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> pressed Republicans in Congress to unite behind his sweeping tax-cut bill, but – despite his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/may/20/donald-trump-plane-qatar-immigration-marco-rubio-republicans-democrats-us-politics-live-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-682ca6808f08a5e9325ebcbc#block-682ca6808f08a5e9325ebcbc">very optimistic front</a> – apparently failed to convince a handful of holdouts who could still block a package that encompasses much of his domestic agenda.</p> 
  <p>In a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Trump bluntly warned Republicans in the House of Representatives not to press for further changes to the sprawling bill, which would <strong>cut taxes</strong> and tighten eligibility for the <strong>Medicaid</strong> health program.</p> 
  <p>He strongly cautioned against further plans to make it more difficult for people to access Medicaid, a program for low-income Americans. One person in the room told Reuters Trump told the holdouts:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>Don’t fuck around with Medicaid</strong>.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He also discouraged Republicans from seeking further carve-outs for <strong>state and local tax payments</strong> (SALT) - a niche issue that is especially important for moderate Republicans in high-tax states like California and New York.</p> 
  <p>But Trump failed to convince some lawmakers who are pushing for those provisions.</p> 
  <p>“The president I don’t think convinced enough people that the bill is adequate the way it is,” said Republican representative <strong>Andy Harris</strong> of Maryland, who leads the hard-right House <strong>Freedom Caucus</strong> and has been <strong>pushing for further Medicaid cuts</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Republican representative <strong>Mike Lawler</strong>, a New York moderate who is pushing to raise limits on deductions for state and local tax payments, likewise said Trump did not change his mind.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As it stands right now, I do not support the bill.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>After the meeting, Trump predicted the package would ultimately pass the House, which Republicans control by a narrow majority of 220-213. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/may/20/donald-trump-plane-qatar-immigration-marco-rubio-republicans-democrats-us-politics-live-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-682ca6808f08a5e9325ebcbc#block-682ca6808f08a5e9325ebcbc">It was a meeting of love</a>,” he said. He did not address Harris’ concerns.</p> 
  <p>Freedom Caucus members have been pushing for new work requirements on some Medicaid recipients to kick in earlier than is planned for 2029. But centrists have fought to protect the program, warning that steep cuts could imperil their majority in the 2026 congressional elections.</p> 
  <p>Trump said afterward the bill <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/may/20/donald-trump-plane-qatar-immigration-marco-rubio-republicans-democrats-us-politics-live-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-682c82408f085a8d56d08c5c#block-682c82408f085a8d56d08c5c">would eliminate “waste, fraud and abuse” in Medicaid</a> but would not cause people to lose coverage.</p> 
  <p><strong>Trump is</strong> <strong>pressing for every House Republican to vote for the bill</strong>, according to a White House official. As he arrived at the Capitol, Trump said <strong>Republican lawmakers who vote against it could “possibly” face a primary challenge in next year’s congressional elections</strong>.</p>

  <p>“What we have talked to some nations about is if someone voluntarily and willingly says I want to go somewhere else for some period of time because I’m sick, because my children need to go to school, or what have you, are there countries in the region willing to accept them for some period of time?,” Rubio said, adding that he was not aware of Libya being included in that.</p> 
  <p>Rubio also told the Senate foreign relations committee that the United States was pleased to see the resumption of food shipments to Gaza, adding that the US understands that another 100 trucks are behind the initial ones to cross in to Gaza and more might enter in the coming days.</p>

  <p>Interior secretary <strong>Doug Burgum</strong> defended the Trump administration’s budget request on Tuesday in a House committee hearing.</p> 
  <p>Burgum testified before the House Appropriations Committee:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>With common sense approaches and modern systems, we can increase returns for our citizens, strengthen our economy, and create great-paying and meaningful jobs – all while protecting our beautiful lands, our abundant wildlife, and our clean air and clean water.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The secretary took some mild heat from lawmakers, facing questions about hiring and funding freezes in the Department of Interior. Republican representative <strong>Mark Amodei</strong> of Nevada said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>How you can sit there and hold somebody’s feet to the fire when there’s a whole bunch of empty desks.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Trump has proposed shrinking the Interior Department budget by $5bn, with major cuts to national park management, conservation programming, and other key functions. </p> 
  <p>Despite the potential steep fall in funding, Burgum has issued an order requiring national park units to remain fully open to visitors.</p> 
  <p>The planned cuts follow the firing of probationary employees within the department in recent weeks, as well as the resigning of 2,700 workers who accepted Trump’s “deferred resignation” offer.</p> 
  <p>“In just four months, the department has been destabilized, and there’s been a stunning decline in its ability to meet its mission,” Democratic representative Chellie Marie Pingree of Maine told Burgum. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong> defended his management of the ongoing measles outbreak in the US, telling Republican senator <strong>Jerry Moran</strong>, of Kansas, that he’s urging people to get vaccinated against the virus, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/trump-the-next-100-days/5308932-live-updates-trump-house-republicans-biden/">The Hill reports</a>.</p> 
  <p>Moran asked Kennedy what the Department of Health and Human Services needed in order to best respond to the outbreak, which has surpassed 1,000 cases. Kennedy said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The best way to prevent the spread of measles is through vaccination. We urge people to get their MMR vaccines. I spent a lot of time with the Mennonites and the MMR vaccine has millions of fragments of human DNA in it, from aborted fetal tissues, and that’s a religious objection for them that I have to respect.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve done a better job at controlling measles since I came into this agency than any other country in the world. Today, we’re at 1,035 cases and we only added 27 cases last week.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>As my colleague <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jessica-glenza">Jessica Glenza</a> wrote recently, although Kennedy has tepidly endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent measles, he has also made false and inflammatory claims about the vaccine, including repeating the above false claim that it contains “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/atrupar.com/post/3lo34uvdm6u2l">aborted fetus debris</a>”. The rubella vaccine, like many others, is produced using <a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-safety/vaccine-ingredients/fetal-tissues">decades-old sterile fetal cell lines</a> derived from two elective terminations in the 1960s. </p> 
  <p>The US is enduring the largest measles outbreak in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/health/measles-southwest-outbreak.html">quarter-century</a>. Centered in west Texas, the measles outbreak has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/texas-measles-outbreak-cases">killed</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/texas-measles-death-child">two</a> unvaccinated children and one adult and spread to neighboring states including New Mexico and Oklahoma. </p> 
  <p>The US eliminated measles in 2000. Elimination status would be lost if the US had 12 months of sustained transmission of the virus. As of 1 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_3-weekly-measles-cases-by-rash-onset-date">reported</a> 935 confirmed measles cases across<strong> </strong>30 jurisdictions.<strong> </strong>Nearly one in three children under five years old involved in the outbreak, or 285 young children, have been hospitalized.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Members of the Senate appropriations committee from both parties are confronting health and human services secretary <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong> about his department’s budget request, which calls for steep cuts in funding research programs, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/trump-the-next-100-days/5308932-live-updates-trump-house-republicans-biden/">The Hill reports</a>.</p> 
  <p>Noting that the Trump administration is asking for a 26% reduction in HHS funding for its fiscal year 2026 budget, Republican <strong>Shelley Moore Capito</strong>, acting as chair of the hearing, said the US should be “funding the basic science”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump defense announcement to be on 'Golden Dome' missile system that will cost billions - Reuters</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The 3pm announcement will be Trump declaring that he has selected the path forward for his “<strong>Golden Dome</strong>” missile defense shield, a US official has told Reuters.</p> 
  <p>The vice chief of space operations, US space force general <strong>Michael Guetlein</strong> is expected to be at the event where the official, who declined to be named, said that it is likely he will be named as the lead on the controversial project.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s missile defense shield idea to protect the US from long-range strikes is estimated to <strong>cost billions of dollars</strong>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/19/politics/golden-dome-missile-shield-price-billions">CNN reported yesterday</a>, and the Pentagon submitted small, medium and large options to the White House for its development.</p> 
  <p>Per CNN’s report, Trump had been expected to announce “his preferred option – and its price point – in the coming days, a decision that will ultimately chart a path forward for funding, developing and implementing the space-based missile defense system over the next several years”.</p> 
  <p>A whopping “$25bn has been carved out in next year’s defense budget for the system, but the Congressional Budget Office has estimated <strong>the US could have to spend more than $500bn – over the course of 20 years – to develop a viable Golden Dome</strong>.</p> 
  <p>“The project will also present a bonanza for private contractors as the government won’t be able to build it alone, with companies including <strong>Elon Musk</strong>’s <strong>SpaceX</strong> in the running for highly lucrative contracts related to the system.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Secretary of state Marco Rubio to face tough questions on Trump policies in Congress</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Secretary of state <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> will testify this week before his former colleagues in Congress, <strong>some of whom have said they regret voting to confirm the ex-senator</strong> because he has not stood up to <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The Senate voted 99-0 to confirm the Florida Republican senator as the nation’s highest diplomat on 20 January, as Democrats joined Republicans in giving the president his first permanent second-term cabinet member just hours after Trump was sworn in.</p> 
  <p>During his friendly Senate foreign relations committee confirmation hearing on 15 January, Rubio promised a robust foreign policy focused on American interests, echoing Trump’s “America First” approach to global affairs.</p> 
  <p><strong>Some Democrats who backed Rubio in January have said they regret their votes</strong>, as Trump has seized more control of the federal government than any modern president, including cutting funding plans that had been approved by Congress.</p> 
  <p>Rubio will tell the Senate committee on Tuesday that the $28.5bn budget request by the Trump administration for the 2025/26 fiscal year will allow his department to continue enacting Trump’s vision while cutting $20bn of “duplicative, wasteful, and ideologically driven programs”, according to prepared remarks published by the state department.</p> 
  <p>At the hearing, Rubio is likely to face tough questions about the <strong>decimation of foreign aid</strong> <strong>-</strong> <strong>Rubio was an advocate of such aid during his 14 years in the Senate</strong> - while slashing staff at the state department and <strong>USAID</strong>, which used to spend roughly $40bn a year and is being folded into the state department.</p> 
  <p>The administration is proposing a new $2.9bn <strong>America First Opportunity Fund (A1OF) t</strong>hat would take on foreign aid, building on “lessons we learned from USAID”, according to the prepared remarks.</p> 
  <p>“It will allow the department to respond rapidly to crises, engage proactively with critical partners like India and Jordan, support essential repatriation efforts, and confront strategic threats from near-peer competitors like China,” Rubio will say.</p> 
  <p>Senators are also likely to grill Rubio on Trump’s plans to unwind <strong>Syria</strong> <strong>sanctions</strong>, Rubio’s role in the administration’s <strong>immigration crackdown</strong>, the <strong>delivery of humanitarian assistance to Palestinians in Gaza</strong> and <strong>efforts to end the war in Ukraine</strong>.</p> 
  <p>He may also face some questions over Trump’s suggestions that <strong>Canada</strong> could become the 51st US state and that the United States could acquire <strong>Greenland</strong>, which have angered some close US allies.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'We have a very, very unified party,' says Trump as he arrives on Capitol Hill to unify party behind tax and spending megabill</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Trump is currently meeting with GOP leaders on Capitol Hill to call for his party to unite around his tax and spending cuts proposal.</p> 
  <p>“We have a very, very unified party,” Trump told reporters ahead of the meeting, piling on praise on House speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> and Senate majority leader <strong>John Thune</strong> who have been desperately scrambling to rally holdouts to get Trump’s megabill over the line.</p> 
  <p>Asked what he will tell the fiscal hawks, Trump said: “I’m a bigger fiscal hawk. There’s nobody like me who’s a bigger fiscal hawk.”</p> 
  <p>He attacked <strong>Thomas Massie</strong> (representative from Kentucky and one such aforementioned fiscal hawk who often votes against his party) as a “grandstander” who “doesn’t understand government” and “should be voted out of office”.</p> 
  <p>Trump denied that the Republicans were touching <strong>Medicaid</strong> and claimed their only concern was waste, fraud and abuse. “We’re not touching it,” he said before blaming the Democrats. In fact, House Republicans have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/19/republican-healthcare-bill-medicaid">proposed an $880bn cut to Medicaid</a> that could leave an estimated 13 million Americans without health insurance.</p> 
  <p>Per the Associated Press, Trump has implored GOP holdouts to “STOP TALKING, AND GET IT DONE.” But negotiations are slogging along and it’s not at all clear that the president’s top domestic priority of extending the tax breaks while pumping in money for border security and deportations and imposing new limits on <strong>Medicaid</strong> has the support needed from the House’s slim Republican majority.</p> 
  <p>Conservative fiscal hawks are insisting on quicker, steeper cuts to federal programs to offset the costs of the trillions of dollars in lost tax revenue. At the same time, a core group of lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states want bigger tax breaks for their voters back home. Worries about piling onto the nation’s $36tn debt are stark.<br><br>Johnson is determined to push the bill forward and needs Trump to provide the momentum, either by encouragement or political warnings or a combination of both.<br><br>A key committee hearing is set for the middle of the night Tuesday (around 1am ET) in hopes of a House floor vote by Wednesday afternoon.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Majority of US companies say they have to raise prices due to Trump tariffs</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A majority of US companies say they will have to raise their prices to accommodate <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s tariffs in the US, according to a new report.</p> 
  <p>More than half (54%) of the US companies surveyed by insurance company Allianz said they will have to raise prices to accommodate the cost of the tariffs. Of the 4,500 companies across nine countries, including the US, UK and China, surveyed by Allianz only 22% said they can absorb the increased costs.</p> 
  <p>The unpredictability of US trade policy has also dented exporters’ confidence. The survey found 42% of exporting companies now anticipate turnover to decline between -2% and -10% over the next 12 months, compared to fewer than 5% before 2 April “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/17/trump-liberation-day-tariff-walk-back">liberation day</a>” – when Trump unveiled his tariff policy.</p> 
  <p>Though Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/17/trump-tariffs-update-active-on-hold">pulled back</a> on many of the levies he initially proposed, key tariffs remain in place, including a 10% universal tariff on all US imports, a 30% tariff on Chinese imports and extra tariffs on specific industries like metal and auto parts.</p> 
  <p>Trump has insisted that tariffs will make America “very wealthy again”, though it appears that American companies and consumers are simply expecting to pay higher prices as the tariffs settle into place. In April, consumer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/25/trump-tariffs-trade-war-consumer-sentiment">expectations</a> of inflation reached their highest point since 1981, according to the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research.</p> 
  <p>Instead of immediately raising prices, which could deter customers, many companies have spent months trying to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs by stockpiling goods to temporarily circumvent them.</p> 
  <p>Nearly eight out of 10 American companies said that they frontloaded shipments to China before Trump announced his tariffs, with 25% saying they had started to front-load before the November 2024 election.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Robert F Kennedy Jr calls WHO 'moribund' and urges other countries to quit</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>US health and human services secretary <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong> dismissed the <strong>World Health Organization</strong> as bloated and “moribund” in a video shown to global health officials meeting earlier today for the body’s annual assembly in Geneva.</p> 
  <p>The United States, the UN agency’s top donor, announced it would withdraw from the WHO on the first day of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s presidency, leaving the organisation with a massive budget shortfall that it is seeking to address through reforms at this week’s assembly.</p> 
  <p>In a video recorded on Fox News and then streamed to the assembly RFK Jr said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I urge the world’s health ministers and the WHO to take our withdrawal from the organisation as a wake-up call. We’ve already been in contact with like-minded countries and we encourage others to consider joining us.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>His speech did not prompt any immediate response from the assembly. Diplomats and ministers mostly watched the address in silence.</p> 
  <p>Trump has accused the WHO of mishandling Covid and of being too close to China - allegations it denies.</p> 
  <p>Kennedy is an environmental lawyer who has long sown doubts about the safety and efficacy of vaccines that have helped curb disease and prevented millions of deaths for decades, and clashed with US lawmakers last week in a hearing disrupted by protesters.</p> 
  <p>In his comments to the WHO, Kennedy called it “mired in bureaucratic bloat, entrenched paradigms, conflicts of interest and international power politics”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We don’t have to suffer the limits of a moribund WHO - let’s create new institutions or revisit existing institutions that are lean, efficient, transparent and accountable.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Kennedy’s comments were broadcast hours after WHO member states adopted an agreement to better prepare for future pandemics.</p> 
  <p>Kennedy said the accord would “lock in all the dysfunctions of the WHO pandemic response”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">At least 50 migrants sent to El Salvador prison entered US legally, report finds</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>At least 50 <strong>Venezuelan</strong> men sent by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> to a prison in <strong>El Salvado</strong>r had entered the <strong>United States</strong> legally, according to a review by the <strong>Cato Institute</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/50-venezuelans-imprisoned-el-salvador-came-us-legally-never-violated-immigration-law">report</a>, published by the libertarian thinktank on Monday, analyzed the available immigration data for only a portion of the men who were deported to El Salvador’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/30/el-salvador-cecot-mega-prison-trump">notorious Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot)</a>, and focuses on the cases where records could be found.</p> 
  <p>“The government calls them all ‘illegal aliens.’ But of the 90 cases where the method of crossing is known, 50 men report that they came legally to the United States, with advanced US government permission, at an official border crossing point,” Cato said in its report.</p> 
  <p>This number aligns with broader trends among Venezuelan migrants, many of whom entered the country either as refugees or through a Biden-era parole program that granted two-year work permits to those with US-based sponsors.</p> 
  <p>“The proportion isn’t what matters the most: the astounding absolute numbers are,” reads the report. “<strong>Dozens of legal immigrants were stripped of their status and imprisoned</strong> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/el-salvador">El Salvador</a>.”</p> 
  <p>Cato’s analysis goes against the Trump administration’s justification for sending the men to El Salvador, saying that only undocumented people were deported.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Social security cuts incite fears of payment disruptions</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Retiree and disability beneficiaries are worried about delays in payments, processing and services amid cuts being made to the <strong>US’s social security system</strong> under the <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration"> administration</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Angel Morgan</strong>, a 44-year-old disability benefits recipient in <strong>Nashville</strong>, <strong>Tennessee</strong>, said she felt like she was “running in circles” navigating long lines at her local social security office and difficulties in trying to make an appointment online to talk about her benefits and how to participate in the <strong>Ticket to Work program</strong>, which provides career development services for disability beneficiaries.</p> 
  <p>“I struggle with social settings and these things just make it worse. Trump doesn’t care about the struggles we go through and won’t quit until we are all bankrupt and either dead or wanting to die,” said Morgan.</p> 
  <p>An average of nearly 69 million Americans will receive social security benefits a month in 2025,<strong> </strong>most of them older people or those with disabilities.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/musk-doge-social-security">agency</a> has been a significant target of the so-called <strong>“department of government efficiency” (Doge)</strong> and its former leader <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, who has called social security “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time”.</p>

  <p>These are challenging days for <strong>Florida</strong> governor <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>, the man who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/21/ron-desantis-republican-presidential-candidate-dropped-out-analysis">would have been king</a>. Barely two and a half years since his landslide re-election and anointment as “DeFuture” of the Republican party in a <a href="https://nypost.com/cover/november-9-2022/">fawning New York Post cover</a>, he stands isolated from the national political stage, feuding with his once blindingly loyal Florida legislature, and limping towards the finish line of his second term with an uncertain pathway beyond.</p> 
  <p>It has been, in the view of many analysts, a fall of stunning velocity and magnitude. And while few are willing to completely rule out a comeback for a 46-year-old politician who was the darling of the Republican hard right until he dared to challenge <strong>Donald Trump</strong> for his party’s 2024 presidential nomination, it is also clear that everything has changed.</p> 
  <p>“He’s completely crashed to the ground at this point and is certainly being treated like a more standard, average governor now,” said <strong>Aubrey Jewett</strong>, professor of political science at the <strong>University of Central <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida">Florida</a></strong>.</p> 
  <p>Jewett added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>He’s lost the ability to push things through. He’s lost that luster he had that at one time seemed like he could do no wrong in Republican conservative circles. He’s definitely come back down to earth and some of it is his own doing because if you govern with an autocratic style, that doesn’t usually make you a lot of allies.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>DeSantis’s once vise-like grip on Florida’s lawmakers has weakened, replaced by open dissent, bitter hostility and a <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/gop-infighting-in-tallahassee-gets-heated/3593755/">hurling of slurs</a> over a number of issues as the two Republican dominated legislative chambers try to reverse six years of passivity and reestablish themselves as a co-equal branch of government.</p> 
  <p>DeSantis, in the words of Republican House speaker <strong>Daniel Perez</strong>, has begun to tell “<a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/732753-bad-blood-daniel-perez-rips-ron-desantis-temper-tantrums-and-lies/">lies and stories that never happened</a>”, and has become increasingly prone to “temper tantrums”.</p>

  <p>Two Democrats on the <strong>US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</strong> who were fired by President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> in March will urge a federal judge in <strong>Washington</strong> to declare the move illegal on Tuesday, in the latest showdown over the limits of presidential power.</p> 
  <p><strong>Alvaro Bedoya</strong> and <strong>Rebecca Kelly Slaughter</strong> seek an order declaring their terminations unlawful and allowing them to resume their work at the agency, which enforces consumer protection and antitrust law, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>The case is one of several testing a 90-year-old supreme court precedent that shields independent agencies from direct <strong>White House</strong> control. A ruling overturning it could reverberate far and wide, shaking the independence of agencies that regulate road safety, stock markets, telecommunications and monetary policy.</p> 
  <p>Bedoya and Slaughter say their terminations on 18 March openly defied a law allowing the president to fire FTC commissioners only for good cause, such as neglecting their duties.</p> 
  <p>The supreme court upheld that law in the 1935 case <strong>Humphrey’s Executor v. US</strong>, after the last time a US president attempted to fire an FTC commissioner over a policy disagreement.</p> 
  <p><strong>Congress</strong> has the power to create agencies that serve legislative or judicial functions, and allowing the president to control those agencies violates the separation of powers, the supreme court ruled.</p> 
  <p>The Trump administration has argued Humphrey’s Executor does not apply to the current FTC, which gained the authority to sue in federal court to block mergers and seek financial penalties after the case was decided, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>As it now exists, the FTC should be considered part of the executive branch controlled by the president, not Congress, the administration has said.</p> 
  <p>Multiple courts have considered that argument and rejected it, saying the supreme court settled the matter, Slaughter and Bedoya said.</p> 
  <p>The FTC, now led by three Republicans, is structured so that no more than three of its five commissioners come from the same party.</p> 
  <p>The case is playing out at the same time as similar challenges by members of the <strong>Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPPB)</strong> and <strong>National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)</strong> who were fired by Trump.</p> 
  <p>The supreme court could rule at anytime on whether the Trump administration must reinstate the MSPB and NLRB members, while this case is being reviewed.</p>

  <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/jpmorgan">JP Morgan</a></strong>’s chief executive, <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong>, warned on Monday that investors were being too complacent as markets shook off news that the US has lost its last triple-A credit rating amid fresh concern over the federal government’s burgeoning debt pile.</p> 
  <p>Credit rating agency <strong>Moody’s</strong> dealt a blow to <strong>Washington</strong> on Friday when it stripped the US of its top-notch rating, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/18/us-credit-rating-downgrade-could-add-to-pressure-on-government-debt">downgrading</a> the world’s largest economy by one notch to AA1 and become becoming the last of the big three agencies to drop its triple-A rating for the US.</p> 
  <p>The announcement unnerved markets on Monday morning, but stock markets had recovered by the end of the day.</p> 
  <p>Speaking at JP Morgan’s annual investor day meeting in <strong>New York</strong>, Dimon warned against complacency. “We have huge deficits; we have what I consider almost complacent central banks. You all think they can manage all this. I don’t think [they can],” he said.</p> 
  <p>Dimon said he saw an “extraordinary amount of complacency” and added that he believes the possibility of stagflation – a recession with rising prices – was far higher than investors believe.</p> 
  <p>Moody’s downgrade came as <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a></strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/16/house-republicans-block-trump-spending-bill">struggles to push</a> his “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill through <strong>Congress</strong>, Moody’s said it expected the US budget deficit to keep rising.</p> 
  <p>“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” Moody’s said, announcing its downgrade. “We do not believe that material multi-year reductions in mandatory spending and deficits will result from current fiscal proposals under consideration.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump on Capitol Hill to meet Republicans amid effort to pass sweeping tax bill</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is expected to head to <strong>Capitol Hill</strong> on Tuesday to meet congressional Republicans as they aim to reach agreement on a sweeping tax-cut bill, with their narrow majority divided over the scope of spending cuts, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>Hardline Republicans in the <strong>US House of Representatives</strong> on Friday briefly blocked the advance of the bill – which nonpartisan analysts say could add $3tn to $5tn to the federal government’s $36.2tn debt – but relented on Sunday.</p> 
  <p>The bill would extend the 2017 tax cuts that were Trump’s signature first-term legislative achievement, and also add tax breaks on income from tips and overtime pay that were part of his populist push on the campaign trail.</p> 
  <p>According to Reuters, he is expected to try to unify the divided 220-213 House majority, including hardliners eager for deep spending cuts, moderates worried about protecting <strong>Medicaid</strong> and Republican lawmakers from coastal states eager to protect their constituents’ ability to deduct state and local taxes.</p> 
  <p>Republicans are looking to parliamentary maneuvres to bypass the objections of Democrats, who say the bill disproportionately benefits the wealthy and will take a deep bite out of social programs.</p> 
  <p>“I think he’ll urge people to get together and I think it’ll be an upbeat speech … I’m glad he’s coming,” said hardline Republican Representative <strong>Ralph Norman</strong> of <strong>South Carolina</strong>, one of the handful who voted against the bill on Friday.</p> 
  <p>House speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> aims to pass the measure by Thursday, before the Memorial Day holiday weekend, setting the stage for the <strong>Senate</strong> to take it up next month.</p> 
  <p>“I’m very optimistic we will find the right equilibrium point to get this bill delivered,” Johnson told reporters on Monday, even as he acknowledged that some thorny issues were unresolved.</p> 
  <p>Hanging over Republicans is a move by credit-ratings firm <strong>Moody’s</strong>, which last week stripped the US federal government of its top-tier credit rating. It cited multiple administrations and <strong>Congress</strong> failing to address the nation’s growing debt. The Republican-controlled Congress so far has not rejected any of Trump’s legislative requests.</p> 
  <p>If the House passes the bill, the Senate will have to labor to pass a partisan bill that could differ significantly from the House’s.</p> 
  <p>“It’s not going to happen overnight. But it should happen in a timely way,” Senate majority leader <strong>John Thune</strong> of <strong>South Dakota</strong> told reporters on Monday, according to Reuters.</p> 
  <p>Republicans control the Senate by a 53-47 margin and at least one conservative, Senator <strong>Josh Hawley</strong> of <strong>Missouri</strong>, has already stated reservations with the House’s Medicaid provisions.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Kennedy Center</strong> announced its lineup on Monday, which includes performances of “Chicago,” “Moulin Rouge” and “Back to the Future: The Musical.” The offerings for kids includes a theatrical version of the cartoon hit “Bluey”, reports the Associated Press (AP).<br><br>The center previously abandoned a week’s worth of July events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights as part of this summer’s <strong>World Pride festival</strong> in <strong>Washington</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>White House</strong> has further moved to cancel millions in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups. And <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s budget framework has proposed eliminating the <strong>National Endowment for the Arts</strong> and the <strong>National Endowment for the Humanities</strong> altogether.<br><br>According to the AP, Trump told the Kennedy Center dinner that congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250m for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center, and said that, over the past decade, “tremendous amounts of money” was spent there. “I don’t know where they spent it,” he said. “They certainly didn’t spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Richard Grenell</strong>, a Trump envoy for special missions who is interim head of the Kennedy Center, said a previous budget included “$26m in phantom revenue.” He suggested the behavior could be a criminal matter for prosecutors and that attorney general <strong>Pam Bondi</strong>, in addition to being on the center’s board, heard the details at a meeting earlier on Monday.<br><br>“She heard the details, and this is unacceptable,” Grenell said.<br><br>Trump said the center would raise funds but added of the building’s state that it’s “falling apart”. He said previous “programming was out of control with rampant political propaganda” and featured “some very inappropriate shows” including a “Marxist anti-police performance” and “Lesbian-only Shakespeare”.<br><br>“Who thinks of these ideas, really?” Trump cried, drawing loud laughs from those present, reports the AP.</p>

  <p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> hosted the <strong>Kennedy Center’s</strong> leadership at the <strong>White House</strong> on Monday night, reinforcing how much attention he is devoting to remaking a premier cultural center as part of a larger effort to overhaul the social and ideological dynamics of the national arts scene.<br><br>According to the Associated Press (AP), the meeting of the center’s board in the state dining room followed Trump firing its previous members and announcing in February that he would serve as the board’s chair. The new board, which unanimously approved Trump as its chair, is stocked with loyalists.</p> 
  <p>They include White House chief of staff <strong>Susie Wiles</strong>; attorney general <strong>Pam Bondi</strong>; <strong>Usha Vance</strong>, the wife of vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong>; and <strong>Lee Greenwood</strong>, whose song “God Bless the USA,” plays at Trump rallies as well as many official events, including during his trip to the <strong>Middle East</strong> last week. Trump called it a “hot board.”<br><br>“We’re gonna turn it around,” Trump told dinner attendees of the center. He said of running the board, “When I said, ‘I’ll do this,’ I hadn’t been there” and joked, “That’s the last time I’ll take a job without looking at it”.<br><br>Trump has called the center’s past programming “woke” and “terrible,” while more broadly seeking to slash federal funding for the arts – complaining that too much programming promotes leftist ideology and political correctness. In his view, molding the Kennedy Center to his own liking can go a long way toward creating a new arts and social culture nationwide, reports the AP.</p>

  <p>US representative <strong>LaMonica McIver</strong>, a Democrat, was charged with assaulting federal agents after a clash outside an immigration detention center in <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-jersey">New Jersey</a></strong>, the state’s federal prosecutor announced on Monday.</p> 
  <p><strong>Alina Habba</strong>, interim US attorney, said in a post on social media that McIver was facing charges “for assaulting, impeding and interfering with law enforcement” when she visited the detention center along with two other Democratic members of the New Jersey congressional delegation on 9 May.</p> 
  <p>“No one is above the law – politicians or otherwise,” Habba <a href="https://x.com/USAttyHabba/status/1924615111198576645">said in a statement</a>. “It is the job of this office to uphold justice impartially, regardless of who you are. Now we will let the justice system work.”</p> 
  <p>McIver on Monday accused federal law enforcement of escalating the situation, saying that it was the <strong>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)</strong> agents who “created an unnecessary and unsafe confrontation”.</p> 
  <p>“The charges against me are purely political – they mischaracterise and distort my actions, and are meant to criminalise and deter legislative oversight,” she said.</p> 
  <p>At the same time, Habba announced her office was dismissing a misdemeanor trespassing charge against <strong>Ras Baraka</strong>, the Democratic mayor of <strong>Newark</strong>, whose arrest instigated the clash with federal agents.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Demand Justice launches ad campaign to highlight Trump's attacks on the rule of law</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The left-learning advocacy group <strong>Demand Justice</strong> plans to undetake a six-figure advertising effort as part of a new campaign to highlight <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s continued attacks on the rule of law.</p> 
  <p>The adverting campaign, which will include online and print ads in national publications is part of a multi-pronged effort called “Justice Under Siege” will include polling, research, and educational initiatives focused on how the Trump administration is attacking the rule of law, a fundamental pillar of American society</p> 
  <p>“Since his inauguration, President Trump has repeatedly defied lawful court orders on issues ranging from illegally firing thousands of public servants to deporting lawful US residents without due process,” <strong>Maggie Jo Buchanan</strong>, the group’s executive director, said in a statement.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ll systematically document and expose this pattern of attacks on the rule of law, which is made even more alarming by congressional Republicans who aren’t just letting Trump get away with it, but actively participating through threats to defund courts, legislative stunts to take away the ability of the judiciary to check Trump’s overreach, and baseless impeachment efforts against judges whose rulings they disagree with.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The group <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/furor-trumps-targeting-law-firms-heats-court-fight-ad-campaign-rcna202570">has previously targeted major law firms</a> who capitulated to Trump with posters around <strong>Washington DC</strong> near the offices of the firms in the US capitol.</p> 
  <p>Since taking office in January, Trump’s attacks on the rule of law have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/judges-trump-court-rulings">brazen and unrelenting</a>.</p> 
  <p>He has openly defied court orders halting deportations, called for a federal judge who ruled against him to be impeached, issued executive orders punishing law firms connected to political rivals, and used the power of his office to revoke the security clearance and investigate officials who spoke out against him.</p> 
  <p>There have also been an alarming rise in threats and harassment against federal judges in recent months as the president has escalated his attacks.</p> 
  <p>There has been little pushback from Republicans to Trump’s actions. <strong>Chief Justice John Roberts</strong> spoke out in defense of judges in March,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/judges-trump-court-rulings"> saying</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate process exists for that purpose.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>, the newest member of the court and one of its liberal members, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/justice-kentanji-brown-jackson-criticizes-trumps-attacks-judges-rcna204359">said this month</a>that the attacks on judges “are not random.

 <h2 class="block-title">Qatar says plane offer for Trump is 'a normal thing between allies'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Qatar</strong>’s offer to give <strong>Donald Trump</strong> a $400m Boeing 747 airplane is a “normal thing that happens between allies,” prime minister <strong>Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani</strong> has said at an economic forum held in <strong>Doha</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Al Thani dismissed concerns about Qatar trying to buy influence with its key ally, after the Senate Democratic leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> introduced a bill on Monday that would prevent any foreign aircraft operating as <strong>Air Force One</strong> amid ethical and security concerns.</p> 
  <p>“I hope that the United States looks to Qatar as a reliable partner in diplomacy that is not trying to buy influence,” Al Thani said.</p> 
  <p>Trump has shrugged off worries, saying it would be “stupid” to turn down the generous offer. He said the Boeing 747-8 would eventually be donated to his presidential library – a repository housing research materials from his administration, and that he had no plans to use it for personal reasons after leaving office.</p> 
  <p><strong>White House</strong> press secretary <strong>Karoline Leavitt</strong> said on Monday that the aircraft “will be accepted according to all legal and ethical obligations.”</p> 
  <p>“Retrofitting the Qatari plane would cost billions and could never even truly eliminate all catastrophic risks,” Schumer <a href="https://x.com/SenSchumer/status/1924557976460816839">said on X</a>.<br><br>The bill would prevent the US from spending taxpayer dollars to retrofit a foreign-owned plane for presidential use.<br><br>“There’s absolutely no amount of modifications that can guarantee it will be secure,” Schumer added.</p>
