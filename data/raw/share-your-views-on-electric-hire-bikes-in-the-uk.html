<p>We want to find out more about your views and experiences on electric hire bikes. Are you a regular cyclist with a bike of your own, who can’t stand electric hire bikes for a host of strongly-felt reasons?</p> <p>Or are you an avid user ready to defend your kind, with criticisms of your own about pedal bikes? Or do you do both, and believe in a world of perfect intra-bike harmony? We would love to hear from you.</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="6ed438e5-08e4-4e52-8d48-e83cf6e5b562" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <h2><strong>This Community callout closed on 21 January 2025.</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>You can see the article that included respondents to this callout <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/15/please-dont-hit-me-battle-between-ebikers-and-other-cyclists">here</a>.</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>You can contribute to open Community callouts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-community-team">here</a> or Share a story <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/community/2015/sep/02/guardianwitness-send-us-a-story">here</a>.</strong></p></li> </ul>
