But this was all about Scheffler. What a performance. Is this already over? Not yet, too much can happen on any given major-championship Sunday. But in this form, and with a three-shot lead, it’s going to take something special to deny Scottie his third major tomorrow.

But Matthieu Pavon can’t make a similar escape, leaving a Texas wedge from the bottom of the bank well short, and that’s consecutive bogeys for the French star. Meanwhile Rory McIlroy is in the hutch with a 72. He ends the day at +2.

And on 17, Scottie Scheffler is never missing his birdie putt. All of a sudden, he’s just the second man to get to double figures this week, after Jhonattan Vegas, and his lead is two!</p> <p><em>-10: Scheffler (17)<br>-8: Noren (F)<br>-7: Riley (F), Poston (F), Kim (17), Vegas (16), Pavon (16)<br>-6: Rahm (F)<br>-5: Bradley (F), Finau (F), DeChambeau (F), Fitzpatrick (16)</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-682912218f088b79656bb143" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-17T22:50:49.011Z">11.50pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Scottie Scheffler is in total control of his game right now.</strong> A 7-iron pinged into 17.

The least he deserves for once again steadying himself after some early travails: since that bogey-bogey start, he’s not dropped a stroke and has now made his second birdie.

See also: Matt Fitzpatrick, who sends his tee shot at the generous par-four 14th onto the high bank to the right of the green. Worried about the water on the other side, he fluffs his first chip, then blades his second through the green.
