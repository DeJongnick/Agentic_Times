<p>Donald Trump has privately indicated he is on the verge of firing the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, rattling Wall Street and renewing questions over the US central bank’s independence.</p> <p>The US president insisted on Wednesday that it was “highly unlikely” he would dismiss the Fed chair, after reports he had suggested he would and shown a draft letter dismissing Powell to political allies.</p> <p>“I don’t rule out anything, but I think it’s highly unlikely. Unless he has to leave for fraud,” said Trump. The president has recently criticized Powell for a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/15/business/trump-says-fed-renovations-are-sort-of-a-fireable-offense">$2.5bn renovation</a> of the Fed’s buildings. “I mean it’s possible there’s fraud involved,” said Trump.</p> <p>Powell has reportedly asked the central bank’s inspector general to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/14/trump-powell-fed-renovations">review </a>the renovation.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly and publicly demanded the Fed cut interest rates to spur economic growth. Powell has so far declined, noting that Trump’s controversial rollout of tariffs has clouded the outlook for inflation.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/07/trump-federal-reserve-jerome-powell">Trump takes on the Fed – but he has little power over central bank, economists say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an interview with the Real America’s Voice network aired on Wednesday, Trump said he would love for Powell to resign but acknowledged that many have said it would disrupt the markets if the president were to remove him, Reuters reported. <strong><br></strong></p> <p>People present at the meeting with Trump expressed approval for Powell’s firing, CBS News <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-asked-gop-lawmakers-if-he-should-fire-jerome-powell-sources/">reported</a>.

The president responded by again calling on the Fed to cut rates, despite policymakers so far holding off primarily due to the threat of a resurgence in inflation.</p> <p>While the president has urged Powell to resign, and attacked him regularly on social media, he does not have the power to fire him over monetary policy. The supreme court <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/22/supreme-court-fed-powell-trump-00366526">signaled</a> in May that it viewed the Fed as legally protected.</p> <p>Trump initially nominated Powell to serve as Fed chair during his first term. Joe Biden then tapped him to stay on for another four years, until May 2026. Powell has repeatedly stated that he plans to do so.</p>
