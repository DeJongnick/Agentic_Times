<p>Rachel Reeves will announce her highly awaited spending review on Wednesday amid pressure on the government to invest in national security and public services and to reboot the UK economy.</p> <p>In what will be a defining policy announcement of the current parliament, the chancellor’s address to the Commons will outline Labour’s day-to-day spending plans for the next three years up to the next general election.</p> <p>Aiming to turn the page on a tough few months, amid bitter rows over cuts to disability benefits and winter fuel payments, Reeves will also allocate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/26/rachel-reeves-new-capital-investment-spending-review">a £113bn boost in capital funding</a> over the next four years.</p> <p>Here are five key charts that will underpin her decisions:</p> <h2>Health and defence</h2> <p>Wes Streeting’s health department is expected to be a big winner of the spending review, having agreed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/07/nhs-to-get-boost-over-three-years-at-expense-of-other-services-spending-review">2.8% real-terms rise</a> in annual day-to-day expenditure for the next three years, amounting to £30bn a year extra by 2028.</p> <p>Defence will also receive a substantial boost to meet Keir Starmer’s promise to spend 2.5% of national income on the military by 2027, on the path towards his “ambition” to hit 3% in the next parliament.</p> <p>The increase for defence will, however, be historically unusual, and will have consequences for spending decisions elsewhere. Military spending has been in steady retreat since the 1950s in a “peace dividend” that allowed for higher spending on other priorities.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/d39pk/2/" data-alt="Charts showing spending on social security, health and defence since the 1960s"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/d39pk/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>However, that trend will go into reverse at a time when pressure is also rising to increase NHS and welfare spending, reflecting the UK’s ageing population.</p> <h2>Austerity?</h2> <p>Reeves set out her plans for total spending – known as the “spending envelope” – at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/30/rachel-reeves-goes-back-to-the-future-with-a-tax-and-spend-budget">October budget</a>, for day-to-day departmental budgets up to 2028-29, and for capital budgets for a further year.</p> <p>The plan involved an increase in departmental budgets of 1.2% a year on average over three years, after taking inflation into account. Capital spending will rise by 1.3% on average in real terms over four years.</p> <p>Reeves will be able to argue that real-terms growth in total spending fulfils a manifesto promise of “no return to austerity”, compared with the 2010s when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/budget-2010-vat-austerity-plan">George Osborne oversaw deep cuts</a>.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/43Jbt/2/" data-alt="Charts showing changes in public service spending"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/43Jbt/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>However, the plans are less generous than under recent Tory and Labour governments. Large settlements this time around in some areas – including health and defence – also mean less money for others, implying a likely squeeze on resources for some departments.</p> <h2>Large infrastructure projects</h2> <p>Reeves has sought to highlight £113bn in extra capital spending, funded through borrowing after changes to her fiscal rules at the autumn budget, as a means to draw a clear dividing line between Labour and the Tories.</p> <p>The plans for investment in long-term projects – including roads, hospitals, social housing and other infrastructure – are significantly more generous than the ones set out by her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/RS794/2/" data-alt="Charts showing levels of capital spending"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/RS794/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The increase is, however, front-loaded – meaning faster growth in investment earlier in the parliament. Raising defence spending to 2.5% of GDP is also expected to be highly capital-intensive. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has warned capital budgets elsewhere could fall as a result.</p> <p>Reeves has, though, announced funding for several new capital projects, including support for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station-ed-miliband-investment">Sizewell C through £14.2bn of government investment in nuclear power</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/04/rachel-reeves-unveils-15bn-for-trams-trains-and-buses-outside-london">£15bn for trains, trams and buses outside London</a>.</p> <h2>Rising borrowing costs</h2> <p>Borrowing costs for governments have risen sharply in the past year, reflecting investor worries over Donald Trump’s erratic trade wars, persistently high inflation and elevated debt levels.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EGYAP/2/" data-alt="Chart showing UK government borrowing costs compared with the US and Germany"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/EGYAP/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In the UK there is particular concern over weak economic growth and the sustainability of Reeves’s tax and spending plans. The chancellor has pledged to stick to her “iron-clad” fiscal rule, despite pressure to mend public services and raise spending on defence.</p> <p>Bond market investors will be watching Reeves closely, after a rise in the yield – in effect the interest rate – on long-term UK government debt to 5.2%.</p> <p>“The upcoming spending review will be critical for the government’s efforts to prop up market confidence, given the tight fiscal situation,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a note to clients.</p> <h2>Autumn budget speculation</h2> <p>As the spending review does not come alongside a budget – for the first time since Gordon Brown was chancellor in 2000 – there will be no tax decisions and the Office for Budget Responsibility will not publish a verdict.</p> <p>However, economists think higher borrowing costs and sluggish economic growth risk wiping out the chancellor’s “headroom” against her main fiscal target to balance day-to-day spending with tax receipts.</p> <p>This could pave the way for months of scrutiny and speculation before the chancellor’s autumn budget. Reeves will face tough decisions. Tax as a share of GDP is at historic levels, while Labour made a manifesto promise not to raise income tax, VAT or employee national insurance.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/DCW64/2/" data-alt="Chart showing levels of tax and public spending since the 1940s"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/DCW64/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“Undeniably, the spending review will likely leave the chancellor with a tricky autumn budget to navigate,” said Sanjay Raja, the chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank.</p> <p>“Tax rises look a near certainty. And pressure to reform the chancellor’s fiscal framework will only increase from here on out.”</p>
