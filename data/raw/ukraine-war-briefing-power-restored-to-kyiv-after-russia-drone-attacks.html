Images posted online showed firefighters working to tackle burning blocks of flats. Hrynchuk did not say how many people had lost power. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the <strong>Russian strikes targeted civilian and energy infrastructure</strong> as Ukraine prepares for winter temperatures.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russian drones and missiles damaged 12 apartment buildings in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, </strong>killing a seven-year-old boy and injuring four people, according to the regional governor.

Rybakov made the comments during the week after Donald Trump hardened his line towards Russia. Putin, Russia’s president, said on Friday: “These are complex issues that require further consideration. But we remain committed to the discussion that took place in Anchorage.” An aide to Putin said contacts with Washington were continuing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>“Fair use” of frozen Russian assets </strong>for Ukraine’s defence and rebuilding was discussed between the European Central Bank president, Christine Lagarde, and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday. “There are solutions for how this can be done,” said Ukraine’s president, calling for more political will in Europe to do it. “We are getting closer to a decision on the assets, and I thank everyone who is helping.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Melania Trump said on Friday that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/melania-trump-ukrainian-children-reunited-families">eight Ukrainian children had been reunited with their families</a></strong> after contact with Vladimir Putin.
