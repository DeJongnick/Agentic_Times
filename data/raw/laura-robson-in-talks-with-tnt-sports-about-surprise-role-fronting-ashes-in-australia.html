<p>Laura Robson is in talks with TNT Sports about a surprise role fronting their live coverage of the Ashes from Australia this winter.</p> <p>The junior Wimbledon champion and mixed doubles Olympic silver medallist has made a successful transition to broadcasting since her premature retirement from tennis three years ago, working as a pundit for both TNT and Sky Sports, but England’s tour to Australia would be her first major TV job outside tennis.</p> <p>TNT is understood to have offered Robson an on-the-ground reporting role throughout the five-match series, with its main commentary and punditry being provided off-site in Europe. The 31-year-old was born in Melbourne to Australian parents before moving to England at the age of six.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/11/worcestershire-v-nottinghamshire-surrey-v-warwickshire-and-more-county-cricket-day-four-live">Leicestershire promoted, Surrey v Warwickshire and more: county cricket, day four – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robson has combined tennis punditry with senior roles in administration since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/16/former-junior-wimbledon-champion-laura-robson-retires-at-28-tennis">retiring due to the wrist and hip injuries</a> that troubled her throughout her career. After two years as the tournament director of the WTA 250 event at Nottingham she was appointed to the same position at the Queen’s Club this year, taking charge of the first women’s tournament at the London venue in over 50 years.</p> <p>TNT is expected to use a combination of Robson’s colour and reportage from Australia, the local commentary feed and their own pundits in the studio for its coverage of the series, the third Ashes tour in succession it or its predecessor BT Sport has covered live.</p> <p>Robson was used as a courtside reporter by Sky at this month’s US Open and was live on air before last Sunday’s final when Donald Trump’s arrival in Arthur Ashe Stadium led to boos from the crowd.</p> <p>Alastair Cook is being lined up to provide expert punditry from the studio as the former England captain is not due to travel to Australia with the BBC’s Test Match Special, with the TNT regular Kate Mason expected to present. While contracts have yet to be signed the negotiations are understood to be progressing well. TNT declined to comment.</p> <p>After agreeing a one-year deal with Cricket Australia TNT has the rights for all of England’s winter tours, as the broadcaster had deals in place to cover both white-ball series in New Zealand and Sri Lanka either side of the Ashes.</p>
