<p>It may seem as if <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/four-tet">Four Tet</a>’s Kieran Hebden is arriving late to the country music party but, rest assured, this is not a case of uncharacteristic bandwagon-jumping. For one, the roots of this collaboration with former Lambchop guitarist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/mar/03/william-tyler-grief-alcoholism-david-berman-time-indefinite">William Tyler</a> date back to 2020; for two, the pair’s new album doubles as a paean to the 1980s Americana Hebden’s dad played round the house when he was a kid (the record is named after his childhood home in south-west London) – music that Tyler’s Nashville songwriter father was professionally involved in.</p>    <p>Yet despite that neat backstory, the evocative title and the fact it begins with a reworking of country mainstay Lyle Lovett’s beautiful and sweetly bizarre 1987 track <a href="https://youtu.be/-sKJ3_P7X3E">If I Had a Boat</a>, 41 Longfield Street Late ‘80s is not an overtly nostalgic album, or a particularly coherent one. The retro country influence rarely fuses with Hebden’s soporific synths and brain-scouring bursts of distortion: the aforementioned opener kicks off with a drone that wavers in intensity like the circling of a benevolent alien spacecraft, practically drowning out Tyler’s faithful rendition of Lovett’s soothingly lovely guitar work. Then <a href="https://youtu.be/cE7yl_HXOmk">Spider Ballad</a> combines pointillist synths with an insistent bassline, while the dreamlike Loretta Guides My Hands Through the Radio layers studio chatter and instrument tuning.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Kieran Hebden and William Tyler: 41 Longfield Street Late ’80s">  <iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/481bf9qdap2XkqmAxdVVZG?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Tyler’s guitar does return: melded with chimes on Timber, and on closer Secret City, a swirl of ethereal synths and meditative strumming. An attempt to resurrect the good old days and/or boys this is not, but Tyler and Hebden have managed to provide a fresh if slightly disjointed take on formative inspiration.</p>
