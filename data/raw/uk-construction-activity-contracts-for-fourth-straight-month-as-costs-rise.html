<p>UK building companies have suffered a poor start to the year, with activity contracting for a fourth month in a row in April as new work dried up while cost pressures remained high, according to an industry survey.</p> <p>Construction firms continued to struggle after two years of depressed activity that industry executives had expected would end with Labour’s election victory last July.</p> <p>A bounce back in the final three months of 2024 fizzled out as the outlook for the sector became clouded by political uncertainty and rising costs. </p> <p>Concerns about the impact of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">Donald Trump’s import tariffs</a> held up decision-making in the commercial sector, while delays in Whitehall over what large-scale construction projects to support before the government spending review due on 11 June reduced activity in civil engineering, industry experts said.</p> <p>S&amp;P Global said its construction purchasing managers’ index edged slightly higher to 46.6 from 46.4 in March but remained well below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction.</p> <p>The report said: “Construction companies widely noted that heightened business uncertainty and worries about the broader UK economic outlook had weighed on client demand.”</p> <p>Housebuilding activity declined but at a slower rate than other sectors.</p> <p>Tim Moore, an economics director at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said: “Commercial construction was a weak spot and lost momentum since March.</p> <p>“Output decreased at the fastest pace for nearly five years amid reports of greater risk aversion among clients and a wait-and-see approach to major spending decisions.”</p> <p>He said survey respondents commented on rising prices paid for a range of raw materials, as well as efforts by suppliers to pass on greater payroll costs.</p> <p>Companies said they expected an improvement in the year ahead, “with a number of survey respondents citing the prospect of a turnaround in workloads across the residential building segment”.</p> <p>According to industry figures from the data provider Glenigan, a recovery in housebuilding is already under way. It said that residential projects under £100m in size were 24% higher in the three months to April than in the preceding quarter.</p> <p>Private housing construction activity rose by 22% on a quarterly basis and 29% when compared with the year before.</p> <p>Social housing construction activity grew by 29% from the previous quarter but was only 3% higher than the same point in 2024.</p> <p>Brian Smith, the head of cost management and commercial at the engineering company AECOM, said he expected to see activity and order levels continue to recover through the summer.</p> <p>He said a lack of clarity about how major projects will be funded remained an issue that ministers needed to resolve.</p> <p>Smith added: “Next month’s spending review is a real opportunity for policymakers to set out a clear roadmap for public-private partnerships that draw in private investment to provide the much-needed backing for large-scale projects.”</p> <p>In the eurozone, the construction sector also remained in decline in April, while the pace of contraction slowed.</p> <p>The eurozone construction PMI from Hamburg Commercial Bank showed a rise in the headline index to 46 in April from 44.8 in March.</p> <p>New orders fell at a slightly slower rate and many companies cut jobs and purchasing. Price pressures picked up to a 15-month high, although they remained well below the long-run average.</p>
