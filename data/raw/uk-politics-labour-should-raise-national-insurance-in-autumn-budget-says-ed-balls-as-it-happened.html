Although Balls now works as a broadcaster and podcaster, he is still seen as one of the leading economic thinkers in Labour politics, having worked for years as Gordon Brown’s chief adviser, served in cabinet, and then held the Treasury brief in Ed Miliband’s shadow cabinet.</p> <p>Discussing how the government could raise the revenue it needs, in particular to fill the £6bn financial hole caused by two recent U-turns, Balls said he thought the government should raise national insurance. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I would do employees’ national insurance, and I would also do a penny on corporation tax - or 2p - and at the same time do an enterprise, capital gains tax-style cut for people growing their businesses.</p> </blockquote> <p>Balls said he did not think the government would raise income tax, and he said he could not see how the government would “get out of this now” without raising one of the two other big tax levers available to the Treasury, national insurance and VAT.</p> <p>In its manifesto Labour promised not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT – the main taxes imposed on workers. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, did raise employer national insurance, but she argued that this did not breach the manifesto pledge because it is paid by firms, not their workers.</p> <p>Raising employee national insurance would be a definite breach of the manifesto. At PMQs on Wednesday Keir Starmer said he would stick to the manifesto tax commitments.</p> <p>Balls argued this was the wrong approach. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It’s much better to be open and level with people and ask everybody to make a contribution, because we need to have strong public finances and to invest in public services, and I would say, to bring child poverty down as well. But you can’t do that while sticking with manifesto commitments which box you in too hard… </p> <p>[Reeves and Starmer have] got to open up about what’s happened and what they’re now going to do, and blaming their backbenchers, or trying to say that they’re sticking to the letter of a manifesto commitment they’re actually breaking, is the wrong strategy. </p> </blockquote> <p>Balls has argued that the pre-election tax pledges went too far in ruling out tax increases a Labour government might find essential. In his podcast he said the government should have warned the public earlier this year that some of those pledges would have to be broken. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>They never prepared the ground for the degree of the squeeze on the public finances, which was coming over the years ahead … They could have opened the books [after the election] and said, there is a huge problem in our public services, which is going to require us to be honest with you about the scale of what needs to be done on taxation.</p> <p>They could have used the Trump presidency and the tariff shock and the big downgrades to global growth to say, ‘look, we suddenly have greater pressures on our defence spending, but the economy is going to slow this year because of the tariff shock, and therefore we need now to reconsider our fiscal position.’</p> <p>But having used none of those opportunities, they’re now in a position where, in July, looking forward to the budget, the framing is that they’re going to have to raise taxes to sort out a fiscal gap not caused by long term growth, or failure to make big, long term fiscal decisions by the previous government or Donald Trump – but because of their U-turns, and that is a bad place for them to be.</p> </blockquote> <p>Balls has often used his podcast to to make relatively critical comments about the the government’s economic strategy. Quite what impact this has had on relations between his wife, Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, and her Treasury colleagues remains something of a mystery.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-11T15:14:06.379Z">at 4.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68711d3a8f088b778dd2948b" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-11T14:27:02.953Z">3.27pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Cutting immigration is a big Conservative priority at the moment, but that did not stop <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> performing a ceremony to mark the opening of a new arrivals terminal at London Stansted airport.</p> <p>The airport is in Badenoch’s North West Essex constituency, and Badenoch spoke about the impact, positive and negative, it had on her constituents.

Middle England feels about ISAs the same way rural America feels about guns.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6870d29d8f087b4c6c061686" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-11T09:03:11.287Z">10.03am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Cooper says people with links to UK will be prioritised when migrants are picked for admission from France</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The government will prioritise people with a connection with the UK when deciding which asylum seekers to accept from France, in return for small boat arrivals being returned, <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong> said this morning.</p> <p>Asked how the government would select the 50 or so migrants from France expected to be brought to the UK every week under the scheme, the home secretary told LBC:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In terms of people applying to come to the UK, we’ve said that priority will be given to people who have a connection to the UK, people who are most likely to be genuine refugees or have been targeted by the smuggling gangs as well. </p> <p>But this is a pilot, and we will develop it over time, but that principle, that fundamental change is really important.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6870d1be8f081d583e50c508" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-11T08:59:22.695Z">9.59am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Returns deal will involve some people arriving on small boats being detained, Cooper says</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Yvette Cooper</strong> has confirmed that the returns agreement with France will involve some small boat arrivals being detained prior to removal.</p> <p>Speaking on the Today programme, she said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We will be detaining people certainly as the pilot is introduced and as the programme becomes operationalised.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked to clarify who would be detained, she added: “Those will be operational decisions and we will update people on those as we roll the programme out.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6870ceb78f087b4c6c06165f" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-11T08:54:22.706Z">9.54am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Cooper declines to say how many people will be returned under deal with France, but says numbers expected to go up</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In her interviews this morning <strong>Yvette Cooper,</strong> the home secretary, declined to say how many people arriving in the UK on small boats would be returned to France under the deal announced yesterday.</p> <p>It has been widely reported that the pilot will start with 50 people a week being returned – although this figure has not been officially confirmed.</p> <p>Cooper did not challenge the claim that 50 a week would be the starting piont, but she stressed that the “ultimate numbers” were not fixed.

Keir Starmer notched up a notable achievement yesterday – by agreeing a pilot returns agreement with France, something never managed by his immediate Conservative predecessors. But, as <strong>Kiran Stacey</strong> and<strong> Jessica Elgot</strong> report in their analysis, there was some Tory precedent for the policy. When Robert Jenrick was immigration minister, he tried, and failed, to get Rishi Sunak to negotiate a deal of this kind.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/10/robert-jenrick-migrant-returns-advice-finally-heeded-labour-pm">Robert Jenrick’s migrant returns advice is finally heeded – by a Labour PM</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yesterday <strong>Jenrick</strong>, who is now shadow justice secretary and seen as a likely replacement for Kemi Badenoch before the next election, told GB News that the Starmer scheme “hasn’t got a cat in hell’s chance of working” because the numbers involved were too small. The key Tory papers, like the<a href="https://x.com/Lou_obrien19/status/1943423256725541194"> Daily Mail</a>, the <a href="https://x.com/Lou_obrien19/status/1943423136365711709">Daily Express</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Lou_obrien19/status/1943412433743163771">Daily Telegraph</a>, are fiercely critical. But, nevertheless, this is a win for Starmerism. The PM regularly argues that calm, sensible cooperation with allies can pay off, and now he has that the returns deal with Emmanuel Macron can achieve this.</p> <p>In politics good news never lasts for long and the headline lines this morning is about the economy shrinking in May. <strong>Graeme Wearden</strong> has the details on his businesss live blog.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jul/11/uk-gdp-economy-may-growth-stock-markets-trump-trade-war-business-live-news-updates">Rachel Reeves say GDP figures ‘are disappointing’ after UK economy shrinks for second month in a row – business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is a setback because Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, have made boosting growth their number one priority. Graeme is covering the reaction to this.</p> <p>I will be focusing on the reaction to the returns deal. <strong>Yvette Coope</strong>r, the home secretary, has been doing an interview round this morning. She dismissed claims that the EU would try to block the arrangement, but she was less forthcoming about how many migrants might actually be returned to France, saying the numbers had not been fixed. And she declined to say whether Macron was right to say at the press conference with Starmer yesterday when he said Brexit had made it harder for the UK to deal with illegal migration. </p> <p>In comments that have infuriated the pro-Brexit papers, <strong>Macron</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Many people explained that Brexit would make it more possible to fight effectively against illegal migration But since Brexit the UK has no illegal migration agreement with the EU … That creates an incentive to make the crossing, the precise opposite of what Brexit promised.</p> <p>The British people were sold a lie, which was that [migration] was a problem with Europe. With your government, we’re pragmatic, and for the first time in nine years we are providing a response.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked on Sky News if Macron had a point, <strong>Cooper</strong> replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think what I’ve seen happen is that the way that the criminal smuggler gangs operate is that they will weaponise anything that is happening. And so what we saw in the run-up to Brexit being implemented was we saw criminal gangs promising people that they had to cross quickly, and they had to pay money to the smuggler gangs quickly in order to be able to cross in time before Brexit happened.</p> <p>As soon as Brexit happened, they then said ‘Oh, well, now you’ve got to pay us money, because this means you can’t be returned because the Dublin Agreement isn’t in place’.</p> <p>So the thing about the criminal smuggler gangs is whatever arrangements are in place, they will use them in order to make money, but that’s why we have to be fundamentally undermining their model.</p> </blockquote> <p>I will post more from the Cooper interviews soon.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> MPs debate backbench bills, starting with Linsey Farnsworth’s unauthorised entry to football matches bill.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>Lunchtime:</em> Keir Starmer is hosting a cabinet awayday, reportedly at Chequers.</p> <p>And Kemi Badenoch is on a visit in her constituency, North West Essex, today.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media.
