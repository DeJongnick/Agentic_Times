<p>Morning everyone. As the Albanese government prepares to push through its bill stripping non-citizens of natural justice in readiness for deportation, refugee lawyers are warning it could apply to up to 80,000 people.</p> 
<p>The neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell is due to face court today after being charged last night with violent disorder in Melbourne.</p> 
<p>Plus: more than half of federal politicians’ own multiple properties, and there’s outrage as Abba fail to make Sweden’s “cultural canon”.</p>
