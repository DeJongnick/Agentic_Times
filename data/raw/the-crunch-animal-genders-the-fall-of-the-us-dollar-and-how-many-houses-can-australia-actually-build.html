<p>Hello and welcome to another edition of The Crunch!</p> <p>In this week’s newsletter we have charts on what makes someone <strong>cool</strong>, <strong>animal genders</strong> in children’s books, and a very <strong>bad year for the US dollar</strong>.</p> <h2>But first … how many homes can Australia actually build?</h2> <p>This week it emerged that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/14/jim-chalmers-defends-labor-housing-targets-after-treasury-briefing-information-released-to-abc">Treasury has doubts</a> about the Australian government achieving its ambitious target to build 1.2m new homes over five years.</p> <p>That is a big number, but how does it compare to what we were likely to have managed anyway? Our latest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/16/can-australia-reach-its-2029-housing-construction-target-data-shows-were-already-falling-behind">One Big Chart</a> shows the 1.2m target is significantly more than Australia has managed to build over a five-year period in the past few decades.</p>    <p>And it’s not just that the target is ambitious – construction data shows we are already falling behind the required rate. This is something we <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2025/apr/16/abs-housing-construction-data-labor-target-estimated-demand">highlighted earlier this year</a>.</p> <h2>Four charts from the fortnight</h2> <p>***</p> <p><strong>1. A devastating heatwave</strong></p> <p>Europe’s “early summer” heatwave has set records across the continent. The Financial Times ($) has put together <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6390eb2c-6415-4a53-bcfa-ea086dc2ef02">some truly terrifying maps</a> showing not just the extreme heat, but also low river flows affecting much of the EU.</p>    <p>As many as 2,300 people across 12 European cities died as a result of the June heatwaves, according to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/09/europe-june-heatwave-study-climate-breakdown-tripled-death-toll">reporting from our UK colleagues</a>. Two-thirds of the heat deaths in London were attributable to climate change.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>2. What makes someone cool?</strong></p> <p>It’s a question <s>we’ve been asking our whole lives</s> academics have attempted to answer with a series of experiments over a number of years, and in several countries. The study found that many of the traits associated with cool people – such as extroversion and adventurousness – are stable across different countries.</p>    <p>This is just one of the very nerdy charts you can find in the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0001799">journal article</a>.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>3. Line goes down</strong></p> <p>We’ve featured a couple of US dollar line charts since Donald Trump’s inauguration, but <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/03/2025/the-us-dollar-is-on-track-for-its-worst-year-in-modern-history">this one</a> from Semafor a couple of weeks back is the cherry on top.</p>    <p>The dollar was already down 7% and on track for its worst year in modern history. Must be tired of all the winning.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>4. Gendered presumptions</strong></p> <p>The Pudding, one of our favourite websites, has an incredible <a href="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/">deep dive into animal gender in children’s books</a>. It looks like an absolutely mammoth project, analysing hundreds of books as well as surveying 1,300 people.</p> <p>There are wonderful charts like this below – showing only a few animals are consistently gendered female – as well as a searchable interactive.</p>    <p>“In the children’s books, male animal characters appeared twice as often as female characters. Male pronouns appeared nearly three times as often in the survey results – particularly striking because there were more women respondents.”</p> <p>We really encourage you to read (and see) the rest <a href="https://pudding.cool/2025/07/kids-books/">here</a>.</p> <h2>Spotlight on … climate change and disasters</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01737-w">Accelerating increase in the duration of heatwaves under global warming</a> – Nature Geoscience</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/chart-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-blows-us-emissions-goal-by-7bn-tonnes/">Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’ blows US emissions goal by 7bn tonnes</a> – Carbon Brief</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/graphic-detail/2025/07/07/why-was-the-flooding-in-texas-so-deadly">Why was the flooding in Texas so deadly?</a> – The Economist ($)</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2025-07/hitze-europa-hoechsttemperaturen-vergleich-daten">Hier ist die Hitze am extremsten</a> (Here is where the heat is most extreme) – Die Zeit ($)</p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CLIMATE-CHANGE/URBAN-HEAT/byvrejywdpe/">The floor is lava</a> – Reuters</p></li> </ul> <h2>Off the Charts</h2> <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/23/magazine/ai-art-artists-illustrator.html">This piece</a> by Christoph Niemann in the New York Times Magazine is something in between an interactive, an animation and a comic.
