<h1>The more James Gunn’s Superman is a hit, the more the right will want its own Dean Cain of steel</h1>

<p>It’s almost impossible to divide superheroes along political lines. Captain America might seem like a patriotic, commie-bashing lunatic, as he was in the 1950s comics during the McCarthy era, until you remember that he has also spent much of his fictional career telling corrupt government agencies to shove it. And, in the Marvel Comic Universe, at least, he went on the run rather than sign up for an authoritarian superhero registry. Superman was once the square-jawed poster boy for US exceptionalism, cheerfully posing on propaganda comic covers urging readers to buy war bonds, but he’s also been written as a Kansas farm boy so suspicious of concentrated power that in one storyline he renounced his citizenship to avoid being used as a pawn of US foreign policy.</p> <p>Bar a few outliers – Iron Man cheerleading the military-industrial complex in his earliest comics springs to mind – trying to pin a superhero to one side of the political spectrum is like trying to staple fog: most of DC and Marvel’s big beasts will drift wherever the story, or the writer’s mortgage payments, takes them. Which is why it’s been so bizarre watching the right’s disgust as a vaguely woke man of steel drives all before him at the summer box office.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn">James Gunn’s Superman</a> passed the half-billion-dollar mark globally this week, which hardly means we’re looking at a film to mirror the success of the early comic book movie era – Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice somehow made $874m, for chrissakes – but does at least indicate that audiences quite like this new, down-to-earth, kindly and human take on Kal-El. Gunn is now producing next Wonder Woman. </p>    <p>Meanwhile, on the dystopian side of the news cycle, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/07/former-superman-actor-dean-cain-reveals-hes-becoming-an-ice-agent-to-support-trumps-mass-deportation-agenda">Dean Cain has declared himself primed and ready to join Donald Trump’s Ice agency</a>. Cain (Kal-El in 90s TV series Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/10/former-superman-actor-dean-cain-says-new-james-gunn-movie-is-woke">only recently declared his horror at how “woke” </a>the new David Corenswet Supes has turned out to be. Are these two things connected? Is Cain trying to make the point that a real “superman” would be standing at America’s borders, demanding paperwork from asylum seekers and Frisbeeing their lunch into the nearest bin, rather than attempting to stop evil invaders from terrorising a rival nation (as Corenswet does in Superman)?</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Is there an alternative reality where filmgoers queue around the block to watch Captain Constitution?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It’s almost as if, in the absence of the kind of superhero movies Cain would like to see muscle their way into multiplexes, the actor sees it as his patriotic duty to bring hard-border fiction into reality. If the 74 million who voted for Trump don’t want these woke Marvel and DC superhero movies, and would really rather see films in which caped crusaders defend gated communities against suspiciously accented delivery drivers, isn’t Hollywood missing a trick? Isn’t there – somewhere – a gap in the market, or perhaps an alternative reality – <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_45">Earth 45?</a> Earth-Fox News? – where filmgoers queue around the block to watch Captain Constitution and the Stand Your Ground Squad, and the Hollywood trades wax lyrical about a new blockbuster era of paranoia and punitive zoning laws?</p> <p>The right has tried this already, of course. Cain was also pretty upset about Disney’s recent “woke” Snow White remake, perhaps because the princess didn’t spend the runtime pining for a man or whistling while she ironed. And so was conservative media outfit the Daily Wire, which at the height of the backlash against Rachel Zegler’s casting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq9bYTFf6ts">made a trailer for a then-forthcoming rival film titled Snow White and the Evil Queen</a>.</p> <p>Plot details were thin on the ground, but presumably involved the heroine abandoning woodland animals for a concealed-carry permit and learning the value of hard work by running her own small business into the ground without government subsidies. We’ll never really know because the film <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2025/01/controversial-snow-white-remake-scrapped-after-lead-actress-departs-ab1/">appears to have been quietly cancelled</a>, leaving a potential audience of millions bereft of the chance to see what happens when you trade magic mirrors for voter ID checkpoints.</p>    <p>Perhaps the lesson here is that it’s just really difficult to make dreamy-eyed fantasy flicks that double as Breitbart comment threads. And it’s not just superhero movies that would creak under the strain. Imagine Star Wars if rebellions were built not on hope but on stricter border controls and mandatory midichlorian checks. Would The Lord of the Rings have really been quite the same if all those ’orrible orcs and trolls had been replaced on the battlefield by desperate migrants trying to reach the Shire, being enthusiastically biffed by an over-xcited Aragorn and Gimli counting down the number of “illegals” they just tonked? </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/11/sorry-dean-cain-of-course-superman-is-woke-he-fights-injustice">Sorry, Dean Cain – of course Superman is woke, he fights injustice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sooner or later, someone’s going to make a superhero film or TV series that gives the Maga crowd everything: a caped crusader who fights windfarms, sues the Daily Planet for libel and pays for everything in gold bullion or crypto. (The Boys got close at times: Homelander is basically what happens when you cross Captain America with a Trump rally and a gallon of unpasteurised milk, but he was hardly a hero – and perhaps that’s the point.)</p> <p>Until then, the culture warriors will have to settle for grumbling about <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/03/entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-controversy-blake-cec">woke elves</a> and <a href="https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/if-she-be-worthy/259582">lady Thor</a> while the rest of us watch Superman save the world from the nastiest supervillains in the universe without checking anyone’s passport.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 8 August 2025 to remove text which suggested that James Gunn was hired to write Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow and Clayface. In fact Gunn was a producer on those films.</p>
