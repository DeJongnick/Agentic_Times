<p>Sellers of fake Botox jabs could be jailed for up to two years, the UK’s medicine watchdog has warned, as it increases efforts to track down those flouting the law.</p> <p>The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it is cracking down on the trade of unlicensed botulinum toxin products after a spate of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/18/uk-health-officials-issue-warning-cosmetic-jabs-botulism">botulism cases across England</a> thought to be linked to them.</p> <p>In total, 41 people are thought to have been affected by the potentially fatal condition between 4 June and 6 August 2025. Botulism affects the nervous system and can cause paralysis if left untreated, <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/botulism/">according to the NHS</a>.</p> <p>The MHRA says it hopes to drive up awareness that anyone caught selling or supplying unlicensed botulinum toxin faces up to two years in prison and unlimited fines, as <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/1916/regulation/46">set out in the Human Medicines Regulations 2012</a>, and is deploying more resources to crack down on those breaking the law.</p> <p>“Criminals are exploiting the popularity of cosmetic treatments by peddling dangerous, unlicensed products, putting profit before safety,” said Andy Morling, the head of the MHRA’s criminal enforcement unit.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2025/aug/17/the-guardian-view-on-regulating-cosmetic-procedures-rogue-operators-must-be-tackled-but-arent-the-only-problem">The Guardian view on regulating cosmetic procedures: rogue operators must be tackled, but aren’t the only problem | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Anyone involved in the supply of unlicensed botulinum toxin – whether through organised networks or informal sales from kitchen tables, hair salons or via social media – is breaking the law and endangering lives. The 41 individuals we’ve seen between June and August left seriously ill represent the devastating human cost of this trade.</p> <p>“We are working across the country to identify those responsible, seize illegal products, and bring cases to court. We use the full range of our enforcement powers and techniques to shut down these operations and bring offenders to justice.”</p> <p>The move follows previous warnings by the watchdog for consumers to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/18/uk-health-officials-issue-warning-cosmetic-jabs-botulism">take care when seeking cosmetic </a>injections to ensure a qualified person is carrying them out and using the correct jabs.</p> <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/06/clapdown-wild-west-cosmetic-treatments-liquid-brazilian-butt-lifts">ministers announced plans</a> that will mean clinics will need to be licensed by their local authority to offer anti-wrinkle injections and fillers – and must meet strict standards to obtain such authorisation.</p> <p>The MHRA says that since May 2023, its criminal enforcement unit, working with Border Force, has seized more than 4,700 vials of unlicensed botulinum toxin, with most products originating in South Korea.</p> <p>Among the products seized is Innotox – a Botox-like medication that is not licensed for use in the UK, and is being sold illegally online. The situation is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/10/diy-botox-like-injection-innotox-available-illegally-online-warning">causing concern among experts</a>, who say Innotox’s liquid formulation has resulted in some people attempting DIY injections – a risky approach they warn can lead to eyelid droops, infections, tissue damage and even botulism.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/06/pain-was-unbearable-agonising-cost-cowboy-cosmetic-surgery">‘The pain was unbearable’: the agonising cost of England’s ‘cowboy’ cosmetic clinics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aenone Harper-Machin, a consultant plastic surgeon and spokesperson for the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons (Bapras), said she welcomed the MHRA’s “decisive action” against the illegal supply and use of unlicensed botulinum toxin products.</p> <p>“These recent cases of serious illness linked to illicit treatments highlight the urgent need to protect the public from unsafe, unregulated cosmetic procedures carried out by untrained individuals,” she said.</p> <p>“Botulinum toxin is a prescription-only medicine that should only be administered in a clinical environment by qualified healthcare professionals. When used improperly, it can cause devastating and even life-threatening complications,” Harper-Machin added.</p> <p>“At Bapras, we strongly support efforts to ensure that all aesthetic procedures are safe, evidence-based, and delivered by appropriately trained medical professionals. We urge anyone considering cosmetic treatment to verify their practitioner’s medical credentials and ensure treatments are carried out in regulated settings using licensed products.”</p>
