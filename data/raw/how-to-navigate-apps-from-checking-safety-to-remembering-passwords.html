<p>With more and more organisations asking you to download an app to access the best deals, or even use their services at all, you may be wondering how to deal with the technical side of all of this technology. Fear not, our consumer technology editor, Samuel Gibbs, has some tips.</p>  <h2>What if I can’t install apps because my phone’s storage is full?</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Delete unused apps and games.</p></li> <li><p>Move photos and videos to iCloud, Google Photos or similar.</p></li> <li><p>Clear out your WhatsApp photos, videos and gifs.</p></li> <li><p>Delete music stored offline.</p></li> <li><p>Clear out downloaded files.</p></li> </ul> <h2>How do you know an app is safe?</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Only download apps from the Google Play Store on Android or the Apple App Store on an iPhone.</p></li> <li><p>Check the listing is from a developer you trust – this will probably be the name of the firm whose app you are downloading. Check the name is right and the logo matches what you would expect.</p></li> <li><p>Do not install apps from your browser.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Can I download an app on open wifi – in a shop, for example?</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Generally yes, as <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/01/why-public-wi-fi-lot-safer-you-think">most apps and services are encrypted</a>, but there is always a risk to using public open wifi.</p></li> <li><p>Ensure that the wifi network is being provided by a company you trust.</p></li> <li><p>Keep your phone and apps up to date or use a trusted VPN when on public wifi.</p></li> <li><p>Most apps can be downloaded on 4G or 5G if you have data.</p></li> </ul> <h2>How do I remember my passwords?</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Use a password manager such as 1Password, Bitwarden, Apple’s Passwords app or similar to securely store all of your login details, leaving you only one long and strong password that you have to remember.</p></li> <li><p>Never reuse passwords between services and always use two-step verification where available.</p></li> <li><p>Use the “forgot password” tool for each app or service if you can’t remember it, then store it in a password manager.</p></li> </ul> <h2>How can I share my loyalty cards when they are an app?</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Most apps and services can be used on more than one phone so you can share apps such as Nectar or similar with your household.</p></li> <li><p>Be careful about sharing apps with children if they can be used to directly buy things.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Keep your phone up to date</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Check for software and security updates in your phone’s settings.</p></li> <li><p>Do not use a phone that no longer receives updates.</p></li> <li><p>Keep your apps up to date from the Google Play or Apple App stores.</p></li> </ul> <h2>What if my phone runs out battery?</h2>  <ul> <li><p>Carry a backup battery or compact power adaptor with you so you can charge on the go.</p></li> <li><p>Put your phone into a power save mode if the battery is low to make it last longer.</p></li> </ul>
