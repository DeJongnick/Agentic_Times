<p>The ancient Greeks personified the north wind as the god Boreas, and his chill breezes were a sign of the imminent arrival of winter. Boreas was depicted as a winged man in a billowing cloak holding a conch shell. He had a notoriously bad temper that produced violent storms, and he shipwrecked Odysseus and Hercules.</p> <p>But in some cities, Boreas was a hero and saviour. When a Persian fleet threatened Athens in about 480BC, an oracle instructed the Athenians to pray to the winds. According to Herodotus, “from clear and windless weather” a storm blew up out of the north that lasted for three days. The storm was said to have destroyed virtually all the Persian ships, causing the invasion to fail.</p> <p>The Athenians gave thanks by building a temple to Boreas and celebrating an annual <a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Boreasmi.html">festival, Boreasmus</a>. Little is known about the event except that it included feasting.</p> <p>When it comes to saving cities, Boreas was a <a href="https://www.theoi.com/Titan/AnemosBoreas.html">bronze age superhero</a>. He protected Megalopolis from an invasion by the Spartans and destroyed a fleet from Syracuse that threatened Thuria. Both cities gave thanks by building temples, and Thuria granted the deity honorary citizenship.</p> <p>It might seem odd to celebrate Boreas’s wintery blasts, but as the saying goes, it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good.</p>
