<p>Prince Harry has laid a wreath and flowers in memory of his grandmother Queen Elizabeth II on the third anniversary of her death.</p> <p>The Duke of Sussex arrived in the UK on Monday and travelled to Windsor, where the late queen was laid to rest at the King George VI Memorial Chapel within the castle’s St George’s Chapel. It is understood he laid a wreath and flowers and privately paid his respects.</p> <p>On Monday evening, Harry will attend the WellChild awards ceremony in London in his role as the charity’s patron, a position he has held for more than 15 years.</p> <p>There has been speculation about whether the prince will see his father the king, who is receiving cancer treatment and was in Scotland at the weekend. Images published recently showed senior aides to the two men meeting. The Mail on Sunday reported the event as a step towards restoring their relationship.</p> <p>The WellChild awards, which celebrate the achievements and resilience of seriously ill youngsters and their families, are being staged exactly three years since Queen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral in Scotland on 8 September, aged 96. She was the UK’s longest-reigning monarch, occupying the throne for 70 years.</p> <p>During the event, Harry will make a speech, meet and talk to children and their families and present an award to an “inspirational child” aged between four and six years.</p> <p>“For 20 years, these awards have highlighted the courage of young people living with complex health needs and shone a light on the devoted caregivers – family and professionals – who support them every step of the way. Their stories remind us of the power of compassion, connection and community,” Harry said before the visit.</p> <p>The prince was last seen in the UK in May, when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/02/prince-harry-loses-legal-challenge-over-police-protection-in-uk">lost a long-running legal battle</a> with the Home Office over changes to his security arrangements.</p>
