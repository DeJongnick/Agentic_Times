<p>Good morning.</p> <p>The US and China have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">agreed a framework for a trade deal</a> only days before Donald Trump and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are due to meet.</p> <p>The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the agreement, forged on Sunday on the sidelines of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) summit in Malaysia, would remove the threat of the imposition of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports starting on 1 November and include “a final deal” on the sale of TikTok in the US.</p> <p>Trump arrived in Malaysia yesterday for the summit, his first stop in a five-day Asia tour that is expected to culminate in a face-to-face meeting with Xi in South Korea on Thursday.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What about other trade deals that are still up in the air?</strong> There were hopes of a truce between the US and Brazil after what President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva described as a positive meeting with Trump in Malaysia. He said their respective teams would start discussing tariffs and other matters “immediately”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>And Canada?</strong> Trump said Saturday that he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-tariffs-canada-ronald-reagan">raise US tariffs by 10%</a> in retaliation for an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-canada-trade-negotations-ontario-tariffs">advertisement</a> sponsored by the Ontario government that accurately quoted Ronald Reagan at length saying tariffs don’t work.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Republican senator calls Trump’s military airstrikes ‘extrajudicial killings’</strong></h2>    <p>The Trump administration’s military airstrikes against boats off Venezuela’s coast that the White House claims were being used for drug trafficking are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/rand-paul-trump-military-airstrikes-venezuela">“extrajudicial killings”</a>, said Rand Paul, the president’s fellow Republican and US senator from Kentucky.</p> <p>Paul’s strong comments came on Sunday on the Republican-friendly Fox News, three days after Trump publicly claimed he “can’t imagine” federal lawmakers would have “any problem” with the strikes when asked about seeking congressional approval for them.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How many people have been killed in the airstrikes?</strong> US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off Venezuela’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration has insisted were involved in smuggling drugs.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Hurricane Melissa strengthens to category 5 as evacuations ordered in Jamaica’s capital</strong></h2>    <p>Hurricane Melissa <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/26/hurricane-melissa-strengthens-into-category-4-approaches-jamaica">strengthened into a powerful category 5 hurricane</a> today, threatening days of catastrophic winds and rain in the northern Caribbean.</p> <p>Jamaica’s government ordered mandatory evacuations for vulnerable areas across the country including in the capital, Kingston. Officials had earlier urged those in low-lying and flood-prone areas to seek refuge as Melissa rapidly climbs up the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale.</p> <p>During a press conference in Kingston on Sunday, Jamaican authorities said both international airports were closed and 881 shelters had been activated.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What is the threat to Jamaica? </strong>“Many of these communities will not survive the flooding. Kingston is extremely low,” said Desmond McKenzie, the minister of local government.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In other news …</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>Two US House Republicans are pushing the federal justice department to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/26/zohran-mamdani-republicans-push-investigate-citizenship">investigate the path to citizenship of Zohran Mamdani</a></strong>, the Democratic candidate favored to win the 4 November election for New York City mayor.
