<p>Nostalgia never goes out of style and, right now, the 90s are having their most powerful revival yet – from the return of the <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/hair/g42799514/side-parting-hair-trend/">side parting</a> to disposable cameras to the John Lewis 90s-soundtracked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/nov/04/john-lewis-christmas-advert-countdown-90s-club-classic-where-love-lives">Christmas ad</a>. This isn’t entirely surprising given our <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tracybrower/2024/10/27/6-reasons-youre-overwhelmed-and-how-to-handle-information-overload/">information overload</a> and increased <a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/burnout-rates-united-states/747243/">burnout rates</a>. When the present feels overwhelming, we tend to look back to eras that feel simpler, more familiar, even comforting. </p> <p>The 90s are a kind of cultural palate cleanser: pared-back style, analogue pleasures and a reminder of life before never-ending notifications and algorithmic scrolling. Beauty was playful – think Pamela Anderson’s <a href="https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/frosted-lips-trend">frosted lips </a>or <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/makeup/g28172969/best-90s-makeup-looks/">Gwen Stefani’s hot pink hair</a>; <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/fashion/style/g34587520/90s-fashion/">fashion</a> swung between supermodel glam and DIY-infused rebellion started by the grunge music scene; and technology was charmingly clunky but endlessly fun, from Tamagotchi pets to digital watches.</p> <p>Happily, you don’t need a time machine – or a house full of Beanie Babies – to bring a little 90s magic into your present day. Many brands are reissuing cult products, while new ones pay tribute to the aesthetic with a wink and a welcome upgrade.</p> <p>Whether you’re after a perfume that evokes the decade, a nod to the bands that soundtracked it, or just something steeped in end-of-the-century cool, here are the 15 best ideas.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best 1990s Christmas gifts</h2> <p>***</p> <h2>For retro tech fans</h2>    <p><strong>Saint Laurent × Lomography </strong><strong>film camera</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.ysl.com/en-gb/pr/lomography-reloadable-camera-607886YCL081000.html" > £50 at YSL </a>  <p>Lomography was the decade’s cool-kid way of turning everyday moments into arty, grainy, offbeat shots, laden with endless creative options. Saint Laurent has given the cult 35mm “Lomo” a sleek monochrome makeover, pre-loaded with 27 frames of black-and-white film, ready to refill once you’re done. Plus, receiving the physical snaps after they’ve been developed is such a nostalgic joy.</p>    <p><strong>Tamagotchi Original</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7751424" > £20 at Argos </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/TAMAGOTCHI-Original-Strawberry-Electronic-Japanese/dp/B0F449FDR8" > £19.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>Few playground fads defined the 90s like Tamagotchis – digital pets that lived (and often died) in your pocket. The reissued versions look just like the originals, complete with eggshell case and bleepy demands for food, games and attention. Nostalgia, responsibility and digital chaos wrapped into one tiny keyring – ideal for kids who want a pet, and adults who still can’t keep a plant alive.</p>    <p><strong>Casio vintage watch</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.thbaker.co.uk/casio-casio-collection-retro-digital-steel-bracelet-watch-a168wem-1ef" > £43.90 at TH Baker </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.casio.com/uk/watches/casio/vintage/product.A168WEM-1/" > £43.90 at Casio </a>  <p>If the 90s had a wrist uniform, it was a Casio. Equal parts indie cool and computer-club chic, this reissue keeps the square face, digital display and backlight glow intact, with heritage colours to choose from. And yes, the alarm still beeps.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>For nostalgic beauty lovers</h2>    <p><strong>Lancôme Juicy Tubes</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.lancome.co.uk/makeup/lips/lip-gloss/juicy-tubes/115012-LAC.html?dwvar_115012-LAC_color=08_tickled_pink" > £20.80 at Lancôme </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/lancome-juicy-tubes-ultra-shiny-lip-gloss/p110790052" > £19.50 at John Lewis </a>  <p>Nothing says 90s quite like a Juicy Tube. Glossy, sticky in the best way and sweetly scented, it was once the school-disco essential. Now back with an updated formula, it still gives that MTV-ready shine, only in better shades. Tickled pink is my favourite – it’s a beautiful, suits-all shade that gives your lips a hint of colour.</p>    <p><strong>CK One Essence Intense unisex perfume</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/calvin-klein-ck-one-essence-unisex-parfum-intense/p112090992" > £31 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.boots.com/calvin-klein-ck-one-essence-unisex-parfum-intense-50ml-10346512" > £43 at Boots </a>  <p>If CK One was a <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/article/43918/1/ck-one-turns-25-calvin-klein-fragrance">revolution</a> – a unisex fragrance, and an ad campaign shot by Steven Meisel, featuring Kate Moss – this reboot is its grownup, moodier sibling. Twice as concentrated as the original, it blends zesty bergamot and blood orange with green tea, sandalwood and upcycled musk. Still clean and androgynous, it’s a modern twist on a genderless scent icon. I could still smell it at the end of a long day.</p>    <p><strong>Urban Decay naked eyeshadow sticks</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/urban-decay-naked-eyeshadow-stick/p113888739" > £20 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/urban-decay-naked-eyeshadow-stick-various-shades-1.1g/17165076/" > £25 at Cult Beauty </a>  <p>Urban Decay made its name in the 90s with grunge-girl shades and irreverent names. These new shadow sticks are a slick update: creamy, long-lasting colour in 90s-inspired shades, from champagne shimmer to matt brown. They’re easy to swipe on (and worked perfectly for my daily tube makeup-application ritual) and channel your inner riot grrrl or Spice Girl – whatever your preference.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>For throwback fashion fans</h2>    <p><strong>Adidas Oasis Tour bucket hat</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/tour-bucket-hat/KK9155.html" > £40 at Adidas </a>  <p>Nothing screams Britpop like a bucket hat, and 90s legends Oasis turned it into a swaggering uniform. Adidas’s take keeps it classic: black, understated, endlessly wearable. Pair with a parka and a pint, and you’ve basically got a backstage pass to Knebworth 96.</p>    <p><strong>Dr Martens Jadon Wednesday platform boots</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.drmartens.com/uk/en_gb/jadon-wednesday-platform-boots-black/p/32224001" > £210 at Dr Martens </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.schuh.co.uk/womens/dr-martens-x-wednesday-jadon-black-boots/1448747020/" > £210 at Schuh </a>  <p>If you lived in DMs through the 90s, these are the grownup reboot your inner teen would fully approve of. Made in collaboration with the Netflix show Wednesday, they have a subtle spiderweb design, chunky platform sole, oversized eyelets and, of course, the signature DM yellow stitching. They channel the era of nu-metal and stripy arm warmers – only now they’re comfier, sturdier and built for stomping through real life, not just the mosh pit. I haven’t taken them off, and they break in much more easily than they used to.</p>    <p><strong>Minga London Rek earring set</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.mingalondon.com/products/rek-earring-set" > £24 at Minga London </a>  <p>Chunky silver with spikes was the jewellery of choice for those who spent the 90s in their local grimy rock club or getting piercings at Blue Banana. Minga London riffs on the era with ultra-cool statement jewellery that’s equal parts Camden market nostalgia and fashion-forward Rick Owens edge. I get stacks of compliments whenever I wear these.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>For a retro revival home</h2>    <p><strong>Discotheque Kinky G candle</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/discotheque-kinky-g-candle-220g/15341638/" > £54 at Cult Beauty </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/discotheque-kinky-g-candle" > £54 at Sephora </a>  <p>This candle channels the heady rush of a proper 90s night out. Notes of coconut cream and cherry pie melt into white peach and almond, evoking perfume-filled dancefloors, and lip gloss applied in the loos. Light it to create your own 90s kitchen disco – it smells like going out-out in the very best way.</p>    <p><strong>Mr Maria × Smiley Bundle of Light lamp</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://babymori.com/products/mr-maria-smiley-bundle-of-light-lamp" > £18 at Mori </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/en-gb/shop/hybrid/mr-maria-x-smiley-bundle-of-light-lamp" > £17 at Urban Outfitters </a>  <p>Nothing says 90s like the yellow Smiley face, once splashed across rave flyers and playground notebooks. This portable lamp gives out a soft, ambient glow that is part nostalgia trip, part mood-booster (larger sizes are also available). </p>    <p><strong>Jonathan Adler Vice weed canister</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://uk.jonathanadler.com/products/vice-weed-canister" > £30 at Jonathan Adler </a>  <p>A playful nod to the 90s hazy counterculture, this ceramic stash jar is as chic as it is cheeky. With bold lettering and a glossy finish, it’s a contemporary upgrade on shoeboxes under the bed, although naturally you’ll now be using it for storing jewellery and trinkets like I do (won’t you?).</p> <p>***</p> <h2>For old-school culture fans</h2>    <p><strong>Vinyl Deli subscription</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.vinyldeli.com/subscribe/products/" > From £28 at Vinyl Deli </a>  <p>For the friend who still insists music sounds better on vinyl, Vinyl Deli hand-picks records each month based on your taste – like mixtape culture reborn. Whether you’re into rave, pop, grunge or indie, it’s the perfect surprise drop for turntable devotees.</p>    <p><strong>The Face Magazine: Culture Shift book</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/en-gb/shop/the-face-magazine-culture-shift-book" > £45 at Urban Outfitters </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Face-Magazine-Culture-Shift/dp/1855145898/" > £25.51 at Amazon </a>  <p>Few titles defined 80s and 90s cool like the Face, the style bible that chronicled Britpop, club culture and street fashion. This anthology captures its era-defining covers, features and photography. A coffee table must for anyone who once cut out magazine pages to make moodboards – or wishes they had.</p>    <p><strong>Gift Republic 90s film trivia quiz game</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.giftrepublic.com/card-packs/90s-movie-trivia" > £4.99 at Gift Republic </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gift-Republic-Questions-Multicolor-GR490123/dp/B09FFPKKZZ" > £4.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>Calling all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/blockbuster">Blockbuster</a> kids: this trivia set revisits the decade of Clueless, The Matrix and Titanic.

Perfect for film buffs who still know every line of Jurassic Park – and aren’t afraid to prove it.</p> <p><em><strong>For more gift ideas from the Filter, read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/nov/05/best-home-gifts-christmas-interiors">the best home gifts for interiors lovers</a></strong></em><em><strong> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/nov/06/christmas-gifts-pets-cats-dogs-uk">the best gifts for pets</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Anita Bhagwandas is a freelance beauty editor and consultant obsessed with finding products that actually deliver what they promise.
