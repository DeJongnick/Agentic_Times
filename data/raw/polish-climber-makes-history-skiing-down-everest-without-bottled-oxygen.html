<p>A Polish adventure skier has made history by becoming the first person to climb up and ski down Mount Everest without the use of additional oxygen.</p> 
<p>The ascent was Andrzej Bargiel’s third attempt at climbing Everest – the tallest mountain on earth at 8,849 metres (29,032ft) high – after dangerous conditions forced the 37-year-old to abandon earlier attempts in 2019 and 2022.</p> 
<p>“The summit itself was arduous and difficult. I’d never spent so much time at such an altitude in my life, so that was a challenge in itself,” Bargiel said. “Skiing down Everest without oxygen was a dream that had been growing inside me for years.”</p> 
<p>More than 6,000 people have climbed the mountain, according to the Himalayan database, but only about 200 have done it without additional bottled oxygen. A few people have skied back down, but never a continuous downhill without supplementary oxygen.</p> 
<p>It took nearly 16 hours on Monday for Bargiel to climb through the “death zone”, which is above 8,000m where oxygen levels are dangerously low.</p> 
<p>At the top of the mountain the air is so thin that climbers only get about a third of the oxygen available at sea level. This can cause brain damage, fluid in the lungs, and even death.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, he skied down through the Khumbu Icefall, a maze of ice towers and deep crevasses known as one of Everest’s most dangerous sections, before arriving at base camp. He was guided through this section partly by a drone flown by his brother, Bartek.</p> 
<p>“I split the descent into two parts, as navigating the technically difficult icefall in relatively safe conditions was only possible in the morning,” said Bargiel.</p> 
<p>Bargiel’s team said in a statement that it was a “groundbreaking milestone in the world of ski mountaineering”.</p> 
<p>The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, celebrated on X, writing: “Sky is the limit? Not for Poles! Andrzej Bargiel has just skied down Mount Everest.”</p> 
<p>In 2018, Bargiel became the first person to ski down Pakistan’s K2, the second highest mountain in the world.</p> 
<p>In an interview with the Guardian in 2020 he said: “No one thought it could be done; even my own brother had doubts. It taught me the value of patience – and that nobody else can make your dreams come true.”</p>
