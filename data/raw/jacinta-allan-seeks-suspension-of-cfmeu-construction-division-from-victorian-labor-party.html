I watched last night’s [60 Minutes] segment. They are allegations,” Smith said.</p> <p>“People are entitled to procedural fairness … I can’t, and I won’t, just hang people on mere media speculation alone.”</p> <p>But the head of the ACTU, Sally McManus, called for anyone in the construction union subject to criminal allegations to be stood down immediately while investigations happen.</p> <p>“We also call on the CFMEU to take all necessary steps to rid the union of any and all criminal elements,” McManus said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/12/union-heavyweight-john-setka-resigns-cfmeu-boss-citing-malicious-attacks-ntwnfb">Anthony Albanese denounces John Setka after union heavyweight resigns as CFMEU boss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Allan said she shared McManus’s view.</p> <p>“Anyone who has any association with any criminal behaviour, they shouldn’t be there in the first place,” she said.</p> <p>The Victorian government has also committed to toughen anti-bikie laws to “prevent certain individuals from associating with each other”, and to conduct an independent review to “strengthen the power of Victorian government agencies who are engaged with construction companies and construction unions”.</p> <p>Allan also urged the federal government “to review – and if necessary, terminate” – CFMEU enterprise bargaining agreements on Victorian construction sites to prevent criminal activity.</p> <p>The New South Wales premier, Chris Minns, said there was “no room for criminality in the construction sector” and vowed to take action against anyone misbehaving in the CFMEU.</p> <p>He also said the NSW Labor party was not taking donations from the union other than affiliation fees.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/14/cfmeu-could-be-deregistered-if-thats-what-needs-to-be-done-after-allegations-minister-says">workplace relations minister, Tony Burke</a>, welcomed the national union’s decision, describing it as “a start, but only a start”.</p> <p>He reiterated comments he made on Sunday, when he said he had asked his department to advise him on ministerial powers to respond to the reports, including deregistering it.<br><br>“As I said yesterday, I will be weighing up the department’s advice, the evidence that’s emerging and the response of the union,” Burke said. <br><br>“The response so far is progress, but falls short.”</p> <p>The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, welcomed the national union’s decision, describing it as a “good next step”.</p> <p>The CFMEU Victorian branch secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/12/union-heavyweight-john-setka-resigns-cfmeu-boss-citing-malicious-attacks-ntwnfb">John Setka, resigned</a> on Friday before Nine published the reports, claiming he had been the target of “ongoing false allegations” which had led to “malicious attacks” on the organisation.</p> <p>Setka had quit the Labor party in 2019 after a long-running dispute with Albanese, who had sought to expel the union official from the party over alleged remarks about domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty – claims the secretary denied.</p>
