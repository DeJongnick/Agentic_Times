<p>More than 60 Labour MPs have formed a bloc to push back against anti-pylon lobbying by Conservative and Green MPs, saying they back plans to build the pylons despite local opposition in several areas.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/12/renewable-energy-uk-pylons-national-grid-upgrade">Government rules out underground cabling in National Grid upgrade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>MPs, particularly in rural areas, have come under mounting pressure from anti-pylon activists to oppose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/12/renewable-energy-uk-pylons-national-grid-upgrade">the infrastructure</a>. The Tories found themselves forced to commit to hold a “rapid review” of overhead pylons in their July manifesto.</p> <p>The Green MP <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/oct/14/green-mp-adrian-ramsay-first-100-days">Adrian Ramsay has also campaigned in his Waveney Valley constituency against pylons</a>, drawing criticism from the prime minister, since the pylons carry electricity from offshore wind.</p> <p>There are already planning battles against overground lines in places including East Anglia and Lincolnshire, with some Labour candidates at the general election saying they opposed pylon schemes.</p> <p>The 61 Labour MPs have written a strident letter backing plans for the “pylon presumption” – a counter to a letter sent last month by 16 Conservatives plus Ramsay . Signatories to that first letter included the former minister James Cartlidge and other high-profile names including Priti Patel and Bernard Jenkin.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/20/pylon-english-councils-fight-ed-miliband-clean-power-revolution-rural-areas">The great pylon pile-on: can councils’ opposition scupper Labour’s ‘clean power’ revolution?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Those MPs had urged the government and the National Energy System Operator (Neso) to carry out an “urgent review” into the pylon presumption and explore the “potential cost competitiveness” of underground cables instead – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/20/pylon-english-councils-fight-ed-miliband-clean-power-revolution-rural-areas">a key ask of anti-pylon campaigners</a>.</p> <p>But the Labour MPs have now hit back in a letter to the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, and the chief executive of Neso, Fintan Slye, saying they were “concerned by recent representations by Conservative and Green MPs”.</p> <p>The letter said: “The cheapest and most pragmatic way to meet our energy needs is to reject the Conservative and Green MPs’ ideological and expensive presumption in favour of undergrounding of cables.”</p> <p>It said the MPs’ letter citing the price comparison on the East Anglia Network pylon rollout from Norwich to Tilbury with underground cabling “cherrypicks details”, and the delay to delivering the grid infrastructure would cost consumers £1bn – according to Neso’s own report. “We cannot afford a delay to 2034 and increased costs for bill payers,” the letter said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/17/ed-miliband-wind-solar-pylons-energy-uk-fossil-fuels">Ed Miliband: beating nimbys on green rollout a matter of ‘national security’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Britain has suffered the worst cost of living crisis in generations, driven by Conservative government failure to reduce our vulnerability to volatile fossil fuel markets.
