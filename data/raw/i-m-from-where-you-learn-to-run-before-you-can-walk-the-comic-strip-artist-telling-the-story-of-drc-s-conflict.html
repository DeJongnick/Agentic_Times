<p>In the early hours of the morning, Baraka, a young boy, wanders through the streets of Goma. He takes a wrong turn and runs into bandits. Back home, his father flicks through TV channels while his mother counts bags of flour. No one speaks. The silence is broken only by crackles on the radio.</p>  <figure class="element element-image element--thumbnail" data-media-id="a812ae0f54d3a7236378ad17a0a47ed62b9c9dd9"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/a812ae0f54d3a7236378ad17a0a47ed62b9c9dd9/0_0_1968_2912/676.jpg" alt="A magazine cover with graphic novel-like drawings of an African boy, a line of people queueing for water, the boy running away from two others, someone lying in bed and a city street    " width="676" height="1000" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma is published in the Continent, a pan-African e-paper </span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Courtesy of Edizon Musavuli/The Continent</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By evening, Baraka is sitting on the shore of Lake Kivu, looking south to Bukavu and east towards Rwanda, finding no hope in either direction.</p> <p>This is the opening to Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma, the first comic by a 31-year-old visual artist, Edizon Musavuli, published earlier this year in the Continent, a weekly pan-African newspaper. The story depicts everyday struggles in Goma through the eyes of a child.</p> <p>Prominent Congolese artists such as Barly Baruti, Fifi Mukuna and Papa Mfumu’Eto, who captured the public’s imagination in comic strips in the past, mainly worked abroad or in Kinshasa, a city more than a thousand miles from Goma. But there are few contemporary comics set in or about the Democratic Republic of the Congo written by Congolese artists.</p>    <p>“I have been drawing since I could hold a pencil,” Musavuli says of his journey as an artist. He began to pursue the craft seriously only after finishing high school, enrolling at the Africa Digital Media Institute in Nairobi. His studies, however, were cut short by financial difficulties.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Art gives hope. It’s something to start with </p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His first solo exhibition was in January 2020, organised with the French Institute of Goma. “It was a really big exhibition. [And] it was impressive how everyone responded to it,” says Musavuli.</p> <p>But just a year later, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/dec/21/children-executed-and-women-raped-in-front-of-their-families-as-m23-militia-unleashes-fresh-terror-on-drc">brutal M23 militia, backed by Rwanda</a>, resurfaced in eastern DRC and upended Goma’s fragile art scene.</p> <p>“Artists in Goma are really reliant on French exhibitions like that,” he says. “If they’re not around, it will feel like we don’t exist. That’s what’s happening right now.”</p>    <p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/m23-rebel-group-goma-drc-democratic-republic-congo-rwanda">M23 captured Goma</a> in January this year, the city’s creative spaces faltered alongside its economy. “Art gives hope. It’s something to start with, but our situation here doesn’t change. So people [in Goma] are not really interested any more,” says Musavuli.</p> <p>Artists and creativity have long been consigned to the margins of the state agenda. “We are not really something the government prioritises,” he says.</p>    <p>Turning to Instagram, he began sharing personal and collective experiences of Congolese life in the form of cartoons. In one post, recounting his childhood, he captioned an interactive story: “I’m from where you learn to run before you walk.”</p> <p>In one reel, which has since generated more than 10,000 views, he is seen working on an unfinished painting, while gunshots are heard in the background.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="A short video of graphic art illustrating the history of the Congo  ">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

The story is charged with political undertones, highlighting how ordinary routines have been stripped away and replaced with constant uncertainty.</p> <p>Yet Musavuli insists the short comic was not meant as explicit political commentary: “I’m not really a political artist or activist [but] I say what people around me are thinking.

Even if your voice is heard by just two people, it’s something.”</p> <p>At the end of the Baraka and the Unpredictable Life of Goma, Baraka walks alone down an empty road, his head held high. “Tomorrow might look exactly the same,” he says, “but I’ll keep walking. Holding on to hope is already fighting back.”</p>
