<p>Geelong and Brisbane will meet in the 2025 AFL grand final with both sides out to cement their place as arguably the best team of recent years.</p> <p>The Cats and Lions have shared two of the past three premierships but for the first time in their 126-year VFL/AFL history now cross paths in a grand final.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/sep/22/afl-finals-brisbane-collingwood-prelim-scott-pendlebury">Young Lions deal knockout blow in what feels like ageing Collingwood’s last swing | Jonathan Horn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two sides clashed just three weeks ago when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/05/afl-qualifying-final-geelong-cats-v-brisbane-lions-match-report">Geelong trounced Brisbane in a qualifying final</a> to open up a clear path to this year’s decider, then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/19/afl-first-preliminary-final-geelong-cats-hawthorn-hawks-match-report">outclassed Hawthorn to book their grand final spot</a>.</p> <p>The Lions have had to take a longer route after their defeat in the first week of finals.

The match is played at the MCG – the traditional home of the grand final – in Melbourne.</p>    <h2><strong>When does the </strong><strong>game finish?</strong></h2> <p>The flag decider should finish around 5.15pm AEST depending on the length of each quarter. The break at the main change is longer than during the home-and-away season to allow for the additional half-time entertainment.</p> <h2><strong>What happens if there is a draw?</strong></h2> <p>A draw will lead to extra-time being played, rather than a grand final replay, as has occurred the three previous times in VFL/AFL history.</p> <p>If the scores are level at full-time, both teams will have a six-minute break before the teams play out two three-minute halves – plus time on. The teams will swap ends after each half without a break.</p> <p>If there is still a draw at the end of the first period of extra-time, another two halves of extra-time will be played. The teams will be allowed an extra 10 interchanges in each half but these do not roll over.</p>    <h2><strong>What is the weather forecast for </strong><strong> grand final day?</strong></h2> <p>The forecast for Melbourne is for partly cloudy conditions with a medium chance of showers that would only bring 0-1mm of rain. The expected maximum is 18C, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.</p> <h2><strong>When is the </strong><strong> grand final parade?</strong></h2> <p>The traditional parade begins at Melbourne Park at 10am AEST on Friday 26 September – a public holiday in Victoria.</p> <h2><strong>What time does the pre-game entertainment start?</strong></h2> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/12/snoop-dogg-2025-afl-grand-final-performance">pre-game entertainment featuring Snoop Dogg</a> will start at 1.30pm AEST.
