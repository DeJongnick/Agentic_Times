<p>The US added 911,000 fewer jobs than first estimated for the year through March 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has announced, highlighting recent concerns about the health of America’s labor market.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/09/us-created-fewer-jobs-march-2025">The revision</a> comes after a lackluster August jobs report, with only 22,000 jobs added in the US.</p> <p>The largest revisions were in leisure and hospitality (down 176,000), professional and business services (down 158,000) and retail trade (down 126,200). Government jobs were adjusted down by 31,000 jobs.</p> <p>We’d like to hear from current job seekers in the US what their experience of looking for work right now has been like.</p> <p>We’d also like to hear from US employees who were considering leaving their jobs for new opportunities but have decided to stay put, and why. Do you have concerns about the US labor market? Tell us.</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="37c649a4-8988-4d23-96be-d19d66c698a8" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>
