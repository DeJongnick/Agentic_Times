<p>A former top <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuelan</a> military intelligence chief has pleaded guilty in a Manhattan federal court to narco-terrorism conspiracy, drug-trafficking and weapons charges, piling further US pressure on the government of Nicolás Maduro.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/19/venezuela-hugo-carvajal-pollo-extradited-drug-trafficking">Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios</a>, AKA “El Pollo” or “The Chicken”, was the director of Venezuela’s military intelligence under presidents Hugo Chávez and Maduro. On Wednesday, days before his trial was set to begin, he pleaded guilty to four federal counts, related to accusations that he helped lead a drug-trafficking group within the Venezuelan government.</p> <p>“Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios was once one of the most powerful men in Venezuela. For years, he and other officials … used cocaine as a weapon – flooding New York and other American cities with poison,” said US attorney Jay Clayton.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/19/venezuela-hugo-carvajal-pollo-extradited-drug-trafficking">Venezuela’s ex-spy chief extradited from Spain to US to face drug charges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Carvajal turned against Maduro in 2019 and supported a failed coup that year led by the opposition leader Juan Guaidó.

The Farc was previously classified as a terrorist organization by the US government before most of its members <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/29/colombia-farc-rebel-group-civil-war-us-terrorist-organization-list-peace-deal">laid down their weapons</a> in a historic 2016 peace process.</p> <p>Although the US government claims the Cartel of the Suns is a structured and government-run drug-trafficking group, <a href="https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/cartel-de-los-soles-profile/">analysts claim</a> that it is more of a “network of networks” of various drug-trafficking groups protected by elements within the Venezuelan state.</p> <p>The Miami Herald, citing unnamed sources, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article309419650.html">reported</a> that Carvajal was potentially collaborating with the US government to provide information about Maduro’s drug-trafficking activities, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/what-is-tren-de-aragua-trump-venezuela">Tren de Aragua</a> gang and Venezuela’s ties to Iran.</p> <p>Details of his potential collaboration may be revealed during his sentencing hearing in October.
