 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>As dawn breaks in Kyiv and multiple towns and cities across Ukraine wake to find scenes of destruction, here is where the situation currently stands:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Western allies have agreed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/us-uk-europe-and-canada-to-block-russian-access-to-swift">block Russia’s access</a> to the Swift international banking payment system</strong>. The US, Canada and key European countries, including Germany, have agreed to remove “selected Russian banks” from the Swift payment system, the countries announced on Saturday.</li> 
   <li><strong>There are reports that a gas pipeline is on fire in Kharkiv</strong> after a Russian attack, while an oil terminal in Vasylkiv, south-west of the capital, Kyiv, has also been targeted. The government has warned that smoke from the explosion in Kharkiv could cause an “environmental catastrophe” and advised people to cover their windows.</li> 
   <li><strong>The 13 Ukrainian soldiers who were reportedly killed while defending an island</strong> in the Black Sea from an air and sea bombardment – reportedly telling a Russian navy warship to “go fuck yourself” when asked to surrender – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/ukraine-island-defenders-who-told-russian-officer-go-fuck-yourself-may-still-be-alive">may still be alive</a>, according to Ukrainian officials.</li> 
   <li><strong>Britain is preparing a “hit list” of Russian oligarchs to be targeted by sanctions</strong> in the coming months, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said.</li> 
   <li><strong>Truss said there would be “nowhere left to hide” for the super-rich allies of Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin</strong>. She told the Sunday Times that new names would be added to the list every few weeks as ministers seek to ratchet up the pressure on Putin.</li> 
   <li><strong>Liquor stores and bars in the US and Canada are targeting Russia’s national drink</strong> in a show of unity with the people of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Shelves in both countries are being stripped of Russian vodka, with the Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, announcing on Saturday the removal of “Russian-made and Russian-branded spirits from our liquor and wine outlets until further notice”.</li> 
   <li><strong>Japanese billionaire Hiroshi ‘Mickey’ Mikitani has said he will donate $8.7m to the government of Ukraine</strong>, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy”. The founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten said in a letter addressed to Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the donation of 1bn yen ($8.7m) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence”, Agence France-Presse reported.</li> 
   <li><strong>A Ukrainian company in charge of building and maintaining roads said it was removing all road signs</strong> that could be used by invading Russian forces to find their way around the country. The company, Ukravtodor, said in a Facebook post: “The enemy has poor communications, they cannot navigate the terrain. Let us help them get straight to hell.”</li>

  <p><strong>Australia</strong> has said it will <strong>fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine</strong> to help it fight Russian forces, days after the government said it would only provide “non-lethal” military equipment.</p> 
  <p>Prime minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> joined Ukrainian-Australians at a church service in Sydney on Sunday morning before announcing the decision.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The Australian government will continue to stand up for what is right when it comes to Ukraine.</p> 
   <p>We’ll be seeking to provide whatever support we can for lethal aid through our Nato partners, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Morrison added that the rapid processing of visa applicants from Ukraine would be a “top priority” going forward.</p>

  <p>A powerful video posted to social media shows a <strong>Ukrainian citizen attempting to stop a Russian tank</strong> with his body weight. </p> 
  <p>The man first climbs on to the tank before hopping down and attempting to push it back with his arms. When that fails, he kneels in front of the tank in a desperate bid to stop its advance. </p> 
  <p>The moment, captured in <strong>Bakhmach</strong> in northern Ukraine, is one of a string of defiant acts caught on video showing unarmed Ukrainians confronting Russian soldiers.</p>

  <p>The decision to remove some Russian banks from the Swift international payments system is expected to have a significant impact in Russia, and further afield. Sergei Aleksashenko, a former deputy chairman of Russia’s central banks, said “there is going to be a catastrophe” on the Russian currency market on Monday. “I think they will stop trading and then the exchange rate will be fixed at an artificial level just like in Soviet times,” he added.</p> 
  <p>Michael Farr, chief executive of financial consulting firm Farr, Miller &amp; Washington, said of the impact on global markets: “This could be a surprise that is not taken very well if it means a slowdown in international trade.”<br></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We are receiving more confirmation of a <strong>blaze at an oil terminal </strong>in the Ukrainian town of <strong>Vasylkiv,</strong> southwest of the capital, Kyiv.</p> 
  <p>The town’s mayor, Natalia Balasinovich, said Russian missiles hit the oil storage area southwest of the air base’s main runway in a video posted online. The National News Agency of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> later confirmed the reports. </p> 
  <p>Photographs and video posted online showed large flames rising under the night sky.<br></p> 
  <p>Anton <strong>Gerashchenko</strong>, an adviser to the the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said on Telegram.<br></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The missile attack was carried out on the Vasilkovskaya oil depot of the KLO company. Rescuers have already left for the scene of the tragedy. Most likely, there were no casualties. It will burn for a long time. The environmental damage will be colossal.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The mayor of Vasylkiv, Natalia Balasinovich, also confirmed that rockets hit the oil depot in Vasilkov, and a strong fire started.</p> 
  <p>A natural <strong>gas pipeline was also blown up </strong>in <strong>Kharkiv, </strong>Ukraine’s second-largest city, after a Russian attack, the Ukrainian state service of special communications said. </p> 
  <p>A mushroom-shaped explosion was shown in a video it posted on the Telegram messaging app.</p> 
  <p>It was not immediately clear how important the pipeline was and whether the blast could disrupt gas shipments outside the city or the country. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Vodka, one of Russia’s most known exports, is being boycotted from liquor stores and bars across the US and Canada in protest of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. </p>

  <p>L. Louise Lucas, a top Democrat in the Virginia State Senate, is alsocalling for “the removal of all Russian vodka and any other Russian products” from <strong>Virginia’</strong>s nearly 400 state-run Alcoholic Beverage Control Authority stores.</p> 
  <p>Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of <strong>Arkansas</strong>, wrote on Twitter: “Dump all the Russian vodka and, alongside ammo and missiles, send the empty bottles to Ukraine to use for Molotov cocktails.”</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Liquor Control Board of Ontario,</strong> Canada’s most populated province, announced on Friday that it would remove “all products produced in Russia” from its more than 600 stores. Similar removals were underway in the provinces of Manitoba and Newfoundland, Reuters reported.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Ukrainian soldiers</strong> who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/ukraine-soldiers-told-russians-to-go-fuck-yourself-before-black-sea-island-death">defended an island in the Black Sea</a> from an air and sea bombardment - reportedly telling an officer on board a Russian navy warship to “go f*** yourself” when asked to surrender, are <strong>believed to still be alive </strong>according to Ukrainian officials.</p> 
  <p>There were 13 border guards stationed on Snake Island, a roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky island owned by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> that sits about 186 miles (300km) west of Crimea, when Russian troops bombed the island on Thursday.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Gas pipeline and oil terminal on fire after attack: reports</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Reports are filtering in that a <strong>gas pipeline is on fire</strong> in <strong>Kharkiv</strong> after a Russian attack.</p> 
  <p>In <strong>Vasylkiv</strong>, central Ukraine, an <strong>oil terminal has also reportedly been targeted</strong>, according to the National News Agency of Ukraine and later verified by CNN.</p> 
  <p>Video of the fire at the oil storage area southwest of the air base’s main runway has circulated across social media this morning.</p> 
  <p>Vasylkiv is about 30km, or 18 miles, south of Kyiv. It hosts a large military airfield and multiple fuel tanks. </p> 
  <p>Illia Ponomarenko, a reporter for the Kyiv Independent, says the population in the area has been advised to keep their windows shut against hazardous chemical fumes.</p> 
  <p>Anton <strong>Gerashchenko</strong>, an adviser to the the Ministry of Internal Affairs, said on Telegram.<br></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The missile attack was carried out on the Vasilkovskaya oil depot of the KLO company. Rescuers have already left for the scene of the tragedy. Most likely, there were no casualties. It will burn for a long time. The environmental damage will be colossal.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The mayor of Vasylkiv, Natalia Balasinovich, also confirmed that rockets hit the oil depot in Vasilkov, and a strong fire started.</p>

  <p>Musk said on Saturday that the company’s Starlink satellite broadband service is available in Ukraine and SpaceX is sending more terminals to the country, whose internet has been disrupted due to the Russian invasion.<br> <strong>Internet connectivity</strong> in Ukraine has been affected by the Russian invasion, particularly in the southern and eastern parts of the country where fighting has been heaviest, internet monitors said on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>While extremely costly to deploy, satellite technology can provide internet for people who live in rural or hard-to-serve places where fibre optic cables and cell towers do not reach. The technology can also be a critical backstop when hurricanes or other natural disasters disrupt communication.</p> 
  <p>Musk said on 15 January that SpaceX had 1,469 Starlink satellites active and 272 moving to operational orbits soon. </p>

  <p><strong>Russia has become a “global economic and financial pariah”, a senior US administration official told the Guardian’s diplomatic editor Julian Borger.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking after western allies announced new financial measures against Russia, including the removal of some Russian banks from the Swift global payments network, the official said the measures were designed to target the Kremlin and individuals tied to the Russian government.</p> 
  <p>“We’ll go after their yachts, their luxury apartments their money and their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the west. We will also engage other governments, so as to detect and disrupt the movement of ill-gotten gains, and deny these individuals their ability to hide their assets in jurisdictions across the world,” the official said.<br><br>They said that all 10 of Russia’s largest financial institutions had now been subjected to sanctions – “holding nearly 80% of the Russian banking sector’s total assets”.<br><br>As a result, the official said: “Russia’s government borrowing costs have more than doubled to almost 17%. The S&amp;P credit rating agency has downgraded Russia to junk status. Within 24 hours of our actions the demand for cash in Russia spiked 58 fold, according to reports, and the Russian government scrambled to deplete its own resources to try and shore up its banks and its currency. In short, Russia has become a global economic and financial pariah.” </p> 
  <p>Russia has been reported to have $630bn in financial reserves stored abroad, in gold and cash, but the new sanctions would render that fund useless, the official said.<br><br>“You heard about fortress Russia, the war chest of $630bn of foreign reserves,” they said. </p> 
  <p>“It’s impressive, but it’s only impressive if Russia can use those reserves. And that means Russia has to be able to sell those reserves and buy rubles to support its currency. And so what we’re committing to do here is to disarm the central bank. And the way we can do that, for example, is by banning US, EU UK, persons from selling rubles to the Central Bank of Russia. That means very simply, the Russian Central Bank can’t support the ruble, full stop, and that means our sanctions will have much greater force.”</p> 
  <p>The US official said the list of Russia banks to be removed from Swift will ultimately be decided by the EU, but said the US would “work very closely” with European countries “to finalize that list”.</p>

  <p><strong>The news that western allies will ban Russian banks from the Swift global payments network is a break through for the countries that had initially pushed for the ban.</strong></p> 
  <p>The UK and Spain were early supporters of the move to lock Russia out of Swift, the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, but Germany <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/swift-eu-leaders-line-up-to-back-banning-russia-from-banking-network">was a key holdout</a>.</p> 
  <p>On Saturday, however, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s foreign minister, said the country was working on a “targeted and functional restriction” on Swift. Hours later, the joint statement by western allies, including Germany, was released, with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen <a href="https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1497694812018991112">announcing</a> the measure.</p>

  <p>It is a victory for Ukraine, which had pleaded since Thursday for countries to ban Russia – foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba going so far as to say that European and US politicians would have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/kyiv-furious-as-eu-wavers-on-banning-russia-from-swift-payment-system">“blood on their hands”</a> if they did not.</p> 
  <p>But it remains unclear how widespread the ban will be. The statement from the west referred to removing “selected Russian banks” from Swift, but gave no specifics.</p> 
  <p>The US, like Germany, had initially been sceptical about the Swift ban. The Observer’s economics editor, Phillip Inman, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/24/what-is-swift-international-payments-network-russia-sanction">wrote</a> that “one reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift.</p>

  <p>The joint statement on Saturday made the move official, although few details were given as to when the Swift removal will take place, and which Russian banks will be targeted.</p> 
  <p>“We commit to ensuring that selected Russian banks are removed from the SWIFT messaging system. This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally,” the countries said.<br><br>“Second, we commit to imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions.”</p> 
  <p>The countries also said they would take measures “to limit the sale of citizenship – so called golden passports – that let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems”.</p> 
  <p>They also announced plans to launch a “transatlantic task force” which will ensure sanctions on Russians remain effective.</p>

  <p><strong>The United Nations Security Council is due to vote on Sunday to call for a rare emergency special session of the UN General Assembly on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/un-chief-speaks-with-ukraine-president-says-un-boost-aid-2022-02-26/?taid=621a914e3cade0000101051c&amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter">reports</a>:</strong></p> 
  <p>The vote by the 15-member council is procedural so none of the five permanent council members - Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States - can wield their vetoes. The move needs nine votes in favor and is likely to pass, diplomats said. The special session would be held on Monday, diplomats said.</p> 
  <p>Only 10 such emergency special sessions of the 193-member General Assembly have been convened since 1950.</p> 
  <p>The request for a session on Ukraine comes after Russia vetoed on Friday a draft UN Security Council resolution that would have deplored Moscow’s invasion. China, India and UAE abstained, while the remaining 11 members voted in favor. </p> 
  <p>The General Assembly is expected to vote on a similar resolution following several days of statements by countries in the emergency special session, diplomats said. General Assembly resolutions are non-binding but carry political weight.</p>

  <p><strong>One of the more surprising encounters I had in the outskirts of Kyiv today was with 50-year-old Alexander, who was manning a makeshift barricade at the entrance to one village with a group of other locals, brandishing whatever weapons they had.</strong></p> 
  <p>Alexander was born and grew up in Russia, then moved to Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, but left when Russian-backed forces took over in 2014. Now, he was ready to fight his own former countrymen.</p> 
  <p>If he were to capture any Russian soldiers, he said, he would have nothing to say to them, except to scream “Get out, occupier!” He said logic did not work on Russians because of the propaganda narrative dominant there.</p> 
  <p>He has stopped talking to his relatives in Russia, he said, as they simply don’t understand why he has become a Ukrainian patriot.</p> 
  <p>“I spoke to my own cousin two days ago and he doesn’t understand anything. That will be our last conversation. I asked him why are you so cowardly, your country is attacking us with ballistic missiles, your own father is from Ukraine, have you gone insane?”</p> 
  <p>He was, however, realistic about his makeshift team’s chances.</p> 
  <p>“Of course, if it’s a tank, in this terrain there’s nothing we can do and we need to run. But if it’s anything less than a tank, we will fight,” he said. </p>

  <p><strong>Germany’s announcement that it will deliver weapons to support Ukraine’s military ends months of resistance from Berlin, despite the repeated calls from the administration of President Zelensky that it needed Germany’s military support.</strong></p> 
  <p>“The Russian attack on the Ukraine marks a sea change,” Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a statement. “It threatens our entire post-war order. In this situation it is our duty to support Ukraine in its attempts to defend itself against the invasion army of Vladimir Putin. Germany stands closely at the side of Ukraine.”</p> 
  <p>Germany is to deliver 1000 tank defence weapons as well as 500 surface to air stinger missiles, from stocks held by the German army, government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said. He said the weapons would be delivered to Ukraine as soon as possible.</p> 
  <p>The decision comes as a relief to many Germans who have watched with despair as the events in Ukraine have unfolded in recent days. Many have felt torn between the attempts by Germany to resist involvement in military conflict due to the extent to which the country is still haunted by its own Nazi era, and having to watch the lives of innocent people in a European democracy being ruined by an autocratic kleptocrat who has increasingly been compared to Adolf Hitler.<br></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Here are Saturday’s top headlines on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine so far.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Fighting continued across <strong>Ukraine</strong> but the capital, <strong>Kyiv,</strong> remained in Ukrainian hands when night fell. The death toll as of Saturday morning was at least 198, according to the Ukrainian health ministry.</li> 
   <li><strong>Poland</strong> said 115,000 refugees have crossed from Ukraine since the invasion began.</li> 
   <li>More <strong>EU</strong> countries – including <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Italy</strong> and <strong>Greece</strong> – have said they would back a ban on <strong>Russia</strong> using the Swift global payments network in an attempt to pile further pressure on the country after its invasion of <strong>Ukraine</strong>.</li> 
   <li>It comes after countries including <strong>Poland</strong> called for stronger sanctions on <strong>Russia</strong>, and expressed anger at <strong>Germany</strong> for not backing a Swift ban. But there are signs Germany may buckle to pressure and support a full ban.<br></li> 
   <li>People across the world – including in <strong>Manchester</strong>, <strong>London</strong> and <strong>Edinburgh</strong> in the <strong>UK</strong> – took to the streets to condemn <strong>Russia</strong>’s invasion on Saturday.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>Ukraine</strong> is increasing pressure on <strong>Turkey</strong> to close the <strong>Bosphorus</strong> and <strong>Dardanelles</strong> straits to Russian warships, which would block some ships advancing towards Ukraine. Turkey has yet to decide.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>Germany</strong> approved the delivery of 400 RPGs to <strong>Ukraine</strong> by the <strong>Netherlands</strong>, marking a shift in policy from its previous position of not shipping weapons.</li> 
   <li><strong>Kyiv</strong> is under curfew until Monday. The mayor said: “All civilians on the street during the curfew will be considered members of the enemy’s sabotage and reconnaissance groups.”</li> 
   <li><strong>Hungary</strong>’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has said it will support all <strong>EU</strong> sanctions against <strong>Russia</strong> and will not block any.</li> 
   <li><strong>Twitter</strong> said it was aware users in <strong>Russia</strong> were experiencing restricted access, following <strong>Facebook</strong>’s similar announcement on Friday.</li> 
   <li>Countries including <strong>Lithuania</strong>, <strong>Estonia</strong> and <strong>Romania</strong> blocked airspace for <strong>Russian</strong> aircraft, with Russia responding by banning Romanian airliners from Russian airspace.</li> 
   <li><strong>Russian</strong> troops have destroyed a concrete dam in <strong>Ukraine</strong> that stops water flowing into <strong>Crimea</strong>, Reuters reports.</li> 
   <li><strong>India</strong>’s prime minister Narendra Modi said he would help peace efforts.</li>

  <p><strong>Russia</strong> will close its airspace to <strong>Romanian</strong> airliners “due to unfriendly decisions by Romanian aviation authorities”, Russian federal aviation agency Rosaviatsiya said on Saturday. Romania earlier banned Russian airlines from its airspace. <br></p>

  <p>When Yuliia Petrenko, a 31-year-old lawyer originally from <strong>Donetsk</strong>, arrived outside Downing Street for the Stand With <strong>Ukraine</strong> demonstration on Saturday, she started crying.</p> 
  <p>“The first thing I saw was somebody’s little boy with a sign that said ‘Putin is killing my gran’, and I just burst into tears,” Petrenko said.</p> 
  <p>Like many Ukrainians living in the <strong>UK</strong>, Petrenko has experienced a wave of emotions in recent days – fear, anger, frustration, powerlessness, guilt – as she talks to relatives at home experiencing the arrival of war.</p> 
  <p>“At the minute, my auntie, my cousin and their puppy are in a shelter,” she told the Guardian at the rally. They fled the Donetsk region for Kyiv after <strong>Russia</strong>’s 2014 invasion. Now, war has followed them. “It just feels like you’re waiting to wake up from a nightmare,” Petrenko said. “They can’t believe what’s happening, they feel like sitting ducks.”</p> 
  <p>Petrenko joined hundreds of people in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> on Saturday demonstrating their support for Ukraine and revulsion at Russia’s invasion, as diverse crowds expressed their solidarity with Ukrainians and called on western leaders to take stronger action.</p> 
  <p>“Stop Putin, stop the war!” crowds shouted outside the prime minister’s residence. In a separate demonstration eggs were thrown at the Russian embassy in Kensington in outrage at the military incursion that has already killed hundreds and turned a sovereign nation into a battleground.</p>

  <p>Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Thursday that European and US politicians would have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/kyiv-furious-as-eu-wavers-on-banning-russia-from-swift-payment-system">“blood on their hands”</a> if they did not support a ban. The following day, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said a ban did not get the “necessary unanimity” but that it would remain a possibility for future consideration.</p>

  <p>Turkey has so far made no public statements confirming that it has decided to close the straits to Russian warships, although President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with Zelenskiy by phone earlier today, stating that Ankara was attempting to push for an immediate ceasefire.</p> 
  <p>The Russian news agency Interfax said Russia had received no official notification from the Turkish side about the closure of the straits to Russian warships.</p> 
  <p>If Turkey chooses to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to Russian warships, preventing them from accessing the Black Sea, it would be a significant move in terms of both cutting off long-term Russian support to their troops in Ukraine as well as a significant show of support to Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>A ban would prevent Russian warships normally permanently stationed around the world from sailing into the Black Sea to assist troops in Ukraine. However, Turkey is unable to prevent ships permanently stationed in the Black Sea from returning to their bases.</p> 
  <p>The shipping industry experts Lloyds List pointed out yesterday that commercial traffic through the Bosphorus had already slowed significantly in the past two days.</p>

  <p>Turkey’s foreign ministry described the Russian invasion as “unacceptable” but described it as a “military operation” rather than a war, as doing so has implications for the Montreux convention, which lays out Turkish control of the straits. The convention defines Turkish control as well as sets limits on the size, tonnage and duration of warships that can cross the straits, although warships belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea are normally able to pass unrestricted. </p> 
  <p>The foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, laid out Turkey’s position regarding the closure of the straits to Hürriyet yesterday, stating that officials were discussing whether the conflict met the definition of a war under the Montreux convention. If officials decide that the definition has been met, this allows them to block warships from Ukraine and Russia from transiting the straits, although the move is likely to be far more significant for the Russian side.</p> 
  <p>“Turkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits,” he said, adding that the Montreux convention stipulates that “if there is a demand for ships from the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed.”</p> 
  <p>“If we accept the state of war legally, this process will begin,” he added “Secondly, if we accept the state of war we will prohibit the passage of warships … but even if we ban them, the Russians have such a right.”</p> 
  <p>Turkey maintains alliances with both Russia and Ukraine, and has so far emphasised its neutrality in the conflict, despite selling its Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine and condemning Russia’s actions. Turkey’s own Nato membership was put under pressure by its decision to buy Russia’s S400 missile defence system in 2017, although Erdoğan has recently sought to show how much Turkey values membership of the organisation, telling journalists that “Nato should have taken a more decisive step”, earlier this week.</p> 
  <p>The conflict in Ukraine and a rebuke from Russia should Turkey choose to close the straits will probably heavily affect Turkey’s economy, already hobbled from a year where the lira lost half of its value and as rising energy costs spark protests and discontent. Turkey imports roughly a third of its natural gas supply from Russia, and much of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine. <br></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has said it will support all EU sanctions against Russia and will not block any.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking on the Ukraine-Hungary border, he said he supported peace efforts.</p> 
  <p>“Hungary made clear that we support all the sanctions, so we will block nothing, so what the prime ministers of the European Union are able to agree, we accept it and we support it,” he told reporters in English, according to Reuters.</p> 
  <p>Earlier on Saturday he said he agreed with Russia being blocked from the cross-border Swift payments system. Orbán has previously been considered Vladimir Putin’s closest ally among EU member states’ leaders.</p> 
  <p>Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said all sanctions should be up for discussion, ahead of a meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Sholz.</p> 
  <p>“I came to Berlin to shake the conscience of Germany so that they would finally decide on truly harsh sanctions that will influence the Kremlin’s decisions,” Morawiecki said, as fighting took place on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.</p> 
  <p>“We need to shut down Nord Stream 1 and 2, we need to cut reliance on raw materials, cut off Russian financial institutions from capital markets, confiscate assets of oligarchs, close off Swift for Russia … all options should be on the table.”</p>

  <p><strong>A Russian ship has been seized by French officials in the Channel.</strong></p> 
  <p>Reuters said French authorities believed it could be linked to a company suspected of violating trade sanctions linked to the war in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>The BBC has reported French officials as saying: “A 127-metre-long Russia cargo ship called the Baltic Leader transporting cars has been intercepted overnight by the French navy in the Channel and escorted to the Port of Boulogne-sur-Mer in northern France.</p> 
  <p>“It has been taken to the French port after a request by the French government because it is suspected of belonging to a company targeted by EU sanctions against Moscow. French border forces are currently investigating the cargo ship. Crew aboard the Baltic Leader have been cooperating with French authorities.”</p> 
  <p>The ship was taken early on Saturday. The Russian embassy is seeking a formal explanation.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Zelenskiy: 'We will win'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been giving a press briefing this morning and said his country will triumph over Russian forces.</strong></p> 
  <p>He said government forces still controlled Kyiv and “key points around the city”. He said Ukrainian forces would win, and criticised disinformation.</p> 
  <p>In the final section of his speech, he said: “Please stop those who are lying, or trying to lie to you, or lying to us. We need to stop this war. We can live in peace together, globally, as humans. </p> 
  <p>“Our military, our national guard, our national police, our territory defence, special service, nationals of Ukraine, please carry on. We will win. Glory to Ukraine.” </p> 
  <p>Zelenskiy said: “We are successfully holding back the enemies attacks. We know we are defending our land and the future of our children. Kyiv and the key areas are controlled by our army.</p> 
  <p>“The occupiers wanted to set up their puppet in our capital. They didn’t succeed. On our streets, there was a proper fight going on. </p> 
  <p>The enemy was using all its weapons, artillery, paratroops, all its weapons. They are hitting residential areas, they are trying to destroy energy infrastructure, and everyone should help us to stop this occupation.”</p>

  <p>He said that after discussions with EU leaders in recent days, including over shutting Russia out of the Swift payments system (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/feb/26/russia-ukraine-latest-news-fighting-kyiv-zelenskiy-assault-putin-capital?page=with:block-6219f1798f0873d0384b1230#block-6219f1798f0873d0384b1230">9.28am</a>), he believed Ukraine should become part of the EU and its citizens should have the same rights.</p> 
  <p>“Ukrainian people deserve to become members of the EU. And this would be a signal of your support to Ukraine. This discussion should be closed.</p> 
  <p>“We discussed this today with the European leaders. All the equipment and defence military help is coming to Ukraine and work is going on to disconnecting Russia from Swift. I hope that Hungary will be forced to support this decision.”</p> 
  <p>He asked for people who could come back to Ukraine to fight to do so: “In every hour and place, city, and town and person … everywhere where the enemy is killing our people, our armed forces are doing everything they can to destroy the enemy.</p> 
  <p>“Those cities and town that are being attacked from the air are holding up, well done. If you can destroy the occupiers, please do. Everyone who can come back to Ukraine, please do, please come back. </p> 
  <p>“We will have a lot of work to do to rebuild our Ukraine. Everyone who can defend it abroad, do it directly in a united way. Every friend of Ukraine who wants to join Ukraine in defending the country please come over, we will give you weapons. It will be announced very shortly, how this can be done. Everyone who is defending Ukraine is a hero.”</p> 
  <p>He issued another plea to Russian people to help stop the war by putting pressure on Vladimir Putin and his government. Anti-war protesters have been arrested in recent days in Moscow and St Petersburg.</p> 
  <p>“I want everyone in Russia to hear me. Everybody. Hundreds of captured soldiers who are here in Ukraine don’t know why they were sent here to kill people or be killed. People need to tell the government why the war has to be stopped, more people from your country will stay alive.</p> 
  <p>“Your nationals are voicing their opposition to this war. We know many people in Russia are shocked now by the brutality of the Russian government, this is the right reaction, I am grateful to this reaction.”<br></p>

  <p>More from Peter Beaumont in Lviv on a reported attack by Russian paratroopers in Brody, near the city.</p> 
  <p><strong>There is a lot of confusion around claims that three Russian helicopters tried to land troops near Brody, about 100km from Lviv in Ukraine’s west.</strong></p> 
  <p>The major of Lviv, Andrey Sadovy, had this to say on his official page. “At 9 o’clock this morning Russian assault troops landed from three helicopters in vicinity of Brody 60 troops and enemy is withdrawing to the forest. Armed forces are defeating the occupants and the situation is under control.”</p> 
  <p>However, the security services of Ukraine for the Lviv region are disputing this, saying the information about Russian assault troops near Brody “is fake”, adding: “They were Ukrainian helicopters.”</p> 
  <p>Purported video footage of what occurred this morning shows a helicopter firing two missiles. If it was a Ukrainian aircraft, it still leaves open the question of what they were firing at.</p>

  <p><strong>Russia being locked out of the Swift financial payments network has become more likely after Cyprus agreed with the proposal.</strong></p> 
  <p>There have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/24/what-is-swift-international-payments-network-russia-sanction">calls for Russia to be shut out of the system</a>, which facilitates cross-border payments. It is thought that doing so will increase pressure on Russia’s businesses and its economy.</p> 
  <p>The move was announced on Twitter by the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who has also spoken to Italy, Germany and Belgium – where Swift is based.</p> 
  <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had a <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1497502146270531585">call on Saturday morning</a> from the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, to say the move had his backing.</p> 
  <p>While a smaller European nation, Cyprus’s backing is significant because it is a major destination for Russian investment.</p>

  <p>“The Ukrainian resistance to the Russian advance appears extraordinary. All of Russia’s day one objectives of Kharkiv, Kherson , Mariupol, Sumy and even Melitopol, which the Russians are claiming to taken but we can’t see anything on that, are still all in Ukrainian hands.</p> 
  <p>“The fighting on the outskirts of Kyiv overnight, we understand to just be Russian spetsnaz special forces and pockets of paratroopers. The reality is the armoured columns coming down from Belarus and the north to encircle Kyiv are still way off, because they have been held off by this incredible Ukrainian resistance.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>There was heavy fighting in Kyiv overnight, as Russian troops attacked from multiple fronts</strong> in an apparent attempt to seize the city. Ukrainian armed forces said they repelled Russian advances on an army base and a key road.</li> 
   <li><strong>Kyiv’s mayor says 35 people including two children were injured in the fighting.</strong></li> 
   <li><strong>A residential high-rise in Kyiv was hit by a missile</strong>, according to Ukraine’s emergency services.</li> 
   <li><strong>Cruise missiles were reportedly launched at Ukraine from the Black Sea</strong> and, separately, areas near Sumy, Poltava and Mariupol were hit by airstrikes</li> 
   <li><strong>Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has remained defiant,</strong> posting a video from outside his city office on Saturday morning rejecting fake reports he had ordered a surrender. “We are not putting our weapons down, we are going to protect our country,” he said.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>Russia claims it has taken the southeastern city of Melitopol, </strong>according to Russia’s Interfax news agency.

   <li><strong>The leaders of Poland, Lithuania and Germany will meet</strong><strong> in Berlin on Saturday to discuss sanctions on Russia, </strong><strong>Reuters reports.</strong></li> 
   <li>Zelenskiy said he spoke to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, about weapons and equipment “on the way to Ukraine” from their partners.</li> 
   <li><strong>Joe Biden has instructed the US state department to release $350m in military aid</strong> to Ukraine.</li> 
   <li><strong>Russian state media has been banned from running ads or monetising</strong> on any platform anywhere in the world owned by Meta, Facebook’s parent company.</li> 
   <li>A report from the Reuters news agency has suggested it is looking more likely that <strong>Russia could be excluded from the Swift global bank payments system</strong> – a step that some countries had been reluctant to take.</li> 
   <li><strong>Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, </strong>whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people”.<br></li>

  <p><strong>We have some more details on the Russian claim it has seized the city of Melitopol</strong>, from the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont, in Lviv.</p> 
  <p>Russian forces reportedly captured the southeastern Ukrainian city of Melitopol on Saturday, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported. Footage posted on social media on Saturday morning appeared to show Russian armoured vehicles in the streets of the city, although the city’s mayor issued a statement saying it remained under Ukrainian control.</p> 
  <p>The claimed capture of Melitopol follows claims by a senior US defence official that Russia had made an amphibious landing of naval infantry between the Melitopol and the key coastal city of Mariaupol.</p> 
  <p>It was also denied by the UK armed forces minister, James Heappey, who said he did not recognise reports that Ukrainian southern coastal city of Melitopol had fallen to Russian forces, adding that the Russian invasion plan was running “nowhere near” to schedule.</p> 
  <p>Ukrainian officials were not immediately available for comment on the fate of Melitopol, a city of about 150,000 people. If confirmed, it would be the first significant population centre the Russians have seized since their invasion began on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Earlier, Ukrainian officials said Russian forces fired cruise missiles from the Black Sea at Mariupol, as well as Sumy in the north-east and Poltava in the east.</p>

  <p>The Agence France-Presse news service has been interviewing ordinary Ukrainians who have been handed a rifle so they can help defend their country. </p> 
  <p>Yuriy Korchemniy, a historian, has never fired an assault rifle in his life. But he joined scores of others and picked up a Kalashnikov when boxes of them were dumped from trucks and handed out to Ukraine’s new volunteer defence units on day two of Russia’s invasion.</p> 
  <p>“They gave out the rifles, loaded them for us and here we are,” the 35-year-old said with a slightly sheepish grin.</p> 
  <p>“I only know how to shoot single rounds, so my plan is to click this here and switch off the automatic mode.”<br></p> 
  <p>The Kyiv bridge underpass he was guarding with a handful of other men - some in their 50s – leads to Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s administrative complex. The reverse side of the road runs through a working-class district of Soviet-style tower blocks that witnessed a deadly shootout with a small group of Russian forces only a few hours earlier.<br></p> 
  <p>An AFP team saw a middle-aged civilian who was killed in the clash carried away by ambulance workers. One witness said the civilian was cut down by bullets fired by the Russians from a speeding armoured vehicle.</p>

   <p>Throughout Friday night, explosions rocked the capital. Artillery fire could be heard in the streets and as dawn broke, a post on the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ Facebook page said “active combat” was taking place in the city.</p> 
   <p>The Ukrainian military claimed to have repelled one attack by Russian forces on an army base located on a main avenue in the Ukrainian capital. The Russians “attacked one of the military units on Victory Avenue in Kyiv. The attack was repulsed,” Ukraine’s army said on its verified Facebook page, without specifying where exactly the incident took place. There was no comment from the Russian military.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome to our live coverage of the invasion of Ukraine</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hello, this is Helen Davidson with our continuing coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Here are some of the most recent developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Explosions and fighting have rocked the east, west and south of Kyiv, </strong>where the Russian assault has continued overnight in a siege apparently aimed at seizing the city. Residents have been taking cover in shelters and underground stations. A woman has reportedly given birth in one station where she had been sheltering with other residents.<br></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>“This night will be the hardest,” the Ukrainian president, </strong><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy,</strong><strong> said in an address. </strong>“This night the enemy will be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/kyiv-attack-latest-russia-invasion-ukraine">using all available means to break our resistance</a>. This night they will launch an assault.”</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>“More than 50,000 Ukrainian refugees have fled their country in less than 48 hours – a majority to Poland and Moldova,” </strong>said the UN refugee agency head Filippo Grandi, adding that “many more are moving towards its borders”.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces had taken control of the strategic Hostomel airfield to the north-west,</strong> while Russian tanks were filmed by locals in the Obolonskyi district about six miles north of the city centre in the morning.<br><br></li> 
   <li><strong>Ukrainian armed forces say they have repelled Russian attacks on an army base and on a major thoroughfare in Kyiv.</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Vladimir Putin urged the Ukrainian army to overthrow its leadership, </strong>whom he labelled as a “gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis who have has lodged itself in Kyiv and taken hostage the entire Ukrainian people.”</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Prominent Russians have joined protests in Russia or spoken out against the invasion, amid at least 1,800 arrests</strong> <strong>at anti-war rallies. </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/prominent-russians-join-protests-against-ukraine-war-amid-1800-arrests-putin">They include pop stars, chat show hosts and newspaper correspondents</a> who have gone public despite the professional and personal risks that come with dissenting from Vladimir Putin.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The US department of defense said a Russian “amphibious assault” was launched on Mariupol, </strong>a coastal city in south-east Ukraine. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li>A report from the Reuters news agency has suggested it is looking more likely that <strong>Russia could be excluded from the Swift global bank payments system</strong> – a step that some countries had been reluctant to take. Among other sanctions, The EU and the UK have moved to freeze foreign-held assets of Vladimir Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov – largely symbolic, but it<strong> </strong>follows appeals for action from Volodymyr Zelenskiy who said: “When bombs fall on Kyiv, it happens in Europe, not just in Ukraine. When missiles kill our people, they kill all Europeans.”</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Nato will deploy significant extra troops to countries in eastern Europe who are part of the alliance, its secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said.</strong> UK ministers warned there would be no forces going to Ukraine itself to avoid an “existential” war between Russia and the west.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The UN security council has voted on a resolution deploring Russian invasion of Ukraine. </strong>Eleven member states voted for the resolution, three abstained (China, India, and UAE) and one voted against (Russia). As Russia holds a veto the resolution was not upheld.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The Council of Europe suspended Russia over its invasion of Ukraine</strong>. The 47-nation council announced that Russia was suspended with “immediate effect” from the organisation’s committee of ministers and parliamentary assembly on Friday “as a result of the Russian Federation’s armed attack on Ukraine”.<br></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Russia will no longer be allowed to compete in this year’s Eurovision song contest,</strong> with organisers saying its inclusion could “bring the competition into disrepute”.</li>
