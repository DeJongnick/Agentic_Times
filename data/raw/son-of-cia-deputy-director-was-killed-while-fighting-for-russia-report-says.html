<p>An American man identified as the son of a deputy director of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cia">CIA</a> was killed in eastern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> in 2024 while fighting under contract for the Russian military, according to an investigation by independent Russian media.</p> <p>Michael Alexander Gloss, 21, died on 4 April 2024 in “Eastern Europe”, according to an obituary published by his family. He was the son of Juliane Gallina, who was appointed the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/stories/story/cia-names-juliane-gallina-as-deputy-director-for-digital-innovation/">deputy director for digital innovation at the Central Intelligence Agency</a> in February 2024.</p> <p>The story of how the son of a top-ranking US spy died fighting for Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is an unlikely tale of how homegrown anger at the United States and online radicalisation led from a middle-class Virginia childhood to the killing fields of eastern Ukraine.</p> <p>On a VKontakte page attributed to Gloss, a high school football player born to parents who both served in the military, he described himself as “a supporter of the multipolar world. I ran away from home. traveled the world. I hate fascism. I love my homeland.” He also posted the flags of Russia and Palestine.</p> <p>According to the investigative website iStories, <a href="https://istories.media/en/stories/2025/04/25/michael-gloss-story/">Gloss is one of more than 1,500 foreigners who have signed contracts with the Russian military since February 2022</a>. The database for the enrollment office was later leaked, exposing him as having signed the contract in September 2023. Sources told iStories that Gloss had been deployed with “assault units”, those engaged in harsh frontline fighting, in December 2023. An acquaintance said that he had been deployed to a Russian airborne regiment sent to storm Ukrainian positions near the city of Soledar.</p> <p>“With his noble heart and warrior spirit Michael was forging his own hero’s journey when he was tragically killed in Eastern Europe on April 4, 2024,” his family wrote in the obituary, which did not mention Russia and Ukraine or discuss the circumstances of his death.</p> <p>In university, Gloss was active in gender equality and environmental protest circles. He joined Rainbow Family, a leftwing environmental protest group, and in 2023 traveled to Hatay, Turkey, to assist in the recovery following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/turkey-syria-earthquake-2023">the earthquake that killed more than 56,000 people</a>. He had also become increasingly angry at the US for its support of Israel and the war in Gaza.</p> <p>While in Turkey, Gloss began expressing a desire to go on to Russia. “He was usually watching videos about Palestine and was so angry at America,” one acquaintance told iStories. “He started thinking about going to Russia. He wanted to war with the USA. But I think he was very influenced by the conspiracy theory videos.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/12/determined-spy-cia-frank-wisner">The Determined Spy: Frank Wisner, the CIA and a covert career cut short </a> </p> </aside>  <p>After receiving a visa to Russia, he traveled around the country before arriving in Moscow, where he joined the military shortly before his documents expired. Photographs and videos obtained by iStories showed he was sent to a Russian training camp, where he mostly trained alongside <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/07/he-had-no-idea-he-was-being-sent-to-a-war-zone-the-indian-and-nepalese-men-on-frontlines-in-ukraine">Nepali contract soldiers</a>. Three months after enlisting, an acquaintance said, he was deployed to Ukraine as a member of an assault battalion.</p> <p>A number of acquaintances told the outlet that he had not been interested in fighting, but hoped the army would allow him to receive a Russian passport and stay in the country.</p> <p>The circumstances of Gloss’s death are not known. A friend said that his family had been informed by the Russian government of his death but were given little other information. “It was announced that he died within the borders of Ukraine,” the friend wrote. “We do not know whether he participated in the war. They did not provide any other detailed information.”</p> <p>It was not clear whether the Russians performed a background check on Gloss or knew the identity of his mother. The Guardian has approached the CIA for comment on the reports.</p>
