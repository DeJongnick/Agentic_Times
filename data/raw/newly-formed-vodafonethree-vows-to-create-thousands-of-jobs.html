<p>VodafoneThree, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jun/14/vodafone-and-three-agree-merger-to-form-uk-largest-mobile-operator">newly formed</a> leader in the UK’s mobile market, is aiming to more than double its broadband business by 2034 as it pledged to create thousands of jobs and upgrade its network.</p> <p>Vodafone has become the fastest growing provider of home broadband since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/10/vodafone-to-launch-home-broadband-service-in-uk#:~:text=Vodafone%20has%20entered%20the%20UK's,signal%20to%20certain%20household%20devices.">expanding beyond mobile services in 2015</a>, and plans to grow its customer base from 2 million to more than 4 million over the next eight years.</p> <p>VodafoneThree has deals in place with CityFibre and Openreach to target its services to customers, and on Thursday announced a partnership with London-focused Community Fibre.</p> <p>The merger of Vodafone’s UK arm with Three creates a business with 27 million customers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/28/vodafone-says-labour-must-let-it-merge-with-three-uk-to-deliver-nationwide-5g">backed by a pledge to invest £11bn over the next decade</a> to roll out next-generation 5G services across the UK.</p> <p>VodafoneThree plans to close some of its almost 650 stores on high streets and in shopping centres but create about 400 customer service jobs previously outsourced overseas.</p> <p>Three UK has about 290 stores, and Vodafone, which controls 51% of the new UK joint venture, has about 350 outlets.</p> <p>The overlap in many locations means that as VodafoneThree combines its businesses, an unspecified number in close proximity will be shut.</p> <p>However, Max Taylor, the chief executive of VodafoneThree, said there would be no redundancies. “Staff levels will come down over time naturally.”</p> <p>Taylor said that the company would not look to increase its customer base by considering a takeover of the troubled rival telecoms and broadband company TalkTalk.</p> <p>The UK’s fourth-largest telecoms group has about 3.2 million customers but is struggling to stem a customer exodus and is facing financial difficulties, which has made it a potential takeover target<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/11/bt-considers-takeover-move-for-struggling-rival-talktalk">.</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/11/bt-considers-takeover-move-for-struggling-rival-talktalk">BT and Virgin Media O2</a> have looked at the possibility of a bid.</p> <p>James Ratzer, an analyst at New Street Research, said: “We genuinely believe that almost regardless of the price, Vodafone is so focused on the integration of Three UK for the next few years that a TalkTalk integration would not be possible for them to take on.”</p> <p>The £16.5bn VodafoneThree merger, bringing together the third and fourth largest mobile operators in the UK, has been underpinned by a pledge to invest billions in extending 5G mobile coverage across the UK.</p> <p>The new company, which has about 13,500 employees, has said it will provide more than 99% of the UK with 5G coverage by 2034.</p> <p>The first £1.3bn of its £11bn investment will be made this year.</p> <p>The company has said that during the eight-year build period it will create 9,000 jobs annually on average, and as many as 13,000 in the years when investment in the project peaks.</p> <p>The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “I’m delighted that this huge investment is being made in mobile phone network infrastructure, better connecting people with families, loved ones and work by providing stronger, more widespread 5G coverage.”</p>
