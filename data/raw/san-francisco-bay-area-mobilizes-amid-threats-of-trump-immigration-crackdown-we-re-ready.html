<p>It was a whirlwind, disorienting 24 hours in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> Bay Area for local leaders and organizers, who were expecting a major <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/san-francisco-federal-immigration-operation">immigration enforcement operation</a> in the region on Thursday.</p> <p>But by mid-morning, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> announced he was calling off a federal “surge” – and telling residents to “stay tuned” for what would come next.</p> <p>In the uneasy lull, many residents carried on, preparing for the worst.</p> <p>Volunteers organized patrols in areas where day immigrant workers tended to congregate, and launched initiatives to help the children of undocumented workers get to and from school. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in San Francisco and across the bay in Oakland.</p> <p>“I think he’s just trying to mess with us, with our Bay Area,” said Jose Ramirez, 59. He was one of a few hundred people gathered in Fruitvale – a predominantly Latino community in east Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco. “But we’re still out here to support.”</p> <p>Oakland’s mayor, Barbara Lee, had initially said<strong> </strong>she was aware of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents being stationed at the local US Coast Guard based, but was unable clarify whether officers would be deployed in the city until Friday.</p> <p>“I spoke with Alameda county sheriff Yesenia Sanchez, who confirmed through her communications with Ice that border patrol operations are cancelled for the greater Bay Area – which includes Oakland – at this time,” Lee said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/san-francisco-federal-immigration-operation">Trump backs down on sending federal troops to San Francisco for immigration crackdown </a> </p> </aside>  <p>By Thursday night, it remained unclear whether agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">ICE</a>) and CBP were still planning to ramp up enforcement in cities such as Oakland that border San Francisco.</p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to the Guardian’s queries, and instead linked to Trump’s Truth Social post explaining that he had called off federal agents following a call with tech leaders including the Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff. “Friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-san-francisco-troops-silicon-valley">wrote</a>.</p> <p>Local officials and advocates condemned Silicon Valley billionaires, including Benioff, who had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/17/marc-benioff-apologizes-san-francisco-national-guard">previously suggested</a> that Trump should send the national guard troops to the city.</p> <p>“I condemn every tech billionaire who supported this,” said Jackie Fielder, the San Francisco city supervisor representing parts of the city’s Mission neighborhood, home to a large Chicano and the Latino community. Standing at the steps of city hall – and directly facing the massive Salesforce tower looming over the city’s skyline – Fielder said: “We are here because Benioff of Salesforce put forth this idea.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Fielder’s district, volunteers from various community groups were geared up to respond to ramped-up raids.</p> <p>For weeks already, the local non-profit Homies Organizing the Mission to Empower Youth (Homey) had been deploying street patrols, to observe and report ICE activity in the area. Patrollers have yet to intervene in any arrests, said José Luis Pavón, an organizer with the group. “But the patrols are also to build community, to make sure that people know their rights, to also reassure a lot of the people who are scared, to involve small-business owners, to involve neighbors, to really strengthen the community,” he said.</p>    <p>Following months of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/20/trump-san-francisco-troops">threats</a> from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> to ramp up law enforcement and immigration raids in the city, the neighborhood is now prepared to respond, Pavón said: “I feel like people are starting to lose their fear. People are getting a lot more practical.”</p> <p>Bay Resistance, a social justice non-profit, said it would continue to send volunteers to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/home-depot-ice-raids-los-angeles">Home Depot stores</a> and other areas where day laborers tend to congregate and work, to monitor for immigration agents and help inform workers about their legal rights. The Latino Task Force said it would drive students of undocumented parents to schools across the city.</p> <p>“We’re ready,” said Lisa Knox, co-executive director of California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, a non-profit that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/27/immigrants-california-detention-facility">supports people in immigration detention</a>. “We always say ‘power, not panic’. We’re focused on getting the message out to the community that they are not alone, people have rights if they encounter ICE or federal agents, and there are rapid response networks that can provide support if they are arrested. Yes, this is frightening, but communities can organize to defend themselves.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>We’re not taking Trump at his word. He’s equivocated before. We’re sticking with our plans</p> <footer> <cite>Lisa Knox, California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Groups were coordinating across the region to ensure they could mobilize wherever ICE shows up, and advocates had learned lessons from efforts in Los Angeles and Chicago, Knox said. The president’s announcement that he was calling off the troops did not alter preparations, she added: “We’re not taking Trump at his word. He’s equivocated before. We’re sticking with our plans.”</p> <p>In Fruitvale, which has one of the highest concentrations of immigrants and non--citizens in Oakland, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/16/los-angeles-trump-ice-immigration-raids">street vendors</a> said they had seen much less foot traffic than usual. The farmers’ market, held in the plaza outside the transit station, was quieter than usual.</p> <p>“We cannot let this happen – where people are afraid to get out of the house, where people are afraid to be seen,” said Rosemary, an 18-year-old community college student who joined the protest. She and her loved ones – almost all of whom are immigrants – created a group chat to check in with one another each hour, she said, to make sure they’re safe.</p> <p>Jaime, an English language development teacher who works with elementary and middle school students in the neighborhood, said she joined up to show solidarity with her students and their families – most of whom are immigrants. Earlier that day, teachers hosted a brown bag lunch for students who were worried about a major federal deployment in the region. A group of about 20 students strategized how to create fundraisers for the families most affected by immigration raids, and reviewed information about immigrants’ legal rights to share with friends and families.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/texas-ice-shooting-miguel-garcia-hernandez-widow">Widow of man shot at Texas ICE facility wonders if political violence is to blame</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Unfortunately … a lot of what is happening won’t feel new to our students,” said Nick, a fellow teacher. “It’s not the first time that their families have felt threatened by the presence of ICE or other immigration officials. It’s not the first time they’ve heard of members of our school community being threatened with deportation or being deported.” The Guardian is not using the teachers’ last names at their request, to protect their students.</p> <p>By Thursday evening as the sun set over the San Francisco Bay, hundreds of protesters walked from Fruitvale, along Oakland’s industrial corridors towards the entrance of the Coast Guard base.</p> <p>Gabriela DelaRiva, a retired nurse who lived in Alameda – the city where the base is located – began to tear up. Her grandmother, she said, had come to the US from Zacatecas, Mexico, as a child, and worked at canneries in California’s agricultural Central valley. And DelaRiva grew up to be an activist – she had marched for labor rights, and against various US military interventions and wars.</p> <p>“To see progress, and then to see these things going backwards, it’s very distressing, very painful,” she said. “But I’m so proud to be in the Bay Area where people do get activated.”</p> <p><em>Sam Levin contributed reporting</em></p>
