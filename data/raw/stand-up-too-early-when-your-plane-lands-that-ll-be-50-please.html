<p><strong>Name:</strong> Aeroplane etiquette.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Dates to 1903, when Wilbur Wright ceded his seat to his brother Orville for the first powered flight.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> For the most part, long gone.</p> <p><strong>What happened to it? </strong>Stress tends to make people less self-aware – and therefore less polite – and air travel seems to get more stressful with each passing year.</p> <p><strong>I guess you can’t force people to be courteous. </strong>You can try. The Turkish Directorate General of Civil Aviation has just announced compliance measures for passengers who stand up too early on landing.</p> <p><strong>How early is too early? </strong>Before the plane has stopped taxiing.</p> <p><strong>Well, obviously. That’s dangerous, and anyway, you’re not going to get anywhere at that point. </strong>But also, before it’s your go.</p> <p><strong>What do you mean, my go? </strong>According to the announcement, you may not “stand up or proceed into the aisle before it is your turn to exit”.</p> <p><strong>And what happens if you do? </strong>“Passengers who do not comply with the rules will be reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation through a Disruptive Passenger Report, and an administrative fine will be imposed.”</p> <p><strong>How much? </strong>According to some reports, 2,603 Turkish lira, or £50.</p> <p><strong>Harsh. Then again, if it happened to a couple of people on my next flight it would brighten my day considerably. </strong>It’s hard to travel these days without wishing punishment on others.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/13/fighting-on-a-plane-is-not-a-good-idea-and-i-should-know">Fighting on a plane is not a good idea – and I should know | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>What other breaches ought to incur hefty fines? </strong>As you can imagine, this is a hot topic, but two iron rules of plane etiquette crop up again and again. First, keep your shoes on.</p> <p><strong>For the whole flight? </strong>At a minimum, wear socks. Absolutely no bare feet.</p> <p><strong>And the second? </strong>The person in the aisle seat has the aisle, and the window seat passenger has the window. Therefore the person in the middle seat gets command of both armrests.</p> <p><strong>What about reclining your seat? Yes or no? </strong>A matter of much dispute – some people believe that if your seat is reclinable, then it’s your right to recline it.</p> <p><strong>There’s a certain </strong><strong>logic to that. </strong>Others think it’s always rude. But the dispute itself can get you into trouble. Last year, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyvd4yjj8xo">Cathay Pacific banned a couple</a> for harassing a passenger who had dared to recline the seat in front of them.</p> <p><strong>This is why I wear headphones. </strong>True – it’s easier to be rude when you can’t hear anything.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Manners cost nothing, unlike business class.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “I will gladly pay £50 to get away from these people 40 seconds sooner.”</p>
