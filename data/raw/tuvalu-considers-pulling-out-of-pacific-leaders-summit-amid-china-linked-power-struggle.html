<p>Tuvalu’s prime minister Feletei Teo said his country may pull out of the region’s top political meeting next month, after host nation Solomon Islands moved to block all external partners – including China, US and Taiwan – from attending.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/07/pacific-islands-forum-what-is-it-and-why-does-it-matter">Pacific Islands Forum</a> leaders meeting will be held in Honiara in September. On 7 August, Solomon Islands prime minister Jeremiah Manele <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/solomon-islands-blocks-us-china-taiwan-pacifics-top-political-meet-2025-08-07/">told parliament that no dialogue partners</a> would be invited to the annual gathering.</p> <p>Countries outside the Pacific, known as “dialogue partners,” have attended the forum since 1989, to work with Pacific leaders and contribute to discussions around development and regional security. While not an official partner, Taiwan has attended the meetings as a “development partner” for more than three decades.</p> <p>The decision by Honiara, a close ally of Beijing, has fuelled speculation the move was aimed at keeping Taiwan out of the meeting. It has raised questions over China’s growing sway in Pacific diplomacy and whether regional unity can hold.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/14/caught-in-the-contest-between-china-and-the-west-the-cook-islands-asks-where-its-future-lies">Caught in the contest between China and the west, the Cook Islands asks where its future lies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tuvalu, along with the Marshall Islands and Palau, are the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/24/culture-democracy-and-clout-why-three-pacific-countries-are-sticking-with-taiwan">only Pacific countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan</a>, in what Beijing views as an affront to its One China principle.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Teo said he would wait to see how other Pacific leaders respond before deciding whether or not to attend the forum next month, expressing “disappointment” at the last-minute exclusion of external countries.</p> <p>“The region does not need these kinds of distractions,” Teo said. “We have far more important issues to focus on, rather than letting ourselves be pressured from outside.”</p> <p>Teo said he had written to Manele outlining concerns around the inconvenient timing of the decision, and his “difficulties supporting the justification” behind the move.</p> <p>“We’ll … see what the rest of the leaders’ response is to the proposal by the Solomons, and then we’ll make our decision,” he said.</p> <p>“I’ll wait for the final decision on this arrangement, and then reconsider my participation,” he said.</p> <p>The annual forum is the main mechanism through which leaders define region-wide policy agendas.</p> <p>Teo added he “won’t be surprised” if China was behind the decision to block partners from the forum, saying the unusual move broke with decades of precedent in the region.</p> <p>“There is no denying that China is trying to extend its footprint in the Pacific, and so is the US,” Teo said.</p> <p>“My own personal view is that we do need their development assistance, but we do not need the competition and conflict overshadowing our development agenda in the Pacific.”</p>    <p>The Guardian contacted China’s embassy in Honiara for comment.</p> <p>A US state department spokesperson said Washington was “disappointed” by the move to exclude partners, and reaffirmed support for the attendance of all partners, including Taiwan, at the forum.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/trump-administration-asks-tiny-pacific-nation-of-palau-to-accept-migrants-deported-from-us">Trump administration asks tiny Pacific nation of Palau to accept migrants deported from US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“All [forum] partners, and that includes Taiwan, should be invited to participate … regardless of where it is hosted – just as countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan invite all dialogue partners, including China,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>Taiwan said it “urges that that existing arrangements be maintained”, adding that its participation at the Pacific meetings would “further strengthen cooperation”.</p> <p>Not all of Taiwan’s Pacific allies have opposed the decision to exlude foreign attenders to the forum.</p> <p>Palau, which will host the forum in 2026, says it “respects and acknowledges” Solomon Islands’ decision to block all foreign attendees, with the office of the president saying it allows members “to focus on the critical intra-regional issues at this year’s forum”.</p> <p>Solomon Islands <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/08/when-china-came-calling-inside-the-solomon-islands-switch">switched diplomatic allegiances from Taiwan to China</a> in 2019 and three years later, the countries signed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/the-deal-that-shocked-the-world-inside-the-china-solomons-security-pact">controversial security pact</a> . Honiara has also received significant Chinese funding,<a href="https://solomons.gov.sb/prc-assists-sig-with-usd-1-million-towards-hosting-of-54th-pif-leaders-meeting/"> including a recent $US1m donation to buy 27 cars to transport delegates during the forum</a>.</p> <p>Dr Sarina Theys, senior lecturer in diplomacy and international affairs at the University of the South Pacific, said Solomon Islands’ decision may be an attempt to avoid openly choosing between China and Taiwan.</p> <p>“The only way to do that is then to just not invite anyone,” Theys said.</p> <p>Niuone Eliuta, first secretary at the Tuvalu High Commission in New Zealand, said he had “no doubt China is behind this decision” to block external partners from the upcoming forum.</p> <p>“This day and age China is very much influencing what’s going on in the Pacific,” Eliuta said, adding that excluding donor partners could mean countries miss out on vital support such as climate funding.</p> <p>“This is a temporary fix, moving development dialogue partners out of the Solomon Islands,” Eliuta said. “I just hope no countries break away from PIF.”</p> <p>Concerns over Beijing’s influence on the Forum are not new. At last year’s meeting in Tonga, segments of the Pacific leader’s communique that referenced Taiwan were altered, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/30/pacific-islands-forum-communique-taken-down-after-chinese-envoy-calls-taiwan-reference-unacceptable">a decision many believe to be an outcome of China’s influence</a>. In 2022, two Chinese defence attaches <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/13/two-chinese-defence-attaches-removed-from-pacific-islands-forum-meeting">were ejected from the Forum’s meeting in Suva</a> while caught listening to a visual address given by US vice-president Kamala Harris.</p>
