<p>Arne Slot claimed Liverpool silenced the doubters with victory over Newcastle, with an increased lead of 13&nbsp;points at the top of the Premier League validating his decision to rest senior players in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/09/plymouth-liverpool-fa-cup-match-report">FA Cup exit at Plymouth</a>.</p> <p>Liverpool stretched their lead over Arsenal with a convincing defeat of Eddie Howe’s side, whom they face in the Carabao Cup final in 18 days’ time, to build on Sunday’s impressive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/23/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">win at Manchester City</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/26/liverpool-newcastle-premier-league-match-report">Liverpool go 13 points clear after Mac Allister completes stroll past Newcastle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“What impressed me most was the mental strength in both games,” said the Liverpool head coach. “After Everton and Wolves people started to question us a bit. Normally when players get questioned you see extra work rate from them, so that’s normal, but if you get a lot of compliments eight out of 10 players can get complacent but these players found an extra gear. We weren’t perfect, we lost more simple balls than we usually do, but the mentality of the team and the squad was great.”</p> <p>Liverpool have established a commanding lead with only 10 league games remaining. Slot has given his squad two days off before they reconvene for the Champions League last-16 first-leg tie at Paris Saint-Germain next Wednesday.</p> <p>Slot added: “This was our fifth game in 15 games and the four before were not simple games. We all know how emotional Everton was, then Wolves and two difficult away games at Villa and City so to show up the way we did tonight, and hardly concede a chance against a very good team like Newcastle, is a big compliment to how the players handled these 15&nbsp;days.</p> <p>“It is the biggest reason why I didn’t take the players to Plymouth and why I didn’t take them to PSV Eindhoven as well. They need to have a break once in a while. I am a bit disappointed we don’t play at the weekend because of course Mo [Salah] and Virgil [van Dijk] wouldn’t have played [in the FA Cup]. It would have been ideal for Harvey [Elliott] and Jarell [Quansah] but unfortunately we are out.”</p> <p>Newcastle were without Alexander Isak at Anfield after their leading striker reported a groin problem. Howe, who was also without Joelinton and Sven Botman, hopes all three will be available when they meet Liverpool at Wembley.</p> <p>Howe said of the defeat: “I thought we played pretty well. What I don’t understand was the two goals. We should never concede from those situations, we have enough bodies back but we just don’t mark the men. I’m really disappointed with that aspect of our play but in between the boxes I thought we were competitive.”</p>
