Gaetz is hopeful that the future president will deliver.</em></p> <p><em>“I advocated for a pardon for Mr</em><em> Snowden extensively. That did not give Mr</em><em> Trump any apprehension in his nominating me. I would have recommended that as attorney general,” Gaetz said Monday. “I have discussed the matter with others in and around the transition, and there seemed to be pretty broad support for a pardon.”</em></p> <p><em>Trump’s Health and Human Services secretary pick, Robert F</em><em> Kennedy Jr., campaigned for president on the promise of a “day one” pardon of Snowden and building a Washington monument in his honor.

SB 1 warrants heightened scrutiny under decades of precedent because the sixth circuit failed to apply that standard, this court should vacate and remand.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-12-04T16:29:41.972Z">at 4.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67507ae38f08921c0f5020ba" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-12-04T15:58:13.588Z">3.58pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Conservative justice Brett Kavanaugh brought up the possibility that minors who receive gender-affirming care could later regret doing so.</strong></p> <p>“You say there are benefits from allowing these treatments, but there are also harms, right, from allowing these treatments, at least the state says so, including lost fertility, the physical and psychological effects on those who later change their mind and want to detransition, which I don’t think we can ignore,” Kavanaugh said.</p> <p>Solicitor general <strong>Elizabeth Prelogar</strong> replied that the alternative is to force young people with gender dysphoria to receive care only after they go through puberty – which can have long-lasting and negative psychological impacts:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The record evidence demonstrates that the rates of regret are very low for the population that has access to this treatment. So these are adolescents who have marked and sustained gender dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of puberty. They are very likely to persist in their gender identity. But if you’re thinking about this from the standpoint of, there’s no harm in just making them wait until they’re adults, I think you have to recognize that the effect of denying this care is to produce irreversible physical effects that are consistent with their birth sex, because they have to go through puberty before they turn 18.</p> <p>So, essentially, what this law is doing is saying we’re going to make all adolescents in the state develop the physical secondary sex characteristics consistent with their gender or with their sex assigned at birth, even though that might significantly worsen gender dysphoria, increase the risk of suicide, and, I think, critically, make it much harder to live and be accepted in their gender identity as an adult. Because if you’re requiring someone to undergo a male puberty, and they develop an Adam’s apple, that’s going to be hard to reverse, and they’re more likely to be identified as transgender and subject to discrimination and harassment as adults.</p> <p>So, I think the relevant question is, you have this population of adolescents, and there are documented very essential benefits for a large number of them, and maybe a small number that will regret this care, just like with any other medical care, but for the state to come in and just say, across the board, you can’t have the medication because of your birth sex – we don’t think that’s a tailored law.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-12-04T16:05:58.108Z">at 4.05pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-675079338f08921c0f5020b6" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/joan-greve"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-12-04T15:49:05.253Z">3.49pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The court’s conservatives, including the chief justice, John Roberts, appeared to suggest that this particular case differed from other cases related to sex discrimination because of its medical ramifications.</strong></p> <p>“It seems to me that the medical issues are much more heavily involved than in many of the cases that you look to,” Roberts told solicitor general <strong>Elizabeth</strong> <strong>Prelogar</strong>.</p> <p>“And if that’s true, doesn’t that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than try to determine them for ourselves?”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-12-04T15:53:38.479Z">at 3.53pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-675076c88f08e2ec1de21398" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-12-04T15:41:12.176Z">3.41pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The first questions were from conservative justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and John Roberts, who signaled skepticism with Elizabeth Prelogar’s arguments.</strong></p> <p>The solicitor general got a more understanding reception from liberal justice <strong>Sonia Sotomayor</strong>, who focused on the law’s impacts on transgender youths.</p> <p>“One of the petitioners in this case describes throwing up every day, going almost mute … because of their inability to speak in a voice that they could live with.

And the problem with Tennessee’s law here is not that it’s just a little bit over-inclusive or a little bit under-inclusive, but that it’s a sweeping, categorical ban where the legislature didn’t even take into account the significant health benefits that can come from providing gender-affirming care, including reduced suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and where the state leaves unregulated entirely access to these treatments in all of their pediatric contexts, where there’s a similar risk-benefit trade-off and for the families affected by this, Justice Sotomayor, these are difficult decisions.</p> <p>Obviously, anytime you’re thinking about a medical intervention, you need to weigh risks and benefits, but the state has come in here, and in a sharp departure from how it normally addresses this issue, it has completely decided to override the views of the parents, the patients, the doctors who are grappling with these decisions and trying to make those trade-offs.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-12-04T15:48:38.714Z">at 3.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6750729e8f08e2ec1de21364" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-12-04T15:20:36.071Z">3.20pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Arguing for the Biden administration, solicitor general Elizabeth Prelogar began by saying the Tennessee law, known as SB 1, unfairly singles out gender-affirming care in a way similar procedures do not face.</strong></p> <p>“To be clear, states have leeway to regulate gender-affirming care, but here, Tennessee made no attempt to tailor its law to its stated health concerns.

You are that man (and have been for years) and as your mother, it pains me and embarrasses me to say that, but it is the sad, sad truth.”</p> <p>Speaking to Fox, Penelope Hegseth said she sent that email in the midst of her son’s divorce and retracted it hours later:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Pete and his wife at the time were going through a very difficult divorce. It was a very emotional time, and I’m sure many of you across the country understand how difficult divorce is on a family. There’s emotions. We say things, and I wrote that in haste. I wrote that with deep emotions. I wrote that as a parent, and about two hours later … my husband tells me I should think through things a little bit more, but Pete and I are both very passionate people. I wrote that out of love, and about two hours later I retracted it with an apology email.

Things are not looking great for the prospect of the Senate confirming <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s nominee for defense secretary, <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>,<strong> </strong>to the job. The former Fox News host was one of the first picks Trump made after winning re-election, but in the weeks since, news broke that Hegseth was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/02/pete-hegseth-non-profit-allegations">accused of sexual assault</a>, which he denies, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/03/pete-hegseth-defense-department-alcohol-use">known to drink excessively</a> and allegedly financially mismanaged two charities. Over the past few hours, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/us/politics/hegseth-trump-defense.html">reports</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-mulls-replacing-pete-hegseth-with-florida-gov-ron-desantis-8f682ad2?mod=hp_lead_pos1">have</a> emerged that it’s all becoming too much for the Republican senators tasked with confirming him, and that Trump is considering pulling the nomination and instead asking Florida’s governor and one-time rival <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong> to lead the Pentagon.</p> <p>But it’s not over yet for Hegseth. His mother, who wrote an email criticizing him for his treatment of women, gave an interview to Fox News this morning billed as setting the record straight, while Hegseth will today be on Capitol Hill for further meetings with lawmakers who will decide his fate. We’ll see if his nomination survives the day.</p> <p>Here’s what else is going on:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The supreme court</strong> will at 10am ET begin hearing arguments <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us?INTCMP=CE_US">in a case</a> concerning Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming treatment for minors, which could have implications nationwide.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The precise balance of power</strong> in the House of Representatives has been determined. With ballot counting finally finished in <a href="https://x.com/AP_Politics/status/1864185949866922211">a tight race in central California</a>, Republicans will control the chamber with 220 seats to the Democrats’ 215 – but the GOP’s majority will immediately shrink as several lawmakers head for jobs in Trump’s cabinet.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> continues his trip to Angola, and will be heading back to the US later today.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-12-04T14:08:49.551Z">at 2.08pm GMT</time></p>  </div>
