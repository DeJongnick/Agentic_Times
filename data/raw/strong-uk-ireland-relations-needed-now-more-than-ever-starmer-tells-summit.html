<p>Keir Starmer has pledged a new era in Anglo-Irish relations after years of toxicity caused by Brexit as he opened a summit between the British and Irish governments in Cheshire.</p> <p>Speaking at the first instalment of what will be an annual UK-Ireland summit, he said the need for a strong relationship between the two countries had never been greater. In turbulent times there were huge benefits to friendship between the two countries, he said in his opening remarks.</p> <p>In turn, the taoiseach, Micheál Martin, thanked Starmer for being the “centre of gravity and stability” at a time of crisis when decades of transatlantic relations had been upended by Donald Trump.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--supporting"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/06/uk-and-ireland-announce-deal-connecting-offshore-windfarms-to-energy-networks">UK and Ireland announce deal connecting offshore windfarms to energy networks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The UK prime minister said he wanted to focus on three themes during the meeting: Britain and Ireland working together to achieve economic growth, domestic security and the transition to net zero.</p> <p>Starmer said: “Today’s summit really marks a new era in the relationship between the UK and Ireland. I think we’ve <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/sep/07/keir-starmer-optimistic-for-deep-reset-of-relations-with-ireland">reset our relationship</a>, turned a page on the turbulent years, if I may say, in recent years.</p> <p>“As we sit here today, I think we would all agree that the world is more uncertain and unstable than it has been for a very long time and there are huge benefits to strengthening our friendship and working together on geopolitical challenges.”</p> <p>Starmer said Thursday’s discussions, which also involved ministerial delegations on education, trade, energy and home affairs, were just the start of what “should be seen as a new era”.</p> <p>Bonds between the two countries were severely tested during Brexit years with distrust of Boris Johnson and frustration with his predecessor Theresa May rupturing Anglo-Irish relations.</p> <p>On Thursday Martin renewed Ireland’s pledge to help the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/dec/14/brexit-reset-five-business-leaders-on-how-theyd-like-relations-with-the-eu-to-change">reset its relationship with the wider EU</a>.</p> <p>Before the summit the Irish prime minister said he would do “anything” to facilitate greater ties with the EU, reducing trade barriers caused by Brexit where possible. Martin was speaking after a meeting with Starmer. “It’s an extremely important relationship for Ireland and when the UK economy does well, the Irish economy does well.</p> <p>“So as far as we are concerned this is a joint effort and endeavour and in that context, as I’ve said to the prime minister, anything we can do to facilitate greater harmony and access to the EU markets the better in terms of goods and services. Or, to put it another way, reduce barriers if that’s possible.”</p> <p>Starmer described the summit as “really successful” with environment, energy, justice and home affairs ministers also attending the summit from both sides.</p> <p>Earlier the two prime ministers announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/06/uk-and-ireland-announce-deal-connecting-offshore-windfarms-to-energy-networks">closer collaboration on subsea energy infrastructure</a> to “harness the full potential” of the Irish and Celtic seas as part of ongoing efforts to reset post-Brexit relations.</p> <p>The pact includes a new data-sharing arrangement to lay the groundwork for connections between the growing number of offshore windfarms and onshore national energy networks. They say it will cut red tape and minimise “the burden of maritime and environmental consent processes for developers”.</p> <p>They have also undertaken to map the sea basin as part of wider concerns about development but also security of subsea cables.</p> <p>Separately Ireland unveiled a £180m package of investment in the UK.</p>
