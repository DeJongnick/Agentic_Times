<p>Australian employers commonly offer paid parental leave – in addition to the government scheme – to attract and retain workers in a competitive jobs market.</p> <p>But the largest listed childcare provider in Australia, G8 Education, has no such policy, drawing the attention of activist shareholders who want to pressure it to change.</p> <p>James Alexander, from the Sustainable Investment Exchange (Six), said the platform was preparing to lodge a shareholder resolution on the issue at the education provider’s annual general meeting in May.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/09/google-maps-turns-20-anniversary-feature">Google Maps changed the way we get around.

Large investors with at least 5% of voting rights have the same rights.</p> <p>While the results of a resolution are non-binding, such strategies are frequently used overseas to express shareholder views, which can prompt a board to take action or risk an investor backlash.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Alexander said the campaign had the support of major investment and superannuation funds to change G8’s policy.</p> <p>A G8 spokesperson said the company provided team members with meaningful benefits that included staff childcare discounts, six weeks of annual leave for teachers and above-award pay.</p> <p>“At G8 Education we recognise that our team members are our biggest asset, and we do our best to provide a supportive and inclusive working environment,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>The spokesperson said the company would “continue to evaluate our employment terms, conditions, and benefits”.</p> <p>G8 runs more than 430 childcare centres around Australia and employs about 10,000 people, mainly women.</p> <p>The sector has modest pay levels and experiences significant turnover rates, prompting Labor to strike a deal last year to give early childhood education workers a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/07/australia-childcare-workers-pay-rise-labor-government">government-funded 15% pay rise</a>, phased in over two years, if centres limit fee increases.</p> <p>About 68% of employers in Australia offer employer-paid parental leave, in addition to the government scheme, according to 2023-24 data. The percentage has been rising quickly, with some organisations now offering equal parental leave for men and women.</p> <p>Parental schemes are now expected among major companies, with some legal and accounting firms offering up to six months of paid leave in addition to the government’s minimum wage scheme.</p> <p>Many miners have also sought to become more family friendly and now offer at least 18 weeks of paid leave for parents of newborn or newly adopted children.</p> <p>Childcare providers tend to have more modest schemes, ranging from zero to 11 weeks of employer-paid leave, according to G8 analysis. Many are not-for-profit providers.</p> <p>The chief executive of the advocacy group The Parenthood, Georgie Dent, said while parental leave was primarily a health policy, it also had financial advantages for companies.</p> <p>“A lot of larger employers have used their parental leave settings as a key tool to attract and retain staff,” Dent said. “The evidence base is really clear that paying parental leave is far more cost effective than constantly recruiting to replace staff.”</p> <p>She said paid parental leave schemes were also leading to greater workforce participation, which was good for the broader economy.</p> <p>“It really does keep parents connected to their employer,” Dent said. “When you have that connection, it becomes perfectly normal and reasonable for people to go off and have a baby, and then normal for them to return when they are ready.”</p>
