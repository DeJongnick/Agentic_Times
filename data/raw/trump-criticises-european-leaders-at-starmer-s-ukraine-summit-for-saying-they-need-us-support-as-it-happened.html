When the Lib Dem leader <strong>Ed Davey</strong> put it to him that the US was no longer a reliable ally on matters relating to Russia, <strong>Starmer</strong> said he disagreed. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/03/peter-mandelson-ukraine-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-67c5d0d08f08962cd47bec5f#block-67c5d0d08f08962cd47bec5f">4.01pm</a>.) And, in response to another question, he said the UK had never split from the US before and should not start now. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/03/peter-mandelson-ukraine-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-67c5d58f8f0837a34020602a#block-67c5d58f8f0837a34020602a">4.19pm</a>.) Starmer also restated his call for a peace deal in Ukraine to backed up by a robust US security guarantee. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/mar/03/peter-mandelson-ukraine-donald-trump-volodymyr-zelenskyy-keir-starmer-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-67c5da018f086243b8dc08bd#block-67c5da018f086243b8dc08bd"> 4.41pm</a>.) But, as Starmer was speaking, <strong>President Trump</strong> issued a new statement mocking the European “show of strength against Russia” – boosting fears that the transatlantic alliance is being tested as never before.

Doesn’t mean for a minute that Vance and Trump - I’m not defending what they did.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Farage defended the journalist who criticised Zelenskyy for wearing his trademark military-style sweatshirt to the meeting, not a suit.</strong> </p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>You know what? If I turned up on the White House.

If Zelenskyy wants to bowl in and show no respect to a man who we all know is incredibly old fashioned about this stuff … if you are going in with a positive mindset, maybe Zelenskyy should have thought about that.</p> </blockquote> <p>And he defended criticising Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit in the Oval Office but not Elon Musk.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Musk isn’t negotiating with Trump, and Musk isn’t asking for billions of dollars from Trump, and Musk isn’t asking for military support from Trump.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Farage said he was “surprised” that Trump told Starmer he was inclined to support the Chagos Islands sovereignty deal. </strong>For weeks Farage has been saying that, from his contacts with people inside the Trump administration, he believed Trump was opposed to it.

PA says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Keir Starmer convened an emergency defence summit of European leaders at the weekend, telling European powers they must realise it is “time to act”, and warned they stand at a “crossroads in history” as he committed £1.6bn in support for Ukraine.</p> <p><strong>The Times</strong> praises the PM’s call for a “coalition of the willing” from Ukraine’s European allies, but warns the power of any peacekeeping force would be limited without US firepower.</p> <p>The paper says: “The risk is that Sir Keir is talking himself into a deployment that could result in Britain’s threadbare army fighting with no US help. After decades of freeloading on defence, Europe would be hard put to field anything but a token force in Ukraine. Sir Keir must try to lower the temperature and re-establish unity. At the same time he must tread carefully on an openended commitment. Britain’s forces should not be asked to write cheques they cannot cover.”</p> <p>The <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> agrees with the PM’s remarks that Europe is “at a crossroads”, writing in a leading article that the continent “needs to adapt” to US “disengagement”.</p> <p>However, the paper says Vladimir Putin will ultimately benefit from the evolving schism between the US and Europe.</p> <p>Those sentiments are echoed by the <strong>Daily Mirror</strong>, which writes in a leading article: “It is worth trying to pull Trump back from the brink to stop any sweetheart deal with Putin to the detriment of Ukraine. But Starmer recognises Britain and Europe must hope for the best, while preparing for the worst.”</p> <p>The <strong>Daily Express</strong> lauds the PM’s role in showcasing “Britain’s reputation and clout on the world stage”. “Fair play to Sir Keir Starmer, he has acted with the calmness of an international statesman in dealing with a crisis,” the paper’s editorial states.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <strong>Independent</strong> says the prime minister has “adopted the role of peacemaker and… bridge-builder between America and Europe to resolve the latest crisis over Ukraine”. The paper’s editorial adds: “The framework for a peace plan created by Europeans for Europeans is being created – a crucial initiative and one that should give fresh momentum after the debacle at the White House on Friday.”</p> <p>The <strong>Sun</strong> calls on European nations who have not yet offered their full support to Ukraine to do so, writing: “Europe needs to act decisively now in Ukraine’s defence — and its own — if there is to be a chance of seeing off the threat from Putin and securing a just and lasting peace.”</p> <p>The <strong>Daily Mail</strong> says the PM is about to enter “the ultimate test” of his statesmanship. An editorial states: “His principal mission is to keep the US within Nato. Without American military might, guaranteeing European security will be infinitely harder. Equally, he can’t allow Ukraine to be sold down the river. It is a delicate diplomatic balance.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-03-03T09:52:31.841Z">at 9.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67c576cf8f08962cd47be7db" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-03-03T09:32:49.325Z">9.32am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Turning back to Ukraine, <strong>Farage</strong> says President Zelenskyy needs to call elections as soon as a peace deal is agreed.</p> <p>He says that, in saying Zelenskyy needs to be realistic and make up with President Trump, he is just saying what Peter Mandelson has been saying.</p> <p>And that’s the end of the Farage phone-in.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67c576238f08962cd47be7d5" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-03-03T09:30:47.932Z">9.30am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The next caller suggests it is time for Farage to resign as Reform UK leader.

But many Europeans who watched President Trump and JD Vance bully and belittle President Zelenskyy on camera in the Oval Office on Friday will have come to a different conclusion.</p> <p>Starmer is expected to make a statement to MPs about his visit to the White House, and yesterday’s summit in London, and that should start after 3.30pm.</p> <p>Here is our overnight story about yesterday’s summit.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/keir-starmer-europe-crossroads-history-must-support-ukraine">Keir Starmer says Europe ‘at crossroads in history’ and must support Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Luke Pollard</strong>, the defence minister, has been giving interviews this morning, and one issue he has had to address is a comment from <strong>Peter Mandelson,</strong> the former Labour cabinet minister and new UK ambassador to Washington, which implied that London is siding more with Trump than Zelenskyy. In an interview with ABC yesterday, Mandelson said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We need a very radical reset. The reset has to consist of the US and Ukraine getting back on the same page. And President Zelenskyy giving his unequivocal backing to the initiative that President Trump is taking to end the war and to bring a just and lasting peace to Ukraine.</p> <p>And the Europeans too need to back the calls for a ceasefire. And by the way, I think that Ukraine should be the first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow.</p> </blockquote> <p>This provoked an angry backlash in the UK. <strong>James Cleverly</strong>, the Conservative former foreign secretary, posted this response <a href="https://x.com/JamesCleverly/status/1896300935082803629">on social media.</a></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The UK ambassador to Washington isn’t meant to communicate his own opinion, he is meant to communicate the UK government opinion.</p> <p>Lammy and Starmer need to grip this.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Ed Davey,</strong> the Lib Dem leader, <a href="https://x.com/EdwardJDavey/status/1896251905338417370">posted this</a>.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>What is Mandelson up to? You cannot square what the Prime Minister said this morning with this. What is the Government’s actual position?</p> <p>Our man in DC should be securing US protection for our brave Ukrainian allies, not telling President Zelensky what to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an interview with Sky News this morning, asked if Mandelson’s comments reflected government policy, <strong>Pollard</strong> replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>No. It’s certainly right that Ukrainians want peace. I think of all the people on our continent that want peace, the Ukrainians want it the most.</p> <p>But we’re still in discussions, diplomatic engagement with our European, US and Ukrainian friends as to the shape of that deal.</p> <p>But it’s certainly right that the war could stop tomorrow if President Putin stopped his illegal and unprovoked aggression. He could stop this war.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if Mandelson misspoke, Pollard replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>That’s not government policy and you wouldn’t expect me to commentate on every ups and downs in negotiations.</p> </blockquote> <p>According to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/the-coalition-of-the-grillings/">Politico’s London Playbook</a>, Mandelson believes his comments have been wrongly interpreted. The ambassador “was reflecting government policies to an American audience, and any suggestion otherwise is hair-splitting nonsense”, a Washington embassy insider told Playbook.</p> <p>I will be covering UK aspects of this story, but its ramifications go well beyond this country. <strong>Martin Belam</strong> is covering events from an international perspective on our Europe live blog.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/mar/03/europe-live-blog-updates-trump-putin-zelenskyy-starmer">Europe live: month’s truce in Ukraine would show if Putin was acting in good faith, says French minister</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9am:</em> Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, holds a phone-in on LBC.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> The Covid inquiry’s module dealing with PPE procurement opens with statements from counsel.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>Lunchtime:</em> Keir Starmer and John Healey attend a lunchtime event to promote <a href="https://policymogul.com/key-updates/43040/new-measures-to-boost-small-businesses-benefitting-from-uk-s-defence-investment">a government initiative</a> to help small businesses bid for defence contracts.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> Angela Rayner, the deputy PM and housing secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>After 3.30pm:</em> Keir Starmer is expected to make a Commons statement about Ukraine, and his attempts to develop a Europe-led peace plan.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line or message me on social media.
