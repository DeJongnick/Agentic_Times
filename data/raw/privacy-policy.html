This privacy policy does not cover personal data that the Guardian processes for the purposes of journalism.</p> <p>The Guardian may use generative AI functionalities in our software and systems, including in our use of personal data. The Guardian has set out our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/help/insideguardian/2023/jun/16/the-guardians-approach-to-generative-ai">generative AI principles</a> on how we will use generative AI.</p> <p><em>Access permissions when you are using the Guardian app</em></p> <p>When you use the Guardian app, we will ask for permissions to access particular functions of your mobile device.

We may also add personal data to improve the accuracy of your delivery address when we send out mail. We may also obtain your personal data from partners whose offers we include in some of our marketing communications and we use this personal data to ensure that we do not send you irrelevant marketing and to ensure the accuracy of the information we hold.</p> <p>We also use personal data based on the content you have viewed on our sites and your interaction with the content to add you to groups with similar interests and preferences, so that we can make our online advertising more relevant.

Some of our services may have a higher age restriction and this will be shown at the point of registration.</p> <p>We also note and comply with the California law which prohibits sale of personal data of consumers between 13-16 years of age unless their guardian has authorised the sale.</p> <h2>Security of your personal data</h2> <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational controls to protect your personal data against unauthorised processing and against accidental loss, damage or destruction. You are responsible for choosing a secure password when we ask you to set up a password to access parts of our sites. You should keep this password confidential and you should choose a password that you do not use on any other site. You should not share your password with anyone else, including anyone who works for us. Sending any information, including personal data, via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of any personal data sent to our site while still in transit and so you provide it at your own risk.</p> <h2>When we share your personal data</h2> <p><em>Within the Guardian group of companies</em></p> <p>Depending on where you live, we may share your personal data within the Guardian group of companies in the UK, US, or Australia. We may share it in order to perform a contract with you, for administrative purposes, or when we have a legitimate interest in doing so. For example:</p> <ul> <li><p>If you book an event held in Australia, at first we may hold your data on our systems in the UK and then we may share it with the Guardian in Australia for administration purposes.</p></li> <li><p>Sometimes we may receive a letter, email or another form of communication from you that we consider to be significant to the history of the Guardian. We may decide to share this with the Guardian Archive run by the Guardian Foundation for historic and archiving purposes.</p></li> <li><p>We may share your data to understand how you interact across our group products or to tailor and offer relevant advertising to you.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>With external organisations</em></p> <p>We share your personal data with other organisations that are not directly linked to us under the following circumstances:</p> <p><em>Service providers</em> - We may share your data with other organisations that provide services on our behalf. We may do this to perform a contract we have entered into with you, where it is in our legitimate interests or with your consent. Examples of when we may share your data with service providers include sharing with:</p> <ul> <li><p>Companies that help deliver newspapers and subscription vouchers, such as i-Movo.</p></li> <li><p>Online payments processors who process credit and debit card or other forms of payments on our behalf.</p></li> <li><p>Fraud management providers that help us to identify and prevent online fraud.</p></li> <li><p>Internet and cloud hosting services providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS).</p></li> <li><p>Life-cycle engagement platforms such as Braze, to help us build and manage our campaigns and send our email communications, including newsletters.</p></li> <li><p>Software service providers such as Salesforce and mParticle that assist us with our customer relationship management.</p></li> <li><p>Communications services providers, such as our podcast service provider called Acast.</p></li> <li><p>Error tracking software providers, such as Sentry and Google Firebase, to help us diagnose and fix errors and optimise the performance of our website and apps.</p></li> <li><p>Service providers that help us carry out analytics, facilitate audience creation and segmentation and to measure our audience engagement.

The embedded player relies on the YouTube API, which is a type of software that allows data to be communicated between our website and apps and the YouTube player. This will include personal data which will also be collected by cookies as set out in our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies">cookie policy</a>. We will provide this data about how you interact with videos to enable YouTube to provide statistical information such as how many views a video has, or how many users watch the entire video. More information about how YouTube will use this personal data, which includes usage data when you interact or use the embedded YouTube player, can be found at the Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Skimlinks because they are an affiliate marketing service provider. We do not drop first or third party cookies, or otherwise access local storage through our affiliate links. Instead we use a type of link that redirects users into Skimlinks’ network. This means we are tracking and identifying the click, rather than individuals. Skimlinks will use IP addresses to direct readers to the geographically relevant affiliate link. The IP address and user agent are anonymised and truncated by Skimlinks. Third party sites including retailers and sites in Skimlinks’ network may place cookies or collect additional information. Details about Skimlinks use of data is set out in their privacy policy at<a href="https://skimlinks.com/privacy-policy"> https://skimlinks.com/privacy-policy</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Advertising partners</em> - We may also share your data collected through our sites with our advertising partners, as set out in our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies">cookie policy</a>.

You can find details about these partners’ use of data and opt out of their identifiers through the following links:</p> <ul> <li><p>LiveRamp: <a href="https://liveramp.uk/privacy/service-privacy-policy/">https://liveramp.uk/privacy/service-privacy-policy/</a> and opt out - <a href="https://liveramp.uk/privacy/your-rights/">https://liveramp.uk/privacy/your-rights/</a></p></li> <li><p>ID5: Privacy policy - <a href="https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy/">https://id5.io/platform-privacy-policy/</a> and opt out - <a href="https://id5-sync.com/privacy">https://id5-sync.com/privacy</a></p></li> <li><p>Lotame: Privacy policy - <a href="https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-notices/services/">https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-notices/services/</a> and opt out - <a href="https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-manager/">https://www.lotame.com/privacy/privacy-manager/</a></p></li> <li><p>The Trade Desk: Privacy policy - <a href="https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/privacy">https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/privacy</a> and opt out - <a href="https://adsrvr.org/">https://adsrvr.org/</a></p></li> <li><p>EUID: Privacy policy - <a href="https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/privacy">https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/privacy</a> and opt out - <a href="https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/">https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/</a></p></li> <li><p>UID2: Privacy policy - <a href="https://transparentadvertising.com/privacy">https://transparentadvertising.com/privacy</a> and opt out - <a href="https://www.transparentadvertising.com/">https://www.transparentadvertising.com/</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em>Affiliate marketing</em> - When a product is linked from a Guardian article or gallery, if the retailer has an affiliate programme, then the link will redirect to the retailer website through our affiliate marketing partner, such as Skimlinks’ network. When a reader clicks on a link, Skimlinks will identify which page the click came from and assign it a randomly generated number. This is communicated to the retailer and associated with any subsequent purchase. The affiliate marketing partner, such as Skimlinks, then reconciles the list of clicks from links on the Guardian with purchases on the retailer’s site. This is used in order to calculate the commission for the Guardian.</p> <p><em>Agencies and authorities if required by law</em> - We may reveal your personal data to any law enforcement agency, court, regulator, government authority, or in connection with any legal action if we are required to do so to meet a legal or regulatory obligation, where the request is proportionate, or otherwise to protect our rights or the rights of anyone else (for example, in response to a valid and properly served legal process such as subpoena or warrant). If we have your contact details, we will take reasonable steps to attempt to notify you prior to disclosing your data unless (i) prohibited by applicable law from doing so, or (ii) there are clear indications of unlawful conduct in connection with your use of Guardian services.</p> <p><em>Event sponsors and partners</em> - We may share your personal data with sponsors of Guardian events and partners who we hold events with for marketing purposes when you have given your permission for us to do so. We may also share your personal data with these sponsors and partners for event administration and security purposes.</p> <p><em>Prize draws, competitions and bids </em>- We may share your personal data with sponsors and partners for the purposes of selecting and notifying winners when you participate in any of our prize draws, competitions and bids. We may also share your data with entities offering any prize you have won in order for that entity to contact you about such a prize.</p> <p><em>Social media organisations</em> - We may share your personal data with other organisations when our web pages use social plug-ins from these organisations (such as liking or sharing on social media). These other organisations may receive and use personal data about your visit to our sites or apps. If you browse our site or view content on our apps, personal data they collect may be connected to your account on their site. For more information on how these organisations use personal data, please read their privacy policies.</p> <p><em>Organisation/s that buy any of the Guardian group companies</em> - We may share your personal data to any other organisation that buys, or to which we transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and business. If this sale or transfer takes place, we will use reasonable efforts to try to make sure that the organisation we transfer your personal data to uses it in line with our privacy policy.</p> <p>When we share your personal data, as specified above, with any organisation which accesses your data in the course of providing services on our behalf, they will be governed by strict contractual restrictions to make sure that they protect your data and comply with applicable law. We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.</p> <p><em>California resident - Do not sell</em></p> <p>These transfers to third parties may constitute “sale” of your personal information under California law. A California resident can halt these sales at any time by pressing the “California resident - Do not sell” link that is located in the footer of every page on our site. Third-parties do not sell personal information that has been sold to them by the Guardian unless you have first received explicit notice and are provided an opportunity to exercise the right to opt out.</p> <h2>International data transfers</h2> <p>Data we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where one or more of our Guardian group companies or service providers are based or have facilities. While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.</p> <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK or the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:</p> <ul> <li><p>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.</p></li> <li><p>We may also use specific approved contracts that use Standard Contractual Clauses for the protection of personal data where appropriate, with our service providers that are based in countries outside the UK or the EEA, including those based in the US and Australia. These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the UK or the EEA.</p></li> </ul> <p>If you are located in the UK or the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the UK or the EEA.</p> <h2>How long we keep your personal data</h2> <p>We keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a product or service and as a result may keep your personal data while you are still using our product or service. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a subscription.</p> <p>If we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data.
