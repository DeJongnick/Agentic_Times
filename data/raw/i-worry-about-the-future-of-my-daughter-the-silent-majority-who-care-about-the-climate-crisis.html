<p>Recent studies show that between 80% and 89% of the world’s population wants to see climate action. Many would even contribute 1% of their income to make that happen, even though people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/22/spiral-of-silence-climate-action-very-popular-why-dont-people-realise">vastly underestimate</a> their peers’ desire for change, researchers found. Members of this “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/22/activate-climate-silent-majority-support-supercharge-action">silent majority</a>” come from all walks of life and are motivated by a range of things. We asked readers who are part of the 80-89% to tell us why they care about the climate crisis and what actions need to be made.</p> <h2>‘The most pressing health issue we face’</h2> <p>Extreme weather events and alarming global temperatures we have observed in the last few years has made me (as a doctor) consider the climate crisis to be the most pressing health issue we face. In medicine, we make great efforts to reduce or eliminate relatively modest risks, but are currently only making modest efforts to tackle the greatest hazard to human health in history.</p> <p>[We need] progressive carbon taxation. The 89% figure is very persuasive and needs to be amplified as a message to those in power.</p> <p><strong>Michael Robert Jackson, </strong><strong>paediatric </strong><strong>radiologist, 46, Edinburgh</strong></p> <h2>‘The only way we can achieve change is by going out and protesting’</h2> <p>I worry about the future of my daughter when she reaches my age and even more about the future of her children if she does have any. I think lifestyle changes do not matter as much unless you are the richest 1%. I believe the only way we can achieve change is by going out and protesting as that’s the only way governments, corporations and richest 1% will listen.</p> <p>I’m really surprised why the 89% who are concerned do not do more to go out and support and protest. We would definitely get change if that happens. Instead of asking whether 89% would give their income, why not ask why they don’t protest and analyse what can be done to change that?</p> <p><strong>Ahmet Bulutoglu, retired, 63, London</strong></p> <h2>‘How many are really interested in making the changes necessary?’</h2> <p>As a citizen of the United States, I am frustrated, and ashamed, of our part in contributing to climate change and the unwillingness of our government to meet treaty obligations that have been agreed to with other nations.</p> <p>It’s great that 80-89%<strong> </strong>of respondents want more done to address climate change, but how many are really interested in making the changes necessary to make a difference? How many are willing to have their tax dollars given to those countries that are not contributing to climate change in any meaningful way but are being unjustly impacted by the actions of countries that are major contributors to climate change? The wealthy – both individuals and nations – are likely to be less affected by climate change than those with fewer financial resources.</p> <p><strong>J</strong><strong>, retired, 65, Washington</strong></p> <h2>‘The very richest people need to change their ways’</h2> <p>There is no way to NOT care, and the percentage missing from the 89% cares too. They just don’t want to be associated with “the movement”.</p> <p>To give 1% of income is not a solution. Again, that would be a fart in space. It is the very richest people that need to change their ways and give up parts of what they have accumulated. THAT would bring change.</p> <p><strong>Mikael, homemaker, Dalarna, Sweden</strong></p> <h2>‘Proportional representation’</h2> <p>[In the UK] proportional representation should allow for more of the 89% you suggest support climate action to vote for a party that is actually serious about doing something.</p> <p><strong>Chris Knight, 48, </strong><strong>supply </strong><strong>chain manager, Northamptonshire, England</strong></p> <h2>‘It’s a false narrative to say we have any impact on the climate as individuals’</h2> <p>It’s a false narrative to say we have any impact on the climate as individuals or even as communities. The same people that tell you to do everything you can to lower your individual footprint are the same people filtering smoke into our air by the factory load or dumping waste into our oceans. Or they’re Taylor Swift.</p> <p><strong>Francis, 19, custodian, Georgia</strong></p> <p>(Swift’s representatives have previously defended her against criticism of her use of her private jet, saying she <a href="https://apnews.com/article/taylor-swift-climate-jet-carbon-emissions-kelce-chiefs-02ac425d24281bd26d73bfdf4590bc82">buys carbon offsets</a> to cover her tours and her jet is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/aug/02/taylor-swift-private-jet-carbon-emissions-blatantly-incorrect">frequently loaned out</a> to others.)</p> <h2>‘I try to do what I can, but I know it means nothing compared to a billionaire using their private jet’</h2> <p>I don’t think personal actions are that important. Sure, I don’t eat meat, I don’t travel by plane even though it’s much cheaper than the train, I try to do what I can, but I know it means nothing compared to a billionaire using their private jet twice a week.</p> <p><strong>Emma, 29, linguistics researcher, Paris</strong></p> <h2>‘We have to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable’</h2> <p>My home of 22 years was lost, turned to ashes in a fire that burned at 2,200 degrees. Nearly all my neighbors lost their homes in 100mph winds that carried the fire storm. My entire town was lost.</p> <p>We are rebuilding in a new way to protect our community, homes and family from the next fire. But I now understand that we have to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable legally and politically for its crime against humanity and the planet.</p> <p><strong>Darya Allen-Attar, finance, Pacific Palisades, California</strong></p> <h2>‘We need to focus on stopping methane leaks’</h2> <p>The river I live on has had three major “100-year” floods within a 20-year period. Each time, the water has risen about a foot higher than the previous flood. We know the torrential rains that produce these floods are caused by the atmosphere becoming warmer and wetter until it is super-saturated, especially as slow-moving storms pass through. Frankly, I fear for my life.</p> <p>Currently, I’m working to get the Climate Superfund Act passed into law in our state. The act would fine the biggest polluters that have affected New Jersey over the years and use the money for resilience efforts.</p> <p>We need to focus on stopping methane leaks and pollution asap, because they will affect the next 20 years more than anything else. With Trump in office, political obstacles are insurmountable, so we must work with private sector businesses and volunteer monitoring efforts for the next few years.</p> <p><strong>Kathryn Riss, retired, 78, New Jersey</strong></p> <h2>‘Vote’</h2> <p>The science of climate chaos has been very clear for many decades, and the implications of non-action are obvious: if you are reasonably happy with your life and have people and places you love, climate chaos is an existential threat. It’s a no-brainer.</p> <p>Voting and political participation are essential. Vote on the climate and demand that politicians act on the climate. Other key actions are factoring energy efficiency and low/no-carbon energy into all relevant purchases, investments and travel plans – and shifting toward a plant-based and low-carbon diet as much as possible.</p> <p><strong>Glenn Campbell, medical writer, 58, Ohio</strong></p>
