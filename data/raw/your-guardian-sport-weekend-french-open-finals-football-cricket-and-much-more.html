The match is being staged at Espanyol’s 40,000-capacity RCDE Stadium in Barcelona. since Andorra’s national stadium is unavailable after hosting the Games of the Small States of Europe.

Tanya Aldred and James Wallace are at the helm for what should be another run-fest for the hosts. England have outclassed West Indies across the 20-over and 50-over formats so far, hammering them by 143 runs in the second one-day international in Leicester. That came hot on the heels of a bruising 108-run win for England in the first ODI at Derby. Stars of both those shows were the openers Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont, who both hit their second successive centuries.

Aidan O’Brien’s No 1 runner Delacroix has solid claims in the Derby, but he perhaps lacks the “wow” factor of many of his other winners. The Lion In Winter must overcome being drawn in stall 19 but it would be no surprise to see him bounce back given O’Brien’s recent exploits with City Of Troy and Auguste Rodin. Also making a strong case in the 19-strong field are Guineas winner Ruling Court and Dante victor Pride Of Arras.</p> <p>2pm</p> <p>Women’s singles final live</p> <p>French Open tennis</p>  <p>World No 1 meets world No 2 at Roland Garros as top-ranked Aryna Sabalenka takes on Coco Gauff, the French Open runner-up in 2022.

Tom Bassam is your minute-by-minute guide and Michael Aylwin our match reporter as Tigers face Sharks in their Premiership semi-final. It’s Michael Cheika’s chance to edge closer to winning the Premiership title in his one-off season at Welford Road on his home-ground farewell. The game promises to be a cracker if their exchanges in the regular season are a reliable measure – Leicester have shared 142 points across two league games with Sale already. </p> <p>5pm</p> <p>Andorra v England live</p> <p>World Cup qualifier</p>  <p>Thomas Tuchel’s Three Lions take on underwhelming opposition as the new head coach builds towards the finals in North America, this qualifier coming three days before meeting Senegal in a friendly in Nottingham.

After brushing West Indies aside 3-0 in the ODI series, England will be eager to maintain their upswing under new white-ball captain Harry Brook. Opener Jamie Smith has certainly been making an impression under England’s new leadership, his 64 from 28 balls in the final match of the one-day whitewash over the tourists a positive sign of things to come.
