<p>A 70-year-old man has died and three people were injured after a helicopter crashed into a field near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, police said.</p> <p>The male pilot, 41, and two other passengers, a 10-year-old boy and 58-year-old woman, sustained minor injuries in the crash in Bentley on Thursday morning.</p> <p>The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and South Yorkshire police have launched a joint investigation into the cause of the crash.</p> <p>Det Ch Insp Gary Magnay said: “Our thoughts are with the family and loved ones of the man who sadly died in this tragic incident. We and our emergency services colleagues remain at the scene and we have launched a full joint investigation into the circumstances surrounding the incident in parallel with the AAIB.</p> <p>“As part of our investigation, we’d ask for anyone with information to get in touch. If you were in the area at the time and saw the events unfold, please contact us. We are particularly keen to hear from those with footage of the helicopter leading up to the crash.”</p> <p>Emergency services were called to Ings Lane, Bentley, at 10.15am on Thursday. Police initially said a number of people had been injured including a man, 70, who had sustained serious injuries. They later confirmed that this man died at the scene.</p> <p>South Yorkshire police said: “Ings Lane is closed while we respond to this incident. Please avoid the area and plan an alternative route where possible. Further updates will be provided when they are available.”</p> <p>Ed Miliband, the MP for Doncaster North, said it was “devastating news” and his “thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim of this terrible incident”.</p> <p>He said his office was in touch with the relevant authorities “and I know the whole of Doncaster will be united in having the victim in their thoughts today”.</p> <p>According to reports, it is believed the helicopter was being used for a private flight that took off from Retford Gamston airport shortly before it crashed. Based on photos, it is believed to belong to Kuki, a helicopter flight school that flies out of Gamston. </p> <p>A spokesperson for Retford Gamston airport confirmed that the aircraft belonged to an onsite tenant and had been involved in an incident.</p> <p>Analysis of the helicopter’s flight path showed it leaving the airfield at about 10am and flying over Doncaster for around seven minutes before stopping suddenly near Bentley.</p> <p>A witness, Lee Needham, who lives in the area, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx203g3j416o">told the BBC</a> that the helicopter came down close to houses, train tracks, industrial units and electrical pylons. “Whoever was piloting the helicopter more than likely saved numerous lives,” he said. </p> <p>Another witness, Rick, told the <a href="https://www.examinerlive.co.uk/news/local-news/helicopter-crash-pilot-saved-numerous-32782050">Yorkshire Post</a> he “didn’t see it come down but there is a chance he [the pilot] managed to steer clear of all the houses”, while another who lived at the end of the lane near railway lines said all the neighbours “thought it was a train crash” and that the helicopter narrowly missed their houses. </p>
