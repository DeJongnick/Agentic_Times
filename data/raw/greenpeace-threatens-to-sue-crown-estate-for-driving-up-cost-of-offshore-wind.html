<p>Greenpeace is threatening to sue King Charles’s property management company, accusing it of exploiting its monopoly ownership of the seabed.</p> <p>The environmental lobby group alleges the crown estate has driven up costs for wind power developers and boosted its own profits, as well as the royal household’s income, due to the “aggressive” way it auctions seabed rights.</p> <p>The crown estate, as the legal owner of the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, is responsible for auctioning offshore wind rights. It has benefited from the huge growth in the industry, commanding hefty option fees from renewable energy developers to secure areas of the seabed to build their windfarms.</p> <p>It made a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/01/king-charles-crown-estate-profit-land-property">£1.1bn profit in its financial year ended in March</a>, double its level just two years ago.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/01/king-charles-crown-estate-profit-land-property">King Charles to receive £132m next year after crown estate makes £1.1bn profit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Will McCallum, co-executive director at Greenpeace UK, said the estate should be “managing the seabed in the interest of the nation and the common good, not as an asset to be milked for profit and outrageous bonuses”.</p> <p>“We should leave no stone unturned in looking for solutions to lower energy bills that are causing misery to millions of households,” he said.</p> <p>“Given how crucial affordable bills and clean energy are to the government’s agenda, the chancellor should use her powers of direction to ask for an independent review of how these auctions are run. If the problem isn’t fixed before the next round, we may need to let a court decide whether or not what’s happening is lawful.”</p> <p>Greenpeace argues the crown estate has a legal duty not to exploit its monopoly position as owner of the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but that it is now in breach of this.</p> <p>The lobby group said it was concerned the crown estate was rationing supply of the seabed to protect high prices, and argued this could harm the development of offshore wind power in the UK.</p> <p>The crown estate has reportedly rejected Greenpeace’s claims, arguing the lobby group has misinterpreted the estate’s legal duties.</p> <p>About 12% of crown estate profits flow to the monarchy through the sovereign grant to fund its work. This was lowered from 25% in 2023 to offset the rise in profits from offshore wind projects.</p> <p>The UK’s wind industry is at a critical juncture as the government plans to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/13/ed-miliband-pledges-most-ambitious-reforms-to-uk-energy-system-in-generations">double onshore wind</a> and quadruple offshore wind power capacity by the end of the decade.</p> <p>The crown estate, which also includes a portfolio of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london">London</a> properties and rural real estate, is worth £15bn. The property assets in London, which is concentrated around Regent Street and St James’s, are valued at £7.1bn.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the crown estate said: “Greenpeace has misunderstood the crown estate’s legal duties and leasing processes. Option fees are not fixed by the crown estate. They are set by the developers through open, competitive auctions and reflect market appetite at the time. As our net revenue is returned to the Treasury, option fees help to ensure that taxpayers benefit from the requisite value from the development of our scarce and precious seabed resource.</p> <p>“The crown estate is accelerating offshore wind in line with government policy to move forward the energy transition at pace and improve energy security.”</p> <p>A Treasury spokesperson said the crown estate “operates independently and makes its own commercial decisions”, adding that “every penny of profit [that] goes to the Treasury … [helps] pay for vital public services like schools and hospitals”. </p>
