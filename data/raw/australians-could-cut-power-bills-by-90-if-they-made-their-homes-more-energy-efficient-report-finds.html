<p>The debate over where Australia gets its energy from has played out like a “comic-book death battle between coal and renewables” in recent years, according to Luke Menzel, the chief executive officer of the Energy Efficiency Council.</p> <p>Discussions over coal versus renewables, the role of gas and the speed of infrastructure rollout to bring renewables online had been “important”, Menzel said. “But there’s a whole other conversation we need to be having. And that’s about how we are using energy.”</p> <p>Menzel and other energy experts say political noise has often overshadowed the role of energy efficiency in Australian homes and how to cut rising household bills.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The latest of several reports to make the case for boosting energy efficiency is from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).</p> <p>IEEFA found Australian households could cut their power bills by more than 90% by implementing a range of energy efficiency measures.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/21/australians-losing-billions-in-savings-due-to-poor-management-of-appliance-efficiency-scheme-audit-finds">Australians losing billions in savings due to poor management of appliance efficiency scheme, audit finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Released on Wednesday, the report calculated potential savings of between 82% and 94% if households installed solar and a home battery and used efficient appliances – such as heat pumps, air-conditioners and electric induction cooktops.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/XTtE7/5/" data-alt="Charts showing how Australian households could save thousands on energy bills."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/XTtE7/5/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The report said with federal and state government policies to incentivise home energy efficiency, a goal of halving household energy bills in a decade is achievable.</p> <p>“We’ve seen over the last few years that energy prices and cost of living has become an emerging concern, but the debate has been around one-off rebates or debates on how to generate power,” Jay Gordon, an energy finance analyst at IEEFA, said.</p> <p>“That’s important, but it misses the point when you see these 80% to 90% cost reductions.”</p> <p>Last month, energy experts <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/24/dont-believe-the-hype-victorian-government-deserves-credit-for-not-buckling-to-aggressive-pro-gas-campaign">congratulated the Victorian government</a> for a suite of measures to improve home energy efficiency, including a ban on gas heating and hot water systems in new homes from January 2027.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The Albanese government’s new $2.3bn home battery program, which officially kicked off last week, provided discounts of about 30% on batteries.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/14/how-to-stay-warm-this-winter-without-breaking-the-bank-or-the-planet">How to stay warm this winter without breaking the bank – or the planet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wednesday’s IEEFA report projected that households could make savings of between 82% and 94% if they:</p> <ul> <li><p>Installed an 8kw rooftop solar system and a 10kwh battery</p></li> <li><p>Used reverse-cycle air conditioning instead of gas or electric heaters</p></li> <li><p>Swapped gas or old electric water heaters for heat pumps</p></li> <li><p>Replaced gas cooktops with electric induction</p></li> </ul> <p>The IEEFA modelling did not take into account the further gains that Gordon said can be made by improving the thermal efficiency of homes: how well they can hold heat in the winter or keep heat out in summer.</p> <p>More thermally efficient homes give households the option to use more daytime energy from solar to either preheat or pre-cool their homes ahead of the evening peak.</p> <p>Menzel said though technologies such as heat pumps and solar are well established, policies to encourage their take-up are a challenge.</p> <p>“With electrification and efficiency you’re talking about a much broader range of product types and interventions that look different in different parts of the economy,” he said.</p> <p>“It’s a heavier lift, but it’s where we need to go.”</p> <p>Australian homes use about a quarter of the country’s electricity, and account for more than 10% of greenhouse gas emissions. Cutting gas use in homes could also ease the supply pressures in the east coast, Menzel said.</p> <p>Two reports in 2023 and 2024 from the independent Climateworks Centre, based at Monash University, have made the case for a “renovation wave” across homes in Australia, especially those built before 2003 when minimum energy efficiency rules were introduced to national building codes.</p> <p>Steps such as upgrading windows, adding insulation to walls, ceilings and floors, and upgrading appliances could save up to $2,200 a year on a household bill, the centre’s research has claimed.</p> <p>Dr Gill Armstrong, the centre’s buildings program manager, said: “They’re tried and tested. It’s low-hanging fruit, but it’s also the one area where we can move fast for households to get the benefit of lower bills.</p> <p>“There’s a growing awareness that homes can be improved quite quickly. It’s a no-brainer for the federal government.”</p>
