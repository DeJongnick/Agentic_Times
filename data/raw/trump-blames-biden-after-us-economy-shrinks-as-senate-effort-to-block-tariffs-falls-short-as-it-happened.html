But we will be back at it on Thursday morning. In the meantime, here’s an overview of the day’s developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> dismissed concerns about the need for trade with China during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. “You know, somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be open’”, the president said, confusing empty shelves with open ones. “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls” he continued. “And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally”.</p></li> <li><p>During his confirmation hearing in the Senate on Wednesday, Trump’s nominee to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terrance Cole, claimed that tattoos on the hand of <strong>Kilmar Ábrego García</strong>, who was deported to El Salvador from Maryland by mistake, proved that he was associated with the gang MS-13. However, the photo Cole was shown clearly did not have the figures M,S,1 or 3, which Donald Trump insisted to ABC News were tattooed on Ábrego García’s knuckles. A Salvadoran journalist who has written a book on the gang says that the tattoos have no such meaning.</p></li> <li><p>Homeland security secretary <strong>Kristi Noem</strong> has defended <strong>Rodney Scott</strong>, Trump’s nominee to lead Customs and Border Protection (CBP), after a Democratic senator and former CBP official <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/29/trump-customs-border-protection-rodney-scott">accused him of mishandling the investigation</a> into the 2010 death of an unauthorized border crosser.</p></li> <li><p>The US Treasury department <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0126">announced</a> that the United States and Ukraine signed a deal on Wednesday to establish a reconstruction investment fund for the country. A Ukrainian official said that her nation would retain sole control of the country’s natural resources.</p></li> <li><p>A Senate resolution to overturn Donald Trump’s tariffs, by declaring that there is no national emergency as the president says there is, narrowly failed to pass on Wednesday, with the vote count deadlocked at 49-49 as two senators who supported the move failing to vote.</p></li> <li><p>A federal judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/30/donald-trump-100-days-michigan-rally-tariffs-ukraine-mandelson-us-politics-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68126b488f08d453599ac164#block-68126b488f08d453599ac164">ordered the Trump administration</a> to ensure immigrants held at Guantánamo Bay are given a chance to raise any concerns about their safety before deporting them to El Salvador or countries other than their places of origin.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mohsen Mahdawi</strong> walked out of immigration detention after a federal judge in Vermont <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/30/donald-trump-100-days-michigan-rally-tariffs-ukraine-mandelson-us-politics-live-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-681238a08f083cd6dad7f7a4#block-681238a08f083cd6dad7f7a4">ordered his release</a>. The Palestinian green card holder and student at Columbia University had been detained by the Trump administration on 14 April despite not being charged with a crime.</p></li> <li><p>While the US economy shrank in the first three months of the year, according to official data, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/30/economy-gdp-q1-trump-tariffs">triggering fears of an American recession</a> and a global economic slowdown, Trump continued to blame Joe Biden for the figures. “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s,” the Trump wrote on Truth Social, adding that the contraction “has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS”.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6812d26f8f083cd6dad7fd98" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/lauren-gambino"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-01T02:02:18.429Z">3.02am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Kamala Harris expected to condemn Trump's stunning power grab in new remarks</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Kamala Harris will step back into the political spotlight on Wednesday night to deliver a sharp critique of Donald Trump, warning that his presidency has put the US at risk of a constitutional crisis.</p> <p>The former vice-president has mostly kept a low profile since leaving the White House in January following her bitter defeat to Trump. Now, a day after Trump celebrated 100 days in office with a rally in Michigan, she is expected to deliver a forceful renunciation of the president’s stunning power grabs that have prompted warnings of creeping authoritarianism.</p> <p>In her remarks, Harris, 60, will warn of a looming constitutional crisis and urge Americans to collectively join the fight to protect rights and freedoms under threat by a president seeking unchecked powers, according to a person familiar with the content of her speech. She is expected to commend leaders whose dissent has galvanized the public, including Democratic senators Cory Booker, who delivered a record-breaking 25-hour speech to show resistance to Trump, and Chris Van Hollen, who secured a visit with a man wrongly deported to El Salvador by the administration.</p> <p>She is also expected to emphasize that the chaos of Trump’s return to power is by design, laid out in the conservative policy blueprint Project 2025. During the campaign, Trump sought to distance himself from the unpopular initiative but his actions as president follow the plan closely – from his chain-saw approach to downsizing the federal government, to his war on diversity, equity and inclusion policies and “gender ideology”.</p> <p>Read more:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/kamala-harris-speech-trump">Kamala Harris to step back into spotlight to give sharp critique of Trump </a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6812ce598f08d453599ac492" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-01T01:40:28.244Z">2.40am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">'I just think I'll be able to convince people how good this is', Trump says of widely unpopular tariffs</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Phoning in to a town hall with News Nation on Wednesday night, Donald Trump was asked by one of the hosts, his old friend Bill O’Reilly, if he is concerned that the sharp drop in the economy following his imposition of tariffs on most of the world could deliver Congress to the Democrats next year. “That’s true”, Trump replied. “I just think I’ll be able to convince people how good this is.”</p> <p>Trump went on to defend the policy in familiar terms, claiming that the system of largely free trade the US has pursued for decades had to end because, in his view, “we’ve been ripped off by every country practically in the world”.</p> <p>But the president’s unshaken confidence in his ability “to convince people” of the wisdom of his policies, even as the economic indicators are all blinking red, does make sense of his near-constant presence on television since the start of his second term in office, as he attempts to sell the public on the idea that self-induced economic shock therapy is a good thing, no matter how small their 401(k) savings accounts are as a result.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-05-01T01:43:53.621Z">at 2.43am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6812b47e8f08d453599ac3d4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-01T00:34:29.761Z">1.34am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump dismisses concern over his trade war with China, saying American children can make do with fewer dolls</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Donald Trump dismissed concerns about the need for trade with China during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.</p> <p>Asked by a reporter when he would speak with China’s president, <strong>Xi Jinping, </strong>to resolve the trade war Trump launched by imposing massive tariffs on imports from China, the president said he was in no hurry, suggesting that Chinese exporters were “having tremendous difficulty because their factories are not doing business”.</p> <p>Chinese exporters made vast sums of money, Trump added, “selling us stuff, much of which we don’t need”.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y66JEJO6WM"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2y66JEJO6WM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Donald Trump dismissed concerns about the need for trade with China during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>To illustrate how trivial he thought the concerns of American consumers might be, the president continued:</p> <p>“You know, somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be open’ [sic]. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, you know? And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally”.</p> <p>Why the president thinks the main import Americans will be missing from China is dolls, rather than, say, manufacturing equipment, electronics, pharmaceuticals or rare-earth minerals is not clear. </p> <p>However, given that so much of what he learns about the world seems to come from watching Fox News, it is not impossible that he was misremembering <a href="https://x.com/Ronxyz00/status/1909923574972105114">a discussion on Fox &amp; Friends</a> from three weeks ago, about the impact of tariffs on a small business in Idaho that sells special needs toys imported from China.

The supreme court had ordered the administration to return Ábrego García to the US so that he would face immigration proceedings as he would have, had he not been sent to El Salvador.</p> <p>The discussions appeared to be an effort by the Trump administration to window dress the underlying legal case and build a paper trail it could reference before the US district judge Paula Xinis, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/trump-administration-kilmar-abrego-garcia-deportation">previously ruled</a> that Donald Trump raising the matter in the Oval Office was insufficient.</p> <p>Read more:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/30/trump-kilmar-abrego-garcia-nayib-bukele">Trump officials contacted El Salvador president about Kilmar Ábrego García, sources say</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6812ab658f0870089fc04b3f" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-30T23:21:36.547Z">12.21am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Senate measure to overturn Trump's tariffs fails to pass by one vote, with two critical senators absent</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>A Senate resolution to overturn Donald Trump’s tariffs, by declaring that there is no national emergency as the president says there is, narrowly failed to pass on Wednesday, with the vote count deadlocked at 49-49 as two senators who supported the move failing to vote.</p> <p>The two no-shows were Senator <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong>, a Kentucky Republican, and Senator <strong>Sheldon Whitehouse</strong>, a Rhode Island Democrat, who had both voted previously to terminate the national emergency Trump declared to give himself the power to impose tariffs.</p> <p>Whitehouse was <a href="https://x.com/SenWhitehouse/status/1917693186673193093">abroad</a>, at the Our Ocean Conference in South Korea. A spokesperson for McConnell, David Popp, told Punchbowl News that the senator “believes that tariffs are a tax increase on everybody”, but did not explain why the senator, who is in poor health, failed to vote.</p> <p>Senator <strong>Rand Paul</strong>, a Kentucky Republican who cosponsored <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/49/text">the resolution</a>, “Terminating the national emergency declared to impose global tariffs”, voted for it, along with two more Republicans: Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.</p> <p>“We torched Biden for abusing emergency powers during COVID”, Paul <a href="https://x.com/SenRandPaul/status/1917647641950986690">posted</a> in advance of the vote. “Now some Republicans want to do the same thing?

It does, however, suggest that the <strong>United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund</strong> is some sort of payback for US support for Ukraine’s defense from the full-scale Russian invasion that began in 2022.</p> <p>“In recognition of the significant financial and material support that the people of the United States have provided to the defense of Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion, this economic partnership positions our two countries to work collaboratively and invest together to ensure that our mutual assets, talents, and capabilities can accelerate Ukraine’s economic recovery” the Treasury statement said.</p> <p>For his part, <strong>Scott Bessent</strong>, the Treasury secretary, is quoted as saying that the agreement was made possible by “President Trump’s tireless efforts to secure a lasting peace”.</p> <p>“This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term”, Bessent added. “President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine”.</p> <p>Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister <strong>Yulia Svyrydenko</strong> <a href="https://x.com/Svyrydenko_Y/status/1917695985507053772">wrote on X</a> that she had signed the deal to “attract global investment into our country”.</p> <p>The first in a list of key provisions of the agreement, Svyrydenko wrote, is: “Full ownership and control remain with Ukraine. All resources on our territory and in territorial waters belong to Ukraine. It is the Ukrainian state that determines what and where to extract. Subsoil remains under Ukrainian ownership – this is clearly established in the Agreement.”</p> <p>“The Fund is structured on a 50/50 basis” she added. “It will be jointly managed by Ukraine and the United States. Neither side will hold a dominant vote – a reflection of equal partnership between our two nations.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-30T23:22:06.148Z">at 12.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6812992e8f0870089fc04ab5" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-30T21:52:32.796Z">10.52pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump says he understands interest rates better than Fed chair Jerome Powell</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Speaking to business leaders at the White House on Wednesday, Donald Trump once again criticized Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates. Powell has cited Trump’s massive tariffs on imports from nearly every country, except Russia, as a reason to fear inflation and so not lower rates.</p> <p>“Mortgage rates are actually down slightly, even though I have a guy in the Fed that I’m not a huge fan of”, <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1917694978337181803">Trump said</a>, apparently departing from his prepared remarks. “But that’s alright, these are minor details. Don’t tell him I said that please”.</p> <p>“I mean, he should reduce the ener-- he should reduce interest rates” the president, who has relied on loans to finance his real estate purchases for decades, added. “I think I understand interest a lot better than him, because I’ve had to really use interest rates. But we should have interest rates go down, it would be positive, but it’s not going to matter that much, because ultimately what we’re creating has much more to do with other things than it does just pure interest rates, but it would be nice for people wanting to buy homes and things”.</p> <p>During his 2016 campaign for the presidency, Trump boasted of his ability to build his real estate empire on loans. “Nobody knows debt better than me. I’ve made a fortune by using debt”, Trump <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2016-race-donald-trump-responds-to-hillary-clintons-attack-on-his-economic-proposals/">told CBS News</a> that year. He also suggested that part of his genius was finding ways to simply not repay his loans if his deals did not work out. “If things don’t work out, I renegotiate the debt” he said. “You go back and you say, ‘Hey, guess what? The economy just crashed. I’m going to give you back half’”.</p> <p>Economists have noted that a central part of the appeal of buying US debt for investors is the promise that the country, unlike Trump’s businesses, would never fail to repay what it borrowed.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-30T22:24:29.506Z">at 11.24pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6812934b8f0870089fc04a84" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/chris-stein"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-30T21:19:39.298Z">10.19pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Noem defends Trump's pick to lead CBP accused of ‘cover-up’ over death of man beaten by US agents</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem has defended Rodney Scott, Donald Trump’s nominee to lead Customs and Border Protection (CBP), after a Democratic senator and former CBP official <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/29/trump-customs-border-protection-rodney-scott">accused him of mishandling the investigation</a> into the 2010 death of an unauthorized border crosser.</p> <p>Scott’s confirmation hearing began a few minutes ago before the Senate finance committee, whose ranking member Ron Wyden last week wrote to Noem with concerns that his handling of the death of Anastasio Hernández Rojas was “deeply troubling”.</p> <p>“The minority’s uninformed account of Mr Scott’s alleged role in the 2010 investigation of the death of Mr Anastasio Hernandez Rojas was infuriating and offensive to read,” Noem wrote in reply.</p> <p>Wyden had questioned Scott’s authorization of an administrative subpoena to obtain Hernández Roja’s medical records. Hernández Roja died after being beaten and tased by CBP agents who were preparing him for deportation, following his arrest for crossing into the San Diego area from Mexico.</p> <p>Noem rejected Wyden’s attacks, saying: “Mr Scott did not impede any investigation, nor did he take steps to conceal facts from investigators” and that his use of the subpoena was “consistent with law and agency policy”.</p> <p>The secretary also said that James Wong, a former top CBP internal affairs official who in a letter to Wyden accused Scott of orchestrating “a cover-up” was “assigned to a wholly separate component of CBP”.</p> <p>“Your public disclosure of these false allegations demonstrates the reckless nature of partisan politics.

Ábrego García’s lawyers have said he’s not a member of MS-13 and he has not been charged with or convicted of a crime.</p> <p>Pressed on the rule of law and the supreme court’s order, Moran told Trump, pointing to the phone on the Resolute Desk: “You could get him back. There’s a phone on this desk.” Trump replied: “I could.” “You could pick it up, and with all the power of the presidency, you could call up the president of El Salvador and say, ‘Send him back right now’,” said Moran. The president replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. I’m not the one making this decision … You want me to follow the law. If I were the president that just wanted to do anything, I’d probably keep him right where he is.</p> </blockquote> <p>Trump then blamed lawyers and “the law” for the situation.</p> <p>His comments appeared to contradict previous remarks from Trump and his top aides <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/trump-el-salvador-deportation-kilmar-abrego-garcia">who have repeatedly claimed</a> that the US is powerless to return Ábrego García because he is in the custody of a foreign government, despite the supreme court’s ruling. The White House’s position in court has been that only El Salvador’s president, <strong>Nayib Bukele</strong>, can release a Salvadoran man from a Salvadoran jail. And Bukele has made it clear that he doesn’t want to do so.</p> <p>Judge <strong>Paula Xinis</strong>, who has set a <strong>deadline of 5pm ET today</strong> for the administration to provide more to details on his efforts to return Ábrego García to the US, last week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/23/kilmar-abrego-garcia-judge-trump-bad-faith">accused the Trump administration of “bad faith”</a> in the case, and I’m sure she will find Trump’s latest comments very interesting indeed.</p> <p>Here’s video of that part of the interview:</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBwCUPttprw"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GBwCUPttprw?start=1213&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=1213" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>In an interview broadcast on Tuesday, Donald Trump told ABC News “I could” get Kilmar Ábrego García returned to the US with one phone call.</figcaption> </figure>  </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-30T18:33:15.064Z">at 7.33pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6812131d8f0870089fc0446b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-30T12:26:55.837Z">1.26pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">'You're not being very nice': Trump clashes with ABC interviewer over edited Ábrego García photo</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In a pre-recorded interview that went out last night on ABC News to mark his 100th day in office, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> clashed with reporter <strong>Terry Moran</strong> over his tariff policies, deportations and the power of the presidency.</p> <p>In an intense, fiery exchange over the knuckle tattoos of <strong>Kilmar Ábrego García</strong> – the man the US government deported to <strong>El Salvador</strong> by mistake - Trump got into a surreal back-and-forth with Moran over whether Ábrego García has the gang name “MS-13” tattooed on his knuckles, apparently confusing a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114361211919694573">photoshopped image</a> he once posted on social media with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/who-is-kilmar-abrego-garcia">Ábrego García</a>’s real hands.</p> <p>It started with Moran pressing Trump on whether he acknowledges that under American law, every person is afforded due process. But Trump claimed that when people come to the country illegally “there’s a different standard”.</p> <p>“But they get due process,” Moran said.</p> <p>“Well, they get a process where we have to get ‘em out, yeah,” Trump said. “They get whatever my lawyers say.”</p> <p>The Trump administration has indicated in court documents that Ábrego García was sent to <strong>El Salvador</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/01/ice-error-deported-maryland-man-el-salvador">in an “administrative error”</a> but White House officials have since disputed that and the lawyer who wrote that court document has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/justice-department-prosecutor-leave-trump-administration-deportation">put on leave</a>.
