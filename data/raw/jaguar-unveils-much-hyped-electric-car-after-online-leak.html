<p>Jaguar unveiled its much-hyped electric concept car in Miami on Monday, just hours after leaked images of the rebranded vehicle were circulated online.</p> 
<p>Early online reaction suggests the concept car might appear more familiar to fans of Barbie or the Pink Panther than the traditional owners of a Jag.</p> 
<p>Unveiled in two colours, Miami pink and London blue, the new electric car, called the Type 00, is described by the brand as a “concept with bold forms and exuberant proportions to inspire future Jaguars”.</p>

<p>The model features the Jaguar logo laser-etched into a brass ingot on each side of the car, which themselves open to reveal rear-facing cameras that provide a view for the driver similar to conventional wing mirrors via screens located in the cabin.</p> 
<p>The most eye-catching features, bar the colours, include the lack of a rear windscreen, with rear-view cameras instead installed under gold patches behind the front wheel.</p> 
<p>Above sizeable wheels and wheel arches, the car’s front end is capped by a windscreen that appears to meld into the side windows, which taper towards the back of the car, contributing to what Autocar describes as “a wraparound effect reminiscent of a racing helmet”.</p> 
<p>The British carmaker sparked controversy this November when it released a series of dramatic changes, including a new design and logo, written as JaGUar, ahead of becoming a fully electric brand.</p> 
<p>Jaguar said the new car uses a dedicated electric platform which should return up to 478 miles of range while rapid charging will add 200 miles of charge in 15 minutes.</p> 
<p>The production-ready version of the Type 00, which will be made in the UK, is set to be revealed late in 2025.</p> 
<p>Although prices have not yet been confirmed, it is expected to cost more than £100,000.</p> 
<p>Jaguar will launch three new electric cars in 2026, having taken new cars off sale more than a year ago to focus on its rebrand.</p> 
<p>Adrian Mardell, chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover, said: “The magic of Jaguar is close to my heart – an original British luxury brand unmatched in its heritage, artistry and emotional magnetism.”</p> 
<p>Prior to the launch, a spokesperson said the firm was “aware of images circulating online ahead of Jaguar’s official reveal at Miami Art Week”.</p> 
<p>Responding to the photos, Jaguar confirmed that the colours at least were accurate. The spokesperson said: “For the design vision, we have chosen Miami pink and London blue. Miami pink celebrates the vibrancy of the city while London blue, a modern take on the opalescent silver blue of the E-Type, is a nod to Jaguar’s British heritage.”</p> 
<p>The jettisoning of much of that traditional heritage has been trailed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/23/jaguar-boss-defends-new-ad-and-rebrand-amid-vile-hatred-online">teaser ads </a>featuring diverse models and no actual cars and the tagline “copy nothing”, a break from advertising tradition that has generated widespread publicity and controversy, including criticism of Jaguar in some quarters for selling “woke” cars.</p> 
<p>Jaguar executives said that the carmaker had to target a new generation as it transitioned from selling diesel models. </p> 
<p>The carmaker, which is owned by India’s Tata group, has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/13/how-jaguar-land-rover-fell-behind-in-the-race-to-an-electric-future-and-what-it-means-for-the-uk">slower than many rivals to embrace electric cars</a>, selling only one model, the ageing Jaguar I-Pace. However, it is investing £18bn to produce battery versions of its lineup alongside petrol cars. Deliveries of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/13/jaguar-land-rover-begins-road-testing-electric-range-rover-prototypes">electric Range Rover</a>, made in its main factory in Solihull in the West Midlands, will start at the end of next year.</p>
