It is the third breach of LVMH’s systems in the last three months.</p> <p>As well as the two attacks on Louis Vuitton, LVMH’s second-largest fashion label, Christian Dior Couture, said in May that hackers had accessed some customer data.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/10/four-arrested-over-cyber-attacks-marks-and-spencer-co-op-harrods#:~:text=Those%20arrested%20were%20a%2017,old%20British%20woman%20from%20Staffordshire.">four people were arrested</a> as part of an investigation into cyber-attacks on Marks &amp; Spencer, the Co-op and Harrods.</p> <p>Those arrested were a 17-year-old British boy from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old Latvian man from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old British man from London and a 20-year-old British woman from Staffordshire.</p> <p>M&amp;S was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/22/marks-and-spencer-apologises-cyber-incident-contactless-payments-online-orders">first retailer to be attacked, in April</a>, in an incident that forced the closure of its online store for nearly seven weeks. The Co-op was attacked in the same month and forced to shut down parts of its IT system.</p> <p>Harrods said on 1 May it had been targeted, and restricted internet access across its websites after attempts to gain unauthorised access to its systems.</p> <p>The arrests came days after the M&amp;S chair, Archie Norman, told MPs that two other large British companies had been affected by unreported cyber-attacks in recent months, as he gave details of the “traumatic” attack on the retailer. </p> <p>Louis Vuitton has been approached for comment.</p>
