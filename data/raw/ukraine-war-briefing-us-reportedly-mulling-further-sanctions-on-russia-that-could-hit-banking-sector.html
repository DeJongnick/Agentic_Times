<ul> <li><p><strong>The Trump administration has prepared additional sanctions it could use to target key areas of Russia’s economy if Vladimir Putin continues to delay ending Moscow’s war in Ukraine</strong>, officials have told the Reuters news agency. It was not clear whether Washington will actually levy further sanctions, but some of the measures being discussed reportedly included targeting Russia’s banking sector and the infrastructure used to get oil to market, said a US official and another person familiar with the matter. Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/23/will-us-sanctions-russia-oil-companies-be-effective-why-trump-now">imposed sanctions on Russia on Wednesday</a> for the first time since returning to office in January.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump said on Saturday that he would not schedule any talks with Putin unless it was clear that the Russian leader was serious about making a deal </strong>to end the war in Ukraine. “I’m going to have to know that we’re going to make a deal. I’m not going to be wasting my time,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he headed to Asia. “I’ve always had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin, but this has been very disappointing,” Trump said, adding, “I thought this would have gotten done before peace in the Middle East.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>An overnight Russian drone attack on Kyiv killed three people and wounded dozens, the mayor of the Ukrainian capital said on Sunday</strong>. “According to preliminary information, three people died and 27 were wounded (including 6 children),” Vitali Klitschko wrote on Telegram.</p></li> <li><p><strong>It comes a day after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/25/russian-overnight-strikes-ukraine-zelenskyy-sanctions-oil">Russian missile and drone attacks</a> on Saturday killed at least four people and wounded 20</strong>, officials said.
