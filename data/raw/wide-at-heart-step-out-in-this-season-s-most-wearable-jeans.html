<p><strong>Balenciaga</strong>’s are supersized, <strong>Gucci</strong>’s have a crisp front pleat and <strong>Loewe</strong>’s are extra high waisted. They’re a favourite of both Hailey Bieber (on the left) and Gigi Hadid, worn extra long and baggy, with trainers or loafers.</p>    <p>Finding the perfect pair of jeans can be fraught to say the least. We’ve yet to discover a faster way than trying on a good selection of styles in a department store. It’s worth noting wide leg fits come in degrees of width. If you are shorter in the leg, go for a high waist and medium width, so the jeans don’t swamp you, or opt for a cropped pair to show off a statement ankle boot. If you are longer in the leg a mid-rise will splice your proportions in the right place.</p> <p>There’s a plain-speaking chic about the season’s most wearable wide-leg jeans look. <strong>Zara </strong>styled its twisted seam denim (pictured below) with a part-unbuttoned denim jacket and simple white tee. For colder weather swap the T-shirt for <strong>Heattech</strong> and a wool trench coat with a cosy scarf in a bright colour. Slouchy cargo pants have been dominating the fashion landscape. Try a jean and cargo combo and give it a smarter, preppy edge by adding a striped shirt, wool tank top and statement boots, as seen at <strong>Me + Em </strong>(above).</p> <p>Vintage denim should always be considered – it’s better for the planet and your wallet. Think about donating an old unworn pair to the charity shop before buying a new-to-you style. Add a tailored tweed jacket to a sharp-cut wide leg like <strong>Arket</strong>’s dark blue high-waist style (below), or step away from the traditional blue hues with a crisp white or tonal grey pair and tuck in a pink jumper for a jolt of colour on a grey day.</p>    <p><strong>1.
