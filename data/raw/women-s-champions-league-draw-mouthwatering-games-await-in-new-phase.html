<p>Manchester United were handed a tricky-looking set of opponents on their debut in the main draw of the Women’s Champions League, while Chelsea will host Barcelona in one of the most eye-catching games of the new 18-team league phase.</p> 
<p>United, who were in the lowest-seeded pot, have been pitted against OL Lyonnes, the renamed record eight-time champions, the former winners Wolfsburg and Juventus among their six opponents. They also face a reunion with their ormer goalkeeper Mary Earps when they host Paris Saint-Germain, arguably the toughest-available opponent in the second pot. Arsenal, the holders, will also host OL Lyonnes, as well as travelling to Bayern Munich. Chelsea also take on Wolfsburg.</p>

<p>The new system replaces the 16-team four-groups-of-four format. It is not that dissimilar to the revamp the men’s competition underwent a year ago: all 18 teams will be placed into a single league table with those involved not all facing each other. Each team plays three games at home and three games away, having been handed one home match and one away match against different teams from each of the three pots, meaning that, for example, everybody knew they would face one pot 1 team at home and another pot 1 team away, setting up a number of exciting-looking contests.</p> 
<p>The league phase will take place across six separate rounds of midweek fixtures: on 7-8 October, 15-16 October, 11-12 November, 19-20 November, and 9-10 December, concluding on 17 December when all 18 teams play simultaneously. The precise dates for the fixtures will be announced on Saturday.</p>

    <p><b>Tottenham</b>'s 40th anniversary celebrations fell flat as <b>Manchester City</b> cruised to a 5-1 Women's Super League victory at Brisbane Road. </p>
    <p>Spurs had not conceded a goal in their first two matches and would have gone top of the table with a point. But their 100% record was blown away as goals from Aoba Fujino, Vivianne Miedema, Kerstin Casparij, the debutant Grace Clinton and Laura Coombs made it back-to-back wins for City. </p>
    <p>Spurs did at least grab a late consolation with arguably the goal of the game, a 20-yard effort from the substitute Olivia Holdt.<br>Isobel Goodwin scored twice as <b>London City Lionesses</b> registered the first WSL win in the club's history by beating <b>Everton</b> 2-1. </p>
    <p>The forward Goodwin, who was top scorer in the Women's Championship with 16 goals during last season's title-winning campaign, struck 13 minutes into each half at Goodison Park. The home substitute Yuka Momiki halved the deficit with a 71st-minute penalty before the visitors survived heavy pressure to record a landmark victory.<b> PA Media</b></p>
