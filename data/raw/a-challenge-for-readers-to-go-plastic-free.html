<p>I can fully endorse Emma Beddington’s experience (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/12/my-no-plastic-life-i-tried-to-cut-out-single-use-items-for-a-month-and-it-almost-broke-me">My no-plastic life: I tried to cut out single-use items for a month – and it almost broke me, 12 February</a>). Two years ago, I tried to give up using single-use plastic for Lent. I managed reasonably well&nbsp;for about a week while I used up fresh and frozen food in my fridge and freezer. But as soon as I started having to purchase fresh food, I ran into trouble. </p> <p>I learned quickly that the convenience of plastic has lulled us into accepting the status quo in shops and supermarkets. Almost everything, food and non-food, has plastic in its packaging. Even jars of food often have a ring of plastic around the metal top, which itself may well have a plastic lining. At one stage, when in desperation to be able to have tea with milk, I drove 15 miles especially to buy said milk in a glass bottle. I wondered if I was doing more harm than good to the planet.</p> <p>The trauma of that time has receded and so, inspired by Emma’s article, I am going to commit myself to another plastic-free Lent. This year it starts on 5&nbsp;March and lasts for 40 long days. </p> <p>I&nbsp;urge Guardian readers to try going plastic-free. You will probably fail on a number of occasions, but I can confirm that it is a salutary and eye-opening lesson as to the prevalence of plastic in our everyday shop. We have to change our habits, but also use consumer pressure to&nbsp;get the suppliers to improve their&nbsp;practices. Now I always respond to supermarket surveys and complain about their use of plastic wrapping. It may not be&nbsp;much, but I am trying.<br><strong>Gwen Harris</strong><br><em>Burton in Lonsdale, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
