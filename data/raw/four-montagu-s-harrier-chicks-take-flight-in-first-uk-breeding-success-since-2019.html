<p>A pair of Montagu’s harriers have raised four chicks in an English wheat field, the first success for Britain’s rarest breeding bird since 2019.</p> <p>The fledglings took their maiden flights this week after being closely monitored by the RSPB and the local farmer, with a protective wire-mesh fence installed around the nest to repel predators such as foxes.</p> <p>The location is being kept secret because it is private farmland, but also to enable the young birds to feed up and grow in strength without disturbance from over-enthusiastic birders.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jul/17/how-summer-heatwaves-affecting-breeding-birds">How this summer’s heatwaves are affecting breeding birds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The <a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/montagus-harrier">Montagu’s harrier</a> has <a href="https://hawkandowltrust.org/learn-and-discover/about-birds-of-prey/montagus-harrier">long been a rare species in Britain</a> but after a recent high of nine successful nests in 2011 its population has dwindled, with no fledging successes for six summers.</p> <p>The migratory raptor overwinters in sub-Saharan Africa before heading north to nest in Europe, often in arable fields. In recent decades its nests have been accidentally <a href="https://www.birdguides.com/news/montagus-harrier-slipping-away-in-portugal/">destroyed by agricultural intensification</a>, such as mechanised harvesting and crop-spraying, as well as breeding birds struggling in wetter summers.</p> <p>In its remaining strongholds, such as France and Spain, many nests in cereal fields are protected from ground-nesting predators by installing temporary small metal fences around them.</p> <p>The pair were first spotted in May and closely monitored by a local volunteer and the RSPB, with a drone being used under licence to locate the nest. Once the youngsters hatched, the nest was protected with fencing earlier this month.</p> <p>Mark Thomas, the species lead for Montagu’s harriers at the RSPB and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2006/dec/11/g2.ruralaffairs">an expert in protecting vulnerable birds of prey</a>, said: “We are overjoyed that a pair have returned, they managed to find each other and through the close protection of a dedicated farmer and the RSPB have managed to raise four youngsters.”</p> <p>The farmer, who is not named to protect the location, said: “It’s fantastic to have these amazing birds on the farm and a just reward for the extensive conservation work we have been undertaking for decades.”</p> <p>Adult harriers are often site-faithful, raising hopes they may return to the same spot next summer.</p> <p>Rings on the parent birds have revealed that the male is a long-lived bird from a British nest in 2015, while the female fledged from a French nest in 2023.</p> <p>Thomas added: “This Anglo-French alliance could just be the springboard needed to save this species in Britain.”</p>
