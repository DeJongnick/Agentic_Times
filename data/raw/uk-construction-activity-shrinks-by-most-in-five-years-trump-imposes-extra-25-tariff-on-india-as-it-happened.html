As <strong>OpenAI</strong> isn’t listed on the stock market, such a secondary stock sale would allow present and ex-staff to cash in.</p> <p>The mooted share sale comes as companies race to test, and roll out, artificial intelligence systems, which has sent the value of chipmaker <strong>Nvidia</strong> surging to over $4tn last month.</p> <p>Shares in <strong>Palantir</strong>, the software analytics and AI company, jumped almost 8% yesterday after it beat Wall Street estimates and hiked its full-year guidance due to the artificial intelligence boom.</p> <p><strong>OpenAI</strong> is riding this wave too. The Financial Times reports that OpenAI’s annual recurring revenue — a measure of expected revenue from subscriptions commonly used by start-ups — has surged to $12bn, and the company is apparently expecting $20bn or more in ARR by the end of 2025.</p> <p>Yesterday, OpenAI launched new freely available artificial intelligence models, in a challenge to rivals including Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta and Chinese rival DeepSeek.</p> <p>The ChatGPT developer has announced two “open weight” large language models, which are free to download and can be customised by developers</p> <p><strong>Sam Altman</strong>, <strong>OpenAI’s</strong> chief executive, said the company was excited to add to a stack of freely available AI models “based on democratic values … and for wide benefit”, adding:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“We’re excited to make this model, the result of billions of dollars of research, available to the world to get AI into the hands of the most people possible.”</p> </blockquote> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/05/openai-meta-launching-free-customisable-ai-models">OpenAI takes on Meta and DeepSeek with free and customisable AI models</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>The agenda</h2> <ul> <li><p>7am German factory orders for June</p></li> <li><p>8.30am BST: eurozone construction PMI report for July</p></li> <li><p>9.30am BST: UK construction PMI report for July</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-06T07:16:21.823Z">at 8.16am BST</time></p>  </div>
