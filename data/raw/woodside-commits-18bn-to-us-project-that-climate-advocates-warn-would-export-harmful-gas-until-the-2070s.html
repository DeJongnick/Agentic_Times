<p>Australian energy company Woodside will spend $18bn on a new liquified natural gas (LNG) project in the US that one advocacy group said would add 1.6bn tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions over its 40-year life.</p> <p>Climate advocates said the announcement, made the week before Woodside’s annual general meeting, would put further pressure on the company after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/24/woodside-energy-climate-plan-rejected-shareholders-annual-general-meeting-protest-vote">a major rebuke from shareholders</a> last year over its emissions plan.</p> <p>Woodside’s chief executive, Meg O’Neill, said the decision to invest in the Louisiana project was a historic moment and would turn the company into a “global LNG powerhouse”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The project was expected to cost US$17.5bn (A$27bn), with investment company Stonepeak also investing US$5.7bn (A$8.8bn).</p> <p>Will van de Pol, chief executive of corporate climate advocacy group Market Forces, said Woodside had committed to a project “that would export harmful gas until the 2070s”.</p> <p>Market Forces estimated the project would add 1.6bn tonnes of CO2-equivalent over its life – the equivalent of running <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/sep/12/inside-eraring-the-giant-nsw-coal-fired-power-station-that-escaped-a-2025-death-sentence">Australia’s biggest coal-fired power station, Eraring</a>, for 120 years.

We continue to engage with Woodside and are currently considering our voting position in relation to its upcoming AGM.</p> <p>“Woodside remains on our Watchlist. We regularly review our portfolio and will continue to engage on long-term climate strategy in the best interests of our members.”</p> <p>AustralianSuper said it had no comment.</p> <p>The bulk of climate-related emissions from Woodside’s business come from “scope 3” emissions, which mostly occur when the company’s gas is sold and burned by its customers.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/10/climate-activists-fined-over-protest-outside-woodside-boss-meg-oneills-perth-home-ntwnfb">Climate activists fined over protest outside Woodside boss Meg O’Neill’s Perth home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These indirect emissions totalled 74.65m tonnes of CO2-equivalent (co2-e) last year, <a href="https://www.woodside.com/sustainability/sustainability-databook/climate-data-table">according to company disclosures</a>.</p> <p>The company’s only plan to address these was to invest US$5bn in “new energy products and lower-carbon services” by 2030, that would indirectly cut 5m tonnes of CO2-e each year.</p> <p>ACCR said Woodside’s decision to go ahead with the Louisiana project would increase its annual<strong> </strong>scope 3 emissions by 27%.</p> <p>A Woodside spokesperson declined to comment on the increase in scope 3 emissions identified by the advocacy groups, but said the company’s climate targets – including a 30% cut to direct emissions by 2030 – remained unchanged.</p> <p>Woodside said its US$2.35bn investment in an ammonia project was a “material step” to its scope 3 investment goal which, when complete, would save 3.2 megatonnes of CO2-e each year.</p>
