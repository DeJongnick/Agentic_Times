<p>The UK’s proposal for a new underground nuclear waste dump has been described as “unachievable” in a Treasury assessment of the project.</p> 
<p>Ministers have put new nuclear power <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/sizewell-c-nuclear-power-station-ed-miliband-investment">at the centre</a> of their green energy revolution. But the problem of what to do with 700,000 cubic metres of radioactive waste – roughly the volume of 6,000 doubledecker buses – from the country’s past nuclear programme, as well as future waste from nuclear expansion, has yet to be solved.</p> 
<p>The government is proposing the vast underground nuclear dump, known as a geological deposit facility (GDF), to safely deal with legacy waste and new nuclear material.</p>

<p>No site has yet been confirmed for the dump and Lincolnshire county council <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lincolnshire-county-council-withdraws-from-the-gdf-siting-process">recently pulled out</a> of the process, leaving only two possible sites, both in Cumbria.</p> 
<p>A Treasury assessment this month, contained in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/nista-annual-report-2024-2025/nista-annual-report-2024-25">annual report</a> of the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority (Nista), has rated the project as “red”, which means successful delivery appears to be “unachievable”.</p> 
<p>A red rating states: “There are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and/or benefits delivery, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable. The project may need rescoping and/or its overall viability reassessed.”</p> 
<p>The report also suggests the cost could soar to up to £54bn.</p> 
<p>Richard Outram, the secretary of Nuclear Free Local Authorities, said: “The Nista red rating is hardly surprising. The GDF process is fraught with uncertainties and the GDF ‘solution’ remains unproven and costly.</p> 
<p>“A single facility as estimated by government sources could cost the taxpayer between £20bn and £54bn. This being a nuclear project, it is much more likely to be the latter and beyond.”</p> 
<p>Most nuclear waste is currently stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, which the <a href="https://www.onr.org.uk/our-work/what-we-regulate/sellafield-decommissioning-fuel-and-waste/sellafield">Office for Nuclear Regulation says</a> is one of the most complex and hazardous nuclear sites in the world.</p> 
<p>The power stations that need decommissioning include 11 Magnox power stations built between the 1950s and 1970s, including Dungeness A in Kent, Hinkley Point A in Somerset and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, as well as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/decommissioning-agreement-reached-on-advanced-gas-cool-reactor-agr-nuclear-power-stations">seven advanced gas-cooled reactors</a> built in the 1990s, including Dungeness B, Hinkley Point B and Heysham 1 and 2 in Lancashire.</p> 
<p>Waste from more recent nuclear facilities, including Sizewell B, a pressurised water reactor in Suffolk, and two new EDF pressurised water reactors – Hinkley C, which is under construction in Somerset, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/sizewell-c-gets-green-light-with-final-investment-decision">Sizewell C</a>, which is planned for construction in Suffolk – will also need to be deposited in a GDF.</p> 
<p>It is likely to take until 2150 to deposit the legacy waste into a GDF, if one is built. Only then would a GDF be able to take waste from new nuclear reactors.</p> 
<p>A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “Constructing the UK’s first geological disposal facility will provide an internationally recognised safe and permanent disposal of the most hazardous radioactive waste.</p> 
<p>“Progress continues to be made in areas taking part in the siting process for this multibillion-pound facility, which would bring thousands of skilled jobs and economic growth to the local area.”</p>
