<p>A highly pathogenic strain of bird flu has been detected at a third property in Victoria, with farmers warning it could exacerbate Australia’s egg shortage in coming months.</p> <p>Agriculture Victoria on Thursday said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/10/bird-flu-eggs-australia-new-outbreak-what-you-need-to-know">the H7N8 strain of avian influenza</a> had been detected at a third poultry farm at Euroa in Victoria’s north-east.</p> <p>The detection occurred at a property belonging to Kinross Farms – the same business where influenza was found at two other sites.</p> <p>Kinross Farms’ managing director, Philip Szepe, said the latest outbreak was “detected quickly and managed immediately”.</p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of chickens were euthanased after the outbreak was detected at the first two properties earlier this month. Guardian Australia understands the number of chickens to be euthanased across the three properties will rise to about 500,000.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/20/wilful-acts-of-bastardry-former-treasury-secretary-says-young-australian-workers-robbed-by-tax-system">‘Wilful acts of bastardry’: former Treasury secretary says young Australian workers ‘robbed’ by tax system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meg Parkinson, the president of the Victorian Farmers Federation Egg Group, said the latest outbreak would extend the timeframe of supply issues that are being seen at supermarkets and grocery stores across the nation.</p> <p>“It just means that it’ll take longer for the shelves to fill up,” she said.</p> <p>Parksinon said it would take six months for the impact of the latest outbreak to flow through to stock on store shelves.</p> <p>“It just depends on what happens.
