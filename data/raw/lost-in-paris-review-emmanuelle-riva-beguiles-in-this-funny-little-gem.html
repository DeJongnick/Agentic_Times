<p>Here is one of the final screen appearances of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/29/emmanuelle-riva-obituary">Emmanuelle Riva</a>, icon of movies from Michael Haneke’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/amour">Amour</a> to Gillo Pontecorvo’s Kapò and Alain Resnais’s Hiroshima Mon Amour, who died in January at the age of 89. It is a delectably gentle, elegant, self-effacing performance. Riva plays a lovably scatty old lady called Marthe in this Tati-esque comedy from French writer-directors Dominique Abel and Fiona Gordon. The movie they have jointly devised, and in which they star, is a clever, funny and distinctly unworldly comedy with an insouciant line in visual humour. </p> <p>Fiona (Fiona Gordon) is a young goof from Canada who comes to Paris to visit her similarly away-with-the-fairies aunt Marthe (Riva). A mishap on the banks of, and then in, the Seine leads to an encounter with a romantic tramp called Dom (Dominique Abel). It’s a classic French entertainment that could have been produced almost any time in the last 60 years. There is a sophistication in its childlike guilelessness and also a cameo for veteran French comedy player Pierre Richard. This movie is as sweet-natured as Abel and Gordon’s debut film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jul/31/rumba-film-review1">Rumba</a>, and they break out some serious tango movies here, too. It’s a little gem.</p>
