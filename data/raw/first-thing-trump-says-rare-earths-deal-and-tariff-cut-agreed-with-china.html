<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Donald Trump has said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade">Washington and Beijing have settled their dispute over rare earths</a> after crucial trade talks with the Chinese president in South Korea.</p> <p>According to China’s commerce ministry, a consensus had been reached during recent talks by both sides’ trade teams in Kuala Lumpur, which included a reduction in Trump’s “fentanyl tariff” imposed on Chinese goods, along with reciprocal measures by Beijing to suspend export controls.</p> <p>After the talks in Busan, Trump told reporters that Xi Jinping had agreed to work “very hard” to prevent the production of fentanyl. In return, Trump said he would lower fentanyl-linked tariffs from 20% to 10%, thereby lowering overall tariffs from 57% to 47%.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What else was agreed?</strong> Trump said China would axe its restrictions on rare earth exports, in a deal he said would last one year before being negotiated annually, and also buy US soya beans.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Was Taiwan discussed?</strong> No. And while Ukraine was discussed, Trump said that the topic of Chinese use of Russian oil was not really discussed.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Trump directs Pentagon to </strong><strong>‘match’</strong><strong> Russia and China in nuclear weapons testing</strong></h2>    <p>Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/trump-pentagon-us-nuclear-weapons">directed the Pentagon to “immediately” match</a> other nuclear powers in their testing of nuclear weapons, specifically citing Russia and China.</p> <p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump said: “Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.” The message was posted less than an hour before Trump met Xi in South Korea on Thursday.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>When did the U</strong><strong>S</strong><strong> last hold a full nuclear weapons test?</strong> In 1992 – and neither China nor Russia are known to have held any such tests since the same period. It is unclear what weapons testing could take place.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Revealed: ICE violates its own policy by holding people in secretive rooms for days or weeks</strong></h2>    <p>US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have increasingly been keeping people in temporary holding rooms for days or even weeks at a time in breach of federal policy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.co.uk/us-news/2025/oct/30/ice-hidden-detention-sites">a Guardian investigation has found</a>.</p> <p>The rooms, which are often small concrete spaces without beds, are used to detain people after they have been arrested but before they are transferred or released. In June, the agency changed its internal policies that previously banned it from detaining people in these rooms for more than 12 hours, raising the limit to three days.</p> <p>Some facilities have recorded massive rises in detention lengths since June, with one facility in New York experiencing a nearly 600% average rise. ICE holding facilities do not receive the same level of oversight as larger ICE detention centers.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Are </strong><strong>several people detained together?</strong> Yes. A former ICE official said the risk of people being sexually assaulted while in a holding room, either by ICE staff or another detainee, rises the longer they are held.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In other news …</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces have killed hundreds of patients and staff inside a hospital in El Fasher,</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/hundreds-reportedly-killed-at-sudanese-hospital-as-evidence-of-rsf-atrocities-mounts">according to the World Health Organization</a> and the Sudan Doctors Network. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/30/they-killed-civilians-in-their-beds-chaos-and-brutality-reign-after-fall-of-el-fasher">Thousands have fled</a> the North Darfur city as accounts emerge of the paramilitary group killing civilians.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The centrist D66 party has made huge gains in the Dutch election,</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/exit-poll-suggests-progressive-d66-party-will-become-largest-in-dutch-parliament">while the party of the far-right</a> leader Geert Wilders has lost support.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Five new suspects have been arrested in connection with the Louvre robbery,</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/30/suspects-arrested-louvre-robbery-paris-crown-jewels">police have said</a> – but the jewels remain missing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kat Abughazaleh</strong><strong>, a progressive contender for Congress, has been indicted over her participation in a protest</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/kat-abughazaleh-indicted-democrat-running-congress">outside an ICE processing facility</a> near Chicago.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Stat of the day: In the first six months of 2025, there were more than 520 US plots and acts of terrorism and targeted violence</strong></h2>    <p>There is strong evidence that political violence is on the rise in the US: in the first six months of 2025, <a href="https://www.theguardian.co.uk/us-news/2025/oct/30/extremists-political-violence-online">there were more than 520 plots and acts of terrorism</a> and targeted violence, causing 96 deaths and 329 injuries.

In India, the town has become known for one thing: running scam operations to siphon money from strangers’ bank accounts. “You lived in fear of being ‘Jamtara-ed’,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/30/scamming-became-the-new-farming-inside-india-cybercrime-villages">writes Snigdha Poonam in this long read</a> on how the district ended up a synonym for digital deceit in the country.</p> <h2><strong>Climate check: Hurricane Melissa hits Cuba after turning Jamaica into ‘disaster area’</strong></h2>    <p>Hurricane Melissa – the strongest cyclone to lash Jamaica since records began nearly two centuries ago – has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/29/hurricane-melissa-hits-cuba-after-turning-jamaica-into-disaster-area">hit Cuba after devastating parts of the neighboring</a> country, which was declared a disaster area by Jamaica’s prime minister.

Affordable, yes, practical, certainly – but hardly cool,” she writes <a href="https://www.theguardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/30/can-i-learn-to-be-cool-even-though-i-am-garrulous-swotty-and-wear-no-show-socks">as she traces the history of the origins</a> of “cool” and how it’s changed over the last century.</p> <h2><strong>Sign up</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Sign up for the US morning briefing">  <iframe src="https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4300" height="52px" data-form-title="A different kind of daily email" data-form-description="Sign up and get a daily US news briefing from the Guardian" scrolling="no" seamless frameborder="0" class="iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article" data-form-success-desc="Thanks, you'll start getting the US morning briefing soon."></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the US morning briefing</figcaption> </figure>  <p>First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
