<h2>Saturday</h2> <p>10am (all times BST)</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>The latest news and buildup on a big weekend at Women’s Euro 2025 and the Club World Cup. While England and Wales will be concentrating on preparation for their meeting on Sunday evening in their final Group D match, those who don’t take each game as it comes may have half an eye on Saturday’s Sweden v Germany game in Group C, which will sort prospective quarter-final opposition. Then when the US wakes up we’ll have news from the Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain camps as they prepare for Sunday’s final at MetLife Stadium, and we’ll have the latest transfer stories, too.

When play is wrapped up, <strong>Ali Martin</strong>, <strong>Barney Ronay</strong>, <strong>Andy Bull</strong> and <strong>Simon Burnton</strong> will bring all the analysis and reaction you need to the day’s action.</p> <h2></h2> <p>11am</p> <p>AU &amp; NZ Invitational XV v British &amp; Irish Lions</p> <p>Rugby union</p>  <p>Time is running out for those hoping to earn a place in Andy Farrell’s 23 for the first Test, which will be exactly a week away when the final warm-up match kicks off at Adelaide Oval. <strong>Daniel Gallan</strong> will have live updates as those on the fringes look to make their case – and they include the head coach’s son, Owen, who is on the bench for the first time this tour after his late call-up. <strong>Robert Kitson</strong> is our man on the spot in South Australia’s capital.</p>   <h2></h2> <p>12.25pm</p> <p>Tour de France stage eight</p> <p>Cycling</p>  <p>The peloton has been heading down France’s north-west coast in the opening week, from the Pas de Calais via Normandy to Brittany. Now it is time to head east by south-east, starting in the Breton town of Saint-Méen-le-Grand. <strong>Amy Sedghi</strong> is your live guide as Tadej Pogacar and company head to Laval, while <strong>Jeremy Whittle</strong> will be reporting from the capital of the Mayenne <em>département</em>. After five lean days for the sprinters, this is their chance and, with Jasper Philipsen out, plenty will fancy their chances.</p> <h2></h2> <p>4pm</p> <p>Wimbledon women’s singles final</p> <p>Tennis</p>  <p>It would never have happened in the years before the roof went on Centre Court, given the risk of the All England Club looking foolish if rain struck after wasting some sunshine hours, but the match-up between Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova will start at 4pm today, in pursuit of the teatime TV audience. <strong>Katy Murrells</strong> will be giving the live updates, while <strong>Tumaini Carayol</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Liew</strong>, <strong>Yara El-Shaboury</strong> and <strong>Simon Cambers</strong> will have all the reports, analysis and news from the penultimate day in SW19.</p> <h2></h2> <p>8pm</p> <p>Sweden v Germany and Denmark v Poland</p> <p>Women’s Euro 2025</p>  <p>We already know who is going through from Group C in Switzerland, with Sweden and Germany both winning their first two matches and now facing each other to decide who comes out on top, which may well mean who gets a chance at gaining revenge against England for defeats at Euro 2022. Sweden, who lost 4-0 to Sarina Wiegman’s team in their semi-final three years ago, need only a draw, as Germany, controversially beaten 2-1 in the 2022 final, have inferior goal difference. <strong>Scott Murray</strong> is on the minute-by-minute updates, while <strong>Suzanne Wrack</strong> will be reporting from Zurich. <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong>, meanwhile, will provide all the latest on Denmark v Poland, with the latter, especially, at risk of having the worst record at the finals …</p>   <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>10am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>It’s the big day in New York, if you are Fifa or an American football Giants/Jets fan, or New Jersey for the more geographically aware, and we will have the buildup to the first Club World Cup final of the Infantino-Trump era, between Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea. Meanwhile, in what is indisputably St Gallen, England and Wales fans will be gathering before their teams meet in a decisive group match at the Women’s Euros. While these promise to be festive occasions, we will also be keeping abreast of a poignant afternoon at Deepdale, as Liverpool take to the pitch for a friendly against Preston in their first game since the death of Diogo Jota.

With England batting first this time, they will be the ones looking to set a target. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> and <strong>James Wallace</strong> are again covering the live action for us, while <strong>Ali Martin</strong>, <strong>Barney Ronay</strong> and <strong>Simon Burnton</strong> will be summing up the day.</p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>12.25pm</p> <p>Tour de France stage nine</p> <p>Cycling</p>  <p>Chinon to Chateauroux is another run for the sprinters, with the finish a happy hunting ground for Mark Cavendish: his first stage victory, in 2008, and his 32nd, in 2021, both came here. It will be flat-out at the end of the day, after being just flat up till then, with not a single rated climb. <strong>Amy Sedghi</strong> is again at the helm of the live coverage, while <strong>Jeremy Whittle</strong> is our man keeping an eye on everyone from the <em>maillot jaune</em> to the <em>lanterne rouge</em>; last year, in his final tour, it was Cavendish who finished as the latter, the name given to the rider who survives the whole Tour to come in last overall.</p> <h2></h2> <p>4pm</p> <p>Wimbledon men’s singles final</p> <p>Tennis</p>  <p>In 2019, Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 13-12 at about 7.10pm. Even though a super tie-break will, if needed, come in at 6-6 in the final set now, with the first to 10 points claiming the trophy, the odds are we won’t find out the winner of Jannik Sinner’s rematch against Carlos Alcaraz until much later this year, given the 4pm start. <strong>Daniel Harris</strong> will cover all the live action, while <strong>Tumaini Carayol</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Liew</strong> and <strong>Sean Ingle</strong> will be reporting from the climax to the 138th championships. Can it possibly be as exciting as the pair’s French Open final last month, in which Alcaraz survived being 0-40 down when serving to stay in the match?</p> <h2></h2> <p>8pm</p> <p>Chelsea v Paris Saint-Germain</p> <p>Club World Cup final</p>  <p>Perhaps not the final that anyone exactly wanted – an intercontinental match-up is always preferable in global tournaments – but an intriguing one nonetheless, with Enzo Maresca’s topsy-turvy first season at Chelsea ending with a chance to land a huge prize against a Paris Saint-Germain team seeking a clean sweep, adding the Club World Cup to all of France’s domestic honours and the Champions League. <strong>Michael Butler</strong> is covering the Coppa Gianni finale as it happens, while <strong>Sid Lowe</strong> and <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> are braving the heat of MetLife Stadium.</p>   <h2></h2> <p>8pm</p> <p>England v Wales and Netherlands v France</p> <p>Women’s Euro 2025</p>  <p>Group D reaches its conclusion with England not certain of progress but knowing that any victory will suffice; if they finish level on six points with a victorious Netherlands and a beaten France, then it is mathematically impossible for both those two to have a better head-to-head goal difference than England’s +3. Wales’s hopes are slim: they need France to beat the Netherlands and see off England by four clear goals. <strong>Emillia Hawkins</strong> covers the UK derby live, while <strong>Will Unwin</strong> is on duty for Netherlands v France. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong> is in Basel with the Dutch and French, while <strong>Suzanne Wrack</strong>, <strong>Tom Garry</strong> and <strong>Sophie Downey</strong> are in Zurich for the Anglo-Welsh argument.</p>
