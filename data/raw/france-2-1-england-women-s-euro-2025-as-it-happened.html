France were their bosses up until Keira Walsh scored a goal out of nowhere near the end, and with some better decision-making in the second half, they’d have added to their first-half tally. England’s shaky defence rode their luck on a couple of occasions as well. But while the result and the overall performance will sting Sarina Wiegman and her team, those last few minutes will offer a little succour. England had been tame up until that point; at least during that frantic denouement, they finally showed a spirit that suggested they’ll not be giving up their trophy so easily. They can’t afford the same again next Wednesday against the Netherlands, though.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686992678f0833eb8520f29b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-05T21:01:36.695Z">10.01pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">FULL TIME: France 2-1 England</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>France hold on by the skin of their teeth!

This, you suspect, is going to be tasty.</p> <p><strong>It’s not that easy to predict, mind.</strong> France have the overall upper hand in the head-to-head, with five wins from ten meetings to England’s two. But it’s the most recent match-ups that are the most instructive, and these teams met last year in qualifying for these finals, and traded 2-1 away victories within the space of four days. So good luck calling it.</p> <p><strong>Perhaps overall form clears the picture?</strong> Well, perhaps: France are on an eight-game winning streak, while the Lionesses have been inconsistent of late, defeated by Belgium and Spain in recent Nations League matches. But Sarina Wiegman’s women can also boast a victory over the world champions this year, and they’ve recently put five past Belgium, six past Portugal, and seven past Jamaica. So yeah, good luck calling this. <strong>The game kicks off at 8pm UK time, 9pm in Zurich.</strong> It’s on!</p> </div>   </div>
