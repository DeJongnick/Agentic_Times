<p>Thank you for publishing a measured and mature piece about the rights of people with gender-critical views to be heard (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/12/gender-critical-book-scotland-national-library-uk-supreme-court">A gender-critical book at Scotland’s National Library is the latest in a long line of cancellations, 12 September</a>). We are not horrible bigots who do not accept trans people and think they should face discrimination. But that is usually the narrative.</p> <p>We are mainly women who have real and well-researched concerns about, for example, the effects of medical treatment that was being given to young people – who do not have the maturity to appreciate the life-changing outcomes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/11/puberty-blockers-to-be-banned-indefinitely-for-under-18s-across-uk">puberty blockers</a> and irreversible surgery.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/23/gender-critical-discourse-must-calm-down">Gender-critical discourse must calm down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The many wider issues of concern are also complex. For example, women’s sports are physically dangerous when male-bodied opponents are allowed to compete. It is possible to live as the opposite sex from the physical body, but genetic makeup and sex characteristics cannot be changed. This is not prejudice. It is scientific fact.</p> <p>People such as the philosopher <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/26/university-of-sussex-fined-freedom-of-speech-investigation-kathleen-stock">Kathleen Stock</a>, For Women Scotland group, the comedy writer Graham Linehan, and many others who have extensively researched and spoken out about these issues, have been doing so for years and have had to fight for their right to be heard. Jobs and incomes have been lost and reputations sabotaged. But they have, thankfully, kept going.</p> <p>That libraries and literary festivals are being influenced by trans rights activists to censor gender-critical writers and artists is no surprise to any of us who have an interest in this issue. It is shocking. But we must all speak up or our precious rights to free speech will be further eroded.</p> <p>That the Guardian has published this article by a gender-critical writer is a welcome step forward. Let us hope that recent legal wins may be the start of a more measured and honest debate outside what has become a nasty and misogynistic shouting match (and actual censorship) against those who care about young people, and the rights of women and gay people.<br><strong>Name and address supplied</strong></p>
