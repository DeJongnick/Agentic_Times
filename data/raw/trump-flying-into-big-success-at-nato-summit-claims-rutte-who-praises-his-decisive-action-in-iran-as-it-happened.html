Strategic competition is intensifying. Extremist ideologies are on the rise. Technology is transforming the nature of both war and domestic security. Hostile state activity takes place on British soil. </em></p> <p><em>It is an era of radical uncertainty, and we must navigate it with agility, speed and a clear-eyed sense of the national interest.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The report warned in particular that:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Many of the <strong>rules which have governed the international system in the past are eroding.</strong> </em></p> <p><em>Global commons are being contested by major powers like <strong>China</strong> and <strong>Russia</strong>, seeking to establish control and secure resources in outer space, cyberspace, the deep sea, and at the Arctic and Antarctic poles. </em></p> <p><em>There will be less scope for agreement on mechanisms which protect fair trade, set controls on science and technological developments and mitigate the effects of climate change, as multilateral institutions decline in influence.</em>”</p> </blockquote> <p>It added:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“The UK’s national security and growth objectives will be <strong>profoundly affected by tensions between the major powers and regulatory blocs</strong> on trade, technology and defence.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The study included particular warnings against Russia and Iran:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“The most obvious and pressing example of this is Russia in its illegal war against a European neighbour. Ukrainians are paying the ultimate price as they find themselves at the frontline of this confrontation.</em></p> <p><em>This war has been accompanied with a campaign of indirect and sub-threshold activity – including cyber attacks and sabotage – by Russia against the UK and other Nato allies and the use of increased nuclear rhetoric in an attempt to constrain our decision making. </em></p> <p><em>Iranian hostile activity on British soil is also increasing, as part of the Iranian regime’s efforts to silence its critics abroad as well as directly threatening the UK.</em></p> <p><em>Meanwhile, some adversaries are laying the foundations for future conflict, positioning themselves to move quickly to cause major disruption to our energy and or supply chains, to deter us from standing up to their aggression.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>It included this stark warning that:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>“For the first time in many years, we have to actively prepare for the possibility of the UK homeland coming under direct threat, potentially in a wartime scenario.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Earlier today, minister <strong>Pat</strong> <strong>McFadden</strong> said the 5% figure of GDP proposed at Nato was not just what he called “an out of date concept of defence and national security” that saw it “purely as the budget for the armed forces.”</p> <p>He told listeners: </p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Critical as that budget is and those capabilities are, <strong>you have to look after your broader security.</strong> Our cyber systems, for example, are under

pursue a close relationship with Moscow have eased, <strong>though none have gone away</strong>.</p> <p>Ukraine’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy,</strong> is invited to the dinner, but not to a working meeting with Nato leaders, reflecting the softening US support for Kyiv, where fresh military aid has been halted under Trump.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Shea</strong>, a former Nato spokesperson

about what we can afford, but what governments choose to prioritise,” said Sebastian Mang, senior policy officer at the New Economics Foundation (NEF).</p> <p>“Having already committed to higher defence budgets, plans to raise spending even further expose the double standard applied to investment in climate, housing and care.</p> <p>“If extraordinary sums can be mobilised for the military, with far lower economic returns and much lower social benefits, then the refusal to fund a just transition and stronger public services is clearly political, not economic.”</p> <p>According to the Nato proposals, members would increase spending to 3.5% of GDP for “hard defence” such as tanks, bombs and other military hardware, while devoting a further 1.5% to broader security, including cyber threats and military mobility.</p> <p>An analysis by NEF found the 5% GDP target would require Nato’s EU members alone to increase spending by €613bn a year – a sum considerably higher than the annual
