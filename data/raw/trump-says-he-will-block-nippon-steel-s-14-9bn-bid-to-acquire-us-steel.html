<p>Donald Trump said on Monday that he intends to block Japan’s Nippon Steel’s $14.9bn bid to acquire US Steel in a move that will fuel further fears about a global trade war when the Republican returns to the White House next month.</p> <p>“I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan” the US president-elect said in a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113586503722263487">statement</a> on Monday, adding: “Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST! As President, I will block this deal from happening. Buyer Beware!!!”</p> <p>The acquisition by Nippon Steel, Japan’s largest steelmaker, to takeover US Steel, the Pittsburgh steel producer established in 1901 that played a vital role in America’s industrialization, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/18/nippon-steel-us-steel-acquisition">announced last year</a> and is under review.</p> <p>The deal has faced criticism from the United Steelworkers union as well as several lawmakers, who view the deal as a threat to national security, job security and workers’ pensions. Joe Biden and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/03/kamala-harris-joe-biden-campaign-labor-day-pittsburgh">vice-president, Kamala Harris,</a> have also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/election-harris-trump-pennsylvania">expressed their opposition</a> for the deal.</p> <p>During the campaign trail, Harris<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/03/kamala-harris-joe-biden-campaign-labor-day-pittsburgh"> told voters</a> she “couldn’t agree more with President Biden: US Steel should remain American-owned and American-operated”.</p> <p>The deal is under review by the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS), a government panel that reviews foreign acquisitions of American companies. In September, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/election-harris-trump-pennsylvania">extended the review</a>, delaying a decision until after the presidential election.</p> <p>The deadline for the review is at the end of this month, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/02/us/politics/trump-nippon-steel-us-merger.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">New York Times</a>, so there will either be another extension or a decision.</p> <p>In a statement after Trump’s comments on Monday, Nippon Steel said that it was “determined to protect and grow US Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency, and US national security” according to <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-block-nippon-steel-040218145.html">Agence France-Presse</a>.</p> <p>The Japanese firm added that it would “invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at US Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers”.</p> <p>It<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/18/nippon-steel-us-steel-acquisition"> was reported</a> that under the proposed deal, US Steel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/18/nippon-steel-us-steel-acquisition">would retain its name </a>and headquarters in Pittsburgh. Nippon has also said that it will honor existing collective bargaining agreements.</p> <p>US Steel has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/28/election-harris-trump-pennsylvania">claimed that blocking the deal could lead to job cuts </a>in Pennsylvania and relocation, and has promised to invest $2.4bn in its facilities if the sale goes through.</p> <p>Critics, however, argue that the Japanese corporation’s purchase of US Steel could pose threats to national security, lead to job cuts and potentially the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-06/u-s-steel-jobs-shift-to-arkansas-away-from-pittsburgh">relocation of workers to non-union states</a>.</p> <p>The United Steelworkers union said in <a href="https://usw.org/union/mission/industries/metals/resources/bargaining-with-uss/the-usw-is-fighting-for-all-members-at-uss">statement on Monday</a> that the deal was “bad for workers, our communities, and the domestic industry, as well as for our national security, critical infrastructure, and domestic supply chains”. It added: “We must continue to resist it – together.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, the United Steelworkers union, which <a href="https://m.usw.org/news/media-center/releases/2024/usw-endorses-kamala-harris-for-president">endorsed Harris</a> for president, thanked Trump for his opposition to the deal.</p> <p>“It’s clear he knows the danger it poses to our national security, our steel industry and communities it supports” the union <a href="https://x.com/steelworkers/status/1863948436946502127">said</a>. “USS must be kept domestically owned and operated!”</p> <p>Trump’s pledge on Monday to block the US Steel deal with Nippon and to “make US Steel strong” through a “series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs” aligns with his intention as president to impose tariffs on foreign imports, which he says will benefit US businesses.</p> <p>Last week, Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/trump-mexico-canada-tariffs-border">announced</a> that upon taking office, he would sign an executive order imposing a 25% tariff on all imports from Canada and Mexico, along with an additional 10% tariff on imports from China.</p> <p>Some economists have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/27/trump-tariffs-explained">warned</a> that US consumers would probably feel the impact of the tariffs through higher prices. They <a href="https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/fiscal-macroeconomic-and-price-estimates-tariffs-under-both-non-retaliation-and-retaliation">estimate</a> that such tariffs could increase household costs between $1,900 to $7,600 – a 1.4% to 5.1% increase in inflation – as companies will probably pass on the tariff costs to consumers.</p>
