<p>Education experts say a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/31/queensland-and-victoria-rebuff-albanese-governments-offer-of-more-public-school-funding">“landmark” deal</a> to fully fund Western Australia’s public schools by 2026 is “not good enough” and still lets the state government “off the hook”.</p> <p>The “statement of intent”, announced on Wednesday by education minister, Jason Clare, would increase funding for Western Australian public schools by $1.6bn over the next five years, with $770m coming from the commonwealth.</p> <p>“Fully funded” refers to the school resource standard (SRS), which estimates how much public funding a school needs to meet students’ needs.</p> <p>Under the statement of intent, the federal government would increase its public school funding from 20% of the SRS to 22.5%, with the state government to lift its own funding by an equivalent amount to reach 100%. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/31/education-ministers-unite-to-demand-albanese-government-fix-teacher-shortages">Education ministers unite to demand Albanese government fix teacher shortages</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Currently no public school in Australia, except for schools in the Australian Capital Territory, is funded at the SRS level – a benchmark for required funding based on student needs.</p> <p>But the Australian Education Union (AEU) president, Correna Haythorpe, said the deal was “not good enough”.</p> <p>She said the deal allowed state governments to continue “fudging the books” using a depreciation tax which allows them to claim about 4% of their public school funding share on non-school expenditures like transport, capital depreciation, regulatory bodies and preschools.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>“Some money is not enough money. This has been going on for far too long – the hero moment needs to be now.”</p> <p>When questioned over the 4% tax on Wednesday, Western Australia’s minister for education, Tony Buti, said it had “always been considered” as part of the funding agreement, adding “every other state does it”.</p> <p>The 4% depreciation tax equated to around $230m of WA’s funding share in 2023.</p> <p>“That 4% goes to ensuring that we have a quality education,” Buti said.</p> <p>Haythorpe said his comments were “complete rubbish”, adding that former shadow minister for education Tanya Plibersek had described the tax as “accounting tricks” before the federal election.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/31/the-school-holidays-are-too-long-parents-are-exhausted-kids-are-over-it-lord-have-mercy">The school holidays are too long.

Again.”</p> <p>The convener of advocacy group Save our Schools, Trevor Cobbold, said while the deal was a significant step forward, it still let the state government “off the hook”.</p> <p>He said if the commonwealth was to increase its share of funding to 25%, it should be conditional on states getting rid of the 4% rule. </p> <p>“It’s not a benchmark for agreements with the other states,” he said. “It’s just not true they’re going to get to 100% [of funding] by 2025 or even 2029.</p> <p>“This is another deceit perpetrated by the government … a deliberate lie,” he said.</p> <p>Cobbold noted the WA government had cut its funding share for public schools from 84.4% of the SRS when the last funding agreement was penned in 2018, to 75% in 2024.</p> <p>“WA has agreed to start clawing back cuts to its share over the past five years,” he said. “But with the commonwealth funding share at 22.5%, WA public schools will be funded at only 95.6% of their SRS in 2029.</p> <p>“The cumulative under-funding over five years will be about $1.6bn. This is not good enough, especially while WA private schools will remain over-funded to at least 2029.”</p>
