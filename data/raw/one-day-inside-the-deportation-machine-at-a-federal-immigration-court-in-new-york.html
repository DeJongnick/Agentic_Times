<p>A brother is torn from his sister. A father arrives for his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> hearing with his family, only to find that they will be leaving without him. A woman, seemingly relieved after emerging from her hearing, finds that her life is about to change when she is apprehended by federal officials waiting just outside the door.</p> <p>These are just some of the moments that happened on a single day in the Jacob K Javits federal building at 26 Federal Plaza in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York City</a>, the largest federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan.</p> <p>Courthouse <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/22/ice-arrests-immigration-courts">detentions</a> have been one of many flashpoints in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s expanding crackdown on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a>, as federal authorities seek to arrest 3,000 people a day. There have been reports of arrests at courthouses across the country, from Phoenix to Los Angeles to Chicago, turning routine hearings into scenes fraught with anxiety and fear. A recently filed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/16/trump-administration-sued-immigration-court-deporting">class-action lawsuit</a> against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> seeks to bar the practice of courthouse arrests.</p>      <p>Immigration court presents an especially precarious situation. Not showing up for a hearing can have serious consequences, but as the Guardian observed in the hallways outside courtrooms in New York, showing up also has serious consequences. Even though some people had been granted follow-up hearings, they were detained by federal officials in the hallway and rushed to a stairwell for holding elsewhere in the building. On 18 June, representatives <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/dhs-immigration-detention-center-visits-new-guidance">Jerry Nadler and Dan Goldman</a> attempted to conduct oversight on the building’s 10th floor, where people have been held, sometimes for days at a time, but were rebuffed by federal officials. Recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/jul/22/footage-reveals-harsh-conditions-inside-ices-new-york-city-confinement-centre-video">released footage</a> shows the harsh conditions faced by people held <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/ice-videos-new-york-trump">on the 10th floor</a>.</p> <p>What follows is a visual timeline of a single day inside the halls of the Jacob K Javits federal building, where some people found their lives forever changed.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>8</strong><strong>.57am</strong><strong> </strong>– A family walks towards a courtroom past masked federal agents. Only the father has a hearing, and his family would not be allowed to enter the room with him. They would have to wait elsewhere.</p>    <p><strong>9</strong><strong>.51am</strong><strong> </strong>– A federal agent checks a stack of documents containing identifying information for people slated for detention.</p>    <p><strong>10</strong><strong>.11am</strong><strong> </strong>– Federal agents load a detained man into an elevator.</p>    <p><strong>10</strong><strong>.17am</strong> – Federal agents wait.</p>    <p><strong>10</strong><strong>.30am</strong><strong> </strong>– Federal agents lead a detained man to a stairwell.</p>      <p><strong>11</strong><strong>.25am</strong><strong> </strong>– The New York City comptroller, Brad Lander, left, escorts a man to the elevator after his hearing. Lander has made regular appearances at the federal building to observe cases and help people leave the building. He was arrested <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/17/brad-lander-arrested-new-york-city-comptroller">on 17 June</a> as he was attempting to help escort someone out. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Lander “was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer”, though video evidence of the encounter debunks that allegation. He was subsequently released the same day.</p>    <p><strong>11</strong><strong>.45am</strong><strong> </strong>– After successfully escorting a man to the elevator, Lander then returns to a courtroom to observe another case. At 11.45am, he stands in the doorway and announces to federal agents that a man named Carlos has been granted a follow-up hearing in 2029. He asks the assembled agents if they would allow him to return for that hearing. No one says anything in response.</p>    <p><strong>11</strong><strong>.46am</strong><strong> </strong>– Chaos breaks out as multiple federal agents grab Carlos while his sister screams.</p>      <p><strong>11</strong><strong>.55am</strong> – Court employees had informed a sketch artist that she wouldn’t be allowed inside the courtrooms at the federal building, despite the fact that such artists are generally permitted in courtrooms where cameras are banned, as in high-profile federal trials. The sketch artist resorts to drawing the scene <a href="https://www.instagram.com/loveizzystudio/p/DMQnt5vOrU6/">in the hallway</a>. She would subsequently be allowed into the courtroom.</p>    <p><strong>12</strong><strong>.58pm</strong><strong> </strong>– A half-eaten snack bar sticks out of a tactical vest.</p>    <p><strong>1</strong><strong>.51pm</strong> – After emerging from a hearing, a woman is immediately apprehended by a masked federal agent who asks for her name and to look at her documents. Upon reviewing her documents, the agent tells her she can leave. “Have a nice day,” he says in Spanish.</p>    <p><strong>2</strong><strong>.11pm</strong><strong> </strong>– Federal agents detain the father from the family observed at 8.57am and lead him to a stairwell. The Guardian later observed a photojournalist telling the man’s family in Spanish that he had been arrested. Their oldest child broke down in tears as the other two slept, after waiting for him for hours after their arrival. The mother said he had no criminal history and that their asylum cases were in progress.</p>      <p><strong>2</strong><strong>.58pm</strong><strong> </strong>– The last woman to emerge from her hearing holds a stack of documents in her hand, and she smiles briefly before a masked agent whose T-shirt reads “police” apprehends her. Her smile fades to an expression of fear as she learns that she will not be allowed to leave. Federal agents then rush her to a stairwell.</p>
