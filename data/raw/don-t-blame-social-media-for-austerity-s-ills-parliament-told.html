<p>Social media is wrongly blamed for mental health issues in young people when the real culprit is austerity, a parliamentary committee has heard.</p> <p>Taking evidence on the effects of social media on young people’s health, the Commons science and technology committee was told by the mental health campaigner Natasha Devon that “in focusing so much on social media … we can sometimes take our eye off other things”.</p> <p>“Anxiety and self-harm in particular have risen dramatically since 2010. And when you look at what happened in 2010 in terms of the effect that austerity has had on families, it’s clear that there is a link between, for example, poverty and poor mental health.</p> <p>“And also we’ve lost things in the school system, things that we know have a therapeutic value. In the state sector, things like art, music, drama and sport have been systematically squeezed out.</p> <p>“So when you put that all together, you create an environment, I think, where it’s difficult for young people to enjoy a good level of mental health, even before you take social media into account.”</p> <p>Devon was speaking alongside the children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, who argued that social media was unlikely to cause problems by itself, but said communications platforms could exacerbate problems such as bullying that already existed in a pre-digital age.</p> <p>“Again, it hasn’t caused it. There’s been bullying forever,” Longfield said, “but what cyberbullying does is allow individuals to track that person. You can never get away. There’s a sense that, back in the day, we’d go home from school, things would settle, you’d be in your home and you’d come back, and it would be another day.</p> <p>“Well, what young people talk to me about is that constancy: throughout the evening, into the early morning, and it can get to you in your hand, as you’re falling asleep, and beep away throughout the night. So unless we take preventative action to stop some of those things happening – blocking, and turning off the thing, and all those things – then there’s a direct nature of cyberbullying. Bullying in any sense is awful, and eats away at your confidence and sense of self, but cyberbullying gets you wherever you are and I think that is particularly dangerous.”</p> <p>Longfield had harsh words for big tech companies such as Facebook, which operates three of the most popular social networks among young people, and Google, whose YouTube video site is as popular as broadcast TV with 12- to 15-year-olds, <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/108182/children-parents-media-use-attitudes-2017.pdf">according to the regulator Ofcom</a>.</p> <p>“I’ve been pushing the tech companies for a couple of years now, with I’d still say limited success, around them taking more responsibility for their platforms being a positive environment. There has been a change of tone, there has been some movement, but in my view not adequate enough.</p> <p>“We should remember that this is one of those areas where the internet absolutely wasn’t designed for children, but they’re one of the biggest groups within it, so we need to make sure that there’s protection around them as a vulnerable group in their own right. I would like … a duty of care for those companies.”</p> <p>Longfield, formerly the chief executive of the 4Children charity <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/mar/22/nation-children-life-chances">before she became the children’s commissioner for England</a>, also argued that the biggest single change her office needed was the power to request data from technology companies. The children’s commissioner can request information from any “public” body, she said, but the legislation had not caught up with the fact that the digital world represents a public space operated by private companies.</p>
