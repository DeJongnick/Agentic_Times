<p>A larger proportion of people who frequently watch GB News wrongly believe that net migration to the UK is increasing than those of other major channels, according to a study examining public attitudes to broadcasting impartiality.</p> <p><a href="https://www.enhancingimpartiality.com/blog/opinion-polling-impartiality">Research by Cardiff University</a>, seen by the Guardian, also found public opposition to allowing politicians to front current affairs programmes – contradicting research carried out by regulator, Ofcom.</p> <p>It found 51% of the public oppose politicians being allowed to present current affairs programmes. Only 29% agreed with the current rules. With those undecided excluded, 64% do not agree with them.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/zkZuN/1/" data-alt="Net migration in the UK has been in decline since the year-ending June 2023"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/zkZuN/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Responding to the findings, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said the public were “right to be concerned about elected politicians playing the role of news presenters”.</p> <p>It comes amid heightened political concern about the number of Reform UK politicians appearing on GB News, including the party’s leader, Nigel Farage. Nandy has recently spoken out about coverage in which “political polemic is now presented as news”.</p> <p>Immigration has been the main political theme in British politics for months, despite net migration to Britain almost halving to 431,000 last year.</p> <p>However, the latest research found 84% of frequent GB News viewers believe new migration has increased. That fell to 71% of ITV frequent viewers, 62% for BBC viewers and 51% of the Channel 4 audience.</p> <p>The level of public support for blocking politicians from fronting current affairs shows appears to contradict Ofcom’s own research. Its own report published last year, based on focus groups rather than polling, concluded “there was no consensus” for preventing politicians hosting TV and radio shows.</p> <p>There now appears to be a conflict between Nandy and Ofcom over the issue. Responding to Cardiff University’s findings, Nandy said it was “troubling that the line between political polemic and objective facts has become blurred in some cases in recent years”.</p> <p>“People rightly expect the highest standards of accuracy and impartiality from their broadcast media and we must ensure they get it,” she said.</p> <p>While Ofcom is currently consulting on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/mar/17/ofcom-rushes-to-close-loophole-politicians-act-as-newsreaders">minor changes to tighten broadcasting rules</a> after some of its rulings against GB News were overturned in the courts, it has no plans to stop politicians presenting shows overall.</p> <p>“Our consultation was about the issue of politicians presenting news content following the high court judgment earlier this year,” a spokesperson said. “It did not extend to considerations around politicians presenting non-news content, including current affairs programmes. We will be publishing our decision in due course.”</p> <p>Angelos Frangopoulos, GB News’s chief executive, has said the channel “has never and does not use politicians to present news programmes”, stating they only presented shows classed as current affairs programmes.</p> <p>Prof Stephen Cushion of Cardiff University’s school of journalism, media and culture, who led the study, said it should lead Ofcom to re-examine the issue. “We would urge Ofcom to reopen its consultation on this and widen its remit to ask whether the public actually wants politicians presenting non-news programming,” he said.</p> <p>Britain’s broadcasting impartiality rules appear to have driven higher trust in TV and radio as sources of news, with 49% of the public saying they trust them. Both are subject to impartiality rules.</p> <p>Just 7% trust social media, with 28% trusting both online sources and print newspapers. The BBC emerged as the most trusted broadcaster for news. Just 18% trusted GB News.</p> <p>While support for retaining impartiality in British broadcasting remains strong, it is becoming weaker among younger audiences. About three-quarters (76%) of people between the age of 50 and 64 think broadcasters in the UK should be regulated for news and current affairs programming. However, that figure sinks to 57% for those aged between 18 and 24.</p> <p>The polling for the study was carried out by YouGov. It conducted a representative poll of about 2,000 people online between 5 and 6 October.</p>
