10-year plan for NHS in England could break down divisions between hospital and GP care</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Hospitals could take over GP surgeries and family doctors could run hospitals under radical plans to reform the NHS in England, <strong>Wes Streeting</strong>, the health secretary, has suggested.</p> <p>Speaking at the NHS ConfedExpo conference in Manchester, Streeting said that under the 10-year health plan being published in July “much of what’s done in a hospital today will be done on the high street”.</p> <p>But this was not “another top-down reorganisation” of the NHS, he said.</p> <p>Streeting said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The NHS should not be bound by traditional expectations of how services should be arranged.</p> <p>I am open to our strongest acute trusts providing not just community services, as many already do, but also primary care.</p> <p>Whatever services will enable them to meet the needs of their patients in a more integrated and efficient way.</p> <p>Indeed, I would hope that those old-fashioned labels – acute, community – become increasingly meaningless.</p> <p>Likewise, there is no reason why successful GPs should not be able to run local hospitals, or why nurses should not be leading neighbourhood health services.</p> </blockquote> <p>Commenting on the speech, <strong>Matthew Taylor</strong>, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The secretary of state is right that the divides between acute, primary, community are already being broken down, supported by the work of integrated care boards.</p> <p>Redesigning services is essential to the future of the NHS and many providers are already breaking down their traditional silos to offer patients truly personalised and integrated care.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-12T15:29:34.428Z">at 4.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div

It is an elegant read, covering not just Starmer but the state of the nation too. Here is McTague’s conclusion:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Thatcher was the last prime minister of genuine, world importance. For a brief moment Blair reached tragically towards such status, but proved unable to overcome his own flaws and failures. During the global financial crisis, Brown briefly mattered, though mainly through force of intellect. Cameron continued the trajectory down, a shrunken, vanilla Blair. Those who raged against the dying of this light – Johnson and Truss – only burned out more quickly. Sunak resumed the trend, the first prime minister-management consultant who seemed destined to bounce into something more powerful in Silicon Valley. Starmer is perhaps the inevitable conclusion of this process, the first prime minister comfortable with Britain’s new status. He looks and sounds like a Scandinavian leader. There are worse futures. Much of Westminster seems blind to the – still very real – prospect that Labour could remain in power after the next election, alone or in coalition with the other forces on the left.</p> <p>Ultimately, Keir Starmer is convinced he can succeed where every recent prime minister has failed. He is the prime fixer of Britain, the manager, convinced that the country he leads is not so much traumatised as let down …</p> <p>But these are not normal times. On the days I accompanied him, Starmer was inspecting the fleets and troops of a country rearming for war. Reform is rising. The temperature online remains angry, volatile, resentful. Either he will become the country’s first normal prime minister, guided by the “human dignity” he holds as the irreducible core of his politics, and able to make us, if not a great country again, then what in our last meeting he called “a rich nation in the broadest sense of the term”. Or the Britain we saw last summer will burst out again, and he will be remembered as the last leader of the old normal, the final defender of the shaky post-2008 world before it was dragged into a new state by the figures now jockeying for mastery of the populist right. “I know what my job is,” Keir Starmer tells me before we part. “To clear up the mess.”</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-684ae4cd8f0814dfee5fea98" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T14:42:00.622Z">3.42pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">US-UK trade deal about to be finalised 'very soon', Jonathan Reynolds says</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Jonathan Reynolds</strong>, the business secretary, has said that finalised version of the US-UK trade deal originally announced last month is due to be announced “very soon”.</p> <p>Although President Trump and Keir Starmer announced the original deal to much fanfare, some details were unresolved and the tariff reductions it featured were not implemented.</p> <p>Now it is about to be finalised.

There is a strong public interest in the information commissioner taking pro-active steps to investigate and, if necessary, issue enforcement notices against the public authorities and Reform UK Ltd.</p> <p>“I also suspect that council staff would welcome the support of the information commissioner, given the clear threats to sack them if they sound the alarm on breaches of the law.

This, on the face of it, looks like a large funding increase and has been reported by some as such.</p> <p>However, that would be misleading. This is because after the UK left the EU, farmers were promised that their subsidies would be the same as they were under the EU, and were promised a figure of £2.4bn a year.</p> <p>The Tory government at the time decided that, rather than being paid per acre, farmers should be paid for improving nature, so it devised the ELMS schemes. But while these were being set up, acreage payments known as basic payments schemes (BPS) were kept. These would be cut each year as the ELMS increased and are due to be phased out entirely by 2028.</p> <p>So, farmers currently get the £2.4bn a year in two streams - the ELMS and the BPS - as well as a smaller amount of money in grants for things like robotics trials.</p> <p>By 2028/29 they will not be paid BPS so will only get ELMS and this will have a value of £2bn. There may be some other grants available to top this up, but this has not been confirmed.</p> <p>In reality, the government has promised an average of £2.3bn a year up to 2028/29 for the farming budget, which is a £100m a year cut, and by the end of the spending period the budget shrinks to not much more than £2bn.</p> <p>NFU senior economist <strong>Sanjay Dhanda</strong> said Defra has been “misleading” in its claims. He said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>A key pillar of Defra’s budget is the continued investment in ELMs, with funding set to rise to £2bn by 2028/29 compared to the £1.8bn earmarked in the autumn 2024 budget. While the government has framed this as a significant uplift from the £800m spent in 2023/24, this comparison is misleading as ELMs was not fully operational at that point, and de-linked payments (BPS) absorbed a large share of funding.</p> <p>The actual increase is a modest £200m over four years – barely sufficient to keep pace with inflation, let alone scale up delivery.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-684abd7a8f089bbac352e82d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T12:15:53.950Z">1.15pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Government urged to review 'rubbish' law governing how MPs approve treaties, as Commons welcomes Gibraltar deal</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>David Lammy</strong>, the foreign secretary, has been urged to review the “rubbish” system in place for parliament to approve treaties.</p> <p>The criticism was made by <strong>Emily Thornberry</strong>, the Labour chair of the foreign affairs committee, during a statement on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/agreement-protects-sovereignty-and-economic-security-of-gibraltar">the agreement</a> the government has reached with the EU over Gibraltar. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/11/uk-and-gibraltar-strike-deal-over-territorys-future-and-borders">UK and Spain strike ‘historic’ deal over Gibraltar’s future and borders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While <strong>Priti Patel</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, said the opposition wanted to read the full text of the agreement before making a final judgment, she and other opposition MPs speaking were generally supportive of the deal, which settles the one outstanding dispute between the UK and the EU left unresolved since Brexit.</p> <p><strong>Thornberry</strong> congratulated Lammy and his negotiating partners for getting deal, but she said she was concerned by his comment that the deal would be considered by MPs in the usual way under the <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9247/">Crag (Constitutonal Reform and Governance Act) process</a>. </p> <p>The Act, passed by the coalition government, in theory allows MPs to delay ratification of a treaty if they don’t like it. But they can only delay by voting against, and there is no obligation on the government to schedule a vote, and so in practice they never get the chance to hold up treaties.</p> <p>Thornberry said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I have to say, I think it’s rubbish, the Crag process, and I do ask [Lammy] to look again at it.</p> </blockquote> <p>MPs should have the right to vote on treaties, she said. She went on:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The [current] requirement is that the government lays before parliament a treaty which this house may resolve not to ratify during a 21-day delay. How that’s done, frankly, I don’t know because it’s never been done …</p> <p>The Crag process is obscure. It is out of date. It is basically unfit for 21st century, unfit for this place, and I do ask the foreign secretary to look at it again.</p> </blockquote> <p>In response, <strong>Lammy</strong> said he heard what Thornberry was saying, and wanted to ensure there would be proper parliamentary scrutiny of the treaty.</p> <p>At the Downing Street lobby briefing the <strong>a No 10 spokesperson</strong> said that failure to reach a deal on Gibraltar could have cost the UK hundreds of millions of pounds. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If an agreement was not reached, the EU’s incoming system of entry and exit control would have meant a hard border.</p> <p>It would have cost <em>Gibraltar</em> hundreds of millions a year, ruining <em>Gibraltar’s</em> economy and leaving the UK taxpayer to pick up the bill.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-684ab5fe8f08c87de84dca85" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/peterwalker"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T11:20:00.637Z">12.20pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Badenoch accuses Today's Emma Barnett of not understanding that public spending can be cut without impact on services</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Peter Walker is a senior Guardian political correspondent.</em></p> <p>Businesses need to “get on the pitch” and come up with ideas for a leaner, more growth-oriented state, <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> has said at a speech in London.</p> <p>Addressing an investment conference a day after the spending review, the Conservative leader gave no new specifics about how a government she led might shrink the state or cut regulation, instead appealing to the business-heavy audience to help show a path.</p> <p>She said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>So my message to business is this: I’m on your side, but I need you to be online too.

Much of what it says overlaps with what the Resolution Foundation concluded (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/12/rachel-reeves-spending-review-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-684a8d998f08c87de84dc8ba#block-684a8d998f08c87de84dc8ba">9.34am</a>), but some off the language is a bit more colourful. Here are the main points from the opening remarks from <strong>Paul Johnson</strong>, the IFS’s director.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Johnson suggested Rachel Reeves is a “gnat’s whisker” away from tax rises in the autumn. </strong>He said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Ms Reeves is now going to have all her fingers and all her toes crossed, hoping that the OBR will not be downgrading their forecasts in the autumn. With spending plans set, and “ironclad” fiscal rules being met by gnat’s whisker, any move in the wrong direction will almost certainly spark more tax rises. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He suggested the figures for projected departmental efficiencies savings published by the Treasury were not credible.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>[The chancellor] also stressed how this was a zero-based review, looking in detail at every aspect of spending. One wonders how effective that was. We can’t find any particular area of spending the government has decided it wants to withdraw from – other, perhaps, than overseas aid. On the efficiency savings one thing is quite striking. It seems that virtually every department is ripe for exactly the same cut in its administration budgets – 10% for all of them over the three years to 2028-29 and then another 5% in one year, 2029-30 – irrespective of how much they might have grown recently, and irrespective of planned spending increase. That is not the result of a serious department by department analysis. I hesitate to accuse the Treasury of making up numbers, but … </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said government suggestions that the economic outlook has improved over the past year were not true.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Despite some of the rather odd recent claims, neither the economic forecasts nor the public finances have improved relative to the genuinely difficult situation we knew about a year ago. Rather the reverse. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said he expected he expected the government to end up spending more over the next three years than it set out in the plans yesterday.</strong> And he said health and defence were likely to get more money.</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>While spending reviews are supposed to provide full and final settlements they rarely do – they are nearly always reopened, especially in the last year of the SR period – and almost always in an upwards direction …</p> <p>Health spending nearly always gets topped up. Growth of 3% a year is below the historic average. It may not even prove enough to fund the official workforce plan and it is at best marginal whether it will be enough to achieve the government’s waiting list targets. </p> <p>Defence spending is rising to 2.5% of national income by 2027, but no increase thereafter. Given external demands and government promises to get it to 3% of GDP at an unspecified date in the next parliament there will be pressure to increase it further.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said the spending review would be difficult for Scotland. </strong>He explained:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>One part of the UK that is going to face some especially sharp choices is Scotland. Its RDEL [day-to-day spending] funding from Westminster will rise not by 1.2% a year over the SR period but by just 0.8% a year. This is a result of the so-called “Barnett squeeze” which, as budgets rise, is designed ever so slowly to reduce the large gap in per capita spending between Scotland and England. (Spending per head in Scotland is still 20-25% higher than in England – hence “free” higher education and social care, higher public sector pay, and so on). Because the Scottish government is prioritising spending on welfare benefits, it could actually be looking at cuts in spending on public services in 2027-28.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-684aab798f08c87de84dc9f4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T10:27:48.934Z">11.27am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">‘Disastrous’: John Swinney facing SNP backlash after Hamilton byelection loss</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>SNP activists and senior figures have vented their frustrations at their leader, John Swinney, after a “disastrous” byelection campaign that saw the party lose a pivotal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/06/scottish-labour-win-pivotal-holyrood-byelection-beating-incumbent-snp-and-surging-reform-uk">Holyrood seat to Scottish Labour</a>, <strong>Libby Brooks</strong> reports.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/12/snp-swinney-criticism-bylection-result">‘Disastrous’: John Swinney facing SNP backlash after Hamilton byelection loss</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-684aaa298f0814dfee5fe74c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-12T10:24:52.323Z">11.24am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Next month the Guardian is holding an event to mark the Labour government being in office for a year.

These are arguably a bit peripheral.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Badenoch references her slightly peevish R4 interview this morning, and complains about “an interviewer who didn’t understand that there are other ways to reduce the size of the state”.

(See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/12/rachel-reeves-spending-review-labour-uk-politics-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-684a9a238f08c87de84dc92f#block-684a9a238f08c87de84dc92f">10.14am</a>.)</p> <p>As for what this means, there is more detail in <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/48305/documents/252847/default/">a letter</a> that <strong>Liz Kendall</strong>, the work and pensions secretary, send to the Commons work and pensions committee about the cuts. It was published by the committee <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/48305/documents/252847/default/">on its website</a> yesterday.</p> <p>Kendall confirmed that the government is conducting a review of how the assesment for Pip (the personal independence payment –a non-means tested benefit for disabled people) is carried out. This will be led by Stephen Timms, the disability minister. </p> <p>But she also said that the government needs to legislate urgently on its plans, because the bill needs to pass by November for the benefit changes to be implemented in time for the 2026-27 financial year. She said the bill would need to start going through parliament before the Timms review was finished, and this meant the key changes were not subject to review.</p> <p>She explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We have consistently been clear that we are not consulting on every proposal. Instead, parliament will have the opportunity to fully debate, propose amendments to, and vote on areas where we have announced urgent reforms that are not subject to consultation. </p> <p>With Pip caseload and costs forecast to continue rising, reforms are needed now to make the system sustainable, while supporting those people with the greatest needs.</p> </blockquote> <p>And, referring to the Timms review, she says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Our long-term ambition is to make Pip fit for the future for those it supports, which is why we have recently launched a wider review of the Pip assessment … The Pip assessment review will rightly take time and require extensive engagement, and we cannot wait for its conclusion to make the urgently needed changes to the Pip eligibility criteria.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cutting eligibiligy for Pip was one of the main proposals, and the most controversial, in the<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/pathways-to-work-reforming-benefits-and-support-to-get-britain-working-green-paper/pathways-to-work-reforming-benefits-and-support-to-get-britain-working-green-paper"> Pathways to Work green paper</a> published in March.

The government wants to legislate to change Pip so people will need to score a minimum of four points in at least one activity to qualify for the “daily living element” from November 2026.

By the end of the decade (2028-29), the health service will account for half (49 per cent) of all day-to-day public service spending controlled by Westminster – up from a third (34 per cent) in 2009-10.</p> <p>While real, per-person funding for health has increased by 36 per cent between 2009-10 and 2028-29, it has fallen by 16 per cent for Justice, 31 per cent for Work and Pensions, and 50 per cent for Housing, Communities and Local Government over the same period.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Ruth Curtice</strong>, chief executive of the thinktank, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Health accounted for 90 per cent of the extra public service spending, continuing a trend that is seeing the British state morph into a National Health State, with half of public service spending set to be on health by the end of the decade.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>The 2020s will see day-to-day public spending rising by much more than in the 2010s, but by much less than in the 2000s, the thinktank says.</strong></p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Real day-to-day spending is now rising again in the 2020s (2019-20 to 2028-29) by 2.2 per cent a year, following a 0.5 per cent fall per year in the 2010s (2009-10 to 2019-20).
