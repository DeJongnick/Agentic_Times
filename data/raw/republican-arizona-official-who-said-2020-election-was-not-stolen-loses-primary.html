<p>The top election official in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona">Arizona</a>’s Maricopa county, who became nationally known for defending the 2020 election results from false claims by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and others of fraud, has lost his seat in the Republican primary to a challenger who questioned those 2020 results.</p> <p>In his campaign, Stephen Richer <a href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/politics/elections/split-within-gop-party-display-during-county-recorder-debate-stephen-richer-justin-heap-don-hiatt/75-37c14754-6c34-4ffe-9789-335d31da4369">reaffirmed</a> in a primary debate with his Republican opponents that neither the 2020 nor 2022 elections were stolen. His opponents continued questioned the results, with one partly blaming Mark Zuckerberg, claiming the Facebook founder<strong> </strong>“dropped in illegal drop boxes” to sway the elections.</p> <p>State representative Justin Heap, another challenger, claimed election rules were not followed, though he avoided taking a direct stance on whether he thought the elections were stolen.</p> <p>On Wednesday it was announced that Heap had won the election with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/30/us/elections/results-arizona-maricopa-county-recorder-primary.html">more than 40% of the vote</a>, after 81% of ballots had been counted. Richer trailed by 6.5%.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/30/kari-lake-arizona-primary">Trump favorite Kari Lake wins Arizona’s Republican Senate primary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Heap is a first-term state representative who sought the votes of Maga supporters, despite <a href="https://x.com/azjustinheap/status/1798175621421683025">deleting</a> 2023 posts on social media claiming he is not one himself. He has, however, claimed he proudly voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 and would do so again. His candidacy was supported by the far-right Freedom caucus.</p> <p>He has also aligned himself with the Senate candidate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/31/trump-kari-lake-arizona-book">Kari Lake</a>, a favorite of Trump who has also repeatedly claimed election fraud despite no evidence, and falsely accused Richer of having a role in it. Richer has sued Lake for defamation.</p> <p>Richer took office in 2021 after defeating a Democrat incumbent.</p> <p>“Nobody stole Maricopa county’s election. Elections in Maricopa county aren’t rigged,” Richer wrote in a <a href="https://recorder.maricopa.gov/pdf/Dear%20Arizona%20Republicans_August%202021.pdf">2021 open letter</a> to Arizona Republicans. “The truth is that the case isn’t there. I spent November and December willing to wait for a meritorious lawsuit, a scientific claim or convincing data. But it never came because it didn’t exist.”</p> <p>He <a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/after-criticizing-the-audit-stephen-richer-received-death-threats-a-missouri-man-is-now-facing-federal-charges/">received</a> death threats for denying the 2020 election was stolen from Trump and that the 2022 election was stolen from Lake. One county party official <a href="https://www.kjzz.org/news/2024-06-25/maricopa-county-gop-official-threatens-to-lynch-county-recorder">stated</a> that he would “lynch” Richer, and a Missouri man <a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/after-criticizing-the-audit-stephen-richer-received-death-threats-a-missouri-man-is-now-facing-federal-charges/">faced</a> federal charges for threatening to kill him in 2022.</p> <p>As recorder of Maricopa county, the most populous county in Arizona, Richer ran voter registration and early voting efforts.</p> <p>Heap will now <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2024/07/31/richer-ousted-maricopa-county-recorder-not-backing-gops-2022-election-theories/">run</a> against Democrat Tim Stringham, an attorney, in the 5 November general election.</p>
