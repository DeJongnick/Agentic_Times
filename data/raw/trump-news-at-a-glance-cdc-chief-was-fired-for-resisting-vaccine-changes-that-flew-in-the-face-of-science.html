<p>CDC director Susan Monarez was fired after resisting changes to vaccine policy that were advanced by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and that she believed contradicted scientific evidence, according to a former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p>Richard Besser said Monarez told him there were “two things she would never do in the job. One was anything that was deemed illegal, and the second was anything that she felt flew in the face of science – and she said she was asked to do both of those”.</p> <p>Fellow CDC employees cheered the three departing officials who quit after Monarez’s dismissal as they left the Atlanta campus on Thursday, in a show of defiance toward Kennedy and his unscientific claims about vaccines.</p> <p>Here is the key <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> news of the day.</p>  <h2>CDC officials who quit in protest lead call to ‘get politics out of public health’</h2>  <p>Senior CDC vaccine research and public health leaders who resigned told hundreds of supporters across the street from campus on Thursday that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> needs to “get politics out of public health”.</p> <p>The agency is reeling from the firing of the CDC chief, Susan Monarez.
