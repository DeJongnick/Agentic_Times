<p>What do you do if you’re a superstar who has pulled well over a million people to a stadium tour? If you’re as contrary as Robbie Williams, you play a gig in a shoebox. This late-night show at the 600-capacity Dingwalls, the smallest venue of his career to date, is a rum event. It was originally a launch evening for a new album, Britpop, now postponed to February. Williams makes no bones about why. “It’s because of Taylor Swift,” he admits, in a week where her new album The Life of a Showgirl is outselling the rest of the UK Top 20 put together. “I could pretend it’s not, but it is. It’s selfish. I want a 16th No 1 album.”</p> <p>Bounding on stage just as the pubs are closing, a grinning Williams clearly relishes the intimate environment. “I’m not doing all that stadium bravado and pointing,” he vows, launching into a full, stripped-down run-through of his 1997 debut album, Life Thru a Lens, with lengthy between-song reminisces of the circumstances of its making.</p> <p>These are characteristically candid. His heart firmly on his brawny, tattooed arm, Williams recalls quitting Take That to find himself £300,000 in debt: “I took EMI’s money to the Groucho Club and did loads of cocaine. Oh, and I was about to get dropped. Then <em>this</em> happened.” Cue a heartfelt Angels, the ubiquitous national anthem of the 90s.</p> <p>This clear-eyed look back at a highly confused time is captivating because Williams, all nods, winks and twitches, is a ferociously skilled entertainer. Closeup, his star wattage is blinding. And this quirky, vibrant intensity doesn’t drop as he segues into playing the imminent Britpop – on first hearing, a rocky, hefty affair – in full.</p> <p>Our host mock-worries that one track, Spies, may be too indebted to Oasis’s Champagne Supernova: “But don’t have a brass neck and sue me, Noel! Not after everything you’ve nicked!” He plays a jaunty number called Morrissey, co-written with Gary Barlow, about the “isolated, deserted and friendless” former Smiths singer. “It’s weird as fuck, innit?” he admits at the end, not incorrectly.</p> <p>Williams announces that he is to play more of these intimate shows – billed as Long 90s – in February. “I knew this would be an incredibly special gig,” he smiles, as he tips us out into the street at 1am. It’s impossible to disagree.</p>
