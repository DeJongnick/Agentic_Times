<p>Viktoria Mullova began her cycle of the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/01/know-the-score-beethoven-where-to-start-with-his-music-250th-anniversary">Beethoven </a>violin sonatas partnered by Kristian Bezuidenhout, but <a href="https://alasdairbeatson.com/">Alasdair Beatson</a> has been the pianist for the last three instalments. They end the series with a pairing of the second of the Op 12 set in A major with the last of the sonatas, in G. All of the performances use historical instruments, with Mullova playing her gut-strung 1750 Guadagnini and using a classical bow, while here Beatson plays a different keyboard for each sonata. For the rather Mozartian Op 12 no 2 he uses a copy of a Walter fortepiano made in 1805, seven years after the sonata was composed; while for the much more ambitious keyboard writing of Op 96 it’s a copy of a Graf from 1819.</p>    <p>What is common to the performances of both sonatas is the sheer<em> joie de vivre</em> of the playing. Everything seems energised, and if the precision and immaculate ensemble is sometimes at the expense of obvious affection for the music and perhaps the last degree of warmth, that’s usually a small price to pay. The fine detail of both the violin and the keyboard playing is exquisite; the shape of every phrase, you feel, has been considered and weighted accordingly, without losing any sense of spontaneity, so the music never stales.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Beethoven: Violin Sonatas Opp 12 no 2 &amp; 96">  <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/us/album/beethoven-violin-sonatas-no-2-and-no-10/1819941703"></iframe> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Stream it on Apple Music (above) or on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0Z2GSCSxD2I3EQdGUVvlmG?si=_D2UruYOSfGOtthrl-XiHQ&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=8ad4bc7ce42b4cb6">Spotify</a></strong></em></p>
