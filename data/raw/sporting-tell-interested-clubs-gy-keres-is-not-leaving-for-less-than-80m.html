<p>Sporting have told interested clubs – including Arsenal – that Viktor Gyökeres will cost a fee of €80m (£67m), the Guardian understands.</p> <p>The Portuguese champions are prepared to cash in on Gyökeres, who has scored prolifically for them since his £20.5m move from Coventry in the summer of 2023. But although Sporting will not seek the full value of his €100m release clause, they have resolved to hold out for at least €80m.</p> <p>The club’s vice-president, Francisco Zenha, has said in the Portuguese media that he is yet to receive an offer for Gyökeres, who has three years to run on his contract.</p> <p>Arsenal are gearing up for a big summer and they want a new No 9, with Gyökeres on their wish-list. They have also followed the progress of RB Leipzig’s Benjamin Sesko. Newcastle’s Alexander Isak is out of reach.</p> <p>Gyökeres, who has admirers in all of Europe’s top leagues, has been a sensation at Sporting, scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances in all competitions. The 26-year-old Sweden international has helped them to the league title in each of his seasons with them – and the Portuguese Cup in this past campaign.</p>
