<p>Costume is a small boutique in Dublin’s city&nbsp;centre, usually fronted with elegant window displays of beautifully dressed mannequins. Last October, however, Marguerite O’Molloy was passing on her way for a manicure and found something startlingly different.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/oct/11/christian-barrosos-best-phone-picture">‘It’s like a scene from a movie’: Christian Barroso’s best phone picture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The shop is on Castle&nbsp;Market, a&nbsp;pedestrian shopping area,” O’Molloy says. “It’s a really lively, cool area and a regular haunt of mine; I actually met my husband in the famous Grogan’s Castle Lounge pub on the opposite corner. That afternoon, I didn’t expect to see this Halloween-themed display. I thought it was&nbsp;hilarious.”</p> <p>O’Molloy took the photo on her phone, then used the Provoke Camera app to translate the image to black and white, and Snapseed to adjust the exposure a little. She did not, however, entertain the idea of editing out the reflection of a passerby, saying, “The turn of her head and backwards glance, her cloak-like coat and the difference in scale between her and the monsters – she makes the image work for me.”</p> <p>The bicycle in the shop window is a&nbsp;regular fixture, but situated in this tableau it reminded&nbsp;O’Molloy of the scene from The Wizard of Oz where the Wicked Witch of the West cycles through the air as Dorothy spins in the tornado nightmare. Arriving at&nbsp;the nail salon a short while later, O’Molloy made her&nbsp;colour selection carefully: Ruby&nbsp;Slipper&nbsp;red.</p>
