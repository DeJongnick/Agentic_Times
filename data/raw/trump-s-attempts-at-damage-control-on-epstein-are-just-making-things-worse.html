<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s evident panic over his intimate relationship with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> is a case study in damage control gone haywire. If he is trying to keep a scandal clandestine, Trump has instead shined a klieg light on it. His changeable diversions constantly call attention to what he wishes to remain hidden. His prevarications, projections and protests have scrambled his allies and set them against each other. His inability to remain silent on the subject makes him appear as twitchy as a suspect in the glare of a third-degree police interrogation.</p> <p>The supine Republican Congress abruptly adjourned for the summer to flee the incessant demands for the release of files in the possession of the Department of Justice. But three Republicans broke to vote with Democrats on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">House</a> oversight committee to demand the Epstein files. The speaker, Mike Johnson, abandoning his assigned role as a Trump echo chamber, blurted, “This is not a hoax,” directly contradicting Trump. Johnson’s plain statement prompted widespread jaw dropping.</p> <p>With every rattled excuse, Trump throws his administration into further chaos. His cabinet members are pitted against each other – the attorney general, Pam Bondi, versus the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, a pair of scorpions in a bottle.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/27/ghislaine-maxwell-testimony-analysis">Ghislaine Maxwell is talking – but what can she tell and can she be believed?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has succeeded in driving Bondi from her regular perch on Fox News, as his reliable apologist, into virtual seclusion. She has reportedly engaged in a screaming match with the deputy director of the FBI, Dan Bongino, a former far-right talkshow jock who made his bones parroting that the Epstein files held the secrets of a vast conspiracy to blackmail deep state actors. After she issued a statement that there was no such “client list”, he apparently sulked at home, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/14/politics/dan-bongino-epstein">declining to come into the office</a>, upset that his reputation was being sullied with his former Maga listeners. Bondi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/us/politics/jeffrey-epstein-pam-bondi-dan-bongino-clash.html">accused him</a> of leaking unfavorable stories to the media that blamed her for the Maga backlash against her announcement. The manosphere bigmouth, sensitive about his hurt feelings, was in a tizzy, oh dear.</p> <p>“No, no, she’s given us just a very quick briefing,” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=643324838063690">Trump said</a> on 15 July about whether Bondi had told him his name was in the files. “I would say that, you know, these files were made up by [the former FBI director James] Comey, they were made up by [Barack] Obama, they were made up by the Biden administration.” The next day he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114863203348237352">posted</a> on Truth Social that “Radical Left Democrats” and “the Fake News” were behind “the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax”.</p> <p>A week later, on 23 July, the Wall Street Journal reported that Bondi had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/23/politics/bondi-trump-epstein-list-files">briefed</a> Trump in May that his name appeared in the Epstein files. Which also raised the question: what did Elon Musk know and from whom did he know it when he tweeted in June that Trump’s name was in the files, a tweet he quickly deleted after he had played arsonist? Did Bondi and the FBI director, Kash Patel, inform him about Trump’s presence in the Epstein documents? Where else would he have gotten the idea?</p> <p>Into the death valley of parched alibis stepped Tulsi Gabbard to win Trump’s affection with a press conference orchestrated at the White House on the same day the Journal punctured Trump’s lie about Bondi briefing him on the Epstein files. Gabbard was there to expose a “treasonous conspiracy” of Obama administration officials who supposedly plotted to manufacture the “Russiagate” scandal that Putin sought to help Trump in the 2016 election, which was a fact. Her <a href="https://www.emptywheel.net/2025/07/24/tulsi-gabbard-teams-up-with-russian-spies-to-wiretap-and-unmask-hillary-clinton/">presentation</a> was a farrago of falsehoods. She conflated Russian interference with false claims that Obama fabricated information about Russian hacking of voting machines and other fairytales. Gabbard also triumphantly unveiled a report that Hillary Clinton was on a “daily regimen of heavy tranquilizers”, which was sheer <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/tulsi-gabbard-clinton-conspiracy-debunked-184116372.html">propaganda</a> concocted by Russian intelligence long debunked as “objectively false” by the FBI.</p> <p>Gabbard’s performance unselfconsciously portrayed herself as a useful idiot for Russian spies. Trump was ecstatic. “She’s, like, hotter than everybody. She’s the hottest one in the room right now,” <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/trump-names-tulsi-gabbard-hottest-030152411.html">he said</a>. He <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5419788-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-files-saga-democrats/">posted</a> that the Democrats “are playing another Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax but, this time, under the guise of what we will call the Jeffrey Epstein SCAM”.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>Trump made a remark that he had never made before, something that underscored the depth of his anxiety. ‘Don’t,’ he said, ‘talk about Trump’</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bondi was reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/us/politics/trump-obama-gabbard-bondi.html">frustrated with Gabbard</a>. Bondi had been given little warning that Gabbard’s work would be dumped in her lap “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/19/politics/gabbard-threatens-obama-officials-2016-election">for criminal referral</a>”, apparently in order to satisfy Trump’s appetite for revenge. Bondi had been the catalyst of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/15/trump-epstein-files-maga">“client list” pseudo-scandal</a>, claiming it was sitting on her desk. Always ready to gratify Trump’s whims, she was not prepared to be sideswiped by Gabbard. In the pursuit of Trump’s favor, one lackey lapped another.</p> <p>Bondi finessed the situation by appointing a special “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/us/politics/trump-obama-gabbard-bondi.html">strike force</a>” to examine and undoubtedly dismiss yet again Trump’s attempt to blot out the conclusive official reports, from the Mueller report to the report by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/25/us/trump-obama-russia.html">Senate intelligence committee</a>, chaired by then <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/2020/08/18/press-rubio-statement-senate-intel-release-volume-5-bipartisan-russia-report/">senator Marco Rubio</a>, that had documented his campaign’s involvement with Russian agents in 2016. Bondi appeared to be seething in <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-formation-strike-force-assess-evidence-publicized-odni">announcing</a> the “strike force”, going out of her way to describe Gabbard as “my friend”. The grueling Trump cabinet dance marathon goes round and round until they drop.</p> <p>To demonstrate Obama’s supposed guilt, Trump posted an AI-generated video showing Obama forced to his knees and shackled in chains by federal agents before a seated and smiling Trump in the Oval Office to the soundtrack of the song YMCA. Trump apparently thinks that depicting himself as an enslaver, President Simon Legree, is a positive image that can deflect questions about his sexually predatory behavior and Epstein relationship.</p> <p>“He’s done criminal acts,” <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/25/us-news/trump-says-obama-owes-me-big-for-supreme-court-immunity-ruling/">said</a> Trump about Obama, and he mused, “There’s no question about it, but he has immunity. He owes me big.” Trump was referring to the supreme court’s ruling granting him “absolute” immunity for “official acts” that wound up relieving him of prosecution for the January 6 insurrection. As Trump explained it, he was responsible for the decision, at least through justices he had appointed, and Obama was indebted to him over “crimes” that Trump himself had made up to make the Epstein shadow disappear.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/what-are-jeffrey-epstein-documents-trump">What are the Jeffrey Epstein files and will they be released?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, after Trump tried the certain loser of a gambit of requesting the release of the Epstein grand jury material, which would almost certainly contain nothing new and was inevitably denied by the judge, he turned to another tactic. Suddenly, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, who had been Trump’s personal attorney in the Stormy Daniels hush-money trial, in which Trump was convicted of 34 felonies, was sent racing to Tallahassee to interview Epstein’s imprisoned co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell.</p> <p>No mere professional prosecutor would do for this high-level mission. Instead, in an unprecedented move, the deputy attorney general would conduct the interrogation. The case, in fact, was closed after Maxwell’s indictment for perjury, conviction for sex-trafficking minors and 20-year sentence. Yet Blanche <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/us/politics/ghislaine-maxwell-epstein-doj.html">stated</a>, sloppily misspelling her first name in his haste, “If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say.” He said that Maxwell can “finally say what really happened”, as if she would perhaps prove the existence of the fictional “client list” or some version of it to incriminate the enemies it contained, or clear Trump as a gentleman beyond reproach.</p> <p>Blanche’s remark seemed to dangle a pardon or clemency. Asked about the possibility, Trump said, “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-says-hasnt-considered-pardoning-ghislaine-maxwell-allowed-rcna221080">I’m allowed to do it</a>.” Curiously, on 14 July, the solicitor general, D John Sauer, who was Trump’s lawyer in the presidential immunity case before the US court of appeals, had filed a brief to the supreme court opposing relief that Maxwell had requested. “From about 1994 to 2004, petitioner ‘coordinated, facilitated, and contributed to’ the multimillionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of numerous young women and underage girls,” Sauer <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-1073/365132/20250714161434468_24-1073_Maxwell_Opp.pdf">wrote</a>. She could not be exempt from her conviction on the basis of Epstein’s first trial agreement as she claimed; she had been fairly tried, convicted and the matter was closed.</p> <p>But the acceleration of the Epstein backlash apparently flipped the administration’s position. Now, Blanche gave Maxwell a grant of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/07/26/epstein-maxwell-limited-immunity-trump-doj">limited immunity</a>. Her attorney, David O Markus, was a good friend of Blanche’s. In the Stormy Daniels hush-money case, he had offered Blanche the advice that he should impeach Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, as a witness against him, by characterizing him as “GLOAT” –the “Greatest Liar of All Time”. In 2024, Blanche appeared twice on Markus’s little-watched podcast. “I consider you a friend,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Kpdn0-IESo">said</a> Blanche.</p> <p>Blanche asked Maxwell over two days about 100 people, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ghislaine-maxwell-interview-justice-department-trump-pardon/">according</a> to Markus. Who those people might be, what she was asked and what she said remain unknown. One wonders, for example, if Blanche inquired about her knowledge of Trump’s adventures in the dressing rooms of underaged models and beyond.</p> <p>One prominent model agent, quoted in a 2023 story in <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/fashion-models-sexual-abuse-financial-exploitation-unsafe-sets-1235648697/">Variety</a>, “Inside the Fashion World’s Dark Underbelly of Sexual and Financial Exploitation: ‘Modeling Agencies Are Like Pimps for Rich People,’” said that Trump was “certainly” a “fixture”. “I would see Donald Trump backstage at [Fashion Week home] Bryant Park, and I’m like, ‘Why is he standing there when there’s a 13-year-old changing?” In 1992, Trump got George Houraney, a Florida businessman, to sponsor a “calendar girl” competition with 28 young models who were flown to Mar-a-Lago. But there were reportedly only two guests. “It was him and Epstein,” Houraney <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/us/politics/trump-epstein.html">said</a> to the New York Times. “I said, ‘Donald, this is supposed to be a party with VIPs. You’re telling me it’s you and Epstein?’”</p> <p>One of those models, Karen Mulder, who had appeared on the cover of Vogue the year before and was considered among the most elite supermodels, described her experience with Trump and Epstein as “disgusting”, according to the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article238351108.html">Miami Herald</a>.</p> <p>A year later, in 1993, Epstein brought a Sport Illustrated swimsuit model, Stacey Williams, to Trump Tower. She had met the future president at a Christmas party in 1992. “It became very clear then that he and Donald were really, really good friends and spent a lot of time together,” Williams <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein">told</a> the Guardian. “The second he was in front of me,” she recounted to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/24/politics/stacey-williams-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein">CNN</a> in 2024, “he pulled me into him, and his hands were just on me and didn’t come off. And then the hands started moving, and they were on the, you know, on the side of my breasts, on my hips, back down to my butt, back up, sort of then, you know – they were just on me the whole time. And I froze. I couldn’t understand what was going on.” While Trump groped her, he kept talking to Epstein, and they were “looking at each other and smiling”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/28/donald-trump-pardon-epstein-ghislaine-maxwell/85405546007/">Markus said</a>: “We haven’t spoken to the president or anybody about a pardon just yet.” Still, he added: “The president this morning said he had the power to do so. We hope he exercises that power in the right and just way.”</p> <p>The House oversight committee has subpoenaed Maxwell for a deposition on 11 August, but she has not decided yet whether to cooperate, <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/07/26/us-news/ghislaine-maxwell-still-mulling-whether-to-testify-before-oversight-committee-her-attorney-says/">her lawyer said</a>.</p> <p>While Blanche hurried back to Washington, Trump appeared to have depleted his armory of conspiracy theories, at least for the moment. He tried a novel tack, his most audacious projection yet. “I’m not focused on conspiracy theories that you are,” he admonished the White House press corps. Then he made a remark that he had never made before, something contrary to his entire character, which underscored the depth of his anxiety. “Don’t,” he said, “talk about Trump.”</p> <p>But Trump quickly recovered from the tension of his momentary reticence, and on the evening of 26 July, from Scotland, where he was touring his golf courses, he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114922194000687458">posted</a> that Beyoncé, Oprah Winfrey and Al Sharpton should be prosecuted for their endorsement of Kamala Harris in exchange for payments of millions of dollars. “They should all be prosecuted!” he demanded. Though a bogus accusation, it accurately reflected Trump’s crudely transactional worldview. A few hours later, in the early morning of Sunday 27 July, he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114922802971032650">posted</a> a Fox News clip of the rightwing talker Mark Levin, writing in capital letters: “THIS IS A MASSIVE OBAMA SCANDAL!”</p> <ul> <li><p>Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Self-Made-Man-Political-Abraham-Lincoln/dp/1476777268/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=A+Self-Made+Man&amp;qid=1597952377&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">A Self-Made Man</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wrestling-His-Angel-Political-1849-1856/dp/150115379X/ref=pd_lpo_14_img_1/141-7485861-0988151?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=150115379X&amp;pd_rd_r=a9c485bb-87bd-4934-9aed-937591fb3ecd&amp;pd_rd_w=WPRE2&amp;pd_rd_wg=C7lVx&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;pf_rd_r=4TE076HKJFEC3JAZ6JHR&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=4TE076HKJFEC3JAZ6JHR">Wrestling With His Angel</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Powers-Earth-Political-1856-1863/dp/1476777284">All the Powers of Earth</a>.
