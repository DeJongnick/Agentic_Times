<p>The UN security council failed to pass a resolution on Friday that would have prevented the reimposition of UN sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme before the deadline for the “snapping back” of punitive measures.</p> <p>UN sanctions on Iran will be re-established at the end of the month unless nine member countries of the security council agree to further extend sanctions relief. Friday’s resolution, put forth by South Korea, received support from only four countries – China, Russia, Pakistan and Algeria.</p> <p>The vote is likely to further strain relations between Iran and the west. Under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, any member of the agreement can call for a resumption of UN sanctions within 30 days if it considers Iran to not be in compliance with its terms. This would automatically re-impose all UN sanctions placed on Iran before 2015, which include an arms embargo, asset freezes and travel bans.</p> <p>Last month, France, Germany and the UK triggered the snapback provision of the deal after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/25/irans-parliament-approves-bill-to-suspend-cooperation-with-iaea">Iran refused to cooperate</a> with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors, which is tasked with monitoring implementation of the deal.</p> <p>Two weeks later, Iran agreed to resume cooperation with the IAEA, but it has not yet been able to carry out all of its inspection activities and the body’s ability to operate in the country has been restricted for years.</p> <p>Since the initiation of the snapback mechanism, intense diplomacy has taken place between mainly European powers and Iran to reach a deal to prevent the sanctions. Talks have not been fruitful, though the UK indicated on Friday after the vote that it was still open to diplomacy.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/07/message-tehran-britain-france-germany-you-made-a-big-mistake-reimposing-sanctions">A message from Tehran to Britain, France and Germany: in your own interests, you should change course | Seyyed Abbas Araghchi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The United Kingdom remains committed to a diplomatic solution. We are ready for further engagements diplomatically in the next week and beyond to seek to resolve differences,” said Barbara Woodward, the British ambassador to the UN.</p> <p>The Iranian foreign ministry said in a Friday statement that it had consistently kept the path of diplomacy open and that it viewed the reimposition of sanctions as “unlawful, unfounded and proactive”.<br><br>Iran is still dealing with the impact of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/24/israel-us-and-iran-all-claim-to-have-won-the-war-but-who-has-really-gained">the 12-day Iran-Israel war</a>, when Israel launched surprise attacks that it said was a pre-emptive move against the country’s nuclear programme. Iran insists that its nuclear programme is of a civilian nature and that it does not seek to create a nuclear bomb.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 23 September 2025 because an earlier version mistakenly referred to the UN security council as having nine members. That meant to refer to the fact that decisions of the security council require the affirmative votes of at least nine of the 15 member countries.</p>
