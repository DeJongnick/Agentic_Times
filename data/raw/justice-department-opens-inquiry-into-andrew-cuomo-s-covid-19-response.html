<p>The justice department has reportedly opened a criminal investigation into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/andrew-cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a>, the former New York governor and current frontrunner in the New York City mayoral race.</p> <p>The investigation was launched after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> accused Cuomo of mishandling the state’s response to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid-19</a> pandemic, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/20/politics/andrew-cuomo-department-of-justice-investigation">multiple outlets</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/andrew-cuomo-investigation-doj.html">reported</a> on Tuesday.</p> <p>Kicked off about a month ago by the US attorney’s office in Washington, the inquiry follows a criminal referral made by James Comer, a Republican representative of Kentucky and chair of the House committee on oversight and government reform.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/05/covid-hydroxychloroquine-steve-hatfill">US scientist who touted hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid named to pandemic prevention role</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/comer-refers-former-new-york-governor-andrew-cuomo-to-trump-doj-for-criminal-prosecution/">referral</a>, Comer recommended Cuomo be “charged with making false statements to Congress”, saying that Cuomo lied on “numerous occasions about material aspects of New York’s Covid-19 nursing home disaster and the ensuing cover-up”.</p> <p>Cuomo faced widespread <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/12/andrew-cuomo-new-york-nursing-home-covid-deaths-leaked-recording">calls for his resignation</a> in February 2021 after allegations emerged that his administration was underreporting Covid-19-related deaths across the state’s nursing homes by as much as half.</p> <p>A leaked recording of Melissa DeRosa, a top Cuomo aide, had her admitting to Democrats that the state withheld the actual numbers out of fear that the justice department would pursue complaints of state misconduct, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/02/11/cuomo-aide-admits-they-hid-nursing-home-data-from-feds/">according to</a> the New York Post.</p> <p>As part of his referral, Comer said: “This wasn’t a slip-up – it was a calculated cover-up by a man seeking to shield himself from responsibility for the devastating loss of life in New York’s nursing homes. Let’s be clear: lying to Congress is a federal crime. Mr Cuomo must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”</p> <p>He went on to say: “The House oversight committee is prepared to fully cooperate with the justice department’s investigation into Andrew Cuomo’s actions and ensure he’s held to account.”</p> <p>In response to the reports, a Cuomo spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, said: “We have never been informed of any such matter, so why would someone leak it now? The answer is obvious: this is lawfare and election interference plain and simple – something President Trump and his top Department of Justice officials say they are against.</p> <p>“Governor Cuomo testified truthfully to the best of his recollection about events from four years earlier, and he offered to address any follow-up questions from the subcommittee – but from the beginning this was all transparently political,” Azzopardi added.</p> <p>The US attorney’s office, which was previously led by Ed Martin, is now headed by Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and prosecutor. Pirro was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/08/trump-withdraws-ed-martin-thom-tillis">appointed by Trump</a> after Martin’s nomination to permanently run the office was withdrawn following Senate Republicans’ concern over his ability to serve, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/15/us/trump-news?smid=url-share#in-farewell-email-ed-martin-discloses-that-he-faces-an-ethics-investigation">reported</a>.</p> <p>Despite his frontrunner status in the mayoral race, Cuomo has been an embattled figure in politics in recent years. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/10/andrew-cuomo-resigns-sexual-harassment-intimidation">resigned</a> as governor in 2021 after an investigation by the state attorney general, Letitia James, which found that he sexually harassed multiple women and retaliated against those who made complaints.</p> <p>Shortly after Cuomo announced his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/01/andrew-cuomo-mayor-new-york-city">decision to run</a> for New York City mayor in March, the justice department <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/eric-adams-corruption-case-dismissed">dropped </a>its corruption case against the city’s current mayor, Eric Adams. Adams pleaded not guilty to accepting bribes and illegal campaign contributions from Turkish officials in exchange for favors.</p> <p>The apparent investigation into Cuomo comes as Adams, a Democrat who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/03/eric-adams-mayor-election-independent">announced</a> his intention to run for re-election as an independent, is at the heart of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/18/eric-adams-donald-trump-corruption-case">scandal</a> over his acquiescence to Trump officials to cooperate on immigration crackdowns while attempting to evade criminal charges.</p>
