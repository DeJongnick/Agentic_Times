<p>Peter Drew works swiftly, transforming a blank city wall into a work of art designed to spark questions about what it means to be Australian.</p> <p>The efficient movements of the Adelaide artist should come as no surprise – he has plastered as many as 5,000 of his striking “Aussie” posters on city walls around the country – and he’s about do more.</p> <p>As he brushes starchy glue on the wall to hold up the colourised archival images on Sunday, people glance and occasionally pause, curious.</p>    <p>A man in a One Nation T-shirt wanders up with a friendly smile – he needs directions to the nearby anti-immigration protest.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>At the last protest, an exercise in jingoism based on the fear of so-called “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2025/sep/04/factchecking-protesters-claims-of-mass-migration-into-australia-video">mass migration</a>”, protesters tore Drew’s posters down as he was putting them up.</p> <p>That inspired him to reinvigorate the project, with 1,000 new posters and six new designs – including one of the people tearing down the posters.</p> <p>The Aussie Posters project has been under way for nearly a decade, sparked by a wave of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/nov/05/muslims-feel-inadequately-protected-by-the-racial-discrimination-act-report">anti-Islamic sentiment in Australia</a> in the wake of the Lindt cafe siege.</p> <p>Drew went on the hunt for pictures of people who applied for exemptions to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2023/jan/30/how-immigration-changed-australia-an-interactive-journey-through-history">White Australia policy</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/01/how-do-i-feel-safe-after-march-for-australia-anti-immigration-protest-ntwnfb">I never thought my race would be under scrutiny here.

But it wasn’t until I was at the Melbourne archive, the national archive, and I found the image of <a href="https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/143613/">Monga Khan</a>.</p> <p>“And as soon as I saw that, I thought, well, this is it. This is the centrepiece, and he was unknown.</p>    <p>“I sort of wanted to find people who weren’t famous, who were just people you’d bump into on the street, and that would be more effective.”</p> <p>The picture of Monga Khan, with his striking profile, moustache and turban, was taken in 1916. As a hawker – a critical part of the economy – he applied for an exemption so he could go home to India and then return.</p> <p>Drew wants his designs – screen-printed on craft paper – to get people thinking about national identity.</p> <p>He has faced outrage and vitriol from those challenged by his work, and gratitude from new arrivals and those who see hope in his evocative images.</p> <p>So he says he’ll continue his work, as immigration policy debate is again used by many as a front for nationalism and racism.</p>    <p>This time, as the anti-immigration march in Adelaide began on Sunday morning, Drew cheekily covered one of his posters with another, identical one, stuck on with masking tape. He added another prank – he rigged up a bucket of water.</p> <p>An anti-immigration protester waited until he thought the police had passed then tore down the top one, leaving the original behind and spilling water everywhere.</p> <p>“Pick it up,” a police officer said.</p> <p>The officer and his colleagues waited, and watched, until the protester put every last scrap in a bin.</p> <p>“Good boy,” one of them said.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="embed">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
