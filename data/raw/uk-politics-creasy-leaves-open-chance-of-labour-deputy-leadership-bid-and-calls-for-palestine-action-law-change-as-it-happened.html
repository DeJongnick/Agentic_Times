Under the arrangements, which were designed to ensure no hardening of the Irish land border post-Brexit, Northern Ireland continues to follow many EU trade and customs rules.</p> <p>Little-Pengelly told the Northern Ireland assembly today there is currently “very little regulatory divergence”, but despite that she said there is “unnecessary checking at the behest of the deal”.</p> <p>As an example, she cited the experience of a man she called Roy from Mid-Ulster who was trying to bring a tractor from Scotland to Northern Ireland.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>He was requiring four certificates. He couldn’t give the haulage company a specific date as to when he was to get that, and therefore he missed that window and those tractors were stuck in Scotland for four to six weeks despite being paid in full, despite the fact that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>That is not acceptable. It is bureaucracy for bureaucracy’s sake. We need to tackle that.</p> <p>The biggest frustration that people have about governments – should it be here, across the United Kingdom or across the globe – is the fact that it’s so difficult to get things sorted because of this unnecessary, disproportionate, non-risk based nonsense that people are putting in place.

She explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There is a difference between people protesting using violence and people protesting the use of proscription.</p> <p>If we don’t get right the response, if we continue to arrest those in that second category, the seriousness the term terrorism risks losing its meaning, becoming diluted rather than strengthened.</p> <p>Proscription was supposedly about stopping those inciting direct harm and violence.</p> <p>Going after somebody with a poster testing the boundaries of liberty – many of whom are clear they don’t support Palestine Action and feel strongly about Palestinian rights or free speech – confuses rather than clarifies the government’s intention ..</p> <p>Legislation on public order focuses on specific acts. Proscription orders target specific terrorist groups. Nothing sits in between this.</p> </blockquote> <p>Creasy said the police should be focusing on people who actually are members of Palestine Action. If the government was not willing to abolish the offence of recklessly expressing support for a proscribed group, it should at least give the police guidance on when the offence should be used, she said.</p> <p>In response, <strong>Dan Jarvis</strong>, the security minister, cited <a href="https://observer.co.uk/news/opinion-and-ideas/article/we-cant-shrink-from-taking-a-stance-on-palestine-action">a recent Observer article</a> by <strong>Jonathan Hall</strong> KC, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, in which he defended the use of the legislation against Palestine Action. Hall said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There is no way ordinary criminal law would be effective against funding, training and recruitment [by Palestine Action] …</p> <p>The motives of those who say “I support Palestine Action” are not always easy to discern. Rather than saying “I support Palestine” or “I oppose the proscription of Palestine Action”, a small number of demonstrators have gone out of their way to invite arrest. I am not sure that this makes the law ridiculous or heavy-handed.</p> <p>Shorn of the power to arrest and prosecute those who display support in public, the police’s role in preventing the growth and operation of Palestine Action would be that much harder.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jarvis</strong> quote an extract from the article and said the government had a duty to ensure public safety.</p> <p>Earlier today <strong>Creasy</strong> did not rule out standing to be Labour’s deputy leader.

Starmer reportedly thinks she will adopt a more muscular approach to addressing the small boats problem.</p> <p>With this in mind, the Today programme broadcast an interview early this morning with Peter Walsh, a senior researcher at the <strong>Migration Observatory</strong>, an Oxford University migration thinktank. When asked to explain why the small boat arrival numbers are at a record level, Walsh said Brexit was one factor. He explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If we look at the powerful geopolitical push factors, they’re things like regime change. We think Afghanistan, war, civil conflict. And when we look at people crossing in small boats, where do they come from? Well, the top nationalities: Afghan, Eritrea, Iranian, Syrian, Sudanese – just those five nationalities account for almost two thirds of all small boat arrivals, and these individuals are from some of the most chaotic parts of the world. </p> <p>But there are also some pull factors, and the question is, why not claim asylum in France, why come to the UK? A number of reasons recur there when we speak with asylum seekers. It’s the presence of family members, the English language.</p> <p>But there’s also increasing evidence of a Brexit effect. We speak with asylum seekers now, and often they’ve claimed asylum in the EU country, sometimes been refused, but they understand that because the UK is no longer a part of the EU, and no longer party to the EU’s fingerprint database for asylum seekers, if they can get to the UK, they have another bite of the cherry and another chance to secure asylum status and remain in Europe.</p> </blockquote> <p>Walsh said, that for people like this, if the UK was still in the EU their chances of being granted asylum here would be “much diminished”.

(See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/08/labour-deputy-leadership-election-contest-keir-starmer-angela-rayner-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68be6d8e8f08638a14b7976b#block-68be6d8e8f08638a14b7976b"> 8.52am</a>.) Although Haigh includes a line saying Labour should be “shouting from the rooftops” about its achievements, the article is mostly a critique of Rachel Reeves’s fiscal orthodoxy, combined with a general call for more radicalism from the government.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Haigh criticised the government for failing to offer the “full transformation” Britain needed. </strong>She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Labour was elected in 2024 to rebuild Britain – not to steady the ship, but to remake it completely.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is an implicit criticism not just of Keir Starmer’s record, but of his election strategy too. Starmer promised “change”, but he also defined change in terms of economic stability, which he described as an improvement on Tory chaos.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Haigh said Labour should be more radical, and less deferential to institutions. </strong>She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>One year on, our mission of renewal is under threat. Economic circumstances and excessive deference to independent institutions are frustrating the democratic demand for change …</p> <p>Yet the damage wasn’t just financial. It was institutional. The Conservatives embedded a model of governance where opaque watchdogs outrank democratic choice. Labour now runs the risk of exacerbating these issues.</p> </blockquote> <p>Many Labour members would agree. But this also echoes arguments deployed by Reform UK.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Haigh criticised the “unaccountable orthodoxy” of the Office for Budget Responsibility and its impact on economic decision making. </strong>She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Originally created to provide an independent check on economic forecasts and help policymaking, [the OBR] has morphed into a gatekeeper of orthodoxy. Its models often underestimate the long-term returns of public investment and ignore the wider benefits of progressive taxation or public ownership.</p> <p>We now know that Sure Start centres, for example, delivered £2 of savings for every pound spent – yet their closure under Osborne was never flagged as a fiscal risk. Nor does the OBR’s sustainability report warn that childhood poverty today will mean higher costs tomorrow.</p> <p>Worse, its forecasting cycle entrenches short-termism: two fiscal events a year, judged against a five-year horizon. We plan defence, housing, and climate investment in decades, yet the watchdog looks only five years ahead. In my view, the OBR should publish supplementary long-term assessments so markets can see the real savings from social investment. Without that, governments are forced into short-term fixes even though the bond market itself takes a longer view.</p> </blockquote> <p>Haigh suggested part of the reason for the failure of the government’s Pip reforms was the inability of the OBR to make allowance for the proposed policies producing savings over the long term. And she also criticised the accuracy of OBR forecasts (a complaint also made regularly by the Tories). </p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Haigh said the OBR should revise its growth forecasts only once a year, not twice a year as it is required to do now under law passed by the Tories. </strong>She said this would “give ministers the space to design serious, long-term reforms – not scramble for short-term fixes to meet arbitrary fiscal targets”. It is thought that Starmer thinks this too. But the government has been nervous about changing the way the OBR operates in case that gets interpreted as a weakening of fiscal discipline.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Haigh criticised the “quantitive tightening” policy being followed by the Bank of England. </strong>She said this was a result of the way George Osborne introduced quantitive easing when he was chancellor. The IPPR, a leftwing thinktank, has made<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/29/treasury-tax-big-banks-quantitative-easing-windfalls-thinktank"> the same argument.</a></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Haigh said the Bank of England should stop paying interest on central bank reserves to commercial lenders. </strong>She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is beyond comprehension that we have not already reformed our approach to the payment of interest on reserves held in the Bank of England reserves. Commercial banks are earning near-Bank Rate on hundreds of billions in deposits costing the taxpayer roughly £40bn a year. </p> </blockquote> <p>This is a view shared by various economists, and Reform UK has been making this argument for at least a year. Richard Tice, the party’s deputy leader, is due to discuss the issue with the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/letter/2025/letter-to-richard-tice-june-2025.pdf">at a meeting soon</a>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68be9a2b8f0884821221bbc9" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-08T08:56:39.675Z">9.56am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Zack Polanski, the new, leftwing leader of the Green party, will be speaking at the TUC conference, later today, Sky News reports.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68be96018f08a1e891a281f4" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/severincarrell"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-08T08:41:36.350Z">9.41am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Severin Carrell is the Guardian’s Scotland editor.</em></p> <p>Ian Murray, the former Scotland secretary unceremoniously sacked by Keir Starmer on Friday, is back in government after an apparent revolt by his Scottish Labour allies and backbench MPs.</p> <p>Murray, said to be “furious” about his sacking, was unexpectedly made a junior minister in both the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology on Saturday night, as Starmer’s reshuffle continued.</p> <p>On Sunday, <strong>Douglas Alexander,</strong> his replacement in the Scotland Office, spoke to Murray’s popularity in an interview with BBC Scotland when he was asked about his colleague’s sacking.</p> <p>He nodded at Murray’s survival as the Labour’s only Scottish MP following the rout in the 2015 general election at the hands of the Scottish National party – when Alexander lost his previous seat of Paisley and Renfrewshire South.

Here are are main points.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Harman said Labour should not elect a deputy leader who would become an “oppositional voice”. </strong>She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>An election for the deputy leadership when Labour is in government, just shortly after our first year of government, is very different than a deputy leadership election when you’re trying to set out a new direction for the party, rebuild the party after an election defeat.</p> <p>And what I think we need is … somebody who is not a counterpoint to the leader, but is complementary to the leader, will broaden the reach of the leader and galvanise the party …</p> <p>The role of the deputy leader is not to provide an alternative, oppositional voice. It’s to be part of a team. The clue is in the name.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>She said she was in favour of Labour getting on with the contest “rapidly”.</strong></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>She said the new deputy leader should definitely be a woman, and probably an MP from outside London. </strong>She explained:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think that, in terms of extending the breadth of the leadership, it probably needs to be somebody from outside London, and it definitely needs to be a woman. But there are 185 Labour women MPs, many very talented …</p> <p>With a prime minister and a deputy prime minister representing London constituencies, the party might well think that the extending of the reach that the deputy provides should be somebody from outside London, but definitely a woman. I don’t think we can have a male prime minister, a man as deputy prime minister and a male deputy leader of the party.</p> </blockquote> <p>If Labour MPs agree with Harman, and they want a deputy leader loyal to Keir Starmer, then Shabana Mahmood, the new home secretary, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, and Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, would all fit the bill. But they have all got quite important jobs already, and so may not be interested.</p> <p>Non-cabinet ministers who would meet the Harmen criteria include Jess Phillips and Alison McGovern.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-08T08:25:46.549Z">at 9.25am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68be6d8e8f08638a14b7976b" class="block is-summary" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-08T07:52:52.624Z">8.52am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Labour accused of 'stitch-up' over deputy leadership contest, as Louise Haigh joins debate with call for 'economic reset'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Good morning. The Labour party has had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)">18 deputy leaders in its history</a>, but only two of them have also served as deputy PM and one of those, Angela Rayner, resigned last week. In the reshuffle that started on Friday, Keir Starmer in effect decoupled those posts, appointing David Lammy as deputy PM (as well as justice secretary). Labour said there would be an election for a new deputy leader to replace Rayner and today the timetable for that election will be set. There is no guarantee that the winner will even have a job in government.</p> <p>Elections are, by definition, divisive, and the easiest option for Keir Starmer would be for Labour MPs to coalesce behind one consensus candidate. Under the rules, an MP needs the support of 20% of the PLP (80 MPs) to be nominated and so it is possible that this could happen. Anyone perceived as a “rebel” candidate might struggle to reach this threshold. Ministers, and cabinet ministers, are free to enter the contest. If Lammy were to stand, and win, he could re-unite the deputy PM and deputy leader jobs, but there is a strong sense in the party that the deputy leader should be a woman, and should represent a seat outside London, and Lammy does not seem interested anyway. At this point there is no obvious favourite, but <strong>Annabelle Dickson </strong>and<strong> Bethany Dawson</strong> have a good guide to potential candidates in <a href="https://www.politico.eu/newsletter/london-playbook/on-your-marks-get-set-schmooze/">their London Playbook</a> for Politico.</p> <p>Already, there is a row about process. Here are the key developments this morning.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Deputy leadership candidates will only have four days to collect the 80 MP nominations they need, <a href="https://x.com/danbloom1/status/1964933179820974505">it is being reported</a>.</strong> Labour’s national executive committee will reportedly set 5pm on Thursday as the deadline for nominations, with the ballot taking place between 8 and 23 October – with the election over well before the budget, which is taking place on 26 November.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Richard Burgon, one of the leading figures in the leftwing Socialist Campaign group in parliament, and a candidate for deputy leader in 2020, has accused the party of a stitch-up.</strong> In <a href="https://x.com/RichardBurgon/status/1964812181712629920">a post on social media</a> last night, he said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’ve been warning about attempts to fix the deputy leadership election – and what I’ve heard is now being proposed is the mother of all stitch-ups. Just a couple of days to secure MPs’ nominations!</p> <p>This is a desperate move to keep Labour members’ voices out of this race and to dodge serious discussion on what’s gone wrong over the last year – from the positions on disability benefits cuts, on winter fuel payments, on Gaza and more. This outrageous timetable shows a leadership that’s unwilling to listen and to learn the lessons needed if we’re to rebuild support and stop Nigel Farage.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Louise Haigh, the former transport secretary and a potential candidate for the deputy leadership, has published <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2025/09/the-fiscal-straitjacket-facing-labour-must-be-broken">on the New Statesman’s website </a>what amounts to a pitch for the job, demanding “an economic reset” and “a decisive break with the fiscal rules and institutional constraints that hold back renewal”.</strong> It is a serious intervention, and, by implication, a damning critique of Rachel Reeves, the chancellor. Here is an extract.</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There is a democratic argument at the heart of this as well. A Labour government with a landslide majority in parliament cannot – and should not – be stopped from delivering the change we clearly set out in our manifesto simply because of assumptions made by the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility]. If we let unelected institutions dictate the limits of change, we betray the people and communities who put their trust in us.</p> <p>And if mainstream politics can’t deliver proper renewal, populists like Nigel Farage will fill the void. Britain’s economy is broken not just in outcomes but in architecture. Unless we rewrite the rules, we risk managed decline dressed up as moderation.</p> <p>I am devastated by the departure of Angela Rayner last week, who consistently offered a challenge to the establishment orthodoxy. Her absence is a real loss to those of us who want to see bold, radical thinking at the heart of government. The reshuffle has been billed as a political reset, but if we are serious about delivering on our priorities, it must offer more than a change of personnel around the Cabinet table. What the country needs now is an economic reset: a decisive break with the fiscal rules and institutional constraints that hold back renewal. Only then can Labour turn its democratic mandate into the transformation Britain so urgently needs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Haigh would have difficulty winning a deputy leadership contest, because of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/nov/29/louise-haigh-resigns-as-transport-secretary">her resignation last year</a> over a 10-year-old conviction relating to mobile phone fraud, but a lot of Labour members will probably agree with the argument in her New Statesman article.
