<p>Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons have suspended supplies from a Lincolnshire pig farm linked to abuse against pigs.</p> <p>Secretly filmed footage has shown farm workers at Northmoor Farm appearing to grab piglets by their hind legs and smashing them on to the hard floor – a banned method of killing known as blunt force trauma<strong> </strong>or<strong> </strong>“piglet thumping”.</p> <p>Other harrowing footage from the farm owned by one of the UK’s biggest pig meat producers, Cranswick, showed a sow being kicked and beaten with metal bars, as well as a botched killing that left an animal writhing in agony, as first <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14699109/farm-supplying-Tesco-Sainsburys-Asda-piglets-beaten-death.html">reported</a> by the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>One worker who failed to kill a sow with several shots from a bolt gun, reportedly told an undercover investigator: “Don’t let nobody see you doing like what we did [sic].”</p> <p>The footage at the farm, which houses about 6,000 pigs in cramped cages, was captured over several weeks last year by an undercover investigator for the animal rights organisation Animal Justice Project (AJP).</p> <p>AJP has filed a formal complaint to Trading Standards, citing multiple breaches of the Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing regulations. </p> <p>Claire Palmer, the founder of AJP, said the group was aiming to show<strong> </strong>“the violent realities of pig farming in Britain”.</p>    <p>“We are demanding immediate enforcement of the ban on blunt force trauma and the prosecution of Cranswick. There must be an independent public inquiry into pig farming practices and regulatory failures.”</p> <p>Piglets are regularly killed as part of the meat production process – if they are weak, sick or not growing fast enough to be profitable. However, there are strict rules about the methods used.</p> <p>The use of blunt force trauma to kill piglets under 10kg was outlawed in 2022 after warnings from the UK’s Animal Welfare Committee and the EU’s Reference Centre for Animal Welfare. Both said the method was unreliable, inhumane, and unnecessary given available alternatives, including captive bolt guns.</p> <p>Cranswick said the entire team at the farm had been suspended while an investigation takes place, as required by law.</p> <p>A Cranswick spokesperson said: “The welfare of the animals we rear is of the utmost importance and we are extremely disappointed to see the unacceptable lapse of welfare standards captured at Northmoor Farm.</p> <p>“As soon as we saw the footage, we immediately suspended the team working at the farm and we are conducting an urgent and thorough investigation. We have also suspended the farm from supplying any pigs until the investigation is completed.”</p> <p>Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda all confirmed they had suspended supplies from the farm while an investigation was carried out.</p> <p>A Tesco spokesperson said: “We take all reports of poor animal welfare extremely seriously and expect all our suppliers to adhere to our high welfare standards.”</p> <p>A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said, “These allegations involve unacceptable treatment of animals, which has no place in our supply chain.”</p> <p>Morrisons said: “We care deeply about animal welfare and these are shocking and concerning allegations. We understand that Cranswick are investigating urgently.”</p> <p>An Asda spokesperson: “We have clear animal welfare policies that all our <br>suppliers must uphold and we welcome the swift response and action taken<br>by Cranswick at this farm.”</p>
