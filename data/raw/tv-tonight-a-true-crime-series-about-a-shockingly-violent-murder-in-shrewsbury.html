<h2>Murder 24/7</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>After DPD driver Aurman Singh was beaten to death while on a delivery in Shrewsbury, the police assessed the shocking level of violence involved and surmised that robbery wasn’t the motive. Stretched across the week, this gripping true-crime series follows the West Mercia police as they track the suspects, make arrests, then realise the roots of the crime run much deeper than they thought. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>The Flu That Killed 50 Million</h2> <p><strong>6.35pm, PBS America</strong><strong><br></strong>Right at the end of the first world war, the 1918 flu pandemic killed more than 50 million people and inflicted further misery on an already anguished world. This documentary uses reconstructions and testimony from the doctors, civilians and politicians of the time to tell the story. Christopher Eccleston narrates. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Panorama: Funfairs – How Safe Are They?</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>Our traditional British summer wouldn’t be the same without soaking up the sights, sounds and wild G-forces of a funfair. But should more be done to ensure rides are properly maintained? Correspondent Rahil Sheikh hears from accident victims keen for tougher safety regulation. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>The Traitors NZ</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Three<br></strong>With the BBC having announced the contestants for its celebrity version of the hyper-addictive reality show, you may be in the mood to indulge your taste for stagey interpersonal intrigue. This New Zealand version sees 22 players gather in a manor house at the foot of Mount Horrible with NZ$100,000 on the table for the winner. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Shardlake</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong></p>    <p>Sean Bean may not have the title role in this Tudor murder mystery adapted from CJ Sansom’s novel – that goes to Arthur Hughes as the “crookback” investigator – but his brooding Thomas Cromwell looms large in every scene nonetheless. Shardlake resumes interrogating the St Donatus monks – but nowhere near fast enough for Anthony Boyle’s Jack Barak. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2>Night Coppers</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>The documentary series that hopes it can convince viewers to care about the police continues. In this edition, officers tackle a domestic violence call, try to help the victim of a mugging and attend a fire at a seafront hotel. How much it makes the public empathise with an emergency service blighted by sexism and racism remains to be seen. <em>Alexi Duggins</em></p>
