<p>Not much fazes Carlos Baleba. The Brighton midfielder likes to spend his spare time watching horror films – “they don’t scare me; nothing has ever scared me” – or even dancing on his own to Mbolé music from his native Cameroon. “Sometimes I need to move my body,” Baleba says with a smirk.</p> <p>Thanks to a strict training regime that he began at the age of 10 under the watchful eye of his father, Eugene, Baleba has developed into one of the Premier League’s most imposing figures. The 21-year-old is tipped to become the latest big-money transfer to leave Brighton after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/14/chelsea-sign-moises-caicedo-british-record-115m-deal-brighton">Moisés Caicedo was sold to Chelsea</a> for a British record £115m in the summer of 2023.</p> <p>Baleba arrived at Brighton a couple of weeks later, still a teenager and after less than 18 months in Europe, with Lille. He will never forget his first experience of facing Manchester City, when he was substituted on his second Brighton start during a 2-1 October defeat at the Etihad.</p> <p>“I felt nervous,” he says. “I saw the intensity of the Premier League, the fans. I said to myself: ‘I have arrived in the Premier League.’ It came as a shock. I saw the big players – the players I watched on TV in Cameroon – and now I was playing against them. When the game was finished, I took some time to myself. I told myself I had played against these players I had seen on the TV. I didn’t play well. When I took the ball I checked the players behind me and the game was going so fast for me. After, I worked. I never gave up.”</p>    <p>Following a draw against Crystal Palace two months later Roberto De Zerbi’s assessment was that Baleba was “perhaps not ready to play in the Premier League yet but he will be a great Premier League player”. Brighton’s head coach used Baleba sparingly at times.</p> <p>“The last gaffer, he helped me,” Baleba says. “It’s why sometimes he didn’t put me on the pitch, to give me some time for my adaptation. When I got ready to play, he gave me the time.”</p> <p>Adapting to England has been a crucial part of Baleba’s progress at Brighton. What helps is what De Zerbi’s successor, Fabian Hürzeler, describes as Baleba’s “fun character”.</p> <p>“It’s natural,” Baleba says. “I’m very happy. If some people [are down], laugh with me and it might change. It’s the same in Brighton. Players like Danny [Welbeck], Simon [Adingra] and Georginio [Rutter] – it’s a good feeling for the team, for everyone.”</p>    <p>But Baleba admits his mother’s death a few months before he left Lille made the transition to a new country much harder. “It was very difficult for me because I didn’t see my mum. I wanted her next to me, but when I signed for Brighton she was not here. That’s why the first season was really difficult for me. I thought a lot about my mum.”</p> <p>Baleba has fulfilled his promise to her to build a house in Douala and remembers how she would encourage his father – who played professionally as a striker in Cameroon and South Africa before coaching his son at the Cameroonian academy École de Football des Brasseries – to work him hard as a child.</p> <p>“She liked when my dad told me to train,” he says. “She was not like some mums in Africa who say: ‘No, it’s too hard for him, it is not the right age to be in the gym.’ She wanted me to work hard. When I was a kid, I said to her: ‘When I become a professional, I will build you a house, buy you a car.’ Everything was for her. I told her this when I was 13. I started [building the house] when I was at Lille. Now it’s done.”</p>    <p>As well as two hours of “non-stop” running every day, Baleba would sprint between truck tyres on a road near his home to work on his agility and honed his gymnastic skills at the local beach. He celebrates goals by performing a backflip. “It’s my dad. He said that if I learn how to do acrobatics then it will help my timing when I’m trying to read the ball or score a header. I would run up to a tyre and then jump on to it with either a front or back flip. It’s easy for me! I can do everything …”</p> <p>That confidence has been evident in Baleba’s performances this season as Brighton have mounted another challenge to qualify for Europe, although a run of five games without a win before Saturday’s match at Brentford could not have come at a worse time. Baleba is ranked as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League on various metrics including possession regains and progressive carries but, as Hürzeler has often said, there remains room for improvement despite reported interest from Liverpool and City among others.</p> <p>“I can’t believe how quickly it has all happened,” Baleba says. “I’ve already done some things that some kids will never do in their football career. I want to do more. I want to be a big midfielder, to be a legend, across the world. To arrive there, I have to work hard.</p> <p>“It’s not easy but I will do any work for that. My motivation now is my mum. My mum, my dad, my little brother [Bediang, a striker, who had trials at Newcastle last year]. I play for them.”</p>
