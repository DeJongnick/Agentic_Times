<p>It would be disappointing and dangerous for the UK to take lessons from Italy’s far-right government (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/17/starmer-italian-style-migration-deals-crossings">Starmer backs plans to explore Italian-style migration deals to limit crossings, 17 November</a>). Agreements aimed at preventing people from reaching a safe country could put refugees at serious risk. Amnesty International says Italy is <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/01/libya-renewal-of-migration-deal-confirms-italys-complicity-in-torture-of-migrants-and-refugees/">complicit in the torture of migrants and refugees</a> through its deal with Libya, where appalling conditions and treatment in detention facilities are well known. This type of policy is about keeping people out, not keeping people safe.</p> <p>Furthermore, Refugee Action research has found that most people travelling to the UK are people of colour from <a href="https://www.refugee-action.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asylum-In-The-UK-A-Front-Line-For-Racial-Justice-Briefing.pdf">countries affected by British colonial rule and foreign policy</a>. Their exclusion from seeking asylum in the UK through such deals is racial injustice in action.</p> <p>We need a humane approach to migration. In the wake of the racist and anti-refugee riots this summer, making migration a national security issue and focusing on “terrorist gangs”, as well as upstreaming and deportations, risks further dividing our communities, while doing little to address the root causes of Channel crossings.</p> <p>Keir Starmer has said “we have got to do everything we can”. This must start with safe routes. The government must make a decisive break with failed deterrence policies, make sure that people seeking asylum are treated with decency, and protect their rights in line with the UK’s legal obligations and international agreements.<br><strong>Tim Naor Hilton</strong><br><em>Chief executive, Refugee Action</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
