<p>I was delightfully unsurprised to read your report<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/28/chemical-companies-lobbying-mps-not-to-ban-pfas-forever-chemicals"> (Chemical companies lobbying MPs not to ban Pfas, 29 August</a>). Pfas really are a bigger problem than most people realise. I must confess to some involvement here: in the 1970s, when working for a big US corporation, I used Pfa-based chemicals in a widely used recipe for food-can sealants. On reflection, I needn’t have done, but the chemical company rep was very generous with samples and lunch, and there was never any suggestion that they might be harmful.</p> <p>Now, after decades of practising the greenest chemistry I can, I know for sure that Pfas are entirely unnecessary; I have yet to find them particularly better or more economic in any of the many recipes for everyday useful stuff that I have worked on. Let’s align with the EU and ban them, for the sake of future generations.<br><strong>Alan Smith<br></strong><em>Chief scientist, Paragon Resources UK</em></p>
