By early Wednesday, with over 90% of ballots counted, Mamdani held 50.4% of the vote, giving him a lead of nearly nine points over Cuomo, his closest competitor.</p> <p>Voter turnout surpassed 2 million, the first time that has happened in New York City since 1969. More than a million votes went to the Democratic candidate.</p> <p>Mamdani performed well citywide, drawing support from a wide range of racial, ethnic and economic groups. Cuomo’s support, in contrast, was concentrated mainly on Staten Island, select parts of Queens, and in Brooklyn’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities.</p> <p>In predominantly Black precincts, voters overwhelmingly favored Mamdani. He also increased his advantage in neighborhoods with large Hispanic populations and won majorities in low-income as well as middle-income districts.</p> <p>But it was younger voters who proved to be Mamdani’s strongest base. Precincts where the median voter was 45 years old or younger is where he held the biggest lead, echoing the strong youth support he achieved in the primary as well as the young coalition that volunteered and joined him on the campaign trail.</p>
