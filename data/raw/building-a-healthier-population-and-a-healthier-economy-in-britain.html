<p>Your coverage of the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) <a href="https://www.ippr.org/articles/our-greatest-asset">report</a> on the UK’s health crisis focuses on the big numbers from the report, but overlooks some of the ways we can improve health in the places where we spend the most time – workplaces and schools (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/sep/17/uk-ill-health-economic-growth-ippr">Tackling UK ill health is vital to economic growth, says IPPR, 17 September</a>). As a member of the IPPR commission on health and prosperity, I contributed through work by Impact on Urban Health to highlight this opportunity.</p> <p>Additional health service spending alone doesn’t stand a chance in addressing the growing number of people too sick to work and the stalling of healthy life expectancy. The evidence-based solutions in the report are aimed squarely at where the social, financial and commercial drivers of health converge. For example, businesses can play a pivotal role in fostering a healthier workforce through better working conditions and health initiatives. Similarly, investing in children’s health through schemes such as Sure Start and free school meals will not just improve health outcomes but also lead to greater educational attainment, financial security and the ability to play an active role in the economy. </p> <p>This in turn will lessen the burden on public services. By focusing on these opportunities, we can improve health outcomes and economic productivity for all.<br><strong>Anna Garrod</strong> <br><em>Policy and influencing director, Impact on Urban Health</em></p> <p>• The IPPR is right to say that creating better health is the key to increasing growth and prosperity. To do that, we need to create better links between the health system and the many preventive projects already happening in communities. Social prescribing is a crucial way of doing this, as part of a “neighbourhood NHS”, helping people access the services and support that matter to them. </p> <p>As the <a href="https://www.ippr.org/articles/our-greatest-asset">report</a> states, there is an “increasingly strong evidence base” to support this. By tackling loneliness and isolation, helping people to get active and joining the dots between services, social prescribing supports individuals, communities and the health system. It should be a key plank of future government health strategy.<br><strong>Charlotte Osborn-Forde</strong><br><em>Chief executive, National Academy for Social Prescribing</em></p> <p>• The IPPR’s report is the kind of substantive thinking we need to reimagine what an all-systems approach to keeping people healthier for longer looks like for the coming century. Taking nothing away from the report or its authors, it was disappointing not to see nature and its benefits for improving health and wellbeing mentioned. Green spaces were noted briefly, but our expanse of protected landscapes and coastlines have much to offer in preventing poorer physical and mental health outcomes. Indeed, you will find much great work in these landscapes already taking place, delivering invaluable outcomes for health by connecting people with nature and improving access. </p> <p>This work deserves recognition, and national parks and other organisations should be given a bigger seat at the public health table. Connecting with nature, from national parks to back yards, is a cost-effective and proactive response to worsening health outcomes. The evidence is there – it&nbsp;just needs to be better integrated into health and education systems.<br><strong>James Metcalfe</strong><br><em>Director, North York Moors Trust</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
