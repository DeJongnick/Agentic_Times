 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>As Israel and Gaza approach midnight, here is a look at the day’s events:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a>, ordered the military to immediately carry out “powerful strikes” in Gaza, in the latest test for the increasingly shaky US-brokered ceasefire in the strip. </strong>Netanyahu ordered the strikes after an emergency meeting to discuss what he called Hamas violations of the ceasefire, amid clamour for a return to the war by far-right figures in the Israeli government.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Nine people have been killed tonight in Israeli air strikes says Gaza’s civil defense agency in its latest update. </strong>Meanwhile, Hamas has denied responsibility over the attack on Israeli soldiers in Rafah on Tuesday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Hamas’s armed wing said it was postponing the handover of another hostage body scheduled for Tuesday evening after what it called Israeli “violations” of the US-brokered ceasefire. </strong>Hamas’s announcement came minutes after Israeli prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> ordered the military to carry out intense strikes on the Gaza Strip, accusing the militants of violating the truce deal.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>US vice-president JD Vance said that Gaza’s ceasefire is holding, Reuters reports. </strong>“The ceasefire is holding. That doesn’t mean that there aren’t going to be little skirmishes here and there,” he said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Turkey’s foreign ministry has issued a statement calling Israel’s latest strikes on Gaza a “flagrant violation of the ceasefire. </strong>It said: “We are deeply concerned by the reports that civilians have lost their lives as a result of the attacks. We once again emphasize that full adherence to the ceasefire is of vital importance for preserving the prospect for lasting peace and ensuring regional security.”</p></li>

  <p><strong>The IDF is yet to comment on the deadly strikes tonight, which were announced by Benjamin Netanyahu’s office earlier saying he had ordered “powerful attacks”.</strong></p> 
  <p>Shortly after the first explosions were heard, Israel’s defence minister Israel Katz also released a statement, accusing Hamas of an assault on Israeli troops in Rafah.</p> 
  <p>Katz said Hamas would “pay a heavy price” for the Tuesday attack and for “violating the agreement to return the bodies of the hostages”.</p> 
  <p>Hamas has denied it was behind “the shooting incident in Rafah”, and says it is committed to the ceasefire.</p>
