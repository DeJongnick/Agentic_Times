<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> announced on Tuesday that his administration will move forward with developing the so-called “Golden Dome” missile defense system that he envisions will protect the United States from possible foreign strikes using ground and space-based weapons.</p> 
<p>Flanked by the US defense secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, in the Oval Office, Trump also said that he wanted the project to be operational before he left office. He added that Republicans had agreed to allocate $25bn in initial funding and Canada had expressed an interest in taking part.</p> 
<p>“Once fully constructed, the Golden Dome will be capable of intercepting missiles even if they are launched from other sides of the world, and even if they are launched from space,” Trump said, “forever ending the missile threat to the American homeland.”</p>

<p>What exactly the Golden Dome will look like remains unclear. Trump has not yet decided which of three options proposed by the defense department he wants to pursue. Pentagon officials recently drafted three proposals – small, medium and large – for Trump to consider.</p> 
<p>The proposals all broadly combine ground-based missile interceptors currently used by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a> with more ambitious and hi-tech systems to build a space-based defense program.</p> 
<p>The option that Trump chooses will determine its timeline and cost. The $25bn coming from Republicans’ budget bill is only set to cover initial development costs. The final price tag could exceed $540bn over the next two decades, according to the congressional budget office.</p> 
<p>Trump said on Tuesday evening that he had settled on “architecture” for the project and suggested the total cost of putting it into service would reach $175bn, but gave no specifics. Gen Michael Guetlein of the US Space Force will oversee implementation of the project, Trump said.</p> 
<p>The selection of Guetlein, the vice-chief of space operations, means the elevation of a four-star general widely seen at the Pentagon to be competent and deeply experienced in missile defense systems and procurement.</p> 
<p>The project is expected to end up largely as a partnership with major defense contractors, including Elon Musk’s SpaceX, given it has the capacity to manufacture rockets to launch military payloads into orbit and satellites that can deliver next-generation surveillance and targeting tools.</p> 
<p>It will also rely on companies that manufacture ordnance currently used by the US military. The project’s baseline capabilities are set to depend on existing systems including the Thaad and Aegis Ashore systems made by Lockheed Martin and Patriot surface-to-air missiles made by Raytheon.</p> 
<p>Golden Dome came into existence because Trump believes that the US should have a missile defense program to track and kill missiles headed towards domestic US targets, possibly sent by China, Russia, North Korea or other strategic foreign adversaries, similar to Israel’s “Iron Dome” program.</p> 
<p>Shortly after he took office again in January, Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/29/donald-trump-executive-orders-signed-list">signed an executive order</a> directing the Pentagon to develop proposals for a “next-generation missile defense shield” in order to upgrade the US’s missile defense capabilities, which he noted had not materially changed in 40 years.</p> 
<p>The order came as the defense department has become more concerned about the threat of long-range strikes from strategic adversaries. Last week, the Defense Intelligence Agency released an assessment that said China has about 400 intercontinental ballistic missiles, Russia has 350 and North Korea has a handful.</p> 
<p>Initially, the White House had named the options for a space-based missile defense system “Moonshot Plus” and “Moonshot Plus Plus”. They were later renamed by Hegseth to be called silver, gold and platinum-dome options based on the three tiers, two former Pentagon officials said.</p>
