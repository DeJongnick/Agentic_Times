<p>The French culture minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/11/rachida-dati-french-cabinet-gabriel-attal">Rachida Dati</a>, is to go on trial over alleged corruption and abuse of power while she was a member of the European parliament, a judicial source has said.</p> <p>Dati, 59, who had hoped to run for Paris mayor in next spring’s municipal elections, was charged in 2019 on suspicions she lobbied for the Renault-Nissan carmaking group while an MEP. She has denied the allegations and has repeatedly sought without success to have the charges quashed.</p> <p>Dati is accused of accepting €900,000 in lawyer’s fees between 2010 and 2012 from a Netherlands-based subsidiary of Renault-Nissan, but of not really working for it. She was an MEP from 2009 to 2019.</p> <p>Investigations have tried to determine whether she was in fact lobbying in the European parliament for the carmaker, an activity that is forbidden.</p> <p>Dati, a former minister for the rightwing French president Nicolas Sarkozy, was appointed as culture minister last year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/11/rachida-dati-french-cabinet-gabriel-attal">in a surprise return to government</a> during Emmanuel Macron’s second term in office.</p> <p>She also serves as the mayor of Paris’s<strong> </strong>7th arrondissement,<strong> </strong>where she has been a vocal critic of the city’s Socialist mayor, Anne Hidalgo. </p> <p>Dati became the first Muslim woman to hold a major government post in 2007 when she was appointed justice minister.</p> <p>She has said that growing up on a low-income estate on the outskirts of the town of Chalons-sur-Saône, in Burgundy, gave her a greater understanding than most politicians of the French electorate. In 2007, Sarkozy said appointing Dati sent a message “to all the children of France that with merit and effort everything becomes possible”.</p> <p>When Dati was appointed to government last year she had already been charged in the Renault-Nissan case. She denied any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The Socialist party leader, Olivier Faure, said at the time of Dati’s appointment that the legal investigation was a problem, saying it sent “a bad signal” and went against Macron’s promises of an “exemplary” republic.</p> <p>Investigating magistrates in France have also ordered that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/carlos-ghosn">Carlos Ghosn</a>, the former tycoon of Renault-Nissan, be tried in the case, a judicial source told Agence France-Presse. Ghosn, who has been living in Lebanon for years after escaping arrest in Japan, has also denied the charges against him.</p> <p>A hearing on 29 September will decide on the date of the trial.</p> <p>A source following the case told AFP that the trial could be held after the Paris municipal elections, due in March</p> <p>Ghosn, the former chair and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, was arrested in Japan in November 2018 on suspicion of financial misconduct, before being sacked by Nissan’s board in a unanimous decision.</p> <p>He jumped bail late the following year and made a dramatic escape from Japan hidden in an audio-equipment box, landing in Beirut, where he remains as an international fugitive.</p> <p>Both Japan and France have sought his arrest.</p>
