<p>The White House is ending funding for the body that produces the federal government’s preeminent climate report, which summarizes the impacts of rising global temperatures on the United States.</p> <p>Every four years, the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) is required by Congress to release a new national climate assessment to ensure leaders understand the drivers of – and threats posed by – global warming. It is the most comprehensive, far-reaching and up-to-date analysis of the climate crisis, playing a key role in local and national decision making about agriculture, energy production, and land and water use.</p> <p>The next assessment is due by 2027. But now, Nasa has ended its contract with the consulting firm ICF International, which convened the USGCRP and coordinated the federal agencies that contribute to the quadrennial report.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/trump-climate-state-laws-executive-order">Trump takes aim at city and state climate laws in executive order</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“There’s really no coming back from this, and it means we are all less informed about climate impacts, and won’t have the most up-to-date information on risks and threats,” said one federal staffer who was engaged in USGCRP activities, and who requested anonymity to avoid retribution. “USGCRP helped me to leverage resources from other agencies for use in my own work. But without these networks, I’m left without a support system and the latest science on climate change.”</p> <p>The end of the contract, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/09/trump-moves-to-hobble-major-climate-study-00280405">first reported</a> by Politico and confirmed by multiple sources to the Guardian, imperils the federal government’s climate research, say experts.</p> <p>“The firing of USGCRP staff guts the entire climate research and services ecosystem leaving teetering silos of climate teams, already reeling from federal cuts due to Doge,” the anonymous staffer said.</p> <p>Another federal worker with knowledge of the program, who was also granted anonymity, said the contract’s cancellation will mean “the Sixth National Climate Assessment is effectively destroyed.”</p> <p>USGCRP staff who hailed from the 15 federal agencies had all been told to abandon the body; its only remaining staff were from ICF and have now been fired, the second worker said. “Climate research as a whole will be hobbled because USGCRP’s interagency working groups are essential coordinating bodies across the entire government, including and beyond the 15 USGCRP member agencies.”</p> <p>The move came one day after the rightwing outlet the Daily Wire <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/meet-the-government-contractor-raking-in-millions-to-spread-climate-doom">published an article </a>attacking ICF International saying the firm was “raking in millions to spread climate doom”. Since its publication, the second worker said they had had a “pit in their stomach”.</p> <p>The attack on the USGCRP and national climate assessment did not come as a surprise. In the Heritage Foundation’s far-right policy blueprint Project 2025, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/who-is-russell-vought-trump-office-of-management-and-budget">Russ Vought</a> – now Trump’s head of the office and management and budget – called to end the USGCRP or fill it with pro-oil industry members.</p> <p>Since Trump’s second term began in January, the monthly meetings of delegates to the body from federal agencies have been cancelled, the anonymous worker said. “We were waiting for new principles to be sent from each agency, which never happened, so that could have been a sign in retrospect,” they added.</p> <p>Andrew Rosenberg, a former Noaa official who is now a fellow at the University of New Hampshire, called the end of the contract “very foolish” and “thoughtless”. National climate assessments provide an important synthesis of “science across fields” – and are not particularly expensive to produce because the authors are all volunteers, he said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-epa-pollution-regulation-cuts">Trump’s EPA aims to cut pollution rules projected to save nearly 200,000 lives: ‘People will be hurt’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In February, Trump officials also denied US scientists permission to attend a meeting of the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading climate science entity. The federal government also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/02/22/trump-federal-scientists-climate-work-ipcc/">cancelled</a> its <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/20/us-delegation-pulled-climate-science-meeting">contract</a> with ICF International to maintain US support for and involvement in the body.</p> <p>“Extreme weather disasters displaced millions of people and caused billions of dollars in damage in 2024 alone,” said Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate scientist who has served as lead author on three national climate assessments. “Given the accelerating pace and scale of climate impacts today, a sustained and more comprehensive national climate assessment process is so essential,” Hayhoe said. “We need it today, to build a better future tomorrow.”</p> <p>The move is a sign of the Trump administration’s fealty to the fossil fuel industry, said Michael Mann, an eminent US climate scientist. The sector donated in record levels to Trump’s re-election campaign.</p> <p>“It is pure villainy,” said Mann. “A crime against the planet – arguably, the most profound of all crimes.”</p>
