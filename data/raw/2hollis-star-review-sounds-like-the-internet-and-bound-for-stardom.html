His fourth album, his first for a major, sounds like the internet: a pummelling mashup of hyperpop, post-Playboi Carti trap and tweaky club music also indebted to underground Swedes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwpG284QPk">Drain Gang</a>. Which is to say, the 21-year-old LA-raised singer-producer feels something like a male Charli xcx circa 2023 – a leftfield figure about to blow up on their own terms.</p> <p>That’s the overriding theme of <em>Star</em>, with songs such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLC2h0bUHfY">Flash</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVlYhnAXRP8">Cope</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulPq2FXiONE">Tell Me</a> dedicating swathes of the record to manifesting success and worrying about over-exposure; a curveball acoustic ballad (Eldest Child) boasts how someone’s parents “don’t know anything about me”.</p> <p>There are reasons to be wary of Hollis Frazier-Herndon’s charms: this pop mainstream-facing record is made up of the most obnoxious parts of loud genres; race cars zoom and big cats growl through the album’s interstices (2hollis’s 2022 debut was called <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5QMzx6rXcQ">White Tiger</a></em>). But he has been SoundCloud-famous since his teen days as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/drippysoup">Drippysoup</a>. His rise feels inevitable, and his production work includes ambient washes as well as dystopian bass; love songs abound, both banging (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNBUu_FJ_sE">You</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2n5sAG23tw8">Burn</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DgSHDI4yh8">Nerve</a>) and angsty (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OQo1nBPEBo">Girl</a>). </p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnzndZQX3SU"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nnzndZQX3SU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnzndZQX3SU">Watch the visualiser for Nice by 2hollis.</a></figcaption> </figure>
