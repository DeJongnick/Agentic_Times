<p>Parents in England are skipping meals and turning to buy-now-pay-later services such as Klarna in order to afford school uniforms before the autumn term, according to a survey.</p> <p>Almost half (47%) of the 2,000 parents who took part in the poll said they were worried about uniform costs, which can run into hundreds of pounds due to expensive branded items, while more than a quarter (29%) said they had forgone food or heating to pay for uniforms.</p> <p>The survey by the parenting charity Parentkind showed struggling parents being forced into debt. Nearly half (45%) of those polled planned to use credit cards to pay for their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/19/top-marks-which-uk-retailers-pass-the-worth-the-money-test-on-school-uniforms">children’s school uniform</a> and a third (34%) said they would rely on Klarna-style delayed payment services.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jan/08/labour-says-cap-on-school-uniform-items-could-save-families-50-a-child">Labour says cap on school uniform items could save families £50 a child</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, urged schools to help struggling parents by reducing the number of branded items of uniform that pupils are required to wear as a matter of urgency, before a forthcoming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jan/08/labour-says-cap-on-school-uniform-items-could-save-families-50-a-child">change in the law</a>.</p> <p>A limit of three branded items, plus a branded tie for secondary and middle schools, will be enforced from September 2026 after the government’s children’s wellbeing and schools bill becomes law, but Phillipson wants schools to act sooner on a voluntary basis.</p> <p>“School uniform matters but it shouldn’t break the bank. No family should have to choose between putting food on the table and buying a new blazer,” she said. “Parents have told us they want fewer costly branded items – and that’s exactly what we’re delivering. Schools can help ease the pressure on families right now by reducing the number of branded items they require.”</p> <p>Currently, schools can require parents to buy multiple items branded with a school logo, often from specialist suppliers, with many asking for more than five and in some cases 10 items, pushing total uniform costs up to £400 including PE kit.</p> <p>Under the new legislation, parents will be able to buy cheaper uniform staples such as shirts or trousers from general retailers including Aldi and Marks &amp; Spencer.</p> <p>Nearly nine out of 10 parents (86%) who took part in the poll – which involved parents of children aged four to 15 attending state schools in England – felt that wearing branded uniforms made no difference to behaviour.</p> <p>Parentkind’s chief executive, Jason Elsom, said: “Parents have faced the crushing cost of sending their children to school for far too long. For many families the bills soar into the thousands every year, covering uniforms, books, stationery, trips, laptops and travel. These reforms are the first real step towards ending that injustice.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/24/families-are-paying-a-high-price-for-school-uniforms">Families are paying a high price for school uniforms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Limiting branded school uniform items will make a difference straight away. Our research shows 85% of parents believe this will cut costs, 71% prefer to buy plain items and add the logo later, and 83% say unbranded uniform is just as good quality. This is about keeping money in parents’ pockets without sacrificing school pride.”</p> <p>Pepe Di’Iasio, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Many families face wider financial pressures and cannot afford basic amenities. The rate of child poverty in the UK is simply appalling. We hope to see the government publish a meaningful strategy to tackle this issue in the near future.”</p> <p>The government has announced that millions of families will receive their benefit payments before the August bank holiday this year, with payments originally due on Saturday 23, Sunday 24 and Monday 25 August paid early on Friday 22 August.</p> <p>The minister for social security and disability, Stephen Timms, said: “This is especially important ahead of the new school year – no family should have to choose between buying school supplies and putting food on the table.”</p>
