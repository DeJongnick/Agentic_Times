<p>Thoughts and non-denominational prayers to all the anti-woke warriors out there. It may seem as though everything is going their way now Donald Trump is back with a vengeance, but the poor things have run into a bit of a branding problem. For years, the anti-woke crowd positioned themselves as fearless free thinkers taking on the intolerant left. The journalist Bari Weiss wrote a fawning <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html">New York Times piece in 2018</a> describing rightwing voices such as Ben Shapiro and Candace Owens as “renegades of the intellectual dark web” (IDW).</p> <p>Now, however, the people who used to position themselves as oppressed truth-tellers operating in what Weiss’s article called an “era of That Which Cannot Be Said”, have a state-sanctioned microphone. They’ve won. But in winning they’ve made it difficult to continue the charade that they give a damn about “cancel culture”. Look around: some of these self-styled free speech warriors are doing everything they can to ruin the lives of everyone who doesn’t 100% agree with them.</p> <p>Most conservatives don’t seem to mind that their hypocrisy is now on full display. But, according to a recent <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/05/25/2025/inside-the-identity-crisis-in-anti-woke-media">piece on the news site Semafor,</a> a handful of people within the anti-woke media ecosystem are starting to have something of an identity crisis. “One didn’t have to be especially prescient to spot those ‘anti-woke’ types who would just slowly become Maga flunkies,” said the libertarian journalist Michael Moynihan, who had a short stint at Weiss’s publication the Free Press before becoming disillusioned.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>At this rate, pro-choice sentiment will be considered “anti-Christian” and anyone espousing it will get deported</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Remember when the right railed against people losing jobs for old comments they’d made? In 2018, for example, the Atlantic fired the conservative columnist Kevin Williamson after the backlash about a 2014 podcast appearance in which the 60-year-old had suggested women should face hanging for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/conservatives-atlantic-fires-kevin-williamson-abortion-comments-2018-4?utm_source=chatgpt.com">having an abortion</a>. Cue a million furious tweets from the “renegades of the IDW” about how, as Ben Shapiro put it on X, “virtually everyone is vulnerable if they run afoul of the Left’s interests”.</p> <p>Now, however, there’s no denying that virtually everyone is vulnerable if they run afoul of the right’s interests. Semafor’s piece notes that “One [Free Press] <a href="https://www.thefp.com/p/pbs-disappears-dei-department-trump-executive-order-free-press-investigation">investigation</a> that exposed two low-profile employees at PBS who had focused on diversity and got them fired rubbed even some of its allies the wrong way”.</p> <p>At least the DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) employees at PBS “only” got fired. <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/410125/canary-mission-the-pro-israel-group-taking-credit-for-student-deportation-explained">Canary Mission</a> and Betar US, two <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/israel-betar-deportation-list-trump">pro-Israel groups</a>, have been compiling “deportation” lists of pro-Palestinian activists on college campuses and sharing them with the Trump administration. Betar US has also warned that it is going to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/25/what-is-betar-us-the-group-pushing-to-deport-pro-palestinian-students">expand its focus</a> beyond immigrants to naturalised US citizens.</p> <p>These organisations are just a couple of cogs in a massive dissent-crushing machine. The Christian nationalist Heritage Foundation, which spearheaded Project 2025, is behind a dystopian plan called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/18/us/project-esther-heritage-foundation-palestine.html">Project Esther</a> that cynically weaponises very real concerns about antisemitism to shut down criticism of Israel and quash pro-Palestinian activism. And you can bet these censorious projects won’t end with Palestinians: at the rate we’re going, pro-choice sentiment will soon be considered “anti-Christian” and anyone espousing it will get deported. If that sounds far-fetched, let me remind you that last month the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/22/veterans-affairs-anti-christian-bias">veterans affairs department</a> ordered staff to report their colleagues for “anti-Christian bias”.</p> <p>Drunk on their power to deport and defame, some on the right have officially lost the plot. For months a number of conservative voices have been engaged on a mission to cancel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/22/meet-ms-rachel-the-youtube-goddess-worshipped-by-toddlers-and-parents-alike">Ms Rachel</a>, a children’s entertainer whose real name is Rachel Accurso. If you have small children, Ms Rachel needs no introduction. For everyone else, she wears a pink headband and sings songs such as Icky Sticky Bubble Gum. Ms Rachel’s videos have always been gently inclusive: she incorporates sign language and she has frequently had Jules Hoffman, a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/songs-for-littles-tiktok-parents-jules-ms-rachel-1234694629/">non-binary musician</a>, on her show. On her <a href="https://www.today.com/parents/celebrity/ms-rachel-tough-topics-controversy-rcna172542">personal social media</a> she has also advocated for issues such as paid family leave.</p> <p>The right tried to cancel Ms Rachel over Hoffman’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/23/jules-hoffman-msrachel-controversy/">gender identity back in 2023.</a> Now they’re trying to cancel the beloved star again – this time, for the “crime” of speaking up about Palestinian kids and featuring a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtq-yOsToXk&amp;ab_channel=CNN">three-year-old double amputee from Gaza</a> in a video. The fact Accurso is <a href="https://www.theamericansaga.com/p/by-humanizing-the-children-of-gaza">humanising Palestinian</a> children is driving some rightwing voices so berserk that they’re smearing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/stop-antisemitism-ms-rachel-doj-investigation">her as antisemitic</a>, asking the US attorney general for an investigation, and spreading the ridiculous and completely baseless lie (which the New York Times bizarrely <a href="https://x.com/mehdirhasan/status/1923047509477216336">chose to amplify</a>) that she is being funded by Hamas.</p> <p>Welcome to our “new era of That Which Cannot Be Said” – one that may make McCarthyism seem progressive. It would seem the new renegades of the intellectual dark web are those of us who think you shouldn’t bomb starving babies in their sleep just because they are Palestinian.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
