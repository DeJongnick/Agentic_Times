Pratika deserves this award as much as I do and I am a little surprised. She is a good anchor and allows me to play my natural game.” <strong>Guardian sport</strong></p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-23T22:10:01.068Z">at 11.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68fa6e238f08074f179a6873" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-23T18:07:53.769Z">7.07pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>That’s all for today.</strong> Thanks for your company – goodnight.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68fa6ba98f08951f69bbbe11" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-23T17:56:36.169Z">6.56pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">India win by 53 runs (DLS) and reach the semi-finals!</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Wicket!
