<p>Here is a complex, mysterious docufictional mediation which unfolds at an unhurried walking pace, co-authored by the Indigenous Brazilian film-maker Ariel Kuaray Ortega, a member of the Mbyá-Guarani movie collective, and Ernesto de Carvalho; it’s evidently been a personal project, many years in the making, and a prizewinner at the 2023 IDFA festival in Amsterdam. Ortega returns to his home town in a remote forested region on the border with Argentina, on a mission to investigate a local legend that a man called Canuto, from his grandfather’s generation, was transformed into a jaguar.</p> <p>The film is at once a documentary on this subject and a record of the fictional re-enactment that Ortega is staging using local people – and, in a way, it is a film about itself. He speaks to his aged grandfather and to villagers about their customs and beliefs and their fraught relationship with the military tyranny of the time; it was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/22/argentina.ianblack">a period notorious for the </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/22/argentina.ianblack">desaparecidos</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/22/argentina.ianblack"> – the “disappeared”</a> – which provides an enigmatic political context for Canuto’s vanishing and the authorities who appropriated their lands without compensation. There are also sharp comments on a certain high-handed “white architect” who designed an award-winning wooden community centre for them, which the community itself regards as exasperatingly flimsy and unfit for purpose, and which they plan to break up for lumber.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSXqAWqk3Ek"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DSXqAWqk3Ek?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The film works in a kind of real-time immersive way, showing scenes in the community at unbroken length. So: does anyone appearing on camera fully believe that Canuto was transformed into a jaguar? Or is the whole idea mysticalised and relativised to such an extent that we question our assumptions about every aspect of asking that question? It could be that Canuto met a horrible end, political or otherwise, and the “jaguar” myth was devised by the collective hivemind to process their shock and grief. It’s an intriguing study.</p> <p>• Canuto’s Transformation is on True Story from 31 October.</p>
