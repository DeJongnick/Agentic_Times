<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Joe Biden has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/14/joe-biden-tariff-chinese-made-electric-vehicles">announced a 100% tariff on Chinese-made electric vehicles</a> (EVs) as part of a raft of stringent policies developed to shield US manufacturers from cheap imports.</p> <p>The move is likely to intensify trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies, and carries risks of retaliation from Beijing. But the US president said the increased levies – which hikes tariffs from 25% to 100% on EVs – were a proportionate response to China’s overcapacity in the EV sector. Levies will also increase on related goods such as lithium batteries and solar cells.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How significant is this?</strong> At the moment, it’s largely symbolic – Chinese EVs have already been virtually excluded from the US market by tariffs previously introduced by Donald Trump.</p></li> <li><p><strong>On the other hand …</strong> Lobby groups have suggested Beijing could pose a future threat by using exports to make up for a frail domestic economy, which the Alliance for American Manufacturing claims would result in an “extinction-level event” for US carmakers.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>At least eight Israeli strikes on Gaza aid groups since October, says report</strong></h2>    <p>Israeli forces have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/14/israel-strikes-aid-groups-gaza-october-human-rights-watch">executed at least eight strikes on humanitarian convoys</a> and their facilities in Gaza since October, according to a report by Human Rights Watch, which said that in every case aid organizations had shared their coordinates with Israeli authorities.</p> <p>HRW said the Israel Defense Forces did not warn the organizations before the strikes, which killed or injured at least 31 people. The report comes after a UN vehicle came under fire in Rafah on Monday, leading to the death of one employee and another being injured as they were travelling to a hospital.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How is this affecting aid?</strong> It’s having a real impact. The HRW report found: <em>“</em>These attacks are having a chilling effect on efforts to provide life-saving aid in Gaza.”</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Michael Cohen to continue testimony at Trump hush-money trial</strong></h2>    <p>Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/14/michael-cohen-testimony-trump-trial">longtime ally and ex-fixer Michael Cohen</a> will resume his testimony on Tuesday in the former US president’s hush-money criminal trial.</p> <p>Cohen is considered crucial to the case where Trump faces charges of allegedly falsifying records of payments to porn actor Stormy Daniels to cover a sexual liaison. The prosecution is arguing the payment represented an election expense.</p> <p>Cohen told the Manhattan courtroom on Monday that Trump had asked him to keep stories about sex out of the press as he ran for president. Damning testimony included Cohen saying: “What I was doing was at the direction of and benefit of Mr Trump,” and later: “Everything required Mr Trump’s signoff.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How is this affecting Trump’s 2024 campaign?</strong> The criminal trial has mostly kept him off the campaign trail, except for at weekends, but it doesn’t seem to have hurt his ranking in the polls.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In other news …</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>Joe Biden has signed into law a bipartisan bill prohibiting the import of enriched uranium from Russia</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/13/biden-russian-uranium-imports-ban">in Washington’s latest sanction</a> against Moscow, which is the world’s main supplier of enriched uranium.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A cluster of EU states are racing to save the bloc’s nature restoration legislation from being abandoned,</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/14/ministers-mount-last-ditch-attempt-to-save-eu-laws-on-restoring-nature">with Sweden, the Netherlands</a> and Italy opposing it at the last summit in March.

Georgia was candid about the award, saying: “I feel like I have to share it with my sister because let’s face it I don’t think I would have been nominated for it if she didn’t survive.”</p> <h2><strong>Sign up</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Sign up for the US morning briefing">  <iframe src="https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4300" height="52px" data-form-title="A different kind of daily email" data-form-description="Sign up and get a daily US news briefing from the Guardian" scrolling="no" seamless frameborder="0" class="iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article" data-form-success-desc="Thanks, you'll start getting the US morning briefing soon."></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the US morning briefing</figcaption> </figure>  <p>First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
