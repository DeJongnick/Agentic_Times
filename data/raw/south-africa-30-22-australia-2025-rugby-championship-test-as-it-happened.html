Simple rugby. Line-out goes to the middle and the hooker, Paenga-Amosa, joins the morass and manages to worm his way between the two Springboks defensive pods. It’s scrappy but it’s over.

Lovely stuff. They don’t breach the line but have the penalty. No points. They go for the corner and a line-out. Esterhuizen comes on at last and replaces Mostert.

Chips ahead. This is sensational! Australia are metres out. Toole is rapid! But the Boks scramble and make the tackle and then turn the ball over under the shade of their own poles. Phew! What a let off for the Boks. That was Handre Pollard rushing back. The chip ahead from Toole bounced the wrong way as far as he was concerned. Could have been a 75 metre score.

Referee Doleman says they’re all backwards but changes his mind on one from Nche that seemed to go forward. Scrum to the Wallabies on their own 22. Kriel is off the pitch (for Esterhuizen I’m guessing) so Nnche is skipper.

Moodie, after dropping the ball twice, is off for the talented Feinberg-Mngomezulu. The new man will go to fullback with Fassi going to the left win.
