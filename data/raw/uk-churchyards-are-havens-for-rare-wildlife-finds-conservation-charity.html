<p>Churchyards are vital havens for rare wildlife including dormice, bats and beetles, according to an extensive audit of burial grounds around the UK. </p> <p>The conservation charity <a href="https://www.caringforgodsacre.org.uk/">Caring for God’s Acre</a> mapped out 20,325 cemeteries, with 800,000 wildlife records submitted and more than 10,800 species recorded.</p> <p>They discovered that these quiet sites are home to a huge variety of rare wildlife, with over a quarter of species recorded featuring on the Red List of endangered species. More than 80 of these were classified as threatened, vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered.</p> <p>The charity is highlighting the importance of churchyards for wildlife and calling for them to be protected and bolstered so they can continue to play this role.</p> <p>There are more than 20,500 burial grounds across the UK, ranging from small areas of under a quarter of an acre, to expansive sites of hundreds of acres.</p> <p>The charity’s biodiversity audit was compiled using records submitted by churchgoers as well as conservation organisations such as the British Trust for Ornithology, the British Lichen Society, Butterfly Conservation, and the Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland.</p> <p>Members of the public have been invited by the charity to visit their local churchyard and record the nature they find there. The organisation has so far managed to engage 30,000 people to contribute to their records.</p>    <p>Harriet Carty, director of Caring for God’s Acre, said: “The records show that over a quarter of the species documented are on the Red List, with more than 80 species classified as threatened, vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered.</p> <p>“This includes species such asthe dormouse, white-letter hairstreak, shepherd’s-needle and eagle’s claw lichen.”</p> <p>Lisa Chilton, CEO of the National Biodiversity Network Trust, said: “Recording wildlife is essential to all our conservation efforts – after all, you can’t protect a species if you don’t know where it’s found.</p> <p>“We are delighted to host the <a href="https://burialgrounds.nbnatlas.org/">Beautiful Burial Ground Portal</a> as part of the NBN [National Biodiversity Network] Atlas – so that wildlife data from the UK’s churchyards, cemeteries and burial grounds are freely accessible to everyone.”</p> <h2>Notable churchyards for wildlife</h2> <p><strong>1. St Mary’s Churchyard, Caynham, Shropshire</strong></p> <p>In the summer months this small rural churchyard, looked after by Caring for God’s Acre volunteers, is full of wildflowers which attract insects and birds.</p> <p><strong>2. Arnos Vale Cemetery, Bristol</strong></p> <p>Arnos Vale in Bristol is rich in history, and full of wildlife, with more than 11,000 verified records listing 1,024 species.</p> <p><strong>3. Morningside Cemetery, Edinburgh</strong></p> <p>Morningside’s city cemetery is a surprisingly rich habitat for wildlife. The Cemetery Wildlife Watch group has documented numerous invertebrates here, including the striking red-legged shieldbug and the aptly named graveyard beetle. </p> <p><strong>4. St Michael’s Churchyard, </strong><strong>Cefnllys</strong><strong>, Powys</strong></p> <p>This secluded churchyard in rural Powys is a prime location for bat enthusiasts. Three species of bat (Daubenton’s bat, soprano pipistrelle, and common pipistrelle) have been recorded here, making it an ideal place for evening wildlife watching as these nocturnal creatures come to life.</p> <p><strong>5. St Helen’s Churchyard, Kelloe, County Durham</strong></p> <p>Historically a butterfly hotspot, St Helen’s has attracted various species over the years, including the dingy skipper, wall, and small heath.</p> <p>The churchyard’s natural meadows and sunny spots create a perfect environment for these delicate insects.</p>
