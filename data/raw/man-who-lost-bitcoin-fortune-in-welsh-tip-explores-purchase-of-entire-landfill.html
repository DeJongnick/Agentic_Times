<p>A computer expert who has battled for a decade to recover a £600m bitcoin fortune he believes is buried in a council dump in south Wales is considering buying the site so he can hunt for the missing fortune.</p> <p>James Howells<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/09/judge-halts-attempt-to-retrieve-600m-bitcoin-wallet-from-welsh-dump"> lost a high court case last month</a> to force Newport city council to allow him to search the tip to retrieve a hard drive he says contains the bitcoins.</p> <p>The council has since announced plans to close and cap the site, which would almost certainly spell the end of any lingering hopes of reaching the bitcoins. The authority has secured planning permission for a solar farm on part of the land.</p> <p>Howells, 39, said on Monday it had been “quite a surprise” to hear of the closure plan. He said: “It [the council] claimed at the high court that closing the landfill to allow me to search would have a huge detrimental impact on the people of Newport, whilst at the same time they were planning to close the landfill anyway.</p> <p>“I expected it would be closed in the coming years because it’s 80/90% full – but didn’t expect its closure so soon. If Newport city council would be willing, I would potentially be interested in purchasing the landfill site ‘as is’ and have discussed this option with investment partners and it is something that is very much on the table.”</p> <p>When he appeared at Cardiff civil justice centre, represented by lawyers working pro bono, Howells described how in the summer of 2013 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/dec/03/500m-bitcoin-hard-drive-landfill-newport-wales-high-court">he accidentally put the hard drive</a> containing his bitcoin wallet in a black bag during an office sort-out and left it in the hall of his house. His then partner is said to have mistaken the bag for rubbish and taken it with her on a trip to the dump, where it has been lost.</p> <p>Howells quickly realised the mistake and ever since has been asking the council to help him retrieve the hard drive, even offering to share the money with the authority, to no avail.</p> <p>The council has resisted Howells’ attempts to allow him to search, insisting that the hard drive had become its property when it entered the landfill site.</p> <p>Sitting as a high court judge, Judge Keyser KC said in January that he accepted the council’s argument that Howells was not entitled to try to retrieve it.</p> <p>Newport city council declined to comment.</p>
