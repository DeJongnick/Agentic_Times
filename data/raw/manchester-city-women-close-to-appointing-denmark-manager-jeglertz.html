<p>Manchester City are close to agreeing a deal to appoint the Denmark national team manager, Andrée Jeglertz, as their new women’s head coach.</p> <p>It is understood that the proposed move would enable the Swedish coach to remain in charge of Denmark until the conclusion of the European Championship in Switzerland this summer, before taking over the Women’s Super League side that finished fourth in the English top tier last season.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/03/inside-the-plight-of-blackburn-rovers-this-is-a-call-for-football-to-do-better">Inside the plight of Blackburn Rovers: this is a call for football to do better | Rachel Dugdale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A deal with Jeglertz is yet to be concluded fully but multiple sources have confirmed discussions are at an advanced stage and he has been City’s first-choice candidate after an extensive search <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/10/manchester-city-women-sack-head-coach-gareth-taylor">to replace Gareth Taylor</a>, who was sacked in March. Nick Cushing was put in temporary charge of the team but he is not understood to have been in the frame for the long-term position.</p> <p>Jeglertz has been in charge of Denmark since 2023, having taken over after the World Cup that year, but on Tuesday there were reports in the Danish media that his likely successor has already been lined up by the Danish Football Association in anticipation of his exit after the European Championship this summer. His contract with the Danish FA is understood to expire after the tournament so no compensation nor release fee would be required.</p> <p>The 53-year-old has extensive experience coaching in the women’s game and led the Swedish club Umeå to lift the women’s European Cup – then known as the Uefa Women’s Cup – in 2004 with a squad that included the Brazil legend Marta.</p> <p>City believe he suits their model for a technical style of play and that his coaching and tactical philosophies fit City Football Group’s preferred profile. The search to replace Taylor was led by the women’s team football director, Therese Sjögran, and the managing director, Charlotte O’Neill. It is their first major appointment since their respective arrivals in 2024 and 2023.</p> <p>In a lengthy managerial career that has stretched more than 22 years, Jeglertz has also managed the Swedish teams Djurgården and Linköping, as well as the Finland national team. As a player he was a defender, predominantly for Umeå and represented Sweden at youth international level.</p> <p>Before his sacking Taylor had been in charge for five years and it was understood that the club’s decision to let the former Wales striker go was based on performances and a feeling that a change would improve the team’s chances of achieving their aims of winning silverware. The club have won the WSL title once, in 2016, but have now endured three consecutive trophyless seasons.</p>
