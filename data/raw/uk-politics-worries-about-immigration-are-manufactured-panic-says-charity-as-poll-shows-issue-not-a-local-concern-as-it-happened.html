These limitations are ones imposed by the United States and by Nato more widely. They almost exclusively constrain Ukrainian activity to Ukrainian soil and deny Ukraine the capabilities required to carry the fight to Russia.</p> <p>They do so, arguably, and understandably, to avoid provoking Russian escalation – hence a preference for financial sanctions as opposed to Tomahawk missiles. But such choices limit Ukraine’s ability to hurt Russia in ways that might bring the war to a conclusion on acceptable terms.</p> <p>In short, therefore, we continue to accept that Ukraine is fighting a proxy war on behalf of Nato that we are denying it the means to win. Reflecting on this, I worry that we forget that war is not ultimately a battle of physical exchange but a battle of human will.</p> <p>Sadly, the trajectory of this war increasingly looks like one that is hurting Ukraine more than Russia. More specifically, it is hurting Ukrainian society more than Vladimir Putin. Putin appears content to incrementally grind this war towards a ceasefire that will be humiliating to Ukraine and embarrassing to western governments.</p> </blockquote> <p>Houghton also called for higher spending on defence.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Hard investment choices have for ever been the challenge of peacetime planners, but we should not be engaged in peacetime planning. We face an outcome to the current conflict that leaves behind a humiliated Ukraine, a residually dangerous Russia and an impoverished Britain devoid of threat awareness with an unfunded SDR [strategic defence review].</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-31T16:00:43.148Z">at 4.00pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6904ccae8f089c910df346bf" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-31T15:10:27.237Z">3.10pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Most voters don't think Badenoch looks like PM in waiting, poll suggests - but only 5% think another leader would be better</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>On Sunday, Kemi Badenoch will celebrate the first anniversary of her election as Tory leader. But “celebrate” might not be the appropriate word. According to <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/53291-how-do-britons-feel-about-kemi-badenoch-after-a-year-as-tory-leader">new polling from </a><strong><a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/53291-how-do-britons-feel-about-kemi-badenoch-after-a-year-as-tory-leader">YouGov</a>,</strong> most Britons (62%), and a majority of Conservative voters (53%), think she does not look like a prime minister in waiting.</p>    <p>To be fair to Badenoch, there is a good reason why the polling numbers are producing numbers like this; it’s because she doesn’t look like a PM in waiting. The Tories suffered a catastrophic defeat in 2025, they are languishing in the polls, and the election may be more than three years away. What matters is whether she or not she looks like a PM in waiting in 2028.</p> <p>With this in mind, there is some modest good news for Badenoch in the other results of the poll: although 77% of people think the Tories are in a weak position, among this group 67% of them say the Tories would be doing just as badly with any other leader, 19% say they would be doing worse, and only 5% say they would be doing better with another leader. Even among Tory supporters, only 10% of those who think the party is in a weak position say it would be doing better under someone else.</p>    <p>The poll also suggests there has been a rise in Badenoch’s approval ratings since the spring – although she is still more unpopular than she was in February.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-31T15:59:21.196Z">at 3.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6904c6c28f08e3e3851d0f8d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-31T14:46:48.727Z">2.46pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The success of Reform UK and the Green party in current polling (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/31/uk-politics-prince-andrew-latest-news-updates-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-rachel-reeves?page=with%3Ablock-6904bde98f08e3e3851d0f01#block-6904bde98f08e3e3851d0f01">2.08pm</a>), and the perception that England has replaced two-party politics (or two-and-a-half-party politics, as some would say) with five-party politics, has renewed interest in whether parliament’s procedures are appropriate for this new era.</p> <p>In <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-923x.70008">an article </a>for the Politcal Quarterly, <strong>Louise Thompson</strong>, an academic at the University of Manchester, argues that they are not. “Parliament is still operating as if it were the 1950s, when two big parties dominated,” she says. She says the smaller parties are not treated fairly as a result.</p> <p>This chart highlights the way parliament’s standing orders, which were drafted for a two-party system, disadvantage parties like Reform and the Greens.</p>    <p>Thompson says these rules create a particular problem for Northern Ireland.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>MPs from all political parties are elected in their constituencies as equals, but at Westminster, some political party groups are more equal than others. This creates a representational deficit and breaks the link in the chain of accountability. It is particularly acute in the case of Northern Ireland. As the only nation of the UK without any large-party representatives, Northern Ireland MPs have no formally guaranteed participation in any parliamentary spaces. In practice, no Northern Ireland MP is guaranteed to be called to speak during any legislative debate or following any ministerial statement whatsoever.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thompson suggests Commons rules should be changed to give smaller parties greater rights. She says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Multiparty politics is here to stay. If parliament doesn’t modernise, it risks silencing the voices of millions of voters and undermining trust in democracy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6904bde98f08e3e3851d0f01" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-31T14:08:32.318Z">2.08pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Find Out Now</strong> has released<a href="https://x.com/FindoutnowUK/status/1983928827643388058"> polling</a> showing the Green party, on 17%, in second place to Reform UK, on 32%.

This was half the 52% who said it was one of the biggest issues facing the country as a whole.</p> <p>These figures have been set out in <a href="https://assets.nationbuilder.com/b4b/pages/14718/attachments/original/1761671139/The_UK's_biggest_challenges_-_Public_attitudes_towards_the_most_important_issues_facing_the_UK_and_local_communities_.pdf?1761671139">a report</a> published by the <strong>Best of Britain</strong> campaign group.

I understand that the relevant emails were only unearthed by your husband this morning, and that you have updated me as soon as possible.</p> <p>I accept that you were acting in good faith when you wrote to me last night. However, it would clearly have been better if you and your husband had conducted a full trawl through all email correspondence with the estate agency before writing to me yesterday.</p> </blockquote> <p>On Wednesday night, when the Daily Mail first broke this story, Reeves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/30/rachel-reeves-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-690311358f08358f328d3d21#block-690311358f08358f328d3d21">said</a> that she and her husband were not aware that a licence was needed to rent the home (under a rule set by Southwark, the local council). Last night an email exchange <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/oct/30/rachel-reeves-labour-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-6903a6048f084e5a6d198ba6#block-6903a6048f084e5a6d198ba6">was released</a> showing that Reeves’s husband, Nicholas Joicey, had been told by the letting agency that a licence was needed, and that they (the agency) would get one.</p> <p>For most of us, the revelation that Reeves did not have the licence she needed because she had been let down by the agency kicked this more or less into non-story territory. But, on Planet Tory, this <a href="https://x.com/sgfmann/status/1984023389087134159">remains a big scandal</a>. Last night <strong>Kevin Hollinrake</strong>, the Conservative chair, posted this <a href="https://x.com/kevinhollinrake/status/1983997113789731018">on social media.</a></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It’s the hypocrisy, stupid. </p> <p>“They’ve broken the rules, they’ve lied to the British people, they have to go”. Rachel Reeves, April 2022 </p> <p>Yesterday Rachel Reeves said she and her husband “were not aware” a licence was needed. </p> <p>Today she admits they knew all along. </p> <p>Do as I say……</p> </blockquote> <p>It is reasonable to ask why Reeves said on Wednesday night she did not realise she needed a licence to rent out her family home, when it turned out that her husband had been told all about this. <strong>Sir Laurie Magnus</strong>, the PM’s ethics adviser, wanted to know. Last night Downing Street also published <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6903ecc8e2ebc0fb39a5204b/Letter_from_the_Independent_Adviser_on_Ministerial_Standards_to_the_Prime_Minister.pdf">his latest letter</a> to the PM on this issue, and this is what he said about Reeves’s apparent memory lapse.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is important to address the chancellor’s statement in her letter to you of 29th October that she and her husband were not aware of the need for a licence. This was a key consideration reflected in my advice to you yesterday. However, emails identified since then, and made public today, demonstrate that the chancellor’s husband was in fact made aware of the need for a licence during the summer of 2024 and that he instructed the estate agency to obtain the licence accordingly. It is clear from his explanation today, that the chancellor’s husband did not recall this exchange, which took place at a very busy time. Furthermore, his contact with the estate agency, during attempts to clarify matters during the course of yesterday, did not give rise to any indication that this prior exchange had taken place. I understand this account and it is helpful to have the clarity (from the content of these emails) demonstrating their desire to comply with the selective licensing regime. It is regrettable that information provided on successive days has generated confusion, but I find no evidence of bad faith.</p> </blockquote> <p>Reeves and her family were moving because she had just become chancellor of the exchequer and so they were going to live in Downing Street. Presumably Reeves had quite a lot of other things to worry about at the time, and no doubt she had an awkward conversation with her husband last night. It won’t be the first time a Westminster spouse gets the blame.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690483428f08b6090a2126f5" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-31T09:38:37.221Z">9.38am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>These <a href="https://x.com/StephenFlynnSNP/status/1983985328332665218">posts on X</a> are from <strong>Stephen Flynn</strong>, the SNP leader at Westminster, on Andrew losing his titles.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The right decision and an important moment for the victims of Epstein.</p> <p>I hope all those who were elected to Parliament and chose to defend inaction rather than speak out now regret the choice they made.</p> <p>As an aside - @Keir_Starmer, is Peter Mandelson still a Lord?</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It was emotional listening live to those who knew Virginia Giuffre tonight.</p> <p>Their collective courage has changed history.</p> <p>He is no longer Prince Andrew.

When David Lammy was appointed justice secretary, and lord chancellor, he probably never expected that removing Prince Andrew’s titles would end up as one of his jobs. But that is where he is today, as a consequence of the remarkable announcement from Buckingham Palace last night.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/30/prince-andrew-leave-royal-lodge-windsor">Prince Andrew to be stripped of titles and forced to leave Windsor home</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew is going to be stripped of his Prince and Duke of York titles and HRH style, as well as the subsidiary titles of Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh, PA Media reports. Many titles can be removed under the royal prerogative on ministerial advice and dukes, including the Duke of York, are listed on the roll of the peerage maintained at the Crown Office. As lord chancellor, Lammy is responsible for maintaining the peerage roll and he is going to receive a warrant from the king telling him to strike the duke from the roll.</p> <p>Judging by what other ministers and MPs have been saying about the decision, Lammy will perform the task with some relish. This is what other politicians have been saying about the move since it was announced last night.</p> <p><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong>, the culture secretary, was on Question Time when the recording was halted so that the panel could be told about Andrew. She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I really support the step that [the king] taken. I think (it’s) a very powerful message to the victims of grooming and sex offences. I used to work with children who’d been abused before I came into Parliament, including many of the girls who’d been horrifically abused by grooming gangs …</p> <p>This is a really brave, important and right step by the king, and I fully support it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Chris Bryant</strong>, the trade minister, told the BBC this morning:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We warmly, I warmly support what the king is doing today. I think the vast majority of people in this country will think that it’s the right thing to do.</p> </blockquote> <p>Describing Andrew as now “an ordinary member of the public”, Bryant also suggested he should go to the US to answer questions about the crimes of the late paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein, if asked.</p> <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>, the Conservative leader, was doing an LBC phone-in last night and she said this was “a very sad state of affairs” for the king. She explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think that the king has clearly felt that this is the right decision for the royal family. It must have been a very difficult thing for him to have done. I mean, having to do that to your own brother.</p> <p>But the standards and expectations in society now are very high. People expect to see the very highest levels of integrity. And I’m afraid the whole Jeffrey Epstein saga and everyone it has touched, from Prince <em>Andrew</em> to Peter Mandelson, has just shown that the public has no truck whatsoever with any kind of sexual abuse, sexual offences, especially of minors. And I think that that’s quite right.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ed Davey</strong>, the Lib Dem leader, <a href="https://x.com/EdwardJDavey/status/1983980247658934634">said</a>:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The king is absolutely right to strip Prince Andrew of both his titles and his residence at the Royal Lodge.</p> <p>It’s clear that Andrew’s position had become totally untenable, having disgraced his office and embarrassed the country.</p> </blockquote> <p>We will get a lobby briefing later today, and so we may get an update on the government line, although Keir Starmer is probably just relieved that King Charles has acted decisively in a way likely to satisify the public that Andrew has been properly punished. Starmer showed no enthusiasm for government involvement in this. Some MPs are still pushing for further action against Andrew, or for a general overhaul of the way titles are awarded, but these seem to be minority arguments.</p> <p>The Commons is not sitting today, but there is other politics around. The Rachel Reeves rental licence story is finally winding up, and in the Lords peers are debating Ukraine.
