<p>Donald Trump has said he sealed an agreement with Nato allies that will deliver Patriot missiles and other key arms to Ukraine – and warned Russia it would face severe sanctions if the war did not end within 50 days.</p> <p>Unveiling the military assistance deal, the US president expressed increased frustration with Vladimir Putin, whom he accused of giving the impression of pursuing peace while intensifying attacks on Ukrainian cities. He gave the Russian president a new deadline of 50 days to make peace or face 100% tariffs on Russian goods, and more importantly, sweeping “secondary tariffs”, suggesting trade sanctions would be imposed on countries that continue to pay for Russian oil and other commodities.</p> <p>Here is more on this and other key Trump stories of the day:</p>  <h2>Trump hails US-Nato deal to arm Ukraine </h2>  <p>After a meeting with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato">Nato</a> secretary general, Mark Rutte, Trump said they had agreed “a very big deal” in which “billions of dollars’ worth of military equipment is going to be bought from the United States, going to Nato … And that’s going to be quickly distributed to the battlefield”.</p> <p>Speaking in the White House alongside a clearly delighted Rutte, the US president said the arms deliveries would be comprehensive and would include the Patriot missile batteries that Ukraine desperately needs for its air defences against the daily Russian aerial onslaught.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/14/trump-does-deal-with-nato-allies-to-arm-ukraine-and-warns-russia-of-severe-sanctions"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Epstein files plunge Trump’s Maga base into turmoil</h2>  <p>The Department of Justice’s announcement that it did not have a list of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged clients, and that the convicted sex offender was not murdered, has plunged the rightwing world into turmoil.</p> <p>Conservative commentators and media figures, some of whom spent years pushing conspiracy theories about Epstein’s death, have accused the government of covering up the hedge fund manager’s crimes, with calls growing for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pam-bondi">Pam Bondi</a>, the attorney general, to resign.
