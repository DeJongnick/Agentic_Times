<p>It was “humiliating” for a Times reporter to have quoted someone the journalist erroneously believed was former New York City mayor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bill-de-blasio">Bill de Blasio</a>, an editor for the London outlet reportedly said in an email to staff.</p> <p>“We should have been on our guard. We should have tried much harder to speak to the people concerned,” Ian Brunskill , the Times associate editor, told the company, according to an email obtained by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/bill-de-blasio-fake-interview-humiliating-times-editor-says-1236603178/">Deadline</a>. He went on to acknowledge the “serious damage” done to the Rupert Murdoch-owned paper.</p> <p>“We – reporters and editors – should be asking: Who is telling me this and why?” the email said. “How do I know they’re who they say they are? How plausible is what I’m being told? What can I do to check?”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/fake-bill-de-blasio-interview">Will the real De Blasio please stand up? A lesson from a UK newspaper’s gaffe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It continued: “Those questions are absolutely basic. Asking them should be second nature to anyone working for a paper with a long history of trusted reporting. There are no excuses.”</p> <p>Brunskill also mentioned another instance which he said harmed the paper’s reputation in recent weeks, referencing an “AI-generated case study” on a fake royal household employee. He said both episodes were “humiliating” and “did serious damage to our reputation”.</p> <p>“We can’t afford to be fooled,” the email reportedly said.</p> <p>Days earlier, the Times <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/29/times-de-blasio-fake-interview-mamdani">apologized and deleted</a> an article after discovering its reporter, Bevan Hurley, mistakenly attributed quotes that were critical of Zohran Mamdani to de Blasio, the Democratic mayor of New York City from 2014 to 2021.</p> <p>De Blasio has been an enthusiastic supporter of Mamdani, whom many expect to be elected as New York City’s next mayor on 4 November.</p> <p>The newspaper removed the article from its website after the real de Blasio released a statement calling the quotes attributed to him “entirely false and fabricated” and lambasted the Times for its “absolute violation of journalistic ethics”.</p> <p>It was later reported by <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/29/2025/british-newspaper-spoke-to-the-wrong-deblasio-not-an-imposter">Semafor</a> that the person with whom Hurley corresponded was not an outright imposter, but a different person who happened to share a name with the former New York City mayor.</p> <p>The person with whom Hurley actually corresponded was Long Island, New York, wine importer Bill DeBlasio, who told Semafor: “I never once said I was the mayor. He never addressed me as the mayor. So I just gave him my opinion.”</p>
