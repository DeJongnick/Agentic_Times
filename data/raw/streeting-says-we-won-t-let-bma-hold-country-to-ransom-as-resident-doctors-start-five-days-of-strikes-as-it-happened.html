The public have been urged to keep coming forward for NHS care during the strike. GP surgeries are open as usual and urgent care and A&amp;E will continue to be available, alongside 111, NHS <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/england">England</a> said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Dr Melissa Ryan, co-chairwoman of the BMA’s UK resident doctors committee, told the PA news agency that rising living costs are forcing many doctors into debt. </strong>She said a first-year doctor with £80,000-100,000 of student debt can expect to lose 9% of their salary for life repaying it.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Louise Stead, group chief executive of Ashford and St Peter’s and Royal Surrey <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">NHS</a> Foundation Trusts, was asked about NHS trusts refusing catch-up shifts for striking doctors and fellow consultants, which enables them to earn extra cash. </strong>It has been suggested the NHS England move to keep as much pre-planned care going as possible means there will be fewer catch-up shifts needed, and therefore doctors will not be able to top up their pay.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Patients at St Thomas’ Hospital have voiced their support for junior doctors taking part in the latest round of strike action over pay and conditions. </strong>Jo Irwin, 72, who was attending the London hospital for a blood test before surgery for a hernia, said she had “no hesitation” in backing the walkout.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Around 30 doctors and supporters gathered outside Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) on Friday morning, waving placards and cheering as passing cars beeped horns in support. </strong>Cristina Costache, who is a paediatrics registrar at the LGI and a PhD student, said: “It’s a very difficult decision to make always, because I love my job and that’s the reason I went into it.

Though I’m a resident doctor by grade, I currently work for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">NHS</a> England on a freelance (locum) basis, so I’ll be supporting my colleagues by electing not to work on the aforementioned days, despite the sauteed carrot of “enhanced strike rates”.</p> <p>Whenever doctors are engaged in a public pay dispute, our status as “heroes” is lost to accusations of shirking and self-interest. These attitudes even play out within different generations of doctors.</p> <p>Discussing money in the sector has historically been taboo. When I was in medical school between 2011 and 2016, I can remember students being reprimanded by established doctors for any suggestion that they were pursuing medicine “to make money”. Those with “pound signs in their eyes” were advised to seek a career in the City instead. There was no need to discuss finances, as the understanding was that being a doctor was a challenging and noble vocation that, while it may never make you rich, would leave you more than financially secure.</p> <p>You could look to consultants as examples of such financial security. After years of arduous training, they’ve arguably reached the top of their profession, the pinnacle. Many of them are covering for resident doctor colleagues over the weekend so residents can strike safely, reportedly advised to demand up to £6,000 a shift. Some may balk at such fees, but how much would a top lawyer charge to work out of hours?</p> <p>With becoming a consultant no means a guarantee, debts of more than £100,000 and a rota that can be unforgiving, conditions for resident doctors<strong> </strong>are challenging. Then you throw in pay – <a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/bma-media-centre/junior-doctors-in-england-vote-to-accept-pay-offer">20% less in real terms</a> compared with a doctor in 2008.

It has only been a year since the last round of strikes and the length of this one – five days at two weeks’ notice over the summer when people are away – is designed to send a message.</p> <p>Consultants were, by and large, supportive of the previous rounds of strikes. There is a recognition our residents have it harder than we did. There is more financial hardship than there used to be, their salaries don’t go as far as ours did when we were training, and they have amassed more student debt. </p> <p>In addition, they have to pay many thousands of pounds in General Medical Council registration and compulsory conference and examination fees that are nowhere near covered by their shrinking study budgets – this always seemed outrageous while I was training too. Consequently, most consultants were pleased when residents received their 22% pay award last year. It felt like a step in the right direction.</p> <p>This time, however, it feels different. There seems to be almost no discussion about the strikes, other than around how we cover them. Most of us are worried about being seen as unsupportive; we know our residents talk to one another and we might get a reputation if we say what we really think.</p> <p>In the conversations I have had, however, the feeling is that it is too soon to go again and there is little hope of any further awards on pay at this stage.
