<p>Donald Trump’s US state department said on Tuesday it had revoked the visas of six foreigners over social media comments made about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">assassination of far-right commentator Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> 
<p>“The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,” the state department said in a statement <a href="https://x.com/StateDept/status/1978218112882266594">posted on X</a>. “The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk.”</p>

<p>The state department then listed six “examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the US” in a thread on the social media platform owned by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, the Trump donor who called himself “a free speech absolutist” before buying the site formerly known as Twitter.</p> 
<p>The thread included screenshots and quotes from people identified as foreign nationals of Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa.</p> 
<p>None of the individuals was identified by name, but the screenshots made it possible to trace the identities of two people, including one who had been singled out for abuse by conservatives on X.</p> 
<p>“Charlie Kirk won’t be remembered as a hero,” one of the comments posted on X read. “He was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash!”</p> 
<p>The thread ended with a statement from the state department that Trump and the secretary of state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, “will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws. Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed.”</p> 
<p>Last month, a deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, urged social media users to send him posts critical of Kirk, saying he was “disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action”.</p>

<p>The administration has previously ramped up efforts to identify and potentially expel thousands of foreign students it accuses of participating in unrest in the form of protests against Israel’s mass killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The administration has also required foreign visitors to make their social media accounts public so that they can be checked before they are allowed to enter the land of the free.</p> 
<p>In recent months, the administration has expelled South Africa’s ambassador to the US for comments critical of Trump, revoked a visa for Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to attend the United Nations general assembly in New York and cancelled visas of the visas for British punk-rap duo <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bob-vylan">Bob Vylan</a>.</p> 
<p>The government has also said it is reviewing the status of the more than 55 million holders of visas to enter the US for potential violations of its standards.</p> 
<p>Those actions have been criticized by civil rights groups as blatant violations of constitutional protections for freedom of speech, which apply to anyone in the US, not just citizens.</p>
