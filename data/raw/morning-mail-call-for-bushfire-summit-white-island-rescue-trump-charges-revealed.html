<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 11 December.</p> 
<h2>Top stories</h2> 
<p><strong>Australia needs a national summit to address how the country should prepare for and resource bushfire emergencies in a changed climate,</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/11/former-fire-and-emergency-chiefs-push-for-national-bushfire-emergency-summit">former emergency leaders say</a>. It comes after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/10/scott-morrison-rejects-calls-for-more-help-saying-volunteer-firefighters-want-to-be-there?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">rejected calls</a> on Tuesday for additional help for volunteers. Asked how tens of thousands of volunteers were expected to continue without pay, Morrison said they “want to be there”. “What we’re saying long term is there needs to be a paradigm shift for how we deal with these fires,” said Greg Mullins, one of the former fire chiefs. “A big national conversation needs to be had. We need farmers, councils, the military, politics.” Meanwhile, a Sydney GP working in the suburbs hardest hit by bushfire smoke plaguing New South Wales has said she is devastated for her patients, many of them <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/10/nsw-bushfires-doctors-sound-alarm-over-disastrous-impact-of-smoke-on-air-pollution">unable to afford air filters</a>, air conditioning or masks.</p> 
<p><strong>A “frontline” Hong Kong democracy protester who recently fled the territory says he was ambushed in an Australian city by masked Chinese men. </strong>“They were nearby my house and waiting for me,” Jack* <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/10/hong-kong-democracy-protester-says-he-was-ambushed-by-masked-chinese-men-in-australia">told Guardian Australia</a>. “They knew my address, they knew where I was going to be. “I think they don’t want to hurt me, they just want to make me scared. It was like intimidation, a message that ‘we know where you are’.”</p> 
<p><strong>A commercial helicopter pilot who led a team that rescued 12 victims from the White Island volcano eruption has said he believed it was their last hope of survival. </strong>“We found people dead, dying and alive but in various states of unconsciousness,” said Mark Law, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/10/new-zealand-volcano-helicopter-pilot-says-was-victims-last-hope">tour company boss</a> who flew to the volcano and spent an hour on the ground. Unsure whether emergency services would reach the island in New Zealand’s Bay of Plenty because of fears for their safety, the team loaded the victims into the helicopters themselves and flew to the mainland.</p> 
<p><strong>Marie Fredriksson, the singer of Roxette, has died aged 61 following a long illness. </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/10/roxette-singer-marie-fredriksen-dies-aged-61">Her family said in a statement</a>: “It is with great sadness that we have to announce that one of our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2019/dec/10/marie-fredriksson-listen-to-your-heart-through-the-years-video">biggest and most beloved artists</a> is gone.” There’s a case to be made that Roxette’s It Must Have Been Love is the greatest 80s power ballad of them all, and perhaps the greatest breakup song, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/10/it-must-have-been-love-roxettes-power-ballad-is-a-masterpiece-of-pain">writes Dave Simpson</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Australian Electoral Commission rejected a complaint about fake how-to-vote cards that directed preferences to Peter Dutton</strong> because they informed voters how to cast their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/10/complaint-about-fake-how-to-vote-cards-preferencing-peter-dutton-rejected">first-preference vote correctly</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Greenland’s ice sheet is melting much faster than previously thought,</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/10/greenland-ice-sheet-melting-seven-times-faster-than-in-1990s">threatening hundreds of millions of people with inundation</a> and bringing some of the irreversible impacts of the climate emergency much closer.</p> 
<p><strong>The woman whose account claimed the UK hospital boy photo was staged claims she was hacked.</strong> A medical secretary has claimed her Facebook account was hacked after it was used to post false information claiming that a photograph of an ill boy on the floor at Leeds General Infirmary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/10/woman-says-account-hacked-to-post-fake-story-about-hospital-boy">was staged for political purposes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Water at Goma is not just an art show, it’s a profound space to process climate anxiety, </strong>writes Mia Timpano. “Flying into Brisbane for the opening means flying into what one airline pilot describes to passengers as ‘significant fire activity’. ‘There will be an odour of that in the cabin,’ was the warning. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/11/water-at-goma-is-not-just-an-art-show-its-a-profound-space-to-process-climate-anxiety">‘It’s nothing to be concerned about.</a>’ But of course it is. And for many of us it’s becoming increasingly difficult to process the panic that the climate emergency induces. Water, the exhibition, is dedicated to this natural element, and it provides a much-needed moment to connect with an otherwise paralysing range of emotions.”</p> 
<p><strong>It’s hard to pinpoint the exact moment our friendships became more transactional and less intimate,</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/11/when-did-we-become-so-bad-at-friendship">writes Johanna Leggatt</a>. “It’s not that we stopped communicating with friends. In fact, we’re all in constant contact, if that is what you would call it, promising to create windows to catch up in, texting questions that go unanswered and failing to respond to texts ... Another way to describe it is as a digital shouting match that replaces actual dialogue with non sequiturs, memes and emojis that ping relentlessly and forever around our devices, awaiting their ‘seen’ receipt, but rarely eliciting a substantive response.”</p>

<p>Under increasing pressure from the public and the opposition to create a federal anti-corruption body, the Coalition has put forward a proposal for a “Commonwealth Integrity Commission”. Critics, including one Coalition MP, say <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2019/dec/11/a-federal-integrity-commission-with-teeth">the proposed watchdog is weak</a> and gives undue protection to politicians. Lawyer and columnist Richard Ackland analyses the current proposal and the case for a strong federal integrity commission on today’s episode of Full Story.</p>

<p><strong>Australia’s summer of sport is already in danger of choking on the smoke haze caused by the devastating bushfires across NSW and Queensland.</strong> Will the poor air quality, which has become a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/11/australias-summer-of-sport-chokes-after-smoke-renders-play-hazardous">very real health hazard</a> for athletes and spectators, prompt a rethink of how the sporting calendar is scheduled?</p>
