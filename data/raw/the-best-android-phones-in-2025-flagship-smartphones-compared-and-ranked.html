<p>Need an Android phone, but not sure which to go for, or whether to buy new or refurbished? With lots to consider, let me be your guide as you trek through the process of picking the best handset for you.</p> 
<p>The latest flagship Android phones come in various sizes, at different prices, and with varying hardware and software features, all powered by the fastest chips. Whether your priority is battery life, camera, screen size, software support or value for money, there is more to choose from than ever. And if you’re thinking of buying Apple instead, we have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/08/the-best-apple-iphones-in-2024-tested-reviewed-and-ranked">a guide for iPhones</a>, too.</p>

<h2>Replace or spruce up?</h2> 
<p>New models typically have faster chips and better cameras, but the differences between generations are shrinking with each year. That means the best Android phone for you could still be the one in your hand.</p> 
<p>If your battery doesn’t last as long as it used to, replacements are often available from the manufacturer or third parties, and start at about £50, depending on the make and model. If your Android is slow or apps won’t install, check you have enough free storage – ideally at least 2GB. Space can be freed up by uninstalling unused apps or content, clearing out your messaging storage, offloading photos and videos to the cloud, and deleting music and podcasts you no longer listen to.</p>

<h2>When to replace your Android</h2> 
<p>If your phone’s worn out, broken beyond repair or no longer receives crucial security updates, it’s time to upgrade. Most older Androids received only three years of software support from release date – not from purchase – with newer, better models getting five to seven years. Replacing a phone that has stopped receiving security updates is essential because it will be more vulnerable to hackers and cybercriminals.</p>

<h2><em>Best Android for most people</em>: <br>Google Pixel 10</h2> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7718388"> 128GB, £799 at Argos </a> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Google-Pixel-10-Unlocked-Smartphone/dp/B0FHJNDQBR"> 128GB, £799 at Amazon </a> 
<p>The Pixel 10 has set a new bar for what you should expect from a flagship phone. It’s the best choice for most people with its balance of cost, size and features.</p> 
<p>It looks and feels great, with satin aluminium sides and Google’s standout camera bar protruding from the glass back. The 6.3in OLED screen is crisp and bright, and its 120Hz refresh rate keeps scrolling smooth.</p> 
<p>A rapid ultrasonic under-screen fingerprint scanner and 2D face recognition make it easy to unlock the Pixel 10. It feels very responsive, coming with the same Tensor G5 chip as Google’s most expensive phones, along with 12GB of RAM and at least 128GB of storage. The battery will last up to two days of general use between charges, too.</p> 
<p>The Pixel 10 is one of the first Android phones to build in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(standard)">Qi2</a> support into the back. As well as fast and easy wireless charging, this opens up compatibility with magnetic accessories, including those made for Apple’s MagSafe iPhones, such as wallets, phone grips, stands and car mounts.</p> 
<p>The phone runs some of the best Android software you can get and is guaranteed monthly security and feature updates <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705">until at least August 2032</a>. This year, Google introduced a collection of useful new advanced AI tools, too, most of which run locally for speed and privacy.</p> 
<p>Highlights include various Gemini, writing, translation, dictation and image-editing tools. The most advanced is Magic Cue, which runs in the background pulling data from your calendar, Gmail, maps, notes, screenshots, contacts and messages to suggest information when you need it. If a friend texts to ask when your flight is due to land, Magic Cue will show the time and date directly on the messages screen to quickly paste into your conversation. Or when you phone a business to check where your delivery is, the system will present a card in the phone app, pulling the order details straight from Gmail.</p> 
<p>Finally, Google has also righted one of the few wrongs of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/19/google-pixel-9-review-a-good-phone-overshadowed-by-great-ones">2024’s Pixel 9</a> by giving the Pixel 10 three cameras on the back, including a new 5x telephoto camera. That makes it one of the best camera systems available, including some great features such as Auto Best Take and Add Me for group photos, plus the new AI Camera Coach, which can guide you to taking a better photo.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The Pixel 10 offers almost everything that Google’s top-tier phones do, but at a lower price. It has a great triple rear camera (with 5x optical zoom), cracking software, cutting-edge AI tools and a high-quality screen, all packed into a manageable size.</p> 
<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want a premium, Google AI-packed phone with a good camera for slightly less<br><strong>Don’t buy if:</strong> you want a massive screen or the very best camera on an Android</p>

<h2><em>Best Android for camera</em>:<br>Google Pixel 10 Pro</h2> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/google-pixel-10-pro-smartphone-android-6-3-5g-sim-free/obsidian/p114219678"> 128GB, £999 at John Lewis </a> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7721179"> 128GB, £999 at Argos </a> 
<p>The Pixel 10 Pro takes everything that is good about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone">regular Pixel 10</a> and turns it up a notch. Its 6.3in OLED is slightly brighter, slicker and crisper, making it one of the very best on a phone. The polished aluminium sides look and feel expensive, while the rapid fingerprint and face scanners feel responsive.<strong> </strong>And Qi2 support opens up compatibility with a large collection of magnetic chargers and accessories.</p> 
<p>It has the Tensor G5 chip, 16GB of RAM and at least 128GB of storage, plus up to two days of battery life. The 10 Pro also comes with a year’s subscription to <a href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/16476811">Google AI Pro</a> – usually costing £18.99 a month – which provides access to the more powerful Gemini Pro, image- and video-generating models, and 2TB of cloud storage.</p> 
<p>It comes with the same Android software and AI tools as the regular Pixel 10, with support <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705">until August 2032</a>.</p> 
<p>The biggest upgrade is in the camera, adding more powerful sensors including a 50MP main, 48MP ultra-wide and 48MP 5x telephoto camera, the latter of which can stretch to 10x with a crop zoom. This trio can make the most out of practically any lighting condition or environment.</p> 
<p>But the 10 Pro is also the first to include generative AI directly in the camera. Zoom to a maximum of 100x magnification, and a local genAI model will process the image, adding back the detail and sharpness lost by digital zoom. It’s not perfect, but the results can be very impressive.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The Pixel 10 Pro has the best camera on an Android phone, plus top software, cutting-edge AI tools and a high-quality screen that’s large but not enormous (if a huge screen is what you want, look to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/23/pixel-10-pro-xl-review-googles-superphone-ai-magnetic-upgrades">Google’s Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> instead).</p>

<h2><em>Best Android for </em><em>battery life and a big screen:</em><br>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</h2> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s25-ultra/buy/"> 256GB, £1,249 at Samsung </a> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-256gb-titanium-silverblue"> 256GB, £1,249 at Carphone Warehouse </a> 
<p>If money is no object and you want the biggest and best screen on an Android coupled with superb battery life, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra lives up to its name.</p> 
<p>The huge 6.9in screen is the brightest and best around, wrapped in a titanium frame with tiny bezels. Four cameras on the back rival the Pixel 10 Pro for the best, including 3x and 5x telephoto cameras. Inside, it has the fastest Android chip available, 12GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage, while its two-day-plus battery life helps it go the distance.</p> 
<p>The S25 Ultra has great software with support until 2032, so you can keep <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/27/from-smash-proof-cases-to-updates-how-to-make-your-smartphone-last-longer">using it for longer with proper care</a>. The phone is packed with loads of the most advanced AI tools – which are still a bit hit and miss – plus a stylus for handwriting and doodling on the screen.</p> 
<p>Despite being thin and not too heavy, the S25 Ultra is super-sized, which means it requires two hands to use most of the time and might be a struggle to fit in pockets. It also launched at an eye-watering price, which has come down a little but still tops most competitors. Look out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/oct/30/how-to-find-the-best-refurbished-phone">for deals on the refurbished market</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The S25 Ultra is the reigning superphone champ with the best screen, the fastest chip, very long battery life and more cameras on its back than any other, plus plenty of AI features and even an integrated stylus.</p>

<h2><em>Best small</em><em> Android:<br></em>Samsung Galaxy S25</h2> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4667872"> 256GB, £709 at Argos </a> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/"> 128GB, £799 at Samsung </a> 
<p>A truly small flagship Android doesn’t exist, but Samsung’s regular Galaxy S25 is the most manageable you can get.</p> 
<p>It has a great and relatively small 6.2in screen, slim bezels and flat aluminium sides, and it weighs only 162g, making it feel nice and compact. Despite being much cheaper, the regular S25 has the same super-quick chip as its much larger S25 Ultra sibling, plus plenty of RAM and at least 128GB of storage. A decent triple camera, including a 3x telephoto zoom, is on the back.</p> 
<p>The S25 also runs the same Android version as the rest of Samsung’s top phones, including loads of AI tools and support until 2032, so you’re not missing out just because it’s smaller.</p> 
<p>The only downside of the more compact size is a smaller battery. It will still last a solid day, but not much more. You can also find better cameras on slightly larger rivals.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The S25 is the last great Android flagship at this size, and it doesn’t skimp on features despite its compact and lightweight frame.</p> 
<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want a smaller flagship phone<br><strong>Don’t buy if:</strong> you need very long battery life or a big screen</p>

<h2><em>Best value Android</em>: <br>Google Pixel 9a</h2> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/google-pixel-9a-smartphone-android-6-3-5g-sim-free-128gb/obsidian/p113480497"> 128GB, £449 at John Lewis </a> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7184486"> 128GB, £449 at Argos </a> 
<p>Google’s latest A-series Pixel is the best yet, squeezing almost everything great about the Android-maker’s high-end phones into a relatively affordable handset.</p> 
<p>It looks like a clone of the regular Pixel 10 from the front, with a decent 6.3in screen and aluminium sides, but the Pixel 9a has a dual-camera system that sits almost flush with the high-quality plastic back. It’s sleek, but looks a bit generic compared with Google’s previous standout camera designs. It still looks and feels good and has full IP68 water resistance, plus an optical fingerprint scanner and face unlock.</p> 
<p>The 9a has the same Tensor G4 chip as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/19/google-pixel-9-review-a-good-phone-overshadowed-by-great-ones">last year’s top Google phones</a>, keeping it snappy in operation, while the battery lasts a good two days between charges. It only has 8GB of RAM, which isn’t particularly noticeable in day-to-day use but does curb some of Google’s more advanced AI tools. The 9a still has great software, including Gemini, which will be supported for a <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705">full seven years from release</a> – almost unheard of at this price.</p> 
<p>The best part is the camera. While it only has a main camera and an ultrawide one on the back, it shoots better photos than many phones twice the price. In fact, it’s only a smidgen behind the regular Pixels in low light. The 9a even has Google’s popular Best Take and Add Me AI features, plus full access to Magic Editor and other tools.</p> 
<p>A few corners have been cut, though, including the plastic back rather than glass, an older generation of scratch-resistant glass on the screen, and the lack of support for Android’s built-in spatial audio system for headphones.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The Pixel 9a offers a top-tier experience at a much cheaper, mid-range price, making it the best value flagship Android by a mile.</p> 
<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> you want an excellent Android with flagship experience and a great camera for less<br><strong>Don’t buy if:</strong> you want a telephoto camera</p>

<h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</h2> <a class="element element-link" href="https://ao.com/product/smf966bzkbeub-samsung-galaxy-z-fold7-5g-mobile-phone-black-107780-305.aspx"> 256GB, £1,599 at AO </a> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold7/buy/"> 256GB, £1,799 at Samsung </a> 
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> a book-style foldable phone:</p> 
<p>Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a remarkable device. It fits a large 8in screen inside an incredibly thin body, which folds like a book to transform it from a tablet to a phone.</p> 
<p>It weighs just 215g and is only 8.9mm thick when folded, with a large, slick and bright 6.5in screen on the outside. It looks and feels just like a regular slab phone. But open it up and you’ll reveal a huge, high-quality internal screen in a body that’s just 4.2mm thick – barely thicker than the USB-C port and slimmer than even the new breed of ultra-thin phones such as the S25 Edge.</p> 
<p>It’s ready for films, books, browsing and serious multitasking with up to eight apps open on screen at once. The Fold 7 has Qualcomm’s top Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM and at least 256GB of storage, helping it fly along regardless of what you’re doing. A battery life of almost two days rivals big slab phones, while five cameras, including a trio of quality cameras on the back (with a 200MP main and 3x telephoto cameras), do a good job of capturing life.</p> 
<p>The foldable phone has a rapid fingerprint scanner in the power button and runs the same quality Android as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/17/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-still-the-superphone-to-beat">Samsung’s top S25 phones</a>, including the Now bar, Gemini and other AI tools. In addition, it offers multiple modes that really take advantage of the folding form in ways that rivals don’t, and software support will last until 31 July 2032.</p> 
<p>But while the Fold 7 is water resistant, it’s not dust resistant. Like all foldables, the internal screen is softer than regular hardened glass, so it must be treated with care. It’s very expensive and repairs are just as pricey, so make sure you get insurance.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The Fold 7 is super thin and light. Its outside offers a high-quality screen and all the trimmings of a regular phone, yet it also packs a huge internal screen with power to spare. It feels like the two-in-one future.</p> 
<p><strong>Buy if:</strong> if you want the best phone-tablet hybrid without the bulk or compromise (other than cost)<br><strong>Don’t buy if:</strong> you’re rough with your phone or need extended camera zoom</p>

<h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</h2> <a class="element element-link" href="https://ao.com/product/smf766bdbgeub-samsung-galaxy-z-flip7-5g-mobile-phone-blue-107753-305.aspx"> 256GB, £979 at AO </a> <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip7/buy/"> 256GB, £1,049 at Samsung </a> 
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> a flip-style foldable phone</p> 
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 takes a big and bright 6.9in OLED screen and folds it in half to fit more easily in your pocket. New in this generation is a bigger outside screen that fills the front of the phone when closed, which can be used for accessing a selection of apps, widgets and Gemini without opening the handset. </p> 
<p>The Flip is particularly attractive in blue with a good wallpaper on the outside screen, and it’s been slimmed down to only 6.5mm thick when open. The phone feels responsive with solid performance and a great fingerprint scanner in the power button on the side. But battery life is a little on the short side, lasting a day or so, meaning it can’t keep up with larger slab phones for staying power.</p> 
<p>The dual rear cameras are solid, but the lack of a telephoto camera means you’re limited to wide and ultra-wide shots. The Flip’s party piece is the ability to shoot selfies using the main cameras, with the outside screen acting as a viewfinder.</p> 
<p>It runs some of the best Android software available with lots of AI tools, including Google’s Gemini, Circle to Search and the Now bar for keeping up with ongoing activities, such as sports, music playback or timers. With software support until 31 July 2032, the Flip 7 is the all-round best flip phone on the market.</p> 
<p>This is a relatively iterative update, though, so <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/23/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review-faster-longer-lasting-phone-battery-camera-screen-ai">last year’s Flip 6</a> is worth looking at if you can find a good deal. As with other folding devices, the Flip 7 is water- but not dust-resistant, and its internal screen is softer and more fragile than a regular phone, so accidental damage insurance will be prudent.</p> 
<p><strong>Why should you buy it?<br></strong>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a great-looking clamshell that squeezes a huge screen into your pocket. It has great software and support as standard.</p>

<h2>Other Androids to consider</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/23/pixel-10-pro-xl-review-googles-superphone-ai-magnetic-upgrades">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>: it offers everything that’s great about the 6.3in Pixel 10 Pro, but with a super-size 6.8in screen and longer battery life.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/sep/02/pixel-9-pro-review-small-phone-camera-google-android-ai">Google Pixel 9 Pro:</a> last year’s standard Pro Pixel is still a contender for the best smaller phone and will get updates until at least August 2031, so it is still worth buying at a decent discount.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/aug/22/pixel-9-pro-xl-review-google-ai-packed-superphone-to-rival-the-best">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL:</a> the predecessor to this year’s Pro Pixel was also great, with updates until at least August 2031, making it worth looking at on a deal or refurbished.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/10/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review-super-thinness-above-all-else">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge:</a> its exquisite, super-slim form is quite something, but comes at the cost of camera and battery life.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s25/buy/">Samsung Galaxy S25+</a>: this middle-of-the-pack Samsung flagship is good, but it’s bettered at either end by its siblings and costs more than rivals. Look for deals.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/05/oneplus-13-review-android-fabric-back-battery-life-camera">OnePlus 13:</a> has great hardware, good camera and long battery life, but it’s let down by short software support and a lack of quality AI tools.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/16/nothing-phone-3-review-a-quirky-slick-android-alternative">Nothing Phone 3:</a> for those looking for something a little different, the top-tier Nothing is pretty slick.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/28/honor-magic-v5-review-fantastic-foldable-phone-better-android-software">Honor Magic V5:</a> a super-thin book-style foldable with a big battery and good camera, but it’s let down by average software – a decent alternative if you want an alternative to Samsung and Google.</p>

<h2>Buying a refurbished Android phone</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/oct/30/how-to-find-the-best-refurbished-phone">Buying refurbished</a> is better for the planet and your wallet than buying new, but Android phones are typically limited in their useful life by a lack of software updates rather than the hardware wearing out. This means the more recently the phone was launched, the better the buy.</p>

</aside> 
<p>Broadly, there are two types of refurbished Android: those that manufacturers, including <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/certified-re-newed-phones/">Samsung</a>, refurb and sell almost as new, and those refurbished by third parties that come in various grades or conditions (see our guide below).</p> 
<p><strong>Do not buy:</strong></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p>any model older than 24-36 months old, because you’ll get only a few years of software support before you’ll have to replace it. Older Android phones get less than five years of support from when they were first released, not from when you bought them.</p></li> 
 <li><p>any phone without access to the Google Play Store and Google’s services, which are needed for most mainstream apps in the UK.</p></li> 
</ul>

    <p>Several third-party retailers offer refurbished phones, including the&nbsp;UK high street chains&nbsp;<a href="https://uk.webuy.com/search?categoryIds=979&amp;categoryName=Phones%20Android">CeX</a> and <a href="https://www.game.co.uk/en/tech/mobile-phones/refurbished-mobile-phones/">Game</a>&nbsp;and online stores such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.musicmagpie.co.uk/store/mobile-phones">musicMagpie</a> and <a href="https://www.envirofone.com/en-gb/buy/refurbished-mobile-phones/search">Envirofone</a>. Marketplaces like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=android&amp;rh=p_n_condition-type%3A13736824031">Amazon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/e/special-events/roe-shop-all/mobile-smart-phones/9355?rt=nc&amp;Operating%2520System=Android">eBay</a> and refurb specialist <a href="https://www.backmarket.co.uk/en-gb/l/android-smartphone/5a66c4f6-0b1e-4080-9728-63333498ebbb">Back Market</a> also have a wide range. And some phone operators, including <a href="https://www.o2.co.uk/shop/phones?os=Android&amp;cnd=like-new">O2</a>, <a href="https://www.giffgaff.com/mobile-phones/refurbished">giffgaff</a>, <a href="https://ee.co.uk/mobile/pay-monthly-phones-gallery/good-as-new-phones">EE</a> and <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/mobile/phones/pay-monthly-contracts/refurbished/samsung">Vodafone</a>, sell refurbished iPhones.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The condition of the phone is among the most important things to consider before parting with any cash. This is graded as follows:</p>
    <p><b>Grade A</b> – virtually identical to a new phone on the outside, usually with the original box and accessories. These are often customer returns rather than trade-ins and are the most expensive.</p>
    <p><b>Grade B</b> – in full working order but typically with light scratches, dents or nicks, and may come with original accessories.</p>
    <p><b>Grade C</b> – in full working order but visibly worn and typically sold without original accessories.</p>
    <p><b>Grade D</b> – also known as “for spares and repairs” or similar. These are broken devices sold for people to fix or gut for parts.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Once you’re satisfied with the condition of the phone, be sure to also size up the device’s:</p>
    <p><b>Battery health</b> – batteries wear out, typically only maintaining up to 80% of their original capacity after 500 full-charge cycles (about two to three years of nightly charging). Has it been replaced?</p>
    <p><b>Charging port</b> – check for signs of damage, as these are among the first parts to break.</p>
    <p><b>Buttons</b> – do they all work without pressing too hard? Broken buttons make phones difficult to use and can be expensive to fix.</p>
    <p><b>Fingerprint scanner</b> – is the fingerprint reader functioning as it should? Scratches or repairs can cause them to be faulty.</p>
    <p><b>Network locks</b> – check the phone works with the provider of your choice, as some are originally sold locked to certain networks and must be unlocked before being used on another.</p>
    <p><b>Unauthorised parts</b> – not all repairs are done by the manufacturer or using certified parts, which can affect performance.</p>
    <p><b>Check it isn’t stolen</b> – check the phone’s 15-digit IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number against a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/mar/04/mobilephones.ukcrime">database of stolen devices</a> through a service such as <a href="https://www.checkmend.com/uk/">CheckMEND</a> or similar.</p>
    <p><b>Warranty</b> – what kind of warranty does the retailer offer on its refurbished phones?</p>

<h2>How we selected</h2> 
<p>Flagship phones come at a premium, so you should expect the very best technology and performance throughout years of use. When I chose which phones to test, I considered:</p> 
<p><strong>Performance</strong> – a top-tier chip and snappy performance are essential to keep a phone fast throughout its useful life.</p> 
<p><strong>Software</strong> – should be up to date and come with a minimum of five years of Android updates from release, ideally longer.</p> 
<p><strong>Great displays</strong> – you should expect high-quality displays with high brightness for outdoor use, high pixel density to keep things crisp and high refresh rates to keep scrolling smooth.</p> 
<p><strong>Cameras</strong> – are the main battleground for the flagship phone manufacturers, so expect the best with multiple lenses and plenty of features.</p> 
<p><strong>Battery life</strong> – should stand up to hard use, at least lasting when used all day.</p> 
<p><strong>Build quality</strong> – top-tier phones aren’t cheap, so they should be made to last with high-quality, ideally recycled materials, scratch-resistant glass and proper water resistance.</p> 
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong> – accidents happen, and even the longest-lasting batteries do wear out, so phones should be repairable with real options for replacement batteries, screens and other parts.</p> 
<p><strong>* * *</strong></p>

    <p></p>
    <p>We combine real-world testing&nbsp;with various tools, such as benchmarking systems that perform standardised tasks.&nbsp;These help us evaluate a phone, measure its performance, confirm that it works as expected and&nbsp;compare it with its competition and predecessors.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We use the phones&nbsp;at different times and in various environments, from firing off emails on packed commuter trains to weekends spent shooting photos&nbsp;in national parks, and&nbsp;everything in between.&nbsp;We do everything a typical smartphone user would, such as messaging, browsing, using&nbsp;apps, listening to music, watching videos, playing games and navigating the real world. That gives us&nbsp;a good impression of how a smartphone handles the rigours of day-to-day life – plus, it shows us how long&nbsp;the battery lasts and the strength of&nbsp;its wireless performance.&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The findings from our general use of the phones&nbsp;are combined with the results from specific tests&nbsp;for things such as the camera zoom, video playback and charging, to inform the reviews and help us rank the devices.</p>

<h2>Why you should trust me</h2> 
<p>I’ve been reviewing consumer electronics for 18 years, with more than a decade spent as the Guardian’s gadget expert. In that time I’ve seen all manner of tech fads come and go, smartphone giants rise and fall, the cutting edge morph into the mainstream, and I have poked, prodded and evaluated more than 1,000 devices – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/21/motorola-moto-x-force-review-great-phone-screen-cant-break">sometimes to destruction</a>.</p>
