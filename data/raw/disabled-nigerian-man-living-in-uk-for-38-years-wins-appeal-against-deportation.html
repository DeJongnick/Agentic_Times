<p>A disabled Nigerian man who has lived in the UK for almost 40 years has won an appeal to stay in the country despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/may/19/home-office-in-threat-to-deport-disabled-man-to-nigeria-after-38-years-in-uk">the Home Office wanting to deport him</a>.</p> <p>Anthony Olubunmi George, 63, came to the UK at the age of 24 in 1986. He has not left the UK since and has no criminal convictions. He had two strokes in 2019 that left him with speech and mobility issues.</p> <p>George has endured periods of homelessness and says he has lost count of the number of friends who have given him shelter over the years. He says he no longer has any close family in Nigeria.</p> <p>“I don’t know how many different sofas I’ve slept on, too many to count,” he said.</p> <p>George had made various applications for leave to remain in the UK, which the Home Office rejected. He said he was overjoyed to finally have the fear of deportation lifted after the judge’s ruling.</p> <p>“I’m so happy I don’t know what to say,” he said. “My life has just begun again. Before I didn’t have hope, but now by God’s grace I can move forward with my life.”</p> <p>His previous solicitors submitted a forged entry stamp in his passport in 2005, and have subsequently been reported to the police and legal regulatory bodies.</p> <p>George said he knew nothing about the passport stamp until many years later. His current lawyer, Naga Kandiah of MTC Solicitors, cited his poor previous legal representation as the reason for George’s problems resolving his immigration status.</p> <p>A Home Office rejection of his case before his successful appeal states: “It’s open to your family and friends to visit you in Nigeria.”</p> <p>The immigration tribunal judge who granted George the right to remain in the UK referred in his ruling to the fact that the solicitor who submitted the fake passport stamp had been struck off. He said George had stopped going to see his GP because of fears about his immigration status.</p> <p>“It is unfortunate that the appellant went on to suffer two cardiovascular attacks having refrained from going for health checks,” the judge said, adding that George has been destitute while in the UK.</p> <p>Kandiah said: “My client has been living in limbo for almost 40 years, has suffered two strokes and has no family left in Nigeria. His situation is not just because of Home Office policies, but also because of poor representation by previous solicitors who failed to uphold professional integrity and ethical standards.</p> <p>“Despite our several applications to the Home Office to review the matter rather than proceeding to an oral hearing, our attempts were refused again and again by the Home Office and the case went to a full court hearing.</p> <p>“I am overjoyed with the decision. He has waited for it for almost four decades.”</p>
