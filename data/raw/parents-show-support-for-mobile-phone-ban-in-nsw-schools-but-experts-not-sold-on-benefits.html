<p>Parents have come out in support of a sweeping mobile phone ban in New South Wales public high schools, while cautioning that exceptions should be made for students with health problems and disabilities.</p> <p>But an expert says the ban will not improve academic results, calling for greater education about how children should manage their screen time.</p> <p>The newly elected NSW government on Monday announced that it would ban mobile phones in all public high schools during school hours.</p> <p>The ban, to be introduced in term four, was a longstanding election promise made by the NSW Labor leader and now premier, Chris Minns.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/22/every-parent-i-know-is-worried-about-their-childs-anxiety-heres-what-25-years-of-teaching-has-shown-me">Every parent I know is worried about their child’s anxiety.

It amassed more than 25,000 signatures.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/29/email-newsletters-guardian-australia-best-daily-news-emails-newsletter-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe-headlines?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>She chose to send her eldest daughter to an independent Sydney school when she started year seven this year, impressed by its strict phone policy.</p> <p>“It’s about recess and lunch – making sure they’re not just in groups of friends scrolling,” she said. “I thought – imagine if they were doing TikToks in the bathroom at lunch …</p> <p>“Kids are there to be learning.
