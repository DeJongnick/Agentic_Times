  <p>With that, we will shut the blog for the evening. Thanks for reading. <strong>Krishani Dhanji</strong> will be back with you first thing tomorrow for all the latest in the world of Australian politics.</p> 
  <p>Until then, here were today’s major developments:</p>

   <li><p><strong>Microsoft</strong> “deprived” Australian consumers of informed choice, the <strong>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)</strong> has alleged.

   <li><p>The <strong>Business Council of Australia</strong> has rejected <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>’s call to split the environment bill into separate pieces, saying the legislation should be passed as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/oct/27/epbc-environment-laws-ai-copyright-lobbying-transparency-federal-parliament-anthony-albanese-asean-sussan-ley-murray-watt-ntwnfb?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68feb6758f0857c13d1650fd#block-68feb6758f0857c13d1650fd">one “holistic” package</a> dealing with both pro-environmental and pro-business sections.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Taxpayers fork out $75m for embattled Spirit ferries</strong></p> 
  <p>Taxpayers will fork out $75m to help the beleaguered operator of two new Spirit of Tasmania ferries navigate ongoing financial issues, AAP reports.</p> 
  <p>It has also been revealed human error is to blame for $9m worth of upgrades needed for the vessels and their yet-to-be-completed berth in Tasmania.</p> 
  <p>The two replacement vessels are not expected to be in service until late 2026, years behind schedule, because a berth in Devonport was not built in time for their arrival. The saga, which caused one of the new ships to be kept in Scotland for months, has been dubbed one of the biggest infrastructure stuff-ups in Australia’s history.</p> 
  <p>Tasmania’s government on Monday announced it would give the ship’s state-owned operator TT-Line an injection of $75m in the November 2025-26 budget. The funds would deal with “medium-term” financial issues, the TT-Line chair, <strong>Ken Kanofski</strong>, told reporters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What we said is ‘we need a buffer’, we don’t want to run too close to the wind.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Labor opposition MP <strong>Dean Winter</strong> said Tasmanians were being forced to pay the price for incompetence. The state government has not ruled out giving TT-Line the remaining $25m of the company’s request if needed.</p>

  <p><strong>Coalition wants a ‘balanced outcome’ on environment protection reforms</strong></p> 
  <p>The shadow environment minister, <strong>Angie Bell</strong>, has told ABC’s Afternoon Briefing the Coalition will “look at everything that is on the table” when it assesses the federal government’s environment protection laws.</p> 
  <p>The Coalition wants to break reforms of the federal environment protection regime in two, prioritising measures to fast-track projects while probably further delaying protections for nature.</p> 
  <p>Asked if the Coalition would be satisfied with Labor doing a deal with the Greens if it can’t find a compromise, she said they had “only just received” extracts from the second part of the minister Murray Watt’s reforms.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Currently we’re going through those extra details. The first tranche of extracts that we received have a lot of moving parts. There’s a lot of uncertainty … but also there’s not much in there really about protecting the environment in detail.</p> 
   <p>We want to get a balanced outcome and that means we want protections for the environment but we want assurances … I have met with the minister’s office and the department now five times and we’ll continue that consultation as we go through the process. We want to make sure the bill is the best it can be.</p>

  <p><strong>Entain gambling acknowledges ‘certain deficiancies’ in old anti-money laundering system</strong></p> 
  <p>Gambling company <strong>Entain</strong> – which runs the <strong>Ladbrokes</strong> and <strong>Entain</strong> brands in Australia – has acknowledged its previous anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regime “missed the mark”.</p> 
  <p>Entain was taken to the federal court in December by Australia’s financial intelligence agency <strong>Austrac</strong>, which alleged the company accepted $152m in bets from 17 high-risk customers who had “suspected criminal profiles and associations”.</p> 
  <p>The company has now filed its defence in the case. While it acknowledges “there were certain deficiencies” in its operations, it disputes a number of allegations made by Austrac.</p> 
  <p>Entain Australia’s chief executive, <strong>Andrew Vouris</strong>, said in a separate statement the company “sincerely regrets that our old program didn’t meet expectations”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We followed expert advice at the time but, looking back, we recognise the old program missed the mark. We’ve acknowledged our shortcomings, taken responsibility, and spent the last two years learning from them and fixing them.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a statement, the company said it had significantly expanded its anti-money laundering unit and invested millions of dollars in new systems and technologies.</p> 
  <p>The company said it closed the betting accounts of all 17 high-risk customers “prior to legal proceedings” and in some cases “as far back as 2020”.</p>

  <p><strong>Government won’t say when it will respond to antisemitism and Islamophobia reports</strong></p> 
  <p>Aly was also asked about when the federal government would respond to two reports which have been handed down in recent months: one from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/10/antisemitism-plan-envoy-jillian-segal-australian-government-ntwnfb">antisemitism envoy</a>, and one from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/sep/12/islamophobia-report-envoy-aftab-malik-hands-down-recommendations-to-albanese-government">Islamophobia envoy</a>.</p> 
  <p>Both made a series of recommendations about how to address antisemitism and Islamophobia in Australian society, including reforms to education and the media, as well as detailing a significant rise in discrimination.</p> 
  <p>Aly said they were currently looking at both reports concurrently but neglected to answer whether a comprehensive response would be delivered by the end of the year.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I don’t want to put a timeframe on it. It’s an incredibly important piece of work and it’s important we get it right. The efforts that have been put into the reports deserve us to take our time and be thoughtful and comprehensive in our response.</p>

  <p><strong>Labor willing to negotiate with Greens or Liberals to get environmental reforms passed, Anne Aly says</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Anne Aly</strong>, the minister for multicultural affairs, international development and small business is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing as debate continues over environmental reforms, to be introduced to parliament this fortnight.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/coalition">Coalition</a> wants to break reforms of the federal environment protection regime in two, prioritising measures to fast-track projects while probably further delaying protections for nature. The Business Council wants the government to water down powers to block projects and for bipartisanship on the issue.</p> 
  <p>Asked if Labor was prepared to water down the bill to meet demands, she said “pretty much everyone” had an opinion on the legislation:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’re focused on getting the bill passed and getting the balance right between ensuring that our environment is protected but also that there is confidence for industry as well … these laws frankly are no longer fit for purpose. They are laws that were drafted back in the ‘90s. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On whether Labor would prefer to do a deal with the Coalition or the Greens – who want the reforms to go further – she said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There are two pathways to making a deal. One with the Greens and one with the Liberals. I believe that <strong>Murray Watt</strong> as the minister responsible has done a great job in negotiating thus far … We want to get it passed and as soon as possible. Through either of those avenues as long as it delivers what Australians want, what Australians need which is environmental protection and certainty to the industry.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Coalition senator <strong>Sarah Henderson</strong> will move a motion on Tuesday for the federal government to launch a senate inquiry into last month’s Optus triple zero outage.</p> 
  <p>An inquiry by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (Acma) is under way but Henderson said that was “woefully inadequate” and questions remained over when the federal government was informed about the breakdown.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to the Senate today, Henderson said there were still conflicting reports about whether three or four people died as a result of the outage.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is an essential service for all Australians. Every Australian needs to know that when they pick up the phone and dial triple zero they will get the help they need from the fire brigade, from the ambulance service or from the police …</p> 
   <p>We are also putting on the table the need to bring mobile phone roaming into this country so that if you don’t have a mobile connection or service from one carrier, particularly when you’re in a regional area, you can use another carrier’s tower.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Greens senator <strong>Sarah</strong> <strong>Hanson-Young</strong> is co-sponsoring the notice of motion to set up the inquiry alongside Coalition senators <strong>Dean Smith</strong> and <strong>Ross</strong> <strong>Cadell</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Vaginal ring contraceptive to be added to PBS on 1 November</strong></p> 
  <p>Hundreds of thousands of Australian women will have access to another affordable contraception option as a vaginal ring is added to the government’s medication subsidy scheme for the first time, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>The NuvaRing is a prescription contraceptive method which is inserted into the vagina by the user and distributes hormones to stop ovulation.</p> 
  <p>It can be used for three weeks in a row before being removed for a week, and a new one is then inserted. Used correctly, the ring is is 99.5% effective, which is similar to other hormonal contraceptive options.</p> 
  <p>The NuvaRing is available in a three-pack as a private script for $130. From 1 November, when it will be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), it will cost general patients $31.60 and concessional patients $7.70. From 1 January, the maximum women will pay per script will be $25.</p> 
  <p>Sexual Health Victoria medical director <strong>Sara Whitburn</strong> told AAP one of the biggest barriers to people choosing the NuvaRing has been cost, but it could be a good option for people who had stomach upsets from taking the pill.</p> 
  <p>Side effects of the ring are similar to the contraceptive pill, including acne, bloating, weight gain and reduced libido.</p> 
  <p>Health minister <strong>Mark Butler</strong> said women’s health needs had been sidelined for too long.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Australia has one of the lowest uptake rates in the developed world of long-acting contraceptives, partly due to access and affordability.</p>

  <p><strong>Musician Holly Rankin warns institutions have ‘failed to engage’ with young people</strong></p> 
  <p>Earlier today, <strong>Holly Rankin</strong> (also known by her stage name <strong>Jack River</strong>) who’s been pushing for protections for artists against AI, as well as engaging young people in politics, gave the Speaker’s lecture at Parliament House.</p> 
  <p>She warned institutions have “failed to engage” with young people, which has seen a new generation move “from institutions to individuals, from mastheads to personalities, from politicians to podcasts”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Young Australians aren’t disengaged from civic conversation. They’re just having it somewhere else.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The conflict, she said, is that the new “public square” where young people are getting their information, is controlled by a small handful of billionaires.</p> 
  <p>She says young people want to see humanity and authenticity in politicians, and urged them to meet young people where they’re at.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Where the town square once gathered people into one conversation, algorithms scatter them into thousands of bubbles, pushing and prodding us into attentional addiction.<strong> </strong>Each citizen lives inside a personalised poker machine – an individually engineered echo chamber that plays on our fears, hopes and insecurities ...</p> 
   <p>Young Australians are ready to engage in democracy. They’re building civic communities with or without institutional support. They value transparency, accountability, humanity, and truth – the same values that birthed democracy itself.</p>

  <p>The health minister, <strong>Mark Butler</strong>, announced major changes to the important scheme in August, including the $2bn Thriving Kids program that will result in children with mild to moderate levels of developmental delay and autism being diverted off the NDIS and onto state-ran support programs.</p> 
  <p>The Greens senator, <strong>Jordon Steele-John</strong>, joined the rally, telling the audience consecutive governments since the NDIS first began rolling out in 2016 had slowly undermined the scheme in an effort to improve its financial sustainability.</p> 
  <p>The senator urged the disability community to continue fighting to protect the scheme:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I know that so many of us wish that we never again would have to have these fights. The word ‘burnout’ flows throughout the community. I know that the road has been hard, and I know that the road still is to come ... I draw hope that we will endure together, that we will thrive together, that we will celebrate together, And that victory will be ours.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Craig Wallace</strong> from the <strong>Disabled People Against Cuts</strong> group said the NDIS “was a world leading social reform that offered choices ... it was structured around the way we live our lives, not our impairments”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There are problems with the NDIS ... but they are not problems caused by us. They are caused by the decisions of the people behind us in this building [Parliament House]. They are the problems with services, markets and providers and state governments pulling away, and yes, disability is expensive and that cost is borne by us and by families and by carers, and eventually, by the whole community.</p>

  <p><strong>New Bradfield MP Nicolette Boele asks about the critical minerals deal</strong></p> 
  <p>Back to the crossbench, new independent MP <strong>Nicolette Boele</strong> asks <strong>Richard Marles</strong> how much the Australian public will benefit financially from the critical minerals deal.</p> 
  <p>Over the weekend, we reported members of the crossbench are calling for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/25/mining-giants-must-pay-rent-tax-critical-minerals-cash-boom">mining rent tax</a> to guarantee taxpayers a “fair cut” of a potential critical minerals boom.</p> 
  <p>Marles says the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/20/albanese-at-the-white-house-trump-endorses-aukus-signs-85bn-rare-earths-deal-and-calls-pm-great-leader">$8.5bn deal</a> signed by <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> and <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is “genuinely in Australia’s national interest”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What we have faced globally is that while we have been engaging in the mining and extraction of critical minerals and rare earths, the processing of them – a sector that would involve significant employment and significant industrial development in this country – has proven much more difficult, given the structure of the global market. And that’s why we have put in place a number of measures, such as the Critical Minerals Production Tax Incentive, and the Critical Minerals Facility.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He doesn’t say whether there will be any tax on the revenue made by companies mining and producing critical minerals.</p>

  <p><strong>‘A lot of intelligent people here’</strong></p> 
  <p>There’s not much that unites the Labor and Coalition benches these days, but the unintentionally perfect timing of House Speaker <strong>Milton Dick</strong> was one of them just now.</p> 
  <p>Labor MP <strong>Josh Burns</strong> was ejected from Question Time after interjecting during a question from Liberal deputy <strong>Ted O’Brien</strong>. This is a real bugbear of Dick’s, who admittedly gives a fair bit of leeway during the QT interjections but gets unhappy when a question is interrupted.</p> 
  <p>“I don’t know why this is so difficult. When people are asking questions, don’t interject,” Dick called out in an angry voice.</p> 
  <p>“There’s a lot of intelligent people here ...,” he continued, letting that remark hang in the air for a moment – until nearly the entire chamber cracked into laughter.</p> 
  <p>O’Brien himself, at the dispatch box, put his hand to his forehead as if shielding his gaze from the sun, looking around in the chamber in mock confusion, mouthing: “where?”</p> 
  <p>Dick continued, amid the laughter: “Well, in the [public] gallery, there are.’</p>

  <p><strong>Andrew Wilkie calls for hospital funding fix, saying ‘people are suffering needlessly’ </strong></p> 
  <p>Back to the crossbench, Tasmanian independent MP <strong>Andrew Wilkie</strong> asks if the government will take action to fix hospital funding. He says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>People are suffering needlessly and far too often dying prematurely. Only the commonwealth has the financial and policy heft to turn things around.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Health minister <strong>Mark Butler</strong>, who’s been out spruiking the upcoming listing of contraceptives into the PBS and bulk-billing incentives for GPs, says it’s a “particularly weird week for the member to suggest this is not a government focused on bold reform”.</p> 
  <p>Wilkie stands up on a point of order and says the questions isn’t about bulk billing or urgent care clinics but about hospitals. Butler continues:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The member for Clark knows that the health and aged care system is an integrated ecosystem, and when bulk-billing is not working, when people are paying too much for their medicines, they don’t fill the scripts their doctors have said are important. They don’t go to the GP when they need to go to the GP, and the member for Clark knows that means they end up in hospital far more regularly than they should.</p>

  <p><strong>Nationals ask about possible closure of Gladstone power station</strong></p> 
  <p>Nationals MP <strong>Colin Boyce</strong> gets the next question, and takes a turn from prosecuting on action against the CFMEU.</p> 
  <p>He asks the minister for industry how many jobs will be lost with the possible closure of the Gladstone power station.</p> 
  <p><strong>Pat Conroy</strong> (the minister representing the industry minister who sits in the Senate), hesitates for a minute before answering. He starts off saying a question on energy should be directed to the minister for energy.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve been pretty clear that the energy sector is going through a transition as ageing coal-fired power stations close down. Unlike those opposite, we have plans in place to drive investment into the sector.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Deputy Nationals leader <strong>Kevin Hogan</strong> gets up to make a point of order on relevance, arguing his question was “tight” (and there’s been no potential job loss numbers disclosed so far). After a bit of back and forth, Conroy finishes his question and hands the baton to energy minister <strong>Chris Bowen</strong>.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There are about 200 direct employees at the Gladstone power station, and others have worked on a contract basis indirectly, and obviously that’s a significant number for the people of Gladstone.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Bowen then goes to the unreliability of coal-fired power.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Today, we had two units of the Callide power station which the honourable member would know well out, out and non-operating. And we have a total unplanned outage across the national energy system of 3.4 gigawatts of coal-fired power. Not planned, not maintenance, coal-fired power stations that were working and all of a sudden break down. It’s the biggest threat to the reliability of our energy system and that in turn is a threat to energy prices.</p>

  <p><strong>Sarah Henderson on AI copyright exemption being ruled out</strong></p> 
  <p>Liberal senator<strong> Sarah Henderson</strong>, who’s had a bone to pick with tech companies pushing for free use of creative material to train generative AI, is very happy with the government’s commitment not to create a text and data mining exemption.</p> 
  <p>The Victorian senator, who prosecuted tech firms and the Productivity Commission (who had discussed an exemption in its interim report) at a Senate hearing, tells Sky News an exemption would have “effectively legalised the theft of the work of creators”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The big tech companies were very happy to basically steal the work of Australian creatives and not pay them for it. There is a very sophisticated licensing scheme under our laws in this country. If any big tech company wants to use the work of any artist or writer or musician, they can pay for it. That’s the bottom line. And they were effectively trying to see a change in the law, which would mean that they could basically steal it. So we really raised a very big red flag.</p>

  <p>Creatives have said there needs to be better protections in place to stop their work being taken for free.</p> 
  <p>Earlier today, <strong>Michelle Rowland</strong> was asked on ABC radio whether works created by AI should be clearly labelled so under Australian copyright laws, but she wouldn’t say.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A number of people whom we have consulted with over the past few months have had a variety of views on that. And these are very valid. They’re obviously groups that have been intimately involved with licensing and with ensuring their own copyright protection. So we will let that run … We’ll ensure that there is proper consultation on that.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), <strong>Gina Cass-Gottlieb</strong>, has addressed the media in Sydney after the body declared it would take federal action against Microsoft over allegedly misleading around 2.7m Australians with Microsoft 365 subscriptions.</p> 
  <p>Gottlieb alleged that since 31 October last year, Microsoft told auto-renewing subscribers to the Microsoft 365 Personal and Family plans that they had only two options.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The first: in order to maintain their existing services, they must accept the Copilot integration and pay higher prices. The second: can cancel their subscription. We allege that this was misleading because, in fact, there was a third, hidden option, which allowed subscribers to continue their existing plan without Copilot and without any price increase.</p> 
   <p>Following a detailed investigation, the ACCC allege that Microsoft deliberately hid this third option to retain the old plan at the old price in order to increase the uptake of Copilot and the increased revenue from that Copilot-integrated plans.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said the price increase for a Personal plan was an annual increase from $109 to $159 annually, or 45%, and $139 to $179 for a Family plan, or 29%.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have taken these proceedings today because we allege millions of Australian consumers were deprived of the opportunity to make an informed choice about the subscription options available to them.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>More than 100 Australian consumers made complaints to the ACCC in late 2024 and early 2025, Gottlieb said, contributing to the investigation.</p>

  <p>The union has not endorsed the offer but says it agreed to do so “to determine whether the union can reach in-principle agreement with the government”. A spokesperson said:</p>

  <p>Tasmanian independent <strong>Andrew Wilkie</strong> says he’s sceptical about a reported intelligence briefing offered to the Coalition to bring them into the tent on the proposed changes to freedom of information (FoI) legislation.</p> 
  <p>The long-serving crossbencher said this morning it’s “really cynical politics”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>... One of the oldest tricks in the political book is to bring your political adversaries into the tent, share with them something that is, supposedly, highly sensitive and secret, and it’s intoxicating. This is just an old political trick to suggest that there is a security dimension and it is so sensitive it can’t be shared with the broader community. This is really cynical politics. This is not about national security.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Labor’s bill would place a fee on FoI requests and tighten rules around access to information. It would create time limits for each request, preventing FoI officers from spending more time to search for documents within scope.</p> 
  <p>But the proposal has so far failed to win the hearts and minds of the Coalition or the Greens – one of which the government will need to pass the bill in the upper house. For now at least, it looks to be stalled.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Business Council of Australia has rejected <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>’s call to split the EPBC bill into separate pieces, saying the legislation should be passed as one “holistic” package dealing with both pro-environmental and pro-business sections.</p> 
  <p>The BCA chief, <strong>Bran Black,</strong> said they want to see the bill passed as one package, even though they have some reservations about some of its components. He said splitting it up would actually harm business certainty.</p> 
  <p>“What we’ve always favoured, and what we continue to strongly favour, is a single, holistic approach to looking at these reforms,” Black told a Parliament House doorstop just now, saying he was keen to look at “supporting the interests of business, but also supporting the interests of the environment”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>At the end of the day, our view is that we need to deliver an outcome that has longevity, and that means getting the balance right. To get that balance right, everything needs to be on the table.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked why he wants the bill passed in one big bill, rather than split into smaller components, as Ley’s Coalition is seeking, Black said it would actually be better for business certainty to have one large package.</p> 
  <p>“That goes directly to the point about longevity. I think if you get a bill that is unbalanced, if it is too much in favour of business interests or too much in favour of environmental interests, then that just leads to more scope for changes to be made in the future,” he said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That undermines what business, frankly, is most looking for, and that is certainty. We want certainty and confidence in the settings now.</p> 
   <p>But I do stress, from a business perspective, we have concerns with respect to some aspects of the draft this point, and we want to see those concerns addressed.</p>

  <p>While the move to rule out an AI exception has been broadly welcomed by the media and arts sectors, the tech lobby group was more muted in its response to the announcement on Monday. A spokesperson said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The TCA looks forward to participating in the reference group in coming days to help develop a framework which we hope will deliver certainty for AI training as well as for artists and creators.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Staying on lobbying, <strong>Monique Ryan</strong> is introducing her bill to the House this morning. The bill would help to strengthen and enforce a code of conduct around lobbying, publish ministerial diaries to show who ministers are meeting with, and stop ministers from being able to move to the private sector in an industry where they’ve held a portfolio.</p> 
  <p>She says Australia’s laws and enforcement on lobbying are lagging behind other OECD nations such as the UK and Canada.</p> 
  <p>She argues the major parties complain about lobbyists when they’re in opposition, but then won’t crack down on reforms when they’re in government.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They’re [major parties] conflicted because they accept the personal and political gains served up by the lobbying [industry] …</p> 
   <p>In November 2023, the voluntary register included 703 third-party lobbyists, 40% of those were former politicians, ministerial advisers or public servants. They were profiting from their knowledge and the networks gained from their time spent here in their service to the public and funded by taxpayers.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Seconding her bill is fellow independent <strong>Kate Chaney</strong>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Part of integrity and accountability in politics is understanding who is influencing our top decision-makers. We should know which lobbyists have access to ministers and cabinet.</p>

  <p><strong>Independents urge more transparency around which lobbyists enter Parliament House</strong></p> 
  <p>As we mentioned earlier this morning, the crossbench is proactively disclosing which lobbyist passes they sponsor to enter Parliament House as part of an initiative by ACT senator <strong>David Pocock</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The independents rallied at Parliament House earlier this morning to urge major party politicians to be transparent about their interactions and make public who they let into Canberra’s halls of power.</p> 
  <p>Pocock said he had been advocating for changes to lobbying pass disclosure rules for years but decided to take the issue into his own hands and create his own register. The senator said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Lobbyists play an important part in our democracy, but the base level expectation should be that there is transparency around that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>So far, around 13 crossbenchers, including a One Nation senator, have disclosed how many passes they sponsor, and to who. The register has the names of 78 passholders.</p> 
  <p>No MPs from Labor, the Liberals, the Nationals or the Greens have yet to add their details to Pocock’s register.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Scientists call for action on deforestation, as government negotiates on EPBC reforms</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>More than 100 scientists and researchers have urged <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> to tackle widespread deforestation that is driving an extinction crisis across the country when the government introduces legislation to revamp environment laws this week.</p> 
  <p>The environment minister, <strong>Murray Watt</strong>, wants to get the long-promised reforms to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act passed before Christmas but is facing a backlash from the Coalition and the Greens, who have both been critical of the changes.</p> 
  <p>In an <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.au/submission/close-deforestation-loopholes-in-the-epbc-act/">open letter</a>, coordinated by Greenpeace Australia Pacific, sent to Albanese and Watt, the scientists said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Without meaningful reform, deforestation will continue to drive massive biodiversity loss.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Vast amounts of habitat are bulldozed each year with clearing for livestock and pasture a major culprit, but much of it happens outside the environment laws. The letter points to a loophole in the laws known as “continuous use” that allows landholders to keep clearing areas without the need to get an environmental approval.</p> 
  <p>Prof <strong>James Watson</strong>, a leading conservation scientist from the University of Queensland, said: “The large-scale destruction of Australia’s native woodlands, forests, wetlands and grasslands is the single biggest threat to our biodiversity.”</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted">

 <h2 class="block-title">Microsoft ‘deliberately omitted’ AI-free option in 365 price rises, ACCC alleges</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Australian consumer watchdog has alleged Microsoft deliberately omitted an AI-free subscription option for Microsoft 365 in communications to 2.7 million Australians when it advised them of price increases as a result of Copilot being integrated into the software package.</p> 
  <p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has launched federal court action against Microsoft claiming the company has misled subscribers to Microsoft 365 personal and family plans with auto-renew enabled that if they want to maintain their subscription they must accept the integration of Copilot AI into the software and pay higher prices, or cancel their subscription.</p> 
  <p>The annual subscription price of the Microsoft 365 Personal plan increased by 45% from $109 to $159 with Copilot included. The annual subscription price for the Microsoft 365 Family plan increased by 29% from $139 to $179.</p> 
  <p>The regulator alleged this information was false or misleading as there was an undisclosed third option of “classic” plans which allowed subscribers to retain the features of existing plans without Copilot at the previous lower price.</p> 
  <p>Consumers were only presented this option when subscribers began cancelling their subscription, the ACCC alleges.</p>

  <p><strong>Monique Ryan pushes for code of conduct for lobbyists</strong></p> 
  <p>Independent MP <strong>Monique Ryan</strong> will introduce a bill today to stop bureaucrats and politicians working as lobbyists as soon as they leave politics.</p> 
  <p>Parliament will start sitting at 10am today and Mondays are always allocated to private members’ bills (which also means the government has carved out some time for debate on <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong>’s repeal net zero bill because it’s politically convenient for Labor).</p> 
  <p>Ryan told RN Breakfast this morning her bill will introduce a code of conduct for lobbyists, will strengthen the lobbying code, publish ministerial diaries so the public can see who ministers are meeting with, and stop ministers and public servants going to work for lobbyists.</p> 
  <p>She namechecks the former Liberal defence minister <strong>Christopher Pyne</strong> going to work as a lobbyist in the defence industry within “nine days of leaving parliament” as well as former foreign affairs minister <strong>Julie Bishop</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Ryan says under the current framework, ministers can’t work in an industry where they’ve had a field of interest for 12 months, “but it’s unenforced”. She says it’s the same with the lobbying code of conduct, and movement of public servants into industries where they’ve had decision-making powers “within weeks or months of leaving government” – both are unenforced.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The potential for conflict of interest in decision-making and for people using the context that they’ve made while they’re in parliament to further their own careers in a way that gives them a commercial advantage, if you like, or for decisions to be made before they leave government with the expectation that there’s some sort of golden handshake after they leave government is corrosive of people’s trust in the integrity and transparency of government.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The environment minister, <strong>Murray Watt,</strong> claims <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>’s reluctance to support the EPBC laws is about her “desperately trying to shore up her leadership” as the Coalition once again ties itself in knots over net zero and climate policy.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to reporters in Parliament House this morning, he says he’s open to making a deal with either the Greens or the Coalition, flatly rejecting Ley’s request to split up the environment bill into various chunks to be voted on separately.</p> 
  <p>Watt says the government has shared “about 70%” of the complex environmental law changes with the Coalition and Greens, and that nearly all of it would be shown to them ahead of it being introduced into parliament. Ley, as we brought you earlier, wrote to Watt asking for some of the more contentious changes to be put into a separate bill – Watt called that idea “mad” and “silly”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s because she’s desperately trying to shore up her leadership ahead of some very difficult net zero conversations with her party room. This week, Sussan Ley is in danger of putting her own leadership ahead of the environment and ahead of business.</p> 
   <p>We can’t split the bill. We need to do both, and we need to get on with it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Watt said the bill would be introduced this week and says he still hopes to have it passed by year’s end – with just three sitting weeks left, including this one. Watt says the debate has been going for five years and the changes are overdue, when asked about the timeline.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have been consulting to death on these reforms, and both business and environment groups are crying out for reform to finally be delivered.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked what would be his optimal pathway through parliament, whether he was hoping for the support of the Coalition or the Greens, the minister said he was open.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I can’t make that any clearer. I’ve met the same number of times with the Coalition and the Greens. I’ve spoken as recently as yesterday with representatives from those parties. What we’re about is passing a bill that is good for the environment and good for business, and it’s up to the Coalition and the Greens to decide, are they prepared to do that, or are they going to go into their corners and fight for a bill that only delivers to the environment or only delivers to business?</p>

  <p>Staying with <strong>Angie Bell</strong>, there’s a big question mark over whether the Liberal party and the National party will keep a commitment to the net zero by 2050 target.</p> 
  <p>Today Nationals senator (and net-zero sceptic) <strong>Matt Canavan</strong> will present his review of the 2050 target to his party room.</p> 
  <p>Bell remains tight-lipped on whether the targets will remain in place – or be ditched altogether.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The National party is undertaking their own review process, as is the Liberal party, and we’ll continue to work through those processes because what Sussan Ley has said is she wants to see affordable and reliable energy for Australians. But we also need to play our role in emissions reduction. And so that is why the Coalition is reviewing our energy policy.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Energy is a huge sticking point for the Coalition – and was one of the reasons why the Nationals and Liberals temporarily split after the election with the Nats wanting stronger guarantees to commit to nuclear power for Australia.</p> 
  <p>Bell says there will be more party meetings this week – including a “long one” on Friday with the backbench – to discuss where they’ll land on energy policy. The shadow energy minister, <strong>Dan Tehan</strong>, has been leading a small committee to put a position to his party.</p>

  <p><strong>To split or not to split?</strong></p> 
  <p>No I’m not talking about the Coalition … but the bill we’ve been covering all morning, the EPBC Act.</p> 
  <p>The government has flat out rejected the Coalition’s call to split the environment reforms to streamline approvals, and legislate environmental protections separately.</p> 
  <p>The shadow environment minister, <strong>Angie Bell,</strong> says she expected the rejection, because for Labor, “it’s their way or the highway”, she tells RN Breakfast.</p> 
  <p>Bell says the Coalition has only seen 50-70% of the draft legislation, and from what they’ve seen so far there’s not much they seem to really like. Bell says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think some of the things around regional planning certainly have merit, but we’ll work through all of the detail when it lands because we really only have some of the bill, and the minister has said he will introduce it this week into the parliament… <strong>But at this point in time, this bill is not workable.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Bell says <strong>Graeme Samuel</strong>’s review was a “very large undertaking” and says the government has cherrypicked some of his recommendations.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The minister has put in some of Graeme Samuel’s recommendations and others that he hasn’t. For example, the premise of Graeme Samuel review was that there be a commission for the environment, and instead, what’s happened is the minister has put out there an EPA, an environmental protection agency, which was a promise by the prime minister at the election before the last one. And so there are some things that are straight out of the Samuel review playbook, and there are elements in there of uncertainty … And also, very, very high penalties that were higher than <strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong>’s natural positive laws.</p>

  <p><strong>Watt says environment laws will remove duplicate approval process between state and federal governments</strong></p> 
  <p>The environment minister, <strong>Murray Watt,</strong> will no doubt have a tough job over the next few weeks to get his EPBC Act 2.0 over the line (never forget <strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong>’s first attempt last parliament).</p> 
  <p>Over on ABC News Breakfast, he explains the independent powers the bill will create to enforce the environment laws, and why the bill will remove the duplicate approval process between state and federal governments.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What we want to do is work with the state so that at least the assessments can be done by a state government on behalf of both the state and federal government, potentially saving months or years in an approval process.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Watt is asked about rules around projects that have an “unacceptable environmental impact” which could be accepted or rejected quickly.</p> 
  <p>The minister gives us a few rather extreme examples of what an unacceptable impact looks like – but there’s not much clarity on where exactly the threshold would be.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If a property developer wanted to build a development in the middle of an internationally listed wetland, that’s almost certainly going to get a no at the end of a process, and we might as well put everyone out of their misery early and give them a quick no …</p> 
   <p>If a mining company wanted to go and mine under Uluru, and perish the thought they would ever want to do that, but clearly that kind of thing is going to be unacceptable because of the environmental damage that it would cause. So they’re the kind of things that we’re seeking to try to stop and stop early in the process.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Vaginal contraceptive ring to be listed on PBS</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A contraceptive vaginal ring will be listed on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for the first time this Saturday.</p> 
  <p>The Albanese government announced the new listing on Sunday night. It will come into effect on 1 November, alongside cheaper long-active contraceptives like IUDs and birth control implants.</p> 
  <p>NuvaRing, which is used on a monthly cycle, is an alternative to daily oral contraceptives.</p> 
  <p>Before the listing women could pay more than $270 a year for the ring which would be reduced to $31.60 per script (for three months of contraception) under the PBS, the government said. Concession card holders would pay $7.70 per script. From 1 January the maximum women will pay per script is $25.</p> 
  <p><strong>Daile Kelleher</strong>, chief executive of Sexual and Reproductive Health Australia, said contraception was “essential healthcare, not a luxury item”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Everyone deserves the right to access affordable contraceptive options and to choose the method that best fits their life, without barriers such as cost.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The women’s minister,<strong> Katy Gallagher, </strong>said the changes would give women “genuine choice” for their reproductive health and ensure their decisions were not limited by cost.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> says he will sit with the Nationals in the parliament this week but won’t attend party room meetings, and didn’t shut down the idea that he could stay with his party if they dumped their net zero target.</p> 
  <p>Joyce’s latest headlines, the prospect that he would join One Nation, haven’t come to fruition yet, he says – he told us in a Parliament House doorstop just now that he hasn’t joined another political party yet, and says he’ll sit with the Nats in question time today. Joyce ruled out sitting as an independent, and says “I’m still in the National party”, and noting voters had voted him in as a National, so he’d sit as a National for the time being.</p> 
  <p>But it’s not plain sailing and happy families. Joyce repeated his previous statements that “there’s been a breakdown in the relationship, it was quite evident to all of you during the [election] campaign”.</p> 
  <p>Asked whether leader <strong>David Littleproud</strong> was trying to keep him in the team, Joyce said he’d spoken to Littleproud in a “brief and very courteous conversation that went for about three minutes”.</p> 
  <p>Joyce confirmed again that he’d quit as MP for New England at the next election, but when we asked if he’d continue his political career after that (perhaps in a different chamber of parliament, or for a different party), he said “I’ll make my mind up”.</p> 
  <p>Asked if the Nationals scrapping net zero could be enough to keep him in the tent, Joyce responded: “I’ll see what they come up with.”</p> 
  <p>Pressed further, Joyce said they were “hypotheticals” about what could happen in future.</p>

  <p><strong>Rowland: no text and data mining exemption</strong></p> 
  <p>There’s a few big issues kicking around this morning, and one is the confirmation from the government that tech giants will not get a text and data mining exemption to train their AI models.</p> 
  <p>Artists and creatives – and media organisations – have been hounding the government for some security around their works, to ensure they’re not scraped for free by generative AI.</p> 
  <p>There was particularly anxiety around a recommendation by the productivity commission that tech giants get free access to creative works.</p> 
  <p>The attorney general, <strong>Michelle Rowland,</strong> says the government has been “clear” that there would be no watering down of the Copyright Act.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is a body of work to do around what the copyright environment looks like in the AI world, but we are making it very clear that we will not be entertaining a text and data mining exception.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>ABC host <strong>Sabra Lane</strong> asks Rowland how authors who don’t want their books taken “full stop” can stop tech companies from using their creative works. Rowland says there’s some uncertainty around whether the current laws fully address that.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Currently, under the Copyright Act, there are avenues to be able to do that, but there is a lot of conjecture around whether or not the law is clear enough on that front … We will go forward as a government with an ambitious set of reforms, again, with the outcome of making sure that our copyright laws are fit for not only the digital environment as they have been to date, but also in the world of AI.</p>

   <p>We won’t be splitting the bill. The review by <strong>Graeme Samuel</strong> into these 90s-era laws made clear you cannot have faster approvals without stronger environmental standards …</p>

  <p>Good morning, <strong>Krishani Dhanji</strong> here with you for what will be another action-packed sitting fortnight.</p>

  <p>The Coalition is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/27/coalition-pushes-to-break-up-environment-bill-as-fight-over-new-nature-laws-heads-to-parliament">calling for it to be split</a> and says it’s anti-business, while the Greens say the opposite. <strong>Murray Watt</strong> called the suggestion of a split the “maddest idea” he’s seen in the five years since the reforms to the act were first recommended.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, the government will also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/27/labor-rules-out-giving-tech-giants-free-rein-to-mine-copyright-content-to-train-ai">reject a proposal to allow copyright exemptions for AI models</a>. And the prime minister is overseas this week in Malaysia and South Korea for the Asean and Apec summits.</p>
