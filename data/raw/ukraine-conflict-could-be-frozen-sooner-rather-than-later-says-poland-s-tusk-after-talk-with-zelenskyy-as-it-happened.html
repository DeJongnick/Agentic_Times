Many vessels are unseaworthy and prone to engine failure, leaving migrants stranded or forced to swim. French authorities respond quickly, often with Frontex support. But boats that remain afloat continue toward the UK. The average number of people per boat has risen to nearly 60, with some carrying almost 100.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Frontex said <strong>the number of people who entered the bloc through an irregular route fell to 95,200 from January to August</strong> with the majority of primary routes, including those across the Mediterranean and those to the Canary Islands from West Africa and into eastern Europe through the western Balkans, seeing lower numbers.</p> <p>However it said <strong>“pressure remains high across all three Mediterranean routes.”</strong></p> <p>Crossings on the east of the Mediterranean into Greece were down by 16% to 26,200. However a new migratory route from Libya into Crete, denounced by the Greek prime minister last month, had emerged in recent months with around 10,000 crossings so far this year.</p> <p>The route, which in recent years has generated most heated political reaction, from Tunisia into Italy, recorded 36,700 crossings an increase of 9% on 2024.
