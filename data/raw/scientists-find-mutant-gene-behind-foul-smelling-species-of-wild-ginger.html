<p>With a smell of rotting flesh the flowers of certain species of wild ginger are unlikely to be used in a wedding bouquet – although they are irresistible to carrion-loving flies. Now researchers say they have worked out how the sulphurous scent is produced.</p> <p>Scientists say the odour is down to small changes in an enzyme that prevents bad breath in humans.</p> <p>“Some organisms have an extraordinary trait which is seemingly difficult to evolve, but such characteristics can evolve in a simpler manner than one would imagine,” said Dr Yudai Okuyama, the first author of <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8988">the research</a> from the National Museum of Nature and Science in Japan.</p> <p>Writing in the journal Science, Okuyama and colleagues reported how they first investigated the origins of a key chemical known to be behind the sulfurous smell produced by some species of <em>Asarum</em>, or wild ginger.</p> <p>This chemical, called dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), is thought to be produced from a substance called methanethiol. Methanethiol is known to cause bad breath in humans and is formed in plants and animals as the amino acid methionine is broken down.</p> <p>The researchers confirmed this by feeding a form of methionine labelled with carbon-13 atoms to a species of wild ginger, <em>A. fudsinoi</em>, and found the DMDS released also contained carbon-13.</p> <p>The team then looked at an array of different species of <em>Asarum</em> to identify genes whose activity varied with the amount of DMDS produced.</p> <p>The work led to the identification of a gene that gives rise to a selenium-binding protein. Such proteins are found across the plant and animal kingdom, and typically convert methanethiol into less harmful substances. In humans this mechanism prevents halitosis.</p> <p>The researchers found the “normal” version of this gene was present in all of the plants and animals they considered, including the various species of <em>Asarum</em>. However, they found the latter also had a mutant form of the gene that produces a protein that turns methanethiol into DMDS. This mutant gene is more active in foul-smelling species.</p> <p>The team said the change in function appeared to be down to a small number of mutations in the gene, with only two or three changes in the amino acids of the protein needed for the shift to occur.</p> <p>Further work showed <em>Eurya</em> and <em>Symplocarpus</em> plants also have selenium-binding proteins that can turn methanethiol into DMDS, explaining why some species smell bad, with the team noting they appeared to have evolved independently.</p> <p>However, not all foul-smelling plants produce their scent in the same way: the team found species of <em>Amorphophallus</em> – a group that includes a plant known as the “corpse flower” – did not have a selenium-binding protein that converts methanethiol into DMDS.</p> <p>“We think some similar enzyme that belong[s] to a different protein family might be responsible for the step,” said Okuyama.</p>
