<p>A US district judge has blocked the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure.</p> <p>Seattle-based judge Tana Lin, who was appointed to the bench by Joe Biden in 2021, granted a partial injunction to the states that filed suit against Trump’s Department of Transportation.</p> <p>She ruled that the states’ lawsuit – led by attorneys general in California, Colorado and Washington – would likely succeed. Her ruling did not apply to the District of Columbia, Minnesota and Vermont, which she found did not provide evidence that they would suffer immediate harm. The injunction will go into effect on 1 July, unless the Trump administration files an appeal blocking it.</p> <p>In February, the Trump administration ordered states not to spend $5bn in funds allocated under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration">Biden administration</a> as part of the national electric vehicle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/infrastructure">infrastructure</a> (Nevi) program.</p> <p>The program provided up to 80% of eligible project costs to deploy electric vehicle charges. Currently, 16 states have at least one operational EV station, <a href="https://evstates.org/awards-dashboard/">according to</a> EV States Clearinghouse.</p> <p>“The new leadership of the Department of Transportation … has decided to review the policies underlying the implementation of the Nevi formula program,” Emily Biondi, associate administrator for planning, environment and realty at the transportation department’s Federal Highway Administration, wrote in a memo.</p> <p>“As result of the rescission of the Nevi formula program guidance, the FHWA is also immediately suspending the approval of all state electric vehicle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/infrastructure">infrastructure</a> deployment plans for all fiscal years. Therefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the Nevi formula program until the updated final Nevi formula program guidance is issued and new state plans are submitted and approved,” she added.</p> <p>In May, the Government Accountability Office found that the Trump administration violated the law when it withheld the funding. The administration “must continue to carry out the statutory requirements of the program”, it said.</p> <p>The White House challenged those findings, which it called “wrong and legally indefensible”, and ordered the transportation department to ignore them. The department is expected to release a draft of its updated electric vehicle guidance this month.</p> <p>During a hearing before the Seattle judge earlier this month, Leah Brown, of Washington’s attorney general’s office said, “This passing reference to revised guidance and to changed priorities is simply insufficient to override congressional intent.” She added that the states aren’t “challenging the ability to revise guidance, but we are arguing that doing so simply is not a sufficient explanation for the actions that they’ve taken,” the Washington State Standard <a href="https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/06/17/seattle-judge-considers-reversing-trumps-ev-charger-funding-freeze/">reported</a>.</p> <p>“The agency has no intent to withhold funds from the states,” justice department attorney Heidy Gonzalez said. “It just wants the opportunity to review past guidance and to promulgate guidance that comports with the current administration’s policies and priorities.”</p> <p>During his campaign for the presidency, Donald Trump voiced a hatred for electric vehicles that ran counter to his growing friendship with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</p> <p>At one point in the campaign, Trump said supporters of the vehicles should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/elon-musk-transformation-trump-climate">“rot in hell”</a> and that Biden’s support of EVs would bring a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/trump-endorses-electric-vehicles-elon-musk">“bloodbath”</a> to the US’s automotive industry.</p> <p>Although he later appointed Musk to serve as head of the “department of government efficiency”, Musk and Trump have since parted ways.</p>
