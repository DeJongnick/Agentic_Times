<p>Netball Australia has pledged to be debt free by 2027 thanks to the financial uplift from hosting that year’s World Cup, as it sets out a 10-year plan to ensure it remains the country’s most popular team sport for women and girls amid increasing competition from football.</p> <p>The organisation reported a surplus of $0.65m for 2024 – up from $0.26m in 2023, and its highest since 2012 – and long-term debt of $3m, a decrease of $1.2m on the previous year.</p> <p>Netball Australia chief executive officer Stacey West said the result was due to strong attendances for Diamonds matches and Super Netball, which attracted more spectators in a single season than any previous Australian women’s competition and “showed why it is the world’s biggest and best netball league”.</p> <p>In total, 366,222 attended matches last year, an increase of 25% on 2023. “Suncorp Super Netball also attracted the highest average crowd in Australian women’s sport, with an average of 6,097 fans attending each match – up from 5,069 in 2023,” West said.</p> <p>This month’s Super Netball round one attendances were up 8% on 2024. Ticket sales for Diamonds events grew 50%, partly thanks to larger venues.</p> <p>The annual report stated Netball Australia’s debt was on track to be cleared by 2027 and the organisation was working on a long-term strategy for the sport. “We are near completion in developing a 10-year strategy to ensure that growth continues which will drive successful commercial outcomes,’’ West said.</p> <p>The plan, due to be formally released this year, “is focused on optimising growth and engagement at every level”, according to the annual report. According to the national AusPlay survey, netball had around 400,000 female participants in 2024. It was the most popular team sport for women ahead of basketball (291,000 participants) and football (251,000).</p> <p>At this week’s AGM, former Diamond Liz Ellis was reappointed chair of Netball Australia for her second year, providing stability <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/13/netball-australia-pay-dispute-ends-revenue-sharing-deal-details">after the pay dispute and leadership changes of 2023</a>.</p> <p>The right to host the 2027 World Cup was secured in 2021. “Hosting the 2027 Netball World Cup in Australia presents the sport with a huge opportunity for new generations of fans to fall in love with the game,” West said.</p> <p>In addition to the 2027 World Cup in Sydney, Netball Australia sees the sport’s inclusion in the 2026 Commonwealth Games as an opportunity for growth.</p> <p>The sport has also been lobbying for a place in the Olympics program in time for the 2032 Brisbane Games. However, one of the world’s most popular women’s sports may be denied due to the IOC’s criteria around gender parity – in this case, participation among men.</p> <p>World Netball’s website states “over 20 million” people play netball in more than 117 countries. For comparison, Fifa has a goal of 60 million female players by 2027. A 2023 survey found there were 16.6m women and girls playing organised football.</p>
