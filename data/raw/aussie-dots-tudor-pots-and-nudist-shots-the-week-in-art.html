Peruvian artist Santiago Yahuarcani creates his works by applying paint prepared from pigments, seeds, leaves and roots, to large sheets of <em>llanchama</em><em>,</em> a cloth made from the bark of the <em>ojé</em> tree. His works are often inspired by the hallucinations brought on by the ritual ingestion of tobacco, coca, ayahuasca and mushrooms – substances long used by the Indigenous peoples of the Amazon when in search of help, knowledge or revelation. His show, The Beginning of Knowledge is at the Whitworth, Manchester, as part of Manchester International festival. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/30/santiago-yahuarcani-peruvian-painter-genocide-amazon-whitworth">Read our interview with him here</a>.</p> <h2>What we learned</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/28/mr-doodle-sam-cox-psychosis-mental-health-interview">Sam Cox AKA Mr Doodle is the million-dollar artist who almost lost himself to his alter ego</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/02/sculptors-behind-football-statues-players-fans">Not all statues of footballers are as terrible as the infamous Ronaldo bust</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/30/schoolclass-jenny-saville-portraits">Jenny Saville’s raw, visceral portraits are inspiring a fresh generation of schoolkids</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/02/indigenous-art-uk-tate-modern-camden-arts-centre-fruitmarket-edinburgh">Indigenous art from around the world is sweeping galleries across the UK</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/02/parque-prado-multi-storey-car-park-garden-paradise-colombia">A once derelict district of Medellín, Colombia has has been rebuilt as a green haven</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/03/creative-australia-apologises-to-khaled-sabsabi-for-hurt-and-pain-after-venice-biennale-reinstatement-ntwnfb">Khaled Sabsabi will show at Venice Biennale after controversial sacking was rescinded</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2> <p><strong>An Allegory, by an anonymous Florentine artist, about 1500</strong></p>    <p>This painting celebrates childbirth and motherhood, but subversively. Mothers were often depicted as the Virgin Mary nursing Christ in medieval and Renaissance art. It was a form of religious manipulation, associating a typical female experience of the age with piety and love of Christ. This woman however lies powerfully and calmly in a meadow while her babies play around her. It is a pagan scene, shorn of Christian symbols. In a pose apparently inspired by <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/sandro-botticelli-venus-and-mars">Botticelli’s Venus and Mars</a>, a strong, even divine maternal figure, who resembles Venus, holds sway over the onlooker.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/italian-florentine-an-allegory">National Gallery</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in Touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
