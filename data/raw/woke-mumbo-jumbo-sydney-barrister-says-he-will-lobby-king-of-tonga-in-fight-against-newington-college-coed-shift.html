<p>A Sydney barrister and Newington college old boy leading the fight against the private school’s coed shift has sent an impassioned email to alumni, detailing his plans to fly to Tonga this week to lobby King Tupou VI on the issue.</p> <p>In his email, Dallas Morgan also lamented that “transgender midgets” could have their fees subsidised and said he hoped the king – whose father was also a fellow former student of the school – would oppose the coed transition.</p> <p>In November, the Newington college council announced the school would begin the transition to becoming coeducational, starting with the introduction of girls into kindergarten and year 5 in 2026, and years 7 and 11 in 2028, with the college fully coeducational by 2033. The school charges up to $42,000 a year.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/11/newington-college-co-education-change-anger-details">Does single-sex education really provide better outcomes for students?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The decision prompted furious opposition from some parents and alumni, including Morgan, who wrote to a select group of alumni on Wednesday “to update the embarrassing saga of old boys wanting a voice against the evil empire of woke mumbo jumbo”.</p> <p>In the email, seen by Guardian Australia, Morgan wrote: “I am flying to Tonga on Saturday, nothing is clear, but I am working on meeting with the King of Tonga to explain we are fighting for a tradition in which they are important.”</p> <p>Newington’s brother school, Tupou college, is in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/tonga">Tonga</a>.</p> <p>“It’s hard to keep fighting but myself and a lot of people on this link have worked very hard to fight against the bullshit that is destroying a school we love,” Morgan wrote.</p>    <p>In the email, Morgan also encourages the recipients to “never give up” and to oppose the school’s “strategic direction”.</p> <p>“We will need to show like at the SGM the silent majority disagree with the ‘Strategic Direction’ aka ‘transgender midgets get free schooling paid for by hard working normal people’. What a joke.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Morgan is a representative of the Save Newington Group and has spoken publicly against the school’s decision to begin admitting girls. He was also among a group of parents and alumni who rallied outside the school in Stanmore in Sydney’s inner-west in January.</p> <p>Guardian Australia sent detailed questions to Morgan and called his chambers but did not receive a response. Two people who received Morgan’s email said he had recalled it on Thursday afternoon, after he was contacted by Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Morgan’s mention of “the SGM” appears to be a reference to the special general meeting that the school’s alumni network, the Old Newingtonians’ Union, held in March.</p> <p>Nearly 800 former students attended the SGM and opponents of the coed move successfully passed all five resolutions put to the meeting, including votes of no confidence in the headteacher and spilling the leadership of the ONU’s council.</p> <p>At the time, the Save Newington College group said a “caretaker” ONU council, made up of the past ONU presidents, was agreed to. The caretaker council would facilitate an ONU council election “in approximately 4 weeks’ time”.</p> <p>There has been a subsequent dispute among alumni over whether the council representatives should self-nominate to fill the vacancies or whether they should be chosen through a more formal election.</p>    <p>Morgan is among a group of plaintiffs who launched a challenge in the New South Wales supreme court against other members of the ONU to try to ensure an election was held.</p> <p>A directions hearing in the matter was held on Monday. In the email he sent on Wednesday, Morgan said the case would be deferred “until a proper election is held”.</p> <p>The ONU leadership council is separate from the Newington’s college council, which was responsible for the decision to make the school coed.</p> <p>Seven alumni are on the college council, according to the school’s website. The ONU has the right to appoint six members of the college council.</p> <h2>‘We don’t want it at Newington’</h2> <p>A Newington alumnus, Kerry Trollope, told Guardian Australia he was “vehemently opposed” to the school becoming coed.</p> <p>“We are not against coed. We love coed. But we don’t want it at Newington,” he said.</p> <p>“We’re part of a group that is fighting really hard to try to reverse the decision … in my heart of hearts I think it’s not going to work, but I’ll fight tooth and nail to the end.”</p> <p>Trollope described Morgan as “dedicated and a lovely man” who was “frustrated”. He suggested he shouldn’t be judged for having made “possibly maybe one little mistake” in the email he sent on Wednesday.</p> <p>Stephen Lake, another Newington old boy, said he and the people he knew had voted for the resolutions at the ONU meeting in March because they were concerned about the way the college council had gone about the coed decision.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/07/sydney-boys-school-protest-gender-equality">If it’s ‘catastrophic’ for a boys’ school to go coed, I fear for the future of gen Z | Elle Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lake said he had no issue with Newington’s headteacher but the school needed to be more transparent.</p> <p>The old boy Peter Thomas said coed and single-sex schools were “both great” but the Newington business model “works very well”.</p> <p>“I think it’s madness to change it,” he said. “If you walked into a McDonald’s hamburger restaurant and they started serving you seafood, you’d be very confused if you were a customer.”</p> <p>Others have spoken in support of the shift. Tim Richter, a former student whose son is enrolled in the school, told Guardian Australia in March he was pleased his son would have the opportunity to learn alongside girls, something he said he thought would have “really benefited” him and his classmates.</p>
