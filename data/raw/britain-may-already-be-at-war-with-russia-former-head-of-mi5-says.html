<p>Britain may already be at war with Russia because of the depth and intensity of cyber-attacks, sabotage and other hostile activity orchestrated by Moscow against the UK, according to a former head of MI5.</p> 
<p>Eliza Manningham-Buller, who led the domestic spy agency two decades ago, said she agreed with comments made by the Russia expert Fiona Hill, who argued <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/06/russia-is-at-war-with-uk-and-us-no-longer-reliable-ally">in a Guardian interview</a> earlier this year that Moscow was at war with the west.</p> 
<p>Lady Manningham-Buller argued that the situation had changed “since the invasion of Ukraine and the various things I read about that the Russians have been doing here – sabotage, intelligence collection, attacking people and so on”.</p> 
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zT9vxBk5N4">on a podcast</a> in which she was interviewed by the lord speaker, John McFall, she then referenced Hill, who advised Donald Trump during his first term as US president and co-authored the UK’s strategic defence review.</p> 
<p>“I think she may be right in saying we’re already at war with Russia. It’s a different sort of war, but the hostility, the cyber-attacks, the physical attacks, the intelligence work is extensive,” she said.</p> 
<p>Six Bulgarians living in the UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/12/six-bulgarians-jailed-after-spying-for-russia-in-uk">were jailed</a> this year for their role in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/07/spy-trial-scheming-bluster-tangled-relationships">spy ring conducting hostile surveillance</a> around Europe, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/08/three-men-found-guilty-over-london-arson-attack-on-ukraine-linked-firms">five men were convicted</a> for their involvement in an arson attack ordered by Moscow on a warehouse containing supplies destined for Ukraine.</p> 
<p>Pat McFadden, then the Cabinet Office minister, said last year that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/25/russia-plotting-to-use-ai-to-enhance-cyber-attacks-against-uk-minister-will-warn">Russia had stepped up</a> its cyber-attacks against the UK. Hackers have targeted a string of British businesses. While the source of the attacks can take time to detect, many are suspected to have originated in Russia.</p> 
<p>Several of the UK’s Nato allies in eastern Europe have been affected by recent drone incidents, most notably Poland where 19 unarmed Russian drones crossed into its airspace this month.</p> 
<p>During the early part of Manningham-Buller’s period as MI5 chief between 2002 and 2007, there were hopes that Russia under Vladimir Putin would not revert to its Soviet ways and instead become a potential partner for the west.</p> 
<p>Manningham-Buller met Putin in 2005 when he came to London after a G8 summit in Scotland, a time when Lord McFall suggested the Russian president was trying to put on a “pleasant face” to impress the leading western nations.</p> 
<p>“I wouldn’t quite describe him as that,” Manningham-Buller replied. “I didn’t anticipate that within a year he’d be ordering the murder on London streets of [Alexander] Litvinenko, but I thought he was quite an unpleasant man.”</p> 
<p>Litvinenko, a former Russian FSB spy who lived in London, fell ill and died slowly in 2006 after he was poisoned with radioactive polonium. A public inquiry held a decade later concluded that two Russian agents killed him and that they were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/21/alexander-litvinenko-was-probably-murdered-on-personal-orders-of-putin">probably acting on Putin’s orders</a>.</p> 
<p>Manningham-Buller criticised the decisions by the US and UK governments to dramatically cut aid spending, arguing it would create a diplomatic opportunity for China to exploit poorer countries.</p> 
<p>She said she had been struck by the quality of the HIV treatment work funded by the US in Africa, which she witnessed during her time a director and then chair of the Wellcome Trust, the medical research charity, after leaving MI5.</p> 
<p>“You’d go to a pretty primitive hospital with people on pallets on the ground, but the George W Bush-funded Aids wing was a different scale. For Americans to stop all of that, and for our cutting back on aid, means that we leave space for your friendly Chinese diplomat,” she said.</p> 
<p>“If we withdraw from the world, they can move in because they have a strong economic base, so I think soft power … whether it’s the BBC World Service, whether it’s aid, whether it’s demining, all contribute importantly to our influence in the world, as well as being of humanitarian importance.”</p>
