Order on birthright citizenship,” Eastman <a href="https://x.com/DrJohnEastman/status/1882177230257950878">wrote gleefully</a> on Wednesday. The lawsuits filed to block Trump’s order, he added, made what he called “the false claim that the issue was settled 150 years ago”.</p> <p>Eastman, <a href="https://www.claremont.org/scholar-bio/john-c-eastman/">a fellow</a> at the far-right Claremont Institute, came to Trump’s attention thanks to <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1148270600407924736">an appearance on Fox News</a> in 2019 that led to an invitation to the Oval Office.</p> <p>In 2020, Eastman’s fringe reading of the 14 amendment was briefly <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/08/18/trump-said-2-years-ago-deny-citizenship-americans-like-kamala-harris/">a campaign issue</a> when he argued in <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/some-questions-kamala-harris-about-eligibility-opinion-1524483">a Newsweek op-ed</a>, the publication later apologized for, that Kamala Harris was not entitled to citizenship when she was born in Oakland, California, in 1964 to immigrant parents – and so, was not eligible to ever be vice-president or president.</p> <p>According to Eastman, the amendment granting citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof”, should be read to exclude the children of people who are not US citizens when their child is born.</p> <p>Harris, he wrote, had no claim to citizenship at birth, since her parents were still, at the time, “subject” not to the jurisdiction of the United States but to their native lands of India and Jamaica.</p> <p>An editor’s note added to Eastman’s Newsweek piece after it was published said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“<em>This op-ed is being used by some as a tool to perpetuate racism and xenophobia. We apologize. The essay, by John Eastman, was intended to explore a minority legal argument about the definition of who is a ‘natural-born citizen’ in the United States. But to many readers, the essay inevitably conveyed the ugly message that Senator Kamala Harris, a woman of color and the child of immigrants, was somehow not truly American. The op-ed was never intended to spark or to take part in the racist lie of Birtherism”.</em></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-01-24T01:30:35.029Z">at 1.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6792d8368f08ce877c328b23" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-01-24T00:11:41.417Z">12.11am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Newark’s mayor denounces warrantless federal immigration raid on business</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In a blistering statement, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, <strong>Ras J</strong><strong> Baraka</strong>, <a href="https://www.newarknj.gov/news/mayor-ras-j-barakas-statement-on-ice-raid-on-newark-business-establishment">denounced</a> a federal immigration raid on a business in his city, in which, he says, citizens, including a veteran, were detained.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Today, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents raided a local establishment in the City of Newark, detaining undocumented residents as well as citizens, without producing a warrant.

Republicans, who have pursued this kind of federal legislation for years, have framed the law as a common-sense defense against infanticide.</p> <p>However, abortion rights supporters fear the bill would also apply in situations where, due to pregnancy or fetal complications, women give birth to infants with no chance of survival. In those scenarios, women may prefer that their children are offered palliative care.</p> <p>The vast majority of US abortions take place before fetal viability, which tends to occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy. Infanticide is also already illegal.</p> <p>The passage of the bill marks the first anti-abortion legislative victory of the second Trump administration, but the bill is unlikely to become law anytime soon. Earlier this week, the US Senate blocked a similar bill from advancing.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-01-23T23:03:45.114Z">at 11.03pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6792c4c58f08ce877c328aa3" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-01-23T22:43:51.794Z">10.43pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Hegseth reportedly told senator he paid $50,000 to woman who accused him of sexual assault</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hegseth-sex-assault-payment-trump-6674cc8cfee654c374725948e01ff666">reports</a> that Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, told Senator Elizabeth Warren in writing that he paid $50,000 to the woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017.</p> <p>The answers, which were seen by the AP, were provided to Warren in response to additional questions she had for Hegseth as part of the vetting process.</p> <p>Hegseth’s attorney, Timothy Parlatore, declined to comment to the news agency on the dollar figure Thursday.

I insisted that they pay, and they did, because the United States was really paying the difference at that time.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>He declared the US will begin “demanding respect from other nations”, singling out Canada and the European Union.</strong> He said Canada could “become a state” of the US, as a way of eradicating the US trade deficit with Canada. “We don’t need their cars and we don’t need their lumber.” On the EU, he said he believes the US has been treated “very, very unfairly” by the bloc. “They don’t take our farm products and they don’t take our cars. yet they send cars to us by the millions,” he said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>He urged Saudi Arabia and the oil-producing cartel Opec to cut oil prices, claiming this would end the war in Ukraine. “</strong>They should have done it long ago. They’re very responsible, actually, to a certain extent, for what’s taking place,” he said. The oil price took a tumble after Trump’s speech.</p></li> <li><p><strong>He said the US needs to double its energy production, partly to fuel artificial intelligence. </strong>Trump said he will fast-track the approvals for new power plants, which companies can site next to their plants – something not currently possible under regulations. Worryingly, he declared that companies will be able to fuel it with anything they want, and have coal as a backup, “good, clean coal”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>He said he wants a “fair relationship” with China over the next four years,</strong> adding that he wants a “level playing field”. Trump said he looked forward to “doing very well with China and getting along with China” during his presidency.

Trump also withdrew the US from the Paris deal in his first 2017-2021 <strong>White House</strong> term.</p> <p>Bloomberg is a media billionaire who also serves as a UN special envoy on climate change. “Bloomberg Philanthropies and other US climate funders will ensure the United States meets its global climate obligations,” the organisation said in a statement, adding this included covering the amount the US owes each year to the <strong>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)</strong>.</p> <p>Bloomberg Philanthropies did not give details of the amounts of funding or who the other climate funders are.</p> <p>The UNFCCC is the UN’s leading climate body. It runs annual climate negotiations among nearly 200 countries and helps implement the agreements that are made in these talks – the biggest of which is the 2015 Paris agreement.</p> <p><strong>Bloomberg</strong> also pledged to work with states, cities and companies to ensure that the US stayed on track with its global climate obligations. “From 2017 to 2020, during a period of federal inaction, cities, states, businesses, and the public rose to the challenge to uphold our nation’s commitments – and now, we are ready to do it again,” he said in the statement.</p> <p>The US is responsible for funding about 21% of the UNFCCC’s core budget.

We need to be able to avoid war. And that means a credible threat from Nato,” Grenell said.</p>    <p>The envoy blasted Trump’s predecessor for not speaking to <strong>Russian</strong> president <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, saying the new US president was pressuring Ukraine and Russia “to the table”.</p> <p>“There’s a huge frustration from Americans that we’re spending hundreds of billions of dollars, and our leaders aren’t speaking to each other to try to solve problems,” Grenell said.</p> <p>The transatlantic alliance’s 32 countries in 2023 set a minimum level for defence spending of 2% of gross domestic product, but Trump has suggested raising this to 5%. Rutte acknowledged that the share had to increase.</p> <p>“We have collectively to move up and we will decide on the exact number later this year, but it will be considerably more than two [percent],” Rutte said.</p> <p>He also said Europe would have to pay more for continued US defence support.</p> <p>“We have to be willing to do that, because at this moment, they are paying more than the Europeans. And here Trump is right,” Rutte said.</p> <p>After Grenell’s remarks, Belgian prime minister <strong>Alexander De Croo</strong> reminded the audience that Putin was “the enemy”, adding: “I see a lot of finger pointing between partners. And that’s not helpful.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-01-23T09:56:24.681Z">at 9.56am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-679206e38f083520265e222a" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-01-23T09:12:27.325Z">9.12am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Nato</strong> secretary-general, <strong>Mark Rutte</strong>, on Thursday called for the <strong>US</strong> to continue supplying <strong>Ukraine</strong> and said <strong>Europe</strong> would pay the bill, reports Reuters. </p> <p>Speaking at an event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Rutte said the alliance must invest more in defence, ramp up defence industrial production and take on a bigger share of spending on help for Ukraine. </p> <p>“On Ukraine, we need US also to stay involved,” Rutte said. “If this new Trump administration is willing to keep on supplying Ukraine from its defence industrial base, the bill will be paid by the Europeans, I’m absolutely convinced of this, we have to be willing to do that,” he added. </p> <p>The secretary general’s comments came after US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> said earlier this week that the <strong>European Union</strong> should be doing more to support Ukraine. </p> <p>In Davos, Rutte also said it was vital <strong>Russia</strong> did not win as it could result in Russian president <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> ‘high fiving’ the leaders of <strong>North Korea</strong> and <strong>China</strong>. </p> <p>“We really have to step up and not scale back our support for Ukraine,” Rutte said. “The frontline is moving in the wrong direction.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6792058a8f086e1515d8371e" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/davidsmith"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-01-23T09:07:23.033Z">9.07am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Those pardoned by <strong>Donald Trump</strong> include more than 250 people who were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/09/january-6-capitol-riot-david-dempsey-prison-sentence">convicted of assault charges</a>, some having attacked police during the <strong>US Capitol riots</strong> with makeshift weapons such as flagpoles, a hockey stick and a crutch.
