In some states, medical staff account for as many as 20% of known coronavirus cases. From doctors to hospital cleaners and from nursing home aides to paramedics, those most at risk have already helped save thousands of lives.</p> <p>Not all these medical professionals survive their encounters with patients. Hospitals are overwhelmed, workers lack protective equipment and some staff suffer from underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to this pernicious virus.</p> <p>Health authorities in the US have no consistent way of tallying the deaths of healthcare workers. As of 14 April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 deaths among health workers – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-us-health-care-worker-death-toll-higher-official-data-suggests">but our reporting shows that is likely a vast undercount</a>.</p> <p>Lost on the frontline is a collaboration between the Guardian and Kaiser Health News that aims to document the lives of healthcare workers in the US who die from Covid-19, and to understand why so many are falling victim to the pandemic.</p> <p>These are some of the first tragic cases. We are creating a database and will investigate and record new cases as this project unfolds.</p>    <p><strong>Helen Gbodi, 54<br></strong><em>The single mother dreamed of opening a nursing home</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation: </strong>Registered nurse<br><strong>Place of work: </strong>MedStar Washington hospital center in Washington DC<br><strong>Date of death: </strong>19 April 2020</p> <p>Helen Gbodi was known for helping elderly neighbors and fellow churchgoers, picking up their medications and groceries and accompanying them on walks. She even dispatched her daughter, Rebecca Gbodi, to shovel snow in neighbors’ driveways.</p> <p>“Even when she didn’t have a lot, she would always give,” Rebecca said of her mother, who worked long hours to put her three children through college and helped pay school fees for other relatives. This year, she embarked on her own dream: she was crafting plans to open her own nursing home, her daughter said.</p> <p>Gbodi understood the severity of Covid-19 early. In March she called everyone in her contacts list, including people she hadn’t talked to in years, to make sure they were aware and taking precautions, her daughter said. Though she did not actively care for patients who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, such patients were being treated on her floor, her daughter said.</p> <p>Days later, she was fighting for her life. By the time she was hospitalized with Covid-19, she was too weak to lift her arm for a virtual handshake with her daughter on FaceTime.</p> <p>“At the end of the day she was willing to put her life in danger for others,” Rebecca said.</p> <p><em>– Anna Jean Kaiser</em></p>    <p><strong>Jenniffer Anderson-Davis, 44<br></strong><em>Nurse with ‘heartwarming’ smile did her best for her children</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Licensed practical nurse<br><strong>Place of work:</strong> Meramec Bluffs Life Plan community in Ballwin, Missouri<br><strong>Date of death: </strong>14 April 2020</p> <p>As a single mother, Jenniffer Anderson-Davis was determined to give her three children everything they needed, so she pursued her nursing degree while delivering pizza to make ends meet.</p> <p>“She always did the best that she could to give them the best life,” her brother, Earl Anderson, said.</p> <p>Most recently Anderson-Davis worked as an admission and discharge nurse at a senior living community. Her mother, Edna Anderson, said that Anderson-Davis was concerned about residents who returned to the facility after visiting Florida (it has since banned re-entry for residents who spent time away).</p> <p>Anderson-Davis tested positive for Covid-19 on 9 April and died at home five days later. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration opened a fatality investigation at Meramec Bluffs on 16 April.</p> <p>In a statement, a spokesperson said: “Jenniffer’s co-workers remember her as a thorough and well-respected nurse who had a smile that could warm any heart.” They did not respond to specific questions about how she may have become infected.</p> <p><em>– Cara Anthony</em></p>    <p><strong>Susan Cicala, 60<br></strong><em>A tireless nurse, she loved her children and travel</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Registered nurse<br><strong>Places of work:</strong> Northern state prison in Newark, New Jersey; Clara Maass medical center in Belleville, New Jersey<br><strong>Date of death:</strong> 4 April 2020</p> <p>Susan Cicala worked long hours. A typical workday began at the hospital surgery department at 5.30am. She’d work there until 2pm, and an hour later would start her next eight-hour shift at a nearby state prison. She worked weekends, too.</p> <p>As for sleep? “She must have slept somewhere, but I don’t know,” her son, Steven Cicala, said with a laugh. “She was the hardest worker I ever met.”</p> <p>Reminiscing on Facebook, colleagues said she talked about her two children constantly. She started wrapping Christmas presents in May. She loved to travel, to Disney World and national parks, and saw vacations as opportunities to learn about the world beyond New Jersey – on a trip to Hawaii she delved into the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p> <p>Cicala became sick in late March and died in early April; her family said they presume she contracted the virus at one of her jobs.</p> <p>“She didn’t go anywhere else,” Steven said.</p> <p>As of 21 May, the New Jersey department of corrections had tallied 152 Covid-19 cases at the prison where Cicala worked; 134 of those diagnoses were among staff. In early May the union representing Cicala and other workers filed a safety complaint saying precautions have been inadequate and may have led to Cicala’s death. A spokesperson for the prison healthcare agency that employed Cicala said it had followed all state and federal guidelines, and that staff were provided with personal protective equipment.</p> <p><em>– Maureen O’Hagan</em></p>    <p><strong>Nina Forbes, 56<br></strong><em>Memory care nurse worked through the pandemic, despite fears</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Licensed practical nurse<br><strong>Place of work:</strong> Silverado memory care facility in Alexandria, Virginia<br><strong>Date of death:</strong> 25 April 2020</p> <p>Nina Forbes refused to let fear stop her from living her life.</p> <p>She was terrified of flying. But a few years ago, Forbes got on a plane for the first time to watch her younger daughter Jennifer play volleyball.</p> <p>Covid-19 also scared Forbes, and as a nurse at an assisted living facility, she knew the virus posed a serious risk. Still, she continued showing up to work.</p> <p>Forbes tested Covid-positive just after Easter. Chills, body aches and a fever kept her from attending family dinner that Sunday. By the following weekend, she struggled to breathe and couldn’t walk on her own. An ambulance took her to the hospital.</p> <p>Her older daughter, Jessica, said her mother didn’t have the necessary protection at work. Forbes sometimes wore trash bags to protect herself, she said.</p> <p>In a statement, a representative for the facility said it met CDC guidelines for personal protective equipment. Employees sometimes used trash bags as an added layer of protection, worn over a disposable gown, according to the representative.</p> <p>Forbes appeared to do what she wanted even in her final moments. Jennifer was able to visit her mother in the hospital, and Forbes died shortly after she left, Jessica said. “It was like she waited for her to leave.”</p> <p><em>— Carmen Heredia Rodriguez</em></p>    <p><strong>Saif Titi, 72<br></strong><em>His warmth and generosity brought diverse clients to his pharmacy</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Pharmacist<br><strong>Place of work: </strong>Noble Pharmacy in Jersey City, New Jersey<br><strong>Date of death:</strong> 7 April 2020</p> <p>When the pandemic hit, Saif Titi was working six days a week at his Jersey City pharmacy and had no interest in slowing down. As was his way, he wanted to be helpful.</p> <p>“He didn’t really run it as a business,” says Titi’s son, Justin. “He wasn’t trying to make profit. He was really just trying to help people.”</p> <p>Titi was born in Jaffa in the last days of British rule in Palestine and grew up a refugee in the Gaza Strip. After studying in Egypt, Austria and Spain, he immigrated to New Jersey in 1972 and bought Noble Pharmacy a decade later.</p> <p>The pharmacy became a fixture in the community, known as a place immigrants could go for help and advice, often in their native language, as Titi spoke Spanish and German in addition to English and his native Arabic. If they couldn’t afford medication, he would give it to them for free. “All different types of people from different cultures would come and they would instantly fall in love with him,” Justin says.</p> <p>Active in the local Arab-American community, Titi gave to charity and sent money home regularly. A Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MayorJustin/posts/10105097528224372?comment_id=10105125421870282&amp;notif_id=1587168586093895&amp;notif_t=feed_comment">tribute</a> included dozens of stories of his generosity and mentorship. “We all lost the sweetest and the most noble man on earth,” wrote one relative.</p> <p>Titi, a father of three and grandfather of two, developed symptoms of Covid-19 in late March. He died in the hospital on 7 April. His wife, Rachelle, also became infected and has taken some six weeks to recover. In quarantine, the family has been unable to grieve together.</p> <p><em>-Noa Yachot</em></p>    <p><strong>Gerald Welch, 56<br></strong><em>Social worker was a ‘big voice’ in his community</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation: </strong>Social worker and behavioral specialist<br><strong>Place of work: </strong>Opportunity Behavioral Health in Reading, Pennsylvania<br><strong>Date of death: </strong>15 April 2020</p> <p>Donna Welch had sworn she would “never, ever, <em>ever</em> get married again”. Then Gerald appeared.</p> <p>They met on MySpace, and she quickly realized that “our spirits connected”. On their first date, at Donna’s house in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Gerald proposed – and Donna said yes. “It was like he came down on a bolt of lightning from heaven,” she said.</p> <p>Gerald’s fiery passion and courage to speak out served him well as a boardroom advocate for underperforming students in the school district, and at the St Paul Missionary Baptist Church, where he resurrected a scholarship now named in his honor.</p> <p>“He had a big voice,” Donna said, “and he was not afraid to use it.” His Families, Organizations and Communities United in Service podcast combined Gerald’s lived experience overcoming drugs and his spirituality to support others struggling with addiction.</p> <p>So even as the state’s Covid-19 cases mounted, Gerald was a dutiful companion for his clients with severe autism – he took them to the supermarket in Lancaster and the laundromat in Lebanon. “Wherever they needed to go, he went,” Donna said. “He cared so much for them, and they loved him dearly.”</p> <p>“We all did,” she added.</p> <p><em>― Eli Cahan</em></p>    <p><strong>Jesus Manuel Zambrano, 54<br></strong><em>Dominican pediatrician realized his dream to practice medicine in U</em><em>S</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Pediatrician<br><strong>Place of work:</strong> Private practice in Freeport, New York; attending physician at Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital<br><strong>Date of death:</strong> 30 March 2020</p> <p>Jesus Manuel Zambrano studied medicine in his native Dominican Republic and immigrated to New York in the 1990s.</p> <p>He hustled, working in fast food and as a school bus driver between studies, said his wife, Sandra. He completed his residency in 2010.</p> <p>In the meantime, they had two children: Jesus Manuel Jr, 22, and Angelyne Ofelia, 18. Jesus Manuel Jr, who uses a wheelchair, never veered far from his father during family outings to restaurants and parks, and Holy Week vacations.</p> <p>Zambrano’s bond with his son informed his care for his patients. “There was not a single day we met and talked when we didn’t talk about his son,” said Dr Magda Mendez, a former colleague.</p> <p>Zambrano spent days in private practice, Sandra said, and in the evenings treated others at the hospital, which saw Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>In early March, he felt ill. He took the next day off – a rare occurrence, Sandra said. He was taken to the hospital where he worked, where he died after a week and a half of care.</p> <p>In becoming a physician in the United States, Zambrano had realized his lifelong dream. He wished the same for his family.</p> <p>“He had a lot of plans for his children, a lot of dreams,” Sandra said.</p> <p><em>— Carmen Heredia Rodriguez</em></p>    <p><strong>Matthew ‘Matty’ Moore, 52<br></strong><em>‘Sitting on the sidelines was never in his DNA’</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Radiologic technologist<br><strong>Place of work:</strong> Northwell Health’s GoHealth Urgent Care in Eltingville, Staten Island, New York<br><strong>Date of death:</strong> 17 April 2020</p> <p>Matthew Moore “would give the shirt off his back to help others,” said his sister, Erin Esposito.</p> <p>A former firefighter and Staten Island native, Matthew Moore volunteered as a first responder for weeks after 9/11, “even when everyone else stopped going”, Esposito said.</p> <p>Moore was known as “a gentle giant” in Prince’s Bay, his brother-in-law Adam Esposito said. He was a devoted churchgoer and a beloved member of “The Beach Boys” firehouse (as Engine 161/81 was nicknamed).</p> <p>He even came through as Santa Claus, delivering gifts on Christmas morning to the children of two firefighters who died on 9/11.</p> <p>Moore became an X-ray technologist, cherishing the ability to help those seeking urgent care. When Covid-19 emerged, he continued showing up to work. “Sitting on the sidelines was never in his DNA,” Esposito said.</p> <p>At the time, the family was reassured that he was receiving the personal protective equipment he needed. Despite his precautions, when Matty contracted Covid-19, it tore through his lungs, which had been damaged at Ground Zero.</p> <p>As Matty lay dying, Esposito sought to reassure her brother. “You’ve done enough for us,” she told him, over the phone.

But he said Martin’s death was “a hard hit”.</p> <p>On 23 March, at the end of a shift, Martin told a supervisor he had mild flu symptoms. A month later, he died at a hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p> <p>AMR paramedics had N95 masks and protective gear and followed CDC guidelines, Houghton said. “We have not yet had a shortage.”</p> <p>In Facebook posts honoring Martin, colleagues described his excitement before trips to Disney World.

Born in Washington Heights in northern Manhattan, she went to nursing school in Greenwich Village and raised her five boys on the Lower East Side.</p> <p>In the 1960s, she traveled to Berlin, where she worked as a nurse for the British army and met her future husband, Peter. A lifelong love of travel was born. Gregarious and high-energy by nature, she loved meeting new people. “Wherever she’d go, she’d make a new friend,” said her son, also named Peter.</p> <p>In later years, Sell spent much of her time in Florida. But she jumped at opportunities to lend her nursing skills to her home city and see her grandchildren and friends.</p> <p>In February, she was contacted by a firm that places nurses on temporary assignments. Her children were concerned about the encroaching pandemic, especially given her age. “But they need a nurse,” she responded. She traveled to New York to fill in as a nurse at several schools citywide just as the pandemic took hold. The firm, Comprehensive Resources, did not respond to questions on protections for its contractors.</p> <p>Sell began developing symptoms in mid-March, just before the citywide school closure went into effect. She returned home to Florida, where she died from pneumonia caused by Covid-19.</p> <p>Before Rosemary died, she had been hatching her next adventure with a friend: to travel to India.

The week before schools closed, a fellow nurse had a fever and a cough.</p> <p>Days later, Howard developed the same symptoms. After initially improving, she took a sudden turn on 4 April. As her brother drove her to the hospital, her heart stopped. She was declared dead at the hospital.</p> <p>In tribute, hundreds turned out on Zoom to mark Nine-Night – a days-long wake traditional to the Caribbean – where loved ones shared photos, sang songs and recounted Marilyn’s impact on their lives.</p> <p>The pandemic has since ripped through Marilyn’s extended family, infecting at least a dozen relatives. (One cousin was hospitalized but has since been released and is recovering.) The family has evolved into a sprawling triage team, monitoring one another’s temperatures, delivering food, charting emergency contacts and nearby hospitals.</p> <p>Howard’s brothers said they wanted to start a foundation in her name to help aspiring nurses in the US and West Indies. “The best way to honor her spirit and her memory is to bring more nurses into this world,” said her brother Rawle. “We need more Marilyns around.”</p> <p>– <em>Noa Yachot</em></p>    <p><strong>Jesus Villaluz, 75<br></strong><em>He took the time to put patients at ease</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Patient transport worker<br><strong>Place of work:</strong> Holy Name medical center in Teaneck, New Jersey<br><strong>Date of death:</strong> 3 April 2020</p> <p>After Jesus Villaluz died from Covid-19 complications, colleagues lined the hallway at Holy Name medical center in Teaneck, New Jersey, to say goodbye.
