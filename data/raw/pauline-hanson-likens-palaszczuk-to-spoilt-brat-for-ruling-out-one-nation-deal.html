<p>Pauline Hanson has likened the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, to a “spoilt brat” for ruling out a deal with One Nation.</p> <p>Arriving in Bundaberg just as the Labor campaign left, Hanson, who remains the most visible One Nation asset in Queensland, despite not running in Saturday’s state election, lashed out at Palaszczuk’s continued criticism of the party.</p> <p>Palaszczuk’s insistence that Labor would rather go into opposition than form government with One Nation has become its strongest attack line against the Liberal National party, which is directly preferencing One Nation in 50 of the 61 seats it is running in, as well as admitting, indirectly, it would form government with One Nation, if necessary.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/queensland-election-one-nation-question-dogs-lnp-in-leaders-debate">Queensland election: One Nation question dogs  LNP in leaders' debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, who has previously said he would work with the parliament Queenslanders delivered, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/queensland-lnp-could-form-government-with-one-nation">was unable to answer “yes or no”</a> to the question of whether he would form government with One Nation on Tuesday during a radio quiz, instead opting for “pass”.</p> <p>Hanson has responded with the line that the major parties are choosing not to respect the will of the people, in the same way <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/10/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables-donald-trump">Donald Trump’s campaign</a> used Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment against the Democrat campaign last year.</p> <p>“I don’t think the premier knows what she is doing actually, I think she is in such a turmoil over this and she is actually needs to get out of the sandpit and be the leader for this state,” Hanson said. “Because the way she is carrying on, it is not leadership, it is not quality.</p> <p>“To say you won’t work with One Nation, it is just ridiculous. It’s like a spoilt brat, she is carrying on like a spoilt kid, and if that is what leadership means then I think she is heading down the wrong path and Tim Nicholls, he needs to grow up and make a decision, because people want clear decision in this state. They want leaders who will make clear decisions. Neither one seems to be able to do it.”</p> <p>Palaszczuk, whose attack line was damaged when one of her former ministers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/21/one-nation-a-thorn-in-its-queensland-rivals-sides">sought Hanson out to embrace her in front of the cameras</a>, despite Labor’s “no One Nation” policy, said she would not “respond to name calling” but disputed she did not respect Queenslanders who wanted to vote for Hanson’s candidates.</p> <p>“I respect everybody,” she said from Toowoomba, west of Brisbane, which has become a key battleground this election.</p> <p>“However, when it comes to the deal between Tim Nicholls and One Nation, I do not share their values. I do not share One Nation values and I will not support that deal and, if that means going into opposition, I will go into opposition rather than be confronted with the values of One Nation.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/12/one-nation-queensland-preference-plan-designed-to-do-labor-over">One Nation Queensland preference plan 'designed to do Labor over'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I don’t support their views when it comes to restricting gun ownership, I don’t support their views when it comes to vaccination. I wholeheartedly believe that children need to be immunised. </p> <p>“And I support the payment of penalty rates and what we have seen is Senator Pauline Hanson, and let’s not forget she is a senator, Senator Pauline Hanson has voted with Malcolm Turnbull 85% of the time.” </p> <p>With polls showing the path to 47 seats and an outright majority in the unicameral parliament remains elusive for both major parties, the question of what will happen in a hung parliament has become one of the hardest for Queensland politicians to answer.</p> <p>Labor has done its best to paint One Nation and the LNP with the same brush, while Nicholls accused Palaszczuk of lying about her no-deals-for-power promise.</p>
