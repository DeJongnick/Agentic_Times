    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:C - You would weigh more than twice as much on Jupiter. Its gravity is about 2.5 times stronger than Earth’s. If you weigh 30kg on Earth, you’d weigh about 75kg on Jupiter – though you couldn’t stand on it because it’s made of gas!, 2:B - Dogs were domesticated about 15,000 years ago and have been trained to herd, guard and hunt. Their brains are better adapted for learning commands and social signals. Cats were domesticated later and are more independent., 3:C - The US has reduced its pollution over the last 40 years, but about half of its population live in a place where the air is dangerous to breathe. There’s also pollution in water and land, and wildfires are making air pollution worse., 4:C - Scientists aren’t sure if space goes on for ever. It might be like a balloon’s surface – if you keep going, you loop back round. The truth is that we don’t know!, 5:C - Whales don’t lay anything on the ocean floor – they don’t lay eggs or lay their heads down to sleep. But when they die they sink in a “whale fall” and other animals feed off their bodies.</p>
