<h1>Connection, normalcy and fierce loyalty: why life is sweet on small market NBA teams</h1>

<p>Two-time NBA All-Star Reggie Theus remembers the 1981 playoffs. In a “big time” opening round series, his Chicago Bulls faced the New York Knicks. The first game tipped off in one of the world’s most famous arenas, Madison Square Garden, and it included stars such as Artis Gilmore, Bill Cartwright and Michael Ray Richardson. The Bulls won game one and went on to win the series, playing Larry Bird and the Boston Celtics in the next round. Theus scored 37 points in the clincher against New York, an overtime victory in the Windy City. But it was a thrill he never quite felt again.</p> <p>While Theus made the playoffs three more times in his long career, he never again featured in such a glitzy postseason showdown like Chicago versus New York. During his 13-years in the league, the he suited up for teams like the Kansas City and then Sacramento Kings (the team relocated to NorCal in 1985) and Orlando Magic. In a way, he was like a kettle moving from the front to the back burners. Indeed, more often than not, the NBA’s glamour markets – cities like Los Angeles, Boston, New York and Chicago – get the attention. But those aren’t its <em>only </em>teams, nor are they necessarily the places with the most success in any one season. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/19/russell-westbrook-denver-nuggets-nba">The strange twilight of Russell Westbrook, the NBA’s ultimate fetish player</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In this year’s playoffs, many of the franchises <a href="https://hoop-social.com/nba-team-market-size-rankings/" title="Protected by Outlook: https://hoop-social.com/nba-team-market-size-rankings/.

But while big markets like New York, Miami or Golden State can draw free-agents thanks to their reputations and attraction for nightlife and entertainment, it’s hard not to wonder what life is like for the pros who live and hoop in smaller, more modest locales?</p> <p>For Theus, who played more years in places like Sacramento than he did Chi-town, the difference felt obvious. “You just get that hometown feel that small markets have,” Theus says. “Everyone sort of knows each other on a personal level.” Some teams, he says, just have a family feel to them. One organization he cites is San Antonio. While Theus never played for the Spurs, he sees how the culture that squad built over decades led to winning, stability and consistency. “There aren’t a lot of different things getting in the way there,” he says.</p> <p>While some fans may think that small town life for an NBA star is boring, Theus explains that it was quite the opposite. “You end up doing what the city has to offer,” Theus says. “I’m an archer and [Sacramento and Orlando] had a lot of hunting and fishing for me. It was great. I don’t know anybody that was bored or didn’t have fun. You did a lot more things together with your teammates. Small towns are personal, which is part of the charm.”</p> <p>When Theus played in the 1980s and 1990s, life was different than it is today. If you were in Sacramento, there wasn’t much national media exposure. Today, though, the reigning NBA MVP, Oklahoma City’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, has already been featured in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLKeqO_TdDw" title="Protected by Outlook: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLKeqO_TdDw.

Thanks to social media, NBA League Pass and streaming services, any player anywhere can become a household name. But when Theus played, it wasn’t nearly so easy to get national attention.</p> <p>“Small markets sometimes feel like they’re on an island by themselves,” he says. But there’s also a big benefit to that, he notes: “[The players] become closer.” Theus says he is still in regular touch with teammates he had in Sacramento and Orlando. But that’s not the same with those in Chicago. It’s a tradeoff. In smaller markets there’s less attention but with that comes, perhaps, a more normal life.</p> <p>“If you’re in Chicago, LA, New York, there are no other places like that,” Theus says. “Those are the three biggest media markets around. So, obviously there’s no place like that. The nightlife – and when I say the nightlife, I’m thinking of dinner spots, entertainment and so forth – those three places are <em>unique</em>.”</p> <p>Age can also be a factor in how you see playing in a smaller market. When Theus played in Chicago, he was in his early 20s – and the world was his oyster. When he was in Orlando, he was more mature, and in his 30s. In between, he was in sleepy Sacramento. Today’s NBA stars earn tens of millions of dollars a year. That affords a lavish life, from private jets to vacations around the globe. If you’re young and want to party, you can find a way today, even if you’re in a smaller city. Still, though, when it comes to a city’s reputation or celebrity <em>fans</em>? Some have all the luck.</p> <p>“There is no place like Madison Square Garden,” four-time All-Star Michael Ray Richardson tells the Guardian. “Sugar,” as he was known then, played in the Big Apple for four years before suiting up across the river in the smaller New Jersey for four more. “In New York, you got all the movie stars and actors and all of that,” he says. “In New Jersey, you really didn’t have none of that.”</p> <p>For Richardson, who now lives in Lawton, about 70 miles south of Oklahoma City, he’s seen what a winning team can mean to a region that is otherwise devoid of major pro sports. It’s something to rally around, he says, to enjoy together as a community. A winner like OKC can make a state feel like one giant college campus. “The whole state is going crazy,” says Richardson, “because there’s no other professional team here. So, if you go to an Oklahoma City Thunder game, it’s like a college atmosphere. It’s unreal.”</p> <p>Robert Parish won three titles with Bird and the Celtics in the prime of his career, and a fourth with Michael Jordan’s Bulls. But in between, he played for two years in Charlotte, which at the time was an expansion team in one of the NBA’s smallest markets. Comparing the places, Parish says tradition stands out. If there’s history, there’s more to cheer for, although history is not always connected to size – just look at how the Packers are intertwined with the lore of Green Bay and the NFL. The same goes for the Spurs in San Antonio</p> <p>“The obvious difference is reputation,” Parish says. “The larger cities [often] have that long, rich history of being loud, loyal and appreciative with crazy fans.” Still, Parish says, victories translate to both types of NBA cities. “The celebrity athletes got the love [in Charlotte] because the Hornets gave the fans a reason to be proud – winning! Same reason for the fan loyalty in bigger markets.”</p> <p>There may be no team in the world with as much tradition as the Celtics – thanks, in part, to Parish. But it’s something Theus recognizes, too. “When you think about the Boston Celtics,” Theus says, “when you think about LA and Chicago, the sports history is a big factor. The lineage runs deeper because it’s been there for so long.” He adds, “Of course, Sacramento has grown up quite a bit now. But when we first got there, we had to tell the fans they weren’t supposed to clap so hard for the other team! … There was a real learning curve.”</p>
