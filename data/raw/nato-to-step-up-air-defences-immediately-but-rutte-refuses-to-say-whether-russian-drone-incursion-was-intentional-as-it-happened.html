 <h2 class="block-title">Nato's Eastern Sentry meant to provide degree of public reassurance - snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Defence and security editor</em></p> 
  <p>It was <strong>something of a surprise that two days on, Nato leaders are still not willing to say whether the drone incursion of 21 drones into Poland was deliberate or not.</strong></p> 
  <p>But <strong>the decision to beef up air policing in Poland</strong> with the deployment of extra fighter jets from France, Germany and Denmark <strong>suggests that alliance members were not has happy as they say they are with how the Wednesday night’s drone incursion was handled.</strong></p> 
  <p>The new mission<strong>, Eastern Sentry, will focus on better countering drone and missiles threats</strong>, spill over activity from Ukraine – starting in Poland and spreading across the alliance’s entire eastern flank – <strong>and will at least provide a degree of public reassurance.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Whether it will deter the Russians from doing anything similar again is unfortunately less certain.</strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">No public call on Russia's intent with drone incursion into Poland, but Nato's intent is clear in its response - snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It was <strong>very</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>notable that Rutte, despite being repeatedly asked, didn’t want to say whether he believed the Russian drone incursion into Poland was a deliberate act by Russia</strong> – which, as he himself acknowledged, would make the incident significantly more serious.</p> 
  <p><strong>It</strong> <strong>was also telling that while Grynkewich defended the operation on Wednesday, he said it’s time to take a “fresh look” at the current setup,</strong> as the incident was “obviously larger than previous incursions that we’ve had,” and that if it had been like previous incidents, “we would have gotten them all.” </p> 
  <p>But the overall message was clear: <strong>Nato will immediately step up its air defences </strong>– in fact, <strong>starting tonight</strong> – to demonstrate its commitment to defending every inch of allied territory.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Rutte, Grynkewich stress importance of defending eastern flank as 'first line' of Nato</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Rutte </strong>also makes a point that the eastern flank of Nato defends the entire alliance, as he stressed that “these latest Russian missiles, when they will be launched, they come down with five times the speed of sound, and they will take five or 10 minutes longer to reach Madrid or London than they take to reach Tallin or Vilnius.”</p> 
  <p>“ So in that sense, let’s agree that within this alliance for 32 countries, we all live on the eastern flank,” he says.</p> 
  <p><strong>Grynkewich </strong>makes a very similar point as he draws on his first-hand experience “from my time in the Middle East.”</p> 
  <p>He says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“The range that those drones can fly, and the paths that they can take, we are all vulnerable to them. So the eastern flank provides a first line of defence for this. </em></p> 
   <p><em>And if those drones get through that first line of defence, they can be paired with the ballistic missiles or other capabilities that hold the entire alliance at risk.</em></p> 
   <p><em>So I do think while it is an eastern sentry line that we’re working to defend, it is on behalf of the entire alliance that this is going forward.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>That ends the press conference.</p>

  <p>Time and time again, <strong>Rutte</strong> repeats the same argument as he says <strong>“the question … was it deliberate or not” is “relevant, but only to limited extend</strong>, because in the end it is reckless, unacceptable.”</p> 
  <p>“We cannot accept Russian drones entering European EU, Nato, Allied airspace. That is absolutely impossible, and that is why we need to defend ourselves against it,” he says.</p>

   <p><em>It was a bunch of Russian drones, even if they were not intent to go into Poland, if that will be the outcome of this… And of course, if it was the intent, there’s even more serious. <strong>But in both cases, it is reckless.

  <p>He insists that <strong>“we were postured fairly well for that event.”</strong></p> 
  <p>But he says that the new programme responds to the new threat, as <strong>he acknowledges that “the scale of that incursion being something that we hadn’t seen to this point.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“We had seen a few drones here and there a smaller number … if it had just been that we would have gotten them all, but, but, clearly, with the number that came across the border, <strong>it’s time to take a fresh look at this and we’re always learning,</strong>” he says.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Grynkewich </strong>gets asked if it’s time for allies to start shooting at drones already as they are on western Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>He sidesteps the question:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“What I would say is Eastern Sentry is focused on the defence of Alliance territory, and as of right now, I see no conflict between the support that individual nations are providing to Ukraine and what they are offering to contribute to this effort.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Both leaders get asked about Nato’s response and seemingly low rate of drones that were shot down on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p><strong>Grynkewich</strong> says it was “a highly successful operation,” although adds that “we always learn something in the debrief as we would say in the fighter business.”</p> 
  <p>He says that the scale of the incursion was larger than previously, and more resources will “help” going forward, including with lowering costs of defending the alliance.</p> 
  <p>He says he doesn’t want his soldiers “thinking about how much their weapons cost, I want them defending our citizens.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Rutte </strong>repeats with a broader warning:</p> 
  <blockquote>

 <h2 class="block-title">EU car industry lobby wants 'bold' action to speed up adoption of electric cars in commercial sector</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The slow transition of commercial vehicles including vans, trucks and buses from petrol and diesel to battery power is a major barrier for the EU in its effort to switch to electric vehicles on Europe’s roads,</strong> the European Commission was told today.</p> 
  <p>ACEA, the main European car industry body, told commission president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen </strong>at a summit today that <strong>“bold” action was needed to improve the switch over among laggard business owners.</strong></p> 
  <p>It said <strong>just 8.5% of vans on EU roads are electric</strong>, while trucks and buses represent just 3.5% of battery electric registrations.</p> 
  <p><strong>Lack of charging points on the public networks, lack of financial incentives to buy electric and grid capacity, are holding the transition back,</strong> the commission was told.</p> 
  <p>“Truck and bus makers are committed to Europe’s green transition: the vehicles are ready, but the enabling conditions are not” stated <strong>Christian Levin</strong>, CEO of Traton Group and Scania.</p> 
  <p>Electric car registrations now represent 15% of the market, with hybrid cars continuing to grow and now standing at 35%.</p> 
  <p>The car manufacturing lobby is <strong>campaigning for delays to the 2035 deadline to end the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles.</strong> Second hand cars could continue to be sold after this date however.</p>

  <p><strong>Ukraine is increasingly finding Russian and Belarusian circuit boards and computer chips in Iskander missiles, which have been used regularly by Russia since its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Reuters reports.</strong></p> 
  <p>“In the 2025 Iskander, compared to the 2022 Iskander, there are fewer European and US (components), and more from Russia and Belarus,” Vladyslav Vlasiuk, commissioner for sanctions policy and an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told reporters this week.</p> 
  <p>The ballistic version of the Iskander missile is particularly difficult to intercept because it travels at several times the speed of sound. The cruise version of the missile travels more slowly.</p> 
  <p>The chips appear to be of lower quality than Western ones, but they do not appear to affect the missiles’ performance, Vlasiuk said.</p> 
  <p>“They have the ability to make chips which are of poor quality - so far. After some time, they will get better,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Kyiv has often found Western electronics in Russian missiles and put pressure on manufacturers to tighten controls on their exports.</p> 
  <p>Belarus does not take an active part in the war in Ukraine but is a close ally of Russia and allowed its territory to be used as a staging ground for Moscow’s troops to launch their 2022 invasion.</p>

  <p>Mikola Statkevich, who had been in jail for five years, was due to cross into Lithuania on Thursday alongside 51 other political prisoners but got out of the bus just beforehand, Belarusian media reported.</p> 
  <p>Security camera footage published by Belarus’s border service showed a man resembling Statkevich sitting in a border zone between the two countries for several hours, before disappearing from view.</p> 
  <p>The 69-year-old, who ran against Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko in 2010, is a prominent member of the country’s opposition.</p> 
  <p>“He went towards Belarus, and after that all information about him was cut off,” Statkevich’s wife Marina Adamovich confirmed to AFP by phone.</p> 
  <p>She said his return to Belarus “was the only possible action for him in this situation”.</p> 
  <p>“Freedom is subjective, and in this case people were deprived of subjectivity. And I knew that Mikola would not allow this to happen,” she said.</p> 
  <p>Earlier on Friday, Belarus’s exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she was “worried about the fate” of Statkevich and that his whereabouts were now “unknown”.</p>

  <p><strong>France risks a downgrade on its ability to pay back debts, economists said, a move that would further complicate new prime minister Sebastien Lecornu’s task of drawing up a budget for next year.</strong></p> 
  <p>US ratings agency Fitch, one of the top global institutions gauging the financial solidity of sovereign borrowers, is to deliver its latest assessment of France’s creditworthiness later on Friday after Wall Street closes.</p> 
  <p>It comes only days after Lecornu’s predecessor Francois Bayrou lost a confidence vote in parliament over an attempt to get an austerity budget adopted, which he had hoped would cut the French deficit and tackle a growing debt mountain.</p> 
  <p>Fitch currently rates France’s ability to repay its sovereign debt at “AA-”, indicating “a very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments”, AFP reports.</p> 
  <p>A downgrade to A would imply that France’s debt repayment capacity may be “more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions”.</p> 
  <p>An agency rating downgrade typically raises the risk premium that investors demand of a government to buy sovereign bonds - although some financial experts suggested that the debt market already reflects the expected downgrade for France.</p>

  <p><strong>Spanish foreign minister José Manuel Albares has summoned the Israeli charge d’affaires in Madrid on Friday over recent comments about Spain made by the office of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</strong></p> 
  <p>Albares summoned Dana Erlich - currently Israel’s top diplomat in Madrid - to “categorically reject the false and slanderous statements from the Israeli prime minister’s office”, Spain’s foreign ministry said in a statement.</p> 
  <p>In an X post on Thursday, Netanyahu’s office had accused Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez of making “genocidal threats”, in reference to Sanchez’s announcement on Monday of new measures against Israel-bound arms and fuel deliveries, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>Sanchez had justified the measures by saying Spain lacked nuclear bombs, aircraft carriers or large oil reserves to exert pressure on Israel to stop what he qualified as “genocide”.</p> 
  <p>Israel has strongly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide, and it is fighting a case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague that accuses it of genocide.</p> 
  <p>The US State Department also expressed concern over Madrid’s limitations on ships and aircraft delivering weapons or military-grade jet fuel to Israel, as well as entry bans on the Israeli national security and finance ministers.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The EU’s consultation with the car industry over the 2035 target for phasing out petrol and diesel vehicles is about ensuring the sector is not “wiped out” by China and other countries</strong>, the European Commission has said. </p> 
  <p>Asked if an intervention could only happen if a “market failure” was proven in the sector, spokesperson <strong>Anna-Kaisa Itkonen</strong> said Europe had a “long tradition of producing small cars but they are not electric”. </p> 
  <p>“<strong>What is important is that we have electric vehicles that are accessible and affordable to customers</strong>, we are not saying what kind of cars people need to buy and use, but this is about the competitiveness of the European industry,” said Itkonen who said the Commission was trying to create “enabling conditions” to ensure EU brands survived the transition to electric. </p> 
  <p>“It is basically just <strong>ensuring that one area of one industry is not wiped out from Europe due to competition from third countries,</strong>” she said. </p> 
  <p>The <strong>European Commission met the car industry at a strategic dialogue this morning</strong> and will publish details later this afternoon.</p> 
  <p>It is also <strong>expected to launch an impact assessment on the current legislation on the 2035 target to phase out petrol and diesel cars</strong> after a consultation closes on 10 October. </p> 
  <p>The Commission said <strong>the impact assessment would be of “the legislation on current standards”.</strong> </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">EU car industry launches campaign to delay 2035 target for phasing out petrol cars</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Also in Brussels, <strong>the car industry formally launches it campaign to delay the EU’s 2035 target for phasing out petrol cars</strong> in a three hour summit with <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> and key personnel at the European Commission this morning.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>main car lobby, representing German, French and Italian manufacturers is pushing for “pragmatism” and “flexibility”</strong> around the existing 2035 target to end sales of new internal combustion engine (ICE) cars.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Government and regulators have not invested in, nor demanded, sufficient levels of infrastructure and grid upgrades are still missing. The consequence: 2030-2035 targets are no longer achievable.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>ACEA, the body which represents most of the EU’s car industry, including <strong>VW, Mercedes-Benz, Honda, Renault, BMW, Ford, Stellantis, Volvo</strong>, and <strong>Toyota</strong>, hopes a new regulation will be proposed by the Commission by the end of the year.</p> 
  <p><strong>Opponents, including the Chinese-owned Swedish brand Polestar, said the push for a delay is a smokescreen for their own failure to adapt to change in the face of Chinese imports</strong> and any delay would penalise Nordic brands who are ahead of the curve.</p> 
  <p>New data, released by S&amp;P Mobility, for ACEA, the European automotive trade body, showed that <strong>the take-up of EVs in the Nordics is the highest in Europe,</strong> representing the best performing of three clusters of EU countries it surveys.</p> 
  <p>In the middling cluster are <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>Ireland</strong> with the two large economies with the slowest cluster including <strong>Spain</strong> and <strong>Italy</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Reinhardt Schorsch</strong>, head of auto forecasting at S&amp;P Global, said Norway was “a wealthy country” that has seen drivers respond to EV incentives put in place by the government but not in place in countries like Germany.</p> 
  <p>He also said the new small cars from Renault including the retro electric Renault 4 posed challenges because of lower driving ranges. Norway’s EV was dominated by more expensive and bigger cars, he said.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Prince Harry has also made a surprise visit to Kyiv after an invitation from the Ukrainian government</strong>, saying he wanted to do “everything possible” to help the recovery of the thousands of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/26/ukraine-amputee-veterans-disability-war-invasion-daniel-melnyk-marta-syrko">military personnel who have been seriously injured</a> in the three-year war against Russia.</p> 
  <p>During the trip to the Ukrainian capital, he and a team from his Invictus Games Foundation are <strong>set to detail new initiatives to support the rehabilitation of the wounded</strong>, with the eventual aim of providing help to all areas of the country.</p> 
  <p>Earlier this year it was estimated that <strong>the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> war had already left 130,000 people with permanent disabilities</strong> – and the government has now put rehabilitation through sport at the heart of its policy for helping veterans.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to the Guardian on an overnight train to the capital, the Duke of Sussex said: <strong>“We cannot stop the war but what we can do is do everything we can to help the recovery process.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He added: “<strong>We can continue to humanise the people involved in this war and what they are going through.</strong> We have to keep it in the forefront of people’s minds. I hope this trip will help to bring it home to people because it’s easy to become desensitised to what has been going on.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: We wish it it was, but it wasn't a mistake</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Poland’s political leadership appears increasingly concerned by the muted US response to Thursday’s Russian drone incursion into Polish airspace.</strong></p> 
  <p>As more and more European partners condemn the incident and declare their support for Poland with concrete offers of help, <strong>the</strong> <strong>US president, Donald Trump, appeared to be more dismissive last night as he said it “could have been a mistake”.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Regardless, I’m not happy about anything having to do with that whole situation,” Trump told reporters, before adding in general terms: “But hopefully it’s going to come to an end.”</p> 
  <p>Overnight, Poland’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, <strong>Radosław Sikorski,</strong> said simply: <strong>“No, it wasn’t a mistake.”</strong></p> 
  <p>This was further followed by the country’s prime minister, <strong>Donald Tusk.</strong></p> 
  <p>“We would also wish that the drone attack on Poland was a mistake. But <strong>it wasn’t. And we know it,</strong>” Tusk said in a pointed social media rebuttal in English this morning.</p> 
  <p>The diplomatic offensive comes <strong>hours before the UN security council gathers in New York to discuss the incident</strong> <strong>on Poland’s request </strong>and we will no doubt hear more from Poland and its European allies in the build up to the meeting.</p>
