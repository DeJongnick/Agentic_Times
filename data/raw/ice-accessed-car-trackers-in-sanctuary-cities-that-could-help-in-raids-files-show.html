<p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">administration</a> ramps up its crackdown on undocumented immigrants to the US, advocates are increasingly worried immigration agents will turn to surveillance technology to round up those targeted for deportation, even in so-called “sanctuary cities” that limit the ways local law enforcement can cooperate with immigration officials.</p> <p>That’s because US Customs and Immigration Enforcement (Ice) in past years has gained <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/us-immigration-agency-data-loophole-information-deportation-targets">access</a> to troves of data from sanctuary cities that could aid its raids and enforcement actions. Among that information is data from the vast network of license plate readers active across the US, according to documents obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>Local agencies across the country use license plate readers, high-speed cameras that scan and capture images and <a href="https://www.openalpr.com/software/scout">videos</a> of every vehicle that passes, to collect information on vehicular activity, including the direction a vehicle is moving. They store those details in databases that are often shared with other local law enforcement agencies as well as federal ones. The volume of data gathered along with the wide breadth of bureaus that have access to it mean that federal agents in practice can often obtain information on individual immigrants gathered by local authorities those same agents are legally not allowed to work with.</p> <p>Take the example of Westchester county, New York, where police work with a license plate reader company named Rekor.</p> <p>Westchester, a 450-sq-mile mostly suburban area just north of New York City – has had laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities on the books since 2018. But documents including emails and access logs newly made public show Ice has had access in the past to a major database that holds license plate reader information collected across the county.</p> <p>Westchester county police said they managed a network of 480 such cameras as of January 2023. Westchester police provided these figures in response to a freedom of information law request and are the most up-to-date figures available on the scale of the county’s license plate surveillance network. In just the last week of January 2023, the cameras scanned 16.2m cars, according to these documents. That’s up from 14m scans across 346 cameras in March 2022, these emails show. Ice, Customs and Border Protection and the agency they fall under, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have all had access to this database as of February 2022, as do local law enforcement agencies outside New York state, these documents show. The license plate information that is stored in this database came from more than 20 cities across Westchester and spans two years.</p> <p>Neither Ice nor the Westchester county police department responded to questions about whether the federal agency still has access to the database.</p> <p>In the first few weeks of Donald Trump’s administration, a <a href="https://westfaironline.com/combined/more-ice-raid-activity-in-westchester/">flurry</a> of immigration enforcement activity across Westchester county prompted local mayors to reassure residents they were complying with local sanctuary laws and were not cooperating with Ice on these investigations. These laws “prohibit members of the police department from engaging in law enforcement activities solely for the purpose of enforcing federal immigration law, unless required to do so by a judicial warrant or other federal law”, the Peekskill mayor, Vivian C McKenzie, told the<a href="https://westfaironline.com/combined/more-ice-raid-activity-in-westchester/"> Westfair Business Journal</a>.</p> <p>The data sharing between the county police and Ice, illustrated in the documents the Guardian reviewed, appear to have sidestepped and undermined the county’s sanctuary city laws. It also means that Ice can potentially use data captured in Westchester to pursue immigration cases elsewhere, including in other sanctuary cities.</p> <p>“Westchester can be a sanctuary county or a surveillance state. It can’t be both. This sort of mass tracking violates the promise made to undocumented residents that they will be safe in the county,” Albert Fox Cahn, the director of the privacy advocacy group the <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/surveillance">Surveillance</a> Tech Oversight Project, said. “It’s unclear if Westchester county [was] violating the letter of its law, or merely its spirit, but either way it’s clear that immigrant communities are at risk.”</p> <p>Westchester county police, Ice and the mayors of several cities in the county did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p> <p>The documents, which Westchester county police made public in response to a freedom of information law request by a legal non-profit and shared exclusively with the Guardian, include a list of its “users”, or organizations that had access to this database as of February 2022. The non-profit asked not to be named to avoid compromising the federal grants the organization was awarded. In addition to Ice and the DHS, agencies listed as having access include the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Secret Service and the FBI.</p> <p>A separate list details individual users who have access to the database. Among the users were five individuals who had email addresses that ended in @ice.dhs.gov and two people with Secret Service email addresses ending in USSS.dhs.gov. There were 44 users with email addresses that end in FBI.gov, 40 with DOJ.gov addresses and just over a dozen featuring DEA.gov. Many of those included on the list indicated they were part of the investigative unit of their agency.<strong> </strong>It was not clear whether that list was current as of 2025 and if those users<strong> </strong>have ongoing access to the database.</p> <h2>A nationwide surveillance net</h2> <p>Rekor sells license plate readers and the software used to analyze their data to law enforcement agencies, though it is among the smaller companies in an ecosystem of many working in similar ways. Together, these companies’ license plate readers blanket the majority of the US. Access to more than one major network can enable law enforcement agencies to monitor people’s movements across the country.</p> <p>In addition to accessing local networks like Westchester’s, Ice uses the national database of Vigilant Solutions, a Motorola subsidiary which offers license-plate reading technology that competes with Rekor for contracts with local law enforcement and business across the US. In 2019, <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/records-reveal-ice-using-mass-surveillance-database-track-people-aid-local-law">documents</a> obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) revealed 9,000 Ice agents had access to the database of Vigilant Solutions.</p> <p>Privacy and civil liberty experts argue these technologies create a vast surveillance dragnet wherein the movement of every vehicle in the US is being tracked and examined regardless of whether there is an active investigation. Residents of places where these cameras have been set up are beginning to push back.</p> <p>In October, residents of Norfolk, Virginia, sued the city for allegedly violating their fourth amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures by installing license plate readers from another Rekor competitor called Flock Safety. When announcing the contract to install 172 Flock cameras across Norfolk, the police chief, Mark Talbot, said his office wanted to create “a nice curtain of technology” that would make it “difficult to drive anywhere of any distance without running into a camera somewhere”. Lee Schmidt, one of the plaintiffs, said four of the cameras had fenced in his neighborhood.</p> <p>“He was outraged by the loss of privacy,” said Michael Soyfer, an attorney at the Institute of Justice who is representing the plaintiffs on this case. “He noticed that he basically couldn’t leave his neighborhood without one of the cameras picking it up.”</p> <p>Local law enforcement across the country sharing license plate data with each other and with federal agencies means that anyone’s movements are in effect being tracked across state lines, experts say.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/27/migrant-surveillance-trump">Ice contractor plans for surveillance boom under Trump migrant crackdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We’re moving to a day where someone getting in their car in New York City could drive to Boston or Washington and have their car basically map every moment of the drive,” Fox Cahn said. “It is profoundly and painfully ironic that American highways went from the symbol of freedom and the liberty of the open road to this metaphor for creeping surveillance and police control.”</p> <h2>Westchester police discuss more surveillance</h2> <p>In addition to informal data-sharing with various federal and local agencies inside and outside of New York state, emails show Westchester police actively discussed creating formal data-sharing relationships to enable a cross-county surveillance network, including with the New York police department and fire departments, as well as an out-of-state agency in Stamford, Connecticut.</p> <p>“If you get a chance I would love to discuss what possibilities exist with a Data Sharing plan,” a Westchester police lieutenant wrote in an email to an NYPD officer dated 10 March 2022. “We are currently at 346 cameras in Westchester with about 14 million reads per week. A lot of those reads are along the city line (Bronx).”</p> <p>The range of agencies and individuals that have access to this database is potentially far more expansive than those listed. Rekor advertises a nationwide law enforcement platform that allows any agency that uses it “to access real time data from any part of the network at no cost”, according to a company <a href="https://www.rekor.ai/post/rekor-systems-launches-public-safety-network">press release</a>. Announced in 2019, the platform would make real-time data on the “150 million plate reads” a month that Rekor collects across 30 states available to any agency that wanted to opt in.</p>
