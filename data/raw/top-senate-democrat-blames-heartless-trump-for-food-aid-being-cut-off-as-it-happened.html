The numbers were similar to data from April 2024, when the question concerned <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s performance as president – a sign of long-term dissatisfaction with governance across the country across parties.</p> <p>“These numbers are not particularly strong for the Trump administration, especially considering we’re in the first year of his second term,” said <strong>Rodrigo Castro Cornejo</strong>, a political science professor and associate director of the university’s Center for Public Opinion.</p> <p>In Wisconsin, Marquette University Law School <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/">found</a> that inflation and the cost of living was the top concern of the 846 registered voters surveyed, with immigration in second and health insurance third. There was, however a partisan split over the top issue: for Republicans, it was immigration, while Democrats and independents were most concerned about inflation.</p> <p>When it came to Trump, 57% of those surveyed in Wisconsin thought his policies would cause prices to rise, 30% believed they will cause it to fall and 12% think they will have no effect. There was a substantial partisan split here, too, with Republicans more likely to see him as effective against inflation, and Democrats much less so.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690279248f08358f328d38b3" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T20:38:08.682Z">8.38pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Democratic senators urge Trump 'not to negotiate away' national security in meeting with Xi</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>With <strong>Donald Trump</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/oct/29/donald-trump-south-korea-china-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-690215bb8f08230808242c45#block-690215bb8f08230808242c45">set to meet</a> China’s president <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> in South Korea on Thursday (which will be 10pm on Wednesday in Washington DC), Democratic senators have asked him to protect the national security of the United States and its allies in what are expected to be high-stake trade talks.</p> <p>“Ahead of your meeting with President Xi Jinping in South Korea on Thursday, we write to urge you not to negotiate away America and our allies’ national security,” reads <a href="https://www.cortezmasto.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Letter-to-POTUS-re-PRC-Trade-Negotiations.pdf">the letter</a> signed by 12 Democratic senators, including minority leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong>.</p> <p>Saying that the Chinese Communist Party “poses a fundamental threat to US national security, economic prosperity, and global leadership”, they note that there has previously been bipartisan support for “export controls and investment screening mechanisms on critical technologies” being sent to China.</p> <p>“We are deeply disturbed by your recent statements and actions, which indicate that you are all too willing to sacrifice these vital national security tools for empty promises and illusory ‘wins,’” the senators write.</p> <p>They urge Trump not to relax restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States, allow a Treasury program that ensures US firms don’t help China develop sensitive technology to continue and to not agree to any statements that indicates the US “opposes” the independence of Taiwan.</p> <p>“America’s export controls, investment safeguards, and our longstanding security partnerships must not be on the negotiating table,” the Democrats said.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-29T20:42:28.068Z">at 8.42pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-690276df8f08358f328d3892" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T20:20:40.354Z">8.20pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Amid the logjam in Congress over reauthorizing government funding, two dozen states have sued the Trump administration over its plan to pause Snap on 1 November.

Taranto had previously been involved in the January 6 attack, and White and Valdivia noted his presence at the Capitol in a memo where they argued he should face a 27-month sentence on the gun charges.</p> <p>The story was first reported by ABC News. Here’s more, from Reuters:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Taranto had previously been charged for his role in the 2021 assault on the Capitol and was pardoned in January on Trump’s return to the White House.

A justice department spokesperson declined to comment and Reuters could not immediately reach the two attorneys for comment.</p> <p>The decision to place them on leave marks the latest in a string of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-top-federal-prosecutor-washington-dc-demotes-senior-leaders-sources-say-2025-02-28/">personnel actions</a> targeting justice department employees who worked on criminal or civil cases disfavored by Trump and his supporters. More than 200 prosecutors, agents and other personnel have been fired, some of whom worked on two criminal cases against Trump or on cases related to the attack on the Capitol.</p> <p>Taranto was convicted on gun charges after having “perpetrated a hoax” on 28 June 2023, in which he falsely claimed he would cause a car bomb to drive into the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p> <p>The next day, after Trump posted Obama’s purported address on social media, Taranto reposted it and began live-streaming himself as he drove into Obama’s neighborhood in Washington DC In the video, he said he was searching for “tunnels” to access private residences. Eventually he parked and walked into a restricted area protected by the US Secret Service where he stated: “Gotta get the shot, stop at nothing to get the shot.”</p> <p>In a search of his van, law enforcement found two firearms, a stabilizing brace and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-29T19:23:58.681Z">at 7.23pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6902611a8f08358f328d37a1" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T18:54:07.197Z">6.54pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">The day so far</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here’s a rundown of what’s been happening today:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The US government shutdown </strong>hit its 29th day, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/oct/29/donald-trump-south-korea-china-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-6902233c8f08d643140ecf45#block-6902233c8f08d643140ecf45">no indication</a> Democrats and Republicans were close to an agreement to restart funding.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Congressional Budget Office</strong>, a nonpartisan forecaster, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/oct/29/donald-trump-south-korea-china-latest-news-updates-live?page=with%3Ablock-690235668f08230808242e71#block-690235668f08230808242e71">predicted</a> the shutdown would negatively impact the economy, but much of its damage would be reversed when the government reopens.

Collection of important economic data has been indefinitely halted as employees at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are furloughed during the shutdown.</p> <p>The Fed typically studies BLS data to determine labor market conditions, including the number of new jobs added to the economy and the current unemployment rate. The last jobs report was released in early September, before the shutdown, and gave a relatively bleak <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/05/us-jobs-report-august-tariffs">snapshot</a> of the jobs market in August. The number of jobs added to the economy in August was down by more than 100,000 since the spring, and unemployment crept up to 4.3% – the highest since 2021.</p> <p>Though BLS was scheduled to release September’s job market report in early October, it suspended its release once the shutdown started. Private payroll firm ADP reported earlier this month that the private sector <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/private-payrolls-declined-in-september-by-32000-in-key-adp-report-coming-amid-shutdown-data-blackout.html">cut</a> 32,000 jobs in September, a sign that the job market is continuing to slow.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/29/federal-reserve-interest-rates">Fed cuts interest rates for second time this year amid economic uncertainty</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690256bb8f0828c07236c387" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T18:08:34.543Z">6.08pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Federal Reserve slashes interest rate again, notes 'somewhat elevated' inflation</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Federal Reserve has voted to slash its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point amid inflation that has remained “somewhat elevated” and an uncertain US economic outlook.</p> <p>The rate cut comes as the central bank shifts from fighting the inflation that plagued the economy’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic and towards bolstering economic growth and the labor market.</p> <p>“Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments.

The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate and judges that downside risks to employment rose in recent months.”</p> <p>The decision was endorsed by 10 of the committee’s 12 members. <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s former top economic adviser, <strong>Stephen Miran</strong>, dissented, arguing for a cut of a half a percentage point, in line with the president’s desire for lower interest rates. <strong>Jeffrey Schmid</strong> also did not vote for the decision, preferring not to lower the rate.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690252f48f0828c07236c357" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T17:52:00.987Z">5.52pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>US representative-elect <strong>Adelita Grijalva</strong>, a Democrat, has now been waiting 36 days to be sworn in to office, setting a new record that any member of Congress has had to wait following a special election, <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2025/10/29/grijalva-swearing-in-delay-shutdown">Axios reports</a>.</p> <p>The matter has become a political football, with House speaker <strong>Mike Johnson</strong> refusing to swear Grijalva in until the House is back in session.</p> <p>The House speaker is able to swear in new members during “pro forma” sessions when the House isn’t in session, as Johnson did earlier this year with two Florida Republicans, but he is declining to do so with Grijalva, of Arizona.</p> <p>She won almost 70% of the vote in the 23 September election for Arizona’s 7th congressional district.

The funds help families pay winter heating and summer cooling bills, with about 80% used in the winter months.</p> <p>States typically receive their allocations in late October or November, and the funds are distributed to households in November and December.</p> <p>Republican representative <strong>Brian Fitzpatrick</strong> of Pennsylvania called on health secretary <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong> to ensure uninterrupted LIHEAP funding during the shutdown.</p> <p>“No household should have to choose between keeping their homes at safe temperatures, basic healthcare, or having food on the table,” Fitzpatrick said in a letter to Kennedy, calling on HHS to use every available authority and mechanism to maintain LIHEAP operations without interruption and to communicate with states and providers to prevent service gaps that would endanger communities.</p> <p>Officials in Minnesota and New York have also warned residents that funds may be delayed. The program assisted 1.5 million New York households last year, governor <strong>Kathy Hochul</strong>’s office said in a statement last week. “Thanks to Washington Republicans’ government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of vulnerable New Yorkers are about to be left in the cold,” she said.</p> <p>The Trump administration fired LIHEAP staff in April as part of wider cutbacks in the federal government, which also raised concerns about getting funds to states.</p> <p>Democratic representative <strong>Madeleine Dean</strong>, also of Pennsylvania, called the situation “unacceptable”. “While <strong>the most vulnerable among us pay the price for this shutdown</strong>, Republicans seem uninterested in ending it,” Dean posted on X.</p> <p>Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, said <strong>any delays in funding would be difficult for vulnerable Americans, 42 million of whom are also set to lose Snap</strong><strong> food aid</strong>, which is set to lapse on Saturday.</p> <p>“If the shutdown continues, the lives of low-income families, the lives of poor families, in the United States will just become much harder,” Wolfe told Reuters. “A $500 grant for energy assistance might not sound like a lot to a middle-income family, but for a low-income family, that’s what allows them to buy heating oil to get the furnace started.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-29T17:40:05.721Z">at 5.40pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-690246a38f082aa93a7eb808" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T16:57:13.105Z">4.57pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Schumer ended his press conference by accusing Republicans of using people who rely on Snap “as hostages”.</strong></p> <p>Replying to a question about whether Democrats should take any responsibility if the food aid benefits ends on Saturday because of the shutdown, as the Trump administration says it will, Schumer replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We are saying the Republicans can fund it now, and they’re using these people as hostages, plain and simple … that’s the answer.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also linked Democrats’s insistence that Snap be funded with Republican’s refusal to negotiate over extending tax credits for Affordable Care Act premiums until the government is reopened:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>And by the way, we don’t want to pit health care and food – they do.

And they are a tax that is imposed by a single person: Donald J Trump,” Kaine said in a floor speech.</p> <p>While Congressional Republicans have largely declined to rein in the president, Tuesday’s vote revealed an underlying discontent with Trump’s tariffs.</p> <p>“Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive. The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule,” Republican Mitch McConnell said in a statement on Tuesday. “And no cross-eyed reading of Reagan will reveal otherwise.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/us-senate-trump-tariffs-brazil">US Senate passes bill with Republican support to rescind Trump’s tariffs on Brazil</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6901fc4b8f082a2c2074bed6" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/maanvi-singh"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T11:37:10.292Z">11.37am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> remains barred from deploying the national guard in Portland, Oregon, following a federal appeals court ruling.</strong></p> <p>The ninth circuit court of appeals agreed on Tuesday that it would rehear a case over the president’s authority with a broader court of 11 judges.

Some staged a performance depicting the US president bound with rope, while others waved red cards and chanted slogans such as ‘No kings, Trump not welcome’ and ‘No to APEC’.</p> <p>Kwon Young-kook, leader of the Justice Party, criticized APEC for “catering to powerful nations instead of promoting genuine economic growth”.</p>    <p>It came as Trump and South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, finalised details of their fraught trade deal at a summit in South Korea on Wednesday, and the US president also sounded an optimistic note about a looming summit with China’s Xi Jinping.</p> <p>“We made our deal, pretty much finalized it,” Trump said at a dinner with Lee and other regional leaders on the sidelines of an Asia Pacific forum.</p> <p>Trump also said his meeting with Xi on Thursday was likely to be three to four hours long and he expected the talks to go well. The meeting is expected to focus on trying to strike a trade war truce.</p> <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The Republican-led US Senate has passed a measure that would terminate Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Brazilian imports, including coffee, beef and other products, in a rare bipartisan show of opposition to the president’s trade war.</strong> The vote passed 52-48.
