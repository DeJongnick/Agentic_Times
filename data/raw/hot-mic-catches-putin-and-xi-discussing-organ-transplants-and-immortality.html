<p>The authoritarian strongmen Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping have mused on how organ transplants might lead to immortality, during a brief exchange of small talk caught on a hot mic at a military parade.</p> 
<p>The Russian president was in Beijing on Wednesday with the Chinese leader, who hosted allies for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/china-military-parade-xi-jinping-appears-with-vladimir-putin-kim-jong-un">a ceremony to mark the 80th anniversary</a> of the end of the second world war.</p> 
<p>As Putin and Xi walked at the head of a delegation of foreign leaders, state media aired live footage that captured parts of what appeared to be a private conversation. While they made their way towards a raised platform in Tiananmen Square, Putin’s interpreter could be heard saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”</p> 
<p>After a brief inaudible passage, the interpreter added: “Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and [you can] even achieve immortality.”</p> 
<p>Xi, who was off camera, could be heard responding in Chinese: “Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.”</p> 
<p>Putin confirmed later to reporters he had discussed prospects for significantly increasing human life expectancy with Xi.</p> 
<p>Both leaders have shown little intention of relinquishing power in their lifetimes. In 2018, Xi <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/11/this-could-destroy-china-parliament-sets-xi-jinping-up-to-rule-for-life">abolished presidential term limits</a>, paving the way for him to rule indefinitely. Putin has also changed Russian law to allow him to remain in high office.</p>

<p>Sections of Russia’s elite, including Putin, have long been fascinated with longevity and the science of extending life.</p> 
<p>In 2024, Putin instructed lawmakers to establish a research centre called New Health Preservation Technologies, dedicated to combating ageing. The project focuses on developing “technologies that prevent cellular aging, neurotechnologies, and other innovations aimed at ensuring longevity”.</p> 
<p>According to an earlier <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2024/09/03/who-wants-to-live-forever">investigation</a> by the independent Russian outlet Meduza, Mikhail Kovalchuk, a longtime family confidant of Vladimir Putin, is leading Russia’s research into immortality, a subject that he and other influential figures close to the Kremlin are reportedly “obsessed” with. Meduza reported that Kovalchuk has invested in organ-printing technology that uses lab-grown cells to produce replacement organs.</p> 
<p>Putin’s eldest daughter, the endocrinologist Maria Vorontsova, has received multimillion-dollar Russian government grants to study cell renewal and ways to extend human health and longevity and is involved in a genetic research programme linked to Kovalchuk. When sanctions were passed on her by the US in 2022, the State Department said she was leading Kremlin-funded genetics programmes worth billions.</p> 
<p>Putin and Xi walked alongside the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, during their conversation, who was smiling and looking in the direction of Putin and Xi. It was not clear if their chat was being translated for him.</p> 
<p>Later footage showed the three leaders walking up the steps towards the viewing platform for the parade.</p> 
<p>The moment was carried on the livestream provided by the state broadcaster CCTV to other media, including the international newswires AP and Reuters.</p> 
<p>China’s largest-ever military parade included 50,000 spectators and a big display of military hardware, from tanks and drones to nuclear-capable missiles, fighter jets and stealth aircraft.</p> 
<p>The performance was seen as a show of defiance to the west. Other attenders included the president of Belarus, Aleksander Lukashenko, the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and Myanmar’s junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing.</p> 
<p>In his formal address, Xi told the crowd that the Chinese people stood firmly “on the right side of history”. He said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> was a great nation that was “never intimidated by any bullies” – in an apparent veiled reference to the US and its allies – and added that China was “unstoppable”.</p>
