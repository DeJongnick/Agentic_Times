<p>It was the week in which Republicans took a beating at the polls, the government shutdown became the longest in history, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-snap-benefits-reactions">42 million people</a> across the country, including 3 million in Florida, saw their federal food aid slashed.</p> <p>But in the alternative reality of Miami, where tickets to an overwhelmingly conservative business conference headlined by Donald Trump cost up to $1,990, and billionaires from Saudi Arabia rubbed shoulders with equally wealthy American tycoons such as Jeff Bezos and Ken Griffin, those events created barely a ripple.</p> <p>Instead, in a gesture that appeared almost to mock the widening disparity between the city’s haves and have-nots, organizers of the America Business Forum cooked up a little treat for attendees: a $50 gift card to spend on food to sustain themselves while they listened to their president congratulate himself for a “golden age” he said his “economic miracle” had delivered.</p> <p>Advocates say the move, along with the high-budget opulence of the conference itself, was an ill-timed insult to more than a half-million Miami-Dade county residents who just saw their own ability to buy essential groceries for their families kiboshed by the gutting of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap).</p> <p>“There’s just a massive cognitive dissonance between what real people are going through, and the elite,” said Larry Hannan, communications and policy director of State Voices Florida, a coalition of more than a hundred non-partisan, pro-democracy and civic engagement groups.</p> <p>“Jeff Bezos does not need a $50 food card. But we saw that with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/04/late-night-hosts-jon-stewart-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel-seth-meyers">Great Gatsby theme party</a> last week. They just can’t seem to stop doing things that are shockingly out of touch.</p> <p>“We’ve been through shutdowns before, and while obviously the White House bubble is always somewhat insane, presidents are usually smart enough, they usually know not to flaunt this type of stuff. But this administration does not seem to care.”</p> <p>The president’s hour-long address on Thursday had the flavor of a political rally, with familiar insults for old political foes such as the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, and a new one: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/nov/05/the-guardian-view-on-zohran-mamdanis-victory-in-new-york-the-democrats-can-build-on-an-uplifting-night">Zohran Mamdani</a>, the newly elected democratic socialist mayor of New York.</p>    <p>Trump touched on his economic agenda, and lauded a host of speakers from the worlds of politics, sport and business that filled the two-day agenda, created largely by Francis Suarez, mayor of the city of Miami, to showcase south Florida and its investment opportunities.</p> <p>Lionel Messi, the Argentina soccer star and World Cup winner, provided celebrity glitz from sporting circles, along with tennis champions Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams. A conversation between Suarez and María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader and democracy activist who last month <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/10/venezuelan-politician-maria-corina-machado-wins-nobel-peace-prize">won the Nobel peace prize</a> that Trump coveted, was well received on day one.</p> <p>Yet overall it was a curious and unmistakably politically charged event with a field of Trump sycophants on the stage, loudly cheered by a crowd of mostly younger and affluent supporters of the president in the audience, some blending business suits with his trademark red Make America Great Again (Maga) caps.</p> <p>How else to explain the presence of Javier Milei, the rightwing president of Argentina, the country whose shaky economy Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/20/argentina-us-currency-swap-bailout">helped shore up last month</a> with a $20bn currency swap lifeline? Or that of Saudi Arabians Fahad AlSaif, head of its <a href="https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/who-we-are/">$925bn Public Investment Fund</a>, and Reema Bandar Al-Saud, Riyadh’s ambassador to the US, touting their country as ripe for investment while the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/29/jared-kushner-financial-ties-trump">Trump family’s financial ties</a> and <a href="https://democracyforward.org/work/uncovering-trumps-ties-to-saudi-investment-funds/">influence</a> there come under greater scrutiny?</p> <p>Then there was Gianni Infantino, head of Fifa, international soccer’s governing body, dropping hints that Trump is in line for the organization’s first peace prize, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/06/we-love-football-micky-van-de-ven-goal-fifa-peace-prize-gianni-infantino">an unwanted new award</a> that observers see created specially for the president as consolation for his Nobel snub.</p> <p>Other speakers, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/21/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-defends-trump">Jamie Dimon</a>, the chief executive of JP Morgan; <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/11/inside-the-fall-of-wework?srsltid=AfmBOooTYYBCoNuNww_H5BK2T9Z0NVaDF54L3MmCfEs5RrpMr7Vy5Lrr">Adam Neumann</a>, founder of WeWork and Flow; and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/04/business/dealbook/ken-griffin-trump-election.html">Griffin</a>, the hedge-fund manager and Republican donor; have all previously praised, worked with or voted for Trump, offering more than a suggestion of a politically skewed lineup.</p> <p>Suarez, unsurprisingly, saw it differently.</p> <p>“We wanted it to be a sort of a cross-section from different verticals, right?” he told the Guardian.</p> <p>“We got in a room. We said, ‘Hey, what are the leading voices?’ People from different backgrounds, different ethnicities, different genders … sports, business, politics, technology, things that touch everyone’s lives.”</p> <p>He pointed to discussions of upcoming, money-spinning notable events in Miami, including the Formula One grand prix, next year’s G20 economic summit <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-g20-summit-2026-doral-resort-florida/">at Trump’s Doral golf resort</a>, and games during the 2026 World Cup, which he called “a generational opportunity”.</p> <p>“Our hope is that Miamians are transformed by the experience,” Suarez said. “We want them to leave thinking, ‘I can be on that stage.’”</p>    <p>The advocates of State Voices Florida, however, believe many Miamians are more focused right now on other issues, especially soaring housing and food costs. Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2025/11/03/florida-snap-desantis-emergency-food-bank-support/">rejected a call</a> from Hannan’s group and others to declare an emergency over Snap benefits and tap state reserves to fund urgent food distribution.</p> <p>“Any civics teacher would tell you it’s his job to look after the people of Florida, and he’s doing the exact opposite,” Hannan said, noting the juxtaposition of a conference of billionaires taking place in the same county in which almost 25% of households rely on Snap benefits to survive.</p> <p>“There just seems to be this detachment at the top. I don’t think the answer is electing a Democrat or electing a Republican, I just think we have to have more empathy for people who are struggling in this state.”</p> <p>Empathy was in short supply in Miami from Trump, a president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency-sketch">not known for ever taking responsibility</a> during a crisis.</p> <p>“The radical left Democrats are causing millions of Americans who depend on food stamps to go without benefits,” he said, blaming the out-of-office opposition party for the government shutdown.</p> <p>“I just want to have a country that’s great again. Is that OK?”</p>
