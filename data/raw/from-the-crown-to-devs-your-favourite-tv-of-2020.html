<h2><strong>The Crown (Netflix)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘An amazing job of their portrayals’: Jackie Harding, 60, writer, the Netherlands</strong></p> <p>Being a Brit of a certain age I was a huge fan of Princess Diana and although I’m very aware that this show is fiction, not fact, it does come across as very believable. The cast does such an amazing job of their portrayals it is difficult at times not to think you are watching a reality show!</p> <h2><strong>Dark (Netflix)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘Brilliant stuff’: Michael, 42, digital marketing freelancer, Edinburgh</strong></p> <p>Season three was a breathtaking finale to one of the best shows I’ve ever seen. With its hugely complex plot and timelines, I felt sure that the ending would inevitably disappoint through having to compromise or fudge some of the ‘rules’. Not a bit of it. It remained compelling and true to itself until the final seconds and was probably the most satisfyingly wrapped-up story it could have been. Brilliant stuff.</p> <h2><strong>Industry (BBC Two)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘Fantastically well-written’: Jack, London</strong></p> <p>It was much more nuanced and interesting than the sex and drugs headlines suggested. I read it as an often painful, and sad, statement on our class system. Absolutely brilliant TV. Fantastically well-written.</p> <h2><strong>I May Destroy You (BBC One)</strong></h2>    <p><strong>‘Unforgettable’: Victoria, archive producer, Lichfield</strong></p> <p>It was groundbreaking and the most innovative programme I’ve seen on TV since Twin Peaks: the Return. The final episode which played out the different scenarios for how Arabella dealt with her ordeal was incredible, and unforgettable television.</p> <p><strong>‘Wow’: Sarah, academic, Twickenham</strong></p> <p>Magnificent, startlingly original, compelling and intelligent. Wow, Michaela Coel is a genius.</p> <h2><strong>Schitt’s Creek (</strong><strong>Netflix)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘The costumes were superb’: Anonymous, Bath</strong></p> <p>Wonderful story with fantastic characters. Each member of the rich family learn about themselves and each other and as a result, become a very closely-knit family. The costumes were superb and I loved the way nobody in the small town batted an eyelid at the outrageousness of them. Not just a happy ending but one with meaning.</p> <h2><strong>Gogglebox (Channel 4)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘The most consistently topical and funny program’: Tony, retired, Droitwich Spa</strong></p> <p>It is by far the most consistently topical and funny program on TV. There’s a little acting going on but it’s just as you would expect in any household situation without cameras. The best ones for me are Giles and Mary and the Caravan lot but the brother and sister [Sophie and Pete] are always very clever with their observations and humour.</p> <h2><strong>Le Bureau des Légendes/The Bureau (</strong><strong>Amazon)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘Decent people trying their best to make things better’: Adrian, Sydney</strong></p> <p>It’s based around true-life events inside the French secret service, DGSE. The beautifully produced show highlights the incredible danger and pressure these civil servants get put under whilst trying to live normally. The show has fantastic plots but more importantly, it is about decent people trying their best to make things better.</p> <h2><strong>Unorthodox (Netflix)</strong></h2>    <p><strong>‘A beautiful story’: J, London</strong></p> <p>By far the best show of the year. A beautiful story that made us learn more about a historically underrepresented community.</p> <h2><strong>Tales from the Loop (</strong><strong>Amazon)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘It’s stayed with me all year’: Mike, 57, librarian, Melbourne in Australia</strong></p> <p>A beautiful adaptation of Simon Stalenhag’s haunting illustrations. Full of warmth, humanity, mystery and emotion. It has stayed with me all year; it’s emotional final episode is still resonating. Not just one of my favourite TV shows of the year but one of the most beautiful works of filmed drama I have ever seen.</p> <h2><strong>Two Weeks to Live (Sky One)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘Clever twists throughout’: Phil Fenerty, Southport</strong></p> <p>A comedy-drama which gave Maisie Williams the chance to show that she had more in her repertoire than looking moody and throwing knives. It helped that the writing was cleverly balancing deep peril, high drama and broad comedy in equal measure. The supporting cast was outstanding, and there were clever twists throughout.</p> <h2><strong>The Queen’s Gambit (Netflix)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘It has characters you can feel’ - Stephen Tyler, programme director, West Sussex</strong></p> <p>Brilliant, engaging, well-paced and beautifully shot. It’s a great story and has characters that you can feel.</p> <p><strong>‘Stunning’: Chris, Los Angeles in the US</strong></p> <p>Visually and cerebrally stunning. Can we please get a second season that focuses on Moses Ingram’s Jolene?!</p> <h2><strong>Lovecraft Country (</strong><strong>Sky Atlantic)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘I’ve been recommending it to friends’: Viki,50, research project manager, Sale</strong></p> <p>I don’t really like horror but I loved this. The blending of sci-fi with the real-life horrors of Black Americans was very powerful. The acting was top-notch. This is the series I’ve been recommending to so many of my friends.</p> <h2><strong>Strictly Come Dancing (BBC One)</strong></h2>    <p><strong>‘It’s about happiness’: Sara, Liverpool</strong></p> <p>It’s something happy to watch on TV instead of all the negative news broadcasted to us all which increases people’s anxiety levels and causes mass hysteria. I love that Strictly is about happiness made by all the celebrities that participate in the programme, and good memories that they will treasure forever.</p> <h2><strong>Normal People (BBC Three</strong><strong>)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘Surprisingly immersing’: Anonymous, Germany</strong></p> <p>I am a much older viewer so it was surprisingly immersing for me since it tells a story of young love and relationships. Still, it threw me way back to my 20s, to confusing emotions, irrational behaviours, and the longing to find that one person, that understands everything. A beautiful film version of the book with two intense main actors I could not look away from.</p> <h2><strong>Devs (</strong><strong>Amazon)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘Fascinating’: Nick Smale, Stockport</strong></p> <p>The Alex Garland drama about strange goings-on at a Google-esque California tech company explored a real and fascinating scientific and philosophical issue: free will vs determinism. I thought they did it in an interesting and dramatic fashion that couldn’t have been done any other way.</p> <h2><strong>Ted Lasso (Apple TV+)</strong></h2> <p><strong>‘Breath of fresh air’: Benjamin Hendy, Southampton</strong></p> <p>At first, it felt like a gentle and pleasant comedy but the longer it went on it became clear it was a show with real heart and maturity. In a year in which so much in the world has been negative, the way in which Ted Lasso deals with every negative thing with resounding positivity was a breath of fresh air.</p>
