<p>Fascism is supposed to look a certain way: black-clad, uniformed, synchronised and menacing. It is not supposed to look like an overweight president who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DT7Scg2okMs">can’t pronounce acetaminophen</a> and who bumbles, for a full minute, about how he would have renovated the UN’s New York headquarters with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/24/trump-delivered-an-embarassing-performance-at-the-un-general-assembly">marble floors, rather than a terrazzo</a>. But as Umberto Eco remarked in his <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism">timeless essay</a> on identifying the eternal nature of fascism: “Life is not that simple. Ur-Fascism can come back under the most innocent of disguises.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2025/05/03/is-trumpism-a-form-of-fascism-two-historians-debate_6740864_23.html">Historians</a>, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/a-scary-place-jason-stanley-on-leaving-trumps-america/a-72139576">scholars</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/23/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/esper-backs-kelly-00185125">even some insiders</a> from the first Trump administration have seen through the comedic quality of the disguise. They appear to have seen in Donald Trump himself and those around him, Eco’s core criteria: the call to tradition and the rejection of reason, the fear of difference, the hostility towards disagreement, the ressentiment, the machismo, the degradation of language into newspeak, the cult of a “strong” leader. Almost a year ago, the historian Robert Paxton, in explaining why he had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/magazine/robert-paxton-facism.html">changed his mind</a> about employing the word to describe Trumpism, remarked: “It’s bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that’s very much like the original fascisms. It’s the real thing. It really is.”</p> <p>Since then, the Trump administration has deployed the US military and National Guard to cities against the will of their state governors. It has put pressure on state legislatures to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/putin-trump-elections-autocrat/684298/">disenfranchise opposition voters</a> in extraordinary ways, and floated the idea of disenfranchising all voters residing outside the US by ending mail-in voting. It has used the power of the state to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/09/maga-cancel-culture-revenge-tactics/684296/">censor books</a>, bully the media and “cancel” comedians who regularly make fun of Trump. It has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/06/trump-expansion-of-presidential-powers">seized executive power</a> in alarming and potentially illegal ways, including the use of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/26/trump-kitchen-sink-tariffs">tariffs</a>, immigration policy and targeted exemptions to generate subservience among powerful corporate actors.</p> <p>An over-fixation on whether actions are legal or not misses the forest for the trees: constitutionality is, practically speaking, whatever the supreme court decides. If the supreme court acquiesces to fundamental changes in the nature of what the US is, that is merely one more sign of how deep the rot goes. And from <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-fascist-actions-president-guide-1235299183/">concrete policy</a> to the decision to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/trump-fascist-icons-tearing-down-real-heroes-1235404378/">publicly venerate the Confederacy</a>, the intended direction of travel is clear.</p> <p>The disguise dropped a little bit more, in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/10/charlie-kirk-shot-utah">Charlie Kirk’s murder</a> – one more tragic datapoint in the merging of the US’s epidemic of gun violence and its growing <a href="https://www.liberation.fr/international/amerique/aux-etats-unis-lextreme-droite-est-impliquee-dans-93-des-meurtres-extremistes-20250913_EJY5W3BD6FCDPEBB3L2LL3NKC4/">political violence</a>. At his strange funeral-rally-spectacle, Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MLRcf3diso">a speech</a> dripping with everything Eco <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/investigating-whether-stephen-millers-speech-130000145.html">sought to warn us against</a>, raging against a diffuse “they” who “cannot conceive of the army they have arisen in all of us”. “You are nothing,” Miller continued. “You have nothing. You are wickedness. You are jealousy. You are envy. You are hatred. You are nothing. You can build nothing. You can produce nothing.”</p> <p>In the past year, as Trump and those behind him have dismantled the institutions of US democracy with incredible speed, the European conversation finally moved from denial to attempts at bargaining, with some acceptance of US disengagement and disinterest going forward. But there has been almost no space for a high-level, public conversation about what to do when the US government is, for the foreseeable future, in the hands of actors hostile to the EU’s basic raison d’être and its values.</p> <p>I understand why European leaders don’t want to have this conversation openly with voters. They fear that alienating Trump, even slightly, will lead him to drop US support for Ukraine. The cleverest think they can buy time by flattering Trump, manipulating him just long enough to find a better footing, while the blindly optimistic look to the 2026 midterms as an inflection point, and some sort of “return to normal”. But the midterms will not save us. As the Democrats’ elections attorney Marc Elias <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/is-the-2026-election-already-in-danger">laid out in detail</a> for The New Yorker, the 2026 elections will probably not be wholly free and fair, and even where they are, Trump’s prior history of insurrection indicates that the results very well might not be honoured. And Trump is already laying the groundwork to drop Ukraine <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/66308c61-9296-47ac-b4a8-fca894abfd25">fully into Europe’s lap</a>.</p> <p>During the first Trump administration, we heard, ad nauseam, that he should be taken seriously, but not literally. It was a mistake then, and it’s a mistake now. When Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUVIGxMVD0E">says</a>, “I hate my opponent and I don’t want the best for them”, we in Europe (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/15/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-helsinki-russia-indictments">“a foe,”</a> remember?) should take him literally. The radical authoritarian agenda the Trump administration is pursuing domestically matters to Europe. A US with a new, masked, secret immigration police with nearly unlimited funds, whose “red” government deploys its military to “blue” cities, and uses the criminal justice system to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dded6ac1-505c-4994-8e89-5feeb421c625">exact retribution</a> on political opponents at <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/20/trump-bondi-truth-social-00574380">the president’s behest</a> – in short, the end of the rule of law – necessarily affects European democracy. Not least, because the Trump administration is engaged in <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/reality-show-why-europe-must-not-cave-in-trumps-culture-war/">a culture war against Europe</a>, promoting forces that seek to destroy it as it currently exists.</p> <p>European voters are out in front of the politicians on this one. The <a href="https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/api/deliverable/download/file?deliverableId=100500">spring Eurobarometer survey</a> showed that large majorities of citizens want the EU to protect them from crises and security risks, think the EU needs more financial means to do so, and support that new funding coming from the EU as a whole, rather than member states alone. A survey of the EU’s five biggest states, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Poland, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/majority-in-eu-biggest-states-believes-bloc-sold-out-in-us-tariff-deal-poll-donald-trump">found</a> that 52% think the EU was humiliated in the recent trade deal with the US. They blame the commission for not “defending” Europe more ardently, with <a href="https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2025/09/09/10-points-eurobazooka/">a strong minority of 39% </a>wanting the bloc to become more “oppositional” to Trump.</p> <p>Timothy Garton Ash recently gave Americans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/us-americans-republic-midterm-elections-democrats">400 days to save their democracy</a>. As an American, I don’t think the country has that long. As Europeans, we should assume that it does not.</p> <p>Europeans are ready for an honest conversation about the challenge Europe faces from Trump – the same way they’ve solidified in the face of aggression from Vladimir Putin. The danger lies in Europe’s leaders fudging, hesitating and avoiding this conversation. If they cannot lead with candour, voters will conclude that European democracy and its institutions are too weak to withstand the pincer move that is building against it.</p> <ul> <li><p>Alexander Hurst is a Guardian Europe columnist</p></li> </ul> <p><br><br></p>
