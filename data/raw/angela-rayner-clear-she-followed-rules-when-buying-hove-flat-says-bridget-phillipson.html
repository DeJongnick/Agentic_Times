<p>Bridget Phillipson has defended her cabinet colleague Angela Rayner over accusations the deputy prime minister avoided tax when buying a seaside property in East Sussex.</p> <p>The education secretary said Rayner had the right to buy the £800,000 flat in Hove “so long as she followed all the rules”, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/08/24/angela-rayner-defends-800000-seafront-hove-home/">after reports</a> Rayner had avoided £40,000 in stamp duty by listing it as the only property she owns.</p> <p>Conservatives have accused Rayner, who is also the housing secretary, of hypocrisy given she has also listed her Greater Manchester home as her primary residence, in a move that allowed her to avoid £2,000 in council tax on her government-owned flat in central London.</p> <p>Phillipson told Times Radio on Sunday: “Angela Rayner has been clear that she followed all the rules and requirements of her, that she has followed the rules completely.</p> <p>“That is her position, that she has done everything that has been asked of her.”</p> <p>Asked whether it was hypocritical for Rayner to buy the flat in Hove, Phillipson replied: “If an individual wants to buy a property, whether that individual is Angela Rayner or anybody else, they are entirely within their rights to spend their money as they choose … Angela Rayner, as an adult with a salary, is able to make choices about how she spends her own money.”</p> <p>She added: “So long as she’s followed all of the rules and requirements as a part of that, then I don’t think there’s anything more.”</p> <p>Rayner has been under pressure since it emerged she had bought the flat weeks after removing her name from the deed of her constituency home in Ashton-under-Lyne. </p> <p>Because she was not listed as one of the owners of the Greater Manchester home, she avoided having to pay a higher rate of stamp duty, which is applicable to purchases of second homes.</p> <p>She is reported to have sold her stake in the Ashton house to pay for the flat in Hove.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister is reported to have separately listed the constituency home as her primary residence, meaning she did not have to pay council tax on her grace-and-favour apartment in Admiralty House on Whitehall, London.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15050439/Rayner-used-wealth-protection-firm-house-deal.html">Mail on Sunday reported</a> over the weekend that Rayner had in 2023 split the ownership of the Ashton house with a trust administered by the law firm Shoosmiths.</p> <p>Rayner’s office did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>The row has been given extra prominence in the run-up to the budget, amid reports that Labour is planning to increase property taxes as a way of avoiding a multibillion-pound shortfall in public spending.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, is said to be considering a range of options including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/18/rachel-reeves-stamp-duty-property-tax-council-tax">an annual property tax</a> to replace stamp duty entirely.</p> <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, will seek to highlight those reports on Monday during a visit to meet homeowners in Reigate in Surrey alongside the shadow housing secretary, James Cleverly.</p> <p>Badenoch said on Sunday: “Labour look set to wage a new war on family homes with more taxes like those that Labour ministers seemingly want to avoid paying themselves.”</p>
