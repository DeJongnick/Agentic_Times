<p>This month the new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/17/everything-you-need-to-know-about-australias-new-home-battery-subsidy">federal battery rebate</a> kicked off.</p> <p>It reminded me of 2008. I was working at the CSIRO and watching the solar boom take off thanks to the new $8,000 solar rebate for 1kW of panels. Consumers were excited, but most had no idea what they were buying or who to trust.</p> <p>The rebate triggered an influx of dodgy operators who would whack 1kW of cheap, nasty panels on your roof paired with a rubbish inverter, charge $500 total and still make a profit.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/09/australians-could-cut-power-bills-by-90-if-they-made-their-homes-more-energy-efficient-report-finds">Australians could cut power bills by 90% if they made their homes more energy efficient, report finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sometimes they charged $0 and threw in a Myer voucher to seal the deal. Yes, they’d <em>pay</em> you to go solar. It was the wild west. Those cheap 1kW systems were sometimes ineffective, often dangerously installed and dumped in landfills way too soon. </p> <p>Sixteen years later, it’s happening again. The approximately $350 a kilowatt hour battery rebate has triggered a rush. I’ve already seen ads offering 46 kWh of battery storage “FREE” when you buy solar.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/sign-up-for-the-clear-air-australia-environment-newsletter-with-adam-morton">Get Guardian Australia environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as an email</a></p></li> </ul> <p>They’ve clearly found a way to get batteries from wholesalers for less than the rebate. Personally, I wouldn’t go near these deals.</p> <p>Batteries are serious gear. They store huge amounts of energy. They need proper installation and careful configuration. Most importantly, when feed-in tariffs shift (as they constantly do), you need a relationship with your installer to update how the battery works with the grid to maximise your savings.</p> <p>So here’s my advice, based on 16 years watching what happens when rebates attract cowboys:</p> <ul> <li><p>Choose well-known brands. Be extremely wary of mystery batteries that popped up yesterday and cost half as much as anything else.</p></li> <li><p>Use a local installer with a solid track record – someone who has been around and will still be around when you need them.</p></li> <li><p>Read the 1-star reviews. They often reveal the stuff that really matters: ghosting customers, shoddy work, or warranty nightmares.</p></li> <li><p>Slow down. The rebate isn’t vanishing tomorrow. Yes, it reduces on Jan 1 but things are mad right now. You might get a better result waiting a few months.</p></li> <li><p>Think about sizing. A battery that’s too small will frustrate you, and one that’s too big may never fill. For most households (unless you’re planning to gamble on Amber), 15-20 kWh is the sweet spot.</p></li> <li><p>Check your solar capacity. There’s no point having a giant battery you can’t fill. If you want to reduce your reliance on your electricity retailer, ensure your solar is up to the job.</p></li> <li><p>Reward good installers. If the crew that did your original solar were great and they sell the battery you want, go back to them. If not, get multiple quotes.</p></li> </ul> <p>This rebate could help thousands of households get batteries that work well, and more than pay for themselves over at least the next 15 years. But only if those households choose carefully. Don’t let history repeat itself.</p> <ul> <li><p>Finn Peacock is the founder of solarquotes.com.au</p></li> </ul>
