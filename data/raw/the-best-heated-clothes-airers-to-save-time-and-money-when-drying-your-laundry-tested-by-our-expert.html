<p>An energy crisis and a drizzly autumn are conspiring to keep the nation’s laundry damp, not least by making it such a turn-off to turn on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/07/the-8-best-electric-heaters-tried-and-tested-from-traditional-stove-style-units-to-modern-smart-models">heating</a>. No wonder heated clothes airers are having a moment. These modish appliances sell out within hours of reaching shops and inspire evangelistic fervour among owners, who call them “life-savers” and “gamechangers”.</p> <p>Can a hot clothes horse really change your life, let alone dry your washing as fast as a tumble dryer for a fraction of the cost and with none of the noise? I needed to be convinced, so I put 14 bestsellers through their paces with my soggy washing to find out whether they’re the best thing in laundry since the clothes peg – or destined for the loft.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Best heated clothes airer overall:</strong> <br>Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer and cover </p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.lakeland.co.uk/25597/dry-soon-deluxe-3-tier-heated-airer-and-cover-bundle" > £204.98 at Lakeland </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best budget heated airer:</strong><br>Black+Decker heated winged clothes airer</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/black-and-decker-winged-heated-airer-1000270495" > £45 at Dunelm </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best heated airer for fast drying:</strong><br>Minky SureDri heat pod drying system</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4013907" > £90 at Argos </a>  <p>***</p> <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>I’ve spent three decades testing products from Sky boxes to mattress toppers, and it’s made me professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically solve domestic problems. I also have a solid background in procrastinating by doing laundry, hanging laundry and folding laundry, so I couldn’t resist the Filter’s offer to pay me to watch clothes dry.</p>    <h2>How I tested</h2> <p>Heated airers all do much the same thing in much the same way. There are small differences in design – some have triangle frames, some are winged and some have covers – but they’re basically all clothes horses that you plug in. I had to find clear distinctions between them, and this chiefly meant devising fair, quantifiable tests to measure how quickly, evenly and cheaply each airer dried clothes.</p> <p>The key test was a half-hourly laundry weigh-in to measure how quickly each airer dried an identical load. Actually, two identical loads – one small (4kg) and one big (8kg) – 14 times, once for every airer. I removed and weighed the clothes every 30 minutes to see how much moisture had evaporated until the fabric was dry, and this gave me an overall drying time. Room temperature remained at a steady 19-20C throughout. For more behind-the-scenes insights into weighing knickers, check out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/08/testing-heated-airers-kittens">the Filter’s newsletter</a>.</p> <p>I took other measurements too, not least to give me something (anything) to do while the laundry dried, such as the dimensions of each airer and the length of its heated bars. I used an infrared thermometer to take the bars’ temperature every 30 seconds to compare heat-up times, and a wattage meter to check power usage. I then used the October 2025 default tariff (26.35p a kWh) to work out running costs an hour.</p> <p>Some brands didn’t want the airers I’d tested returned, so those were donated to two organisations that do important work in and around Southampton. The first is <a href="https://www.scratchcharity.co.uk/">Scratch</a>, which provides services and furniture for families and individuals experiencing poverty, and the other is <a href="https://stopdomesticabuse.uk/">Stop Domestic Abuse</a>, a charity offering support for survivors of abuse and stalking.</p> <p>Here’s my guide to the nine best heated clothes airers based on my tests.</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>The best heated clothes airers in </strong><strong>2025</strong></h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best heated clothes airer overall</em>: <br>Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer and cover </h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.lakeland.co.uk/25597/dry-soon-deluxe-3-tier-heated-airer-and-cover-bundle" > £204.98 at Lakeland </a>  <p>This airer is for anyone who’s fed up with choosing between the expense of a noisy tumble dryer, the mess of clothes on radiators, and the rank stink of laundry slowly drying on a conventional clothes horse. With its ventilated heat-retaining cover in place, it’s the most efficient barred airer I tested.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Lakeland’s Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-tier heated airer arrives ready to use. It took me only two minutes to unfold the tiers, position the cover, plug in the cable and switch it on. The airer is a handsome chrome rack on its own, but the light grey embroidered cover makes the whole thing look rather gorgeous.</p> <p>The bars warmed up faster than most of its rivals, reaching 27C within 30 seconds before maxing out at 50C. When I laid a 4kg load of damp T-shirts across them and closed the cover, the lot was dry in two hours. That’s no faster than a tumble dryer, but it’s much more energy-efficient, costing about 8p an hour compared with 79p for my tumble dryer.</p> <p>The Dry:Soon Deluxe has some excellent user-friendly details. In particular, a timer lets you set it to switch off in hourly increments up to 12 hours ahead, which is handy for leaving it on overnight without the risk of forgetting it in the morning. All Lakeland’s airers come with a three-year warranty compared with the basic statutory guarantees for most heated airers.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> this airer costs almost as much as a tumble dryer. Deluxe by name, deluxe by price. But it’s many times cheaper to run, and with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/27/higher-energy-bills-price-cap-rises">energy costs rising</a>, £200+ may be worth spending to keep your bills down.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for: </strong>families who want to give up their expensive tumble dryer habit<br><strong>Available drying space:</strong> 21m (up to 36 hanging T-shirts)<br><strong>Dimensions (open): </strong>73 x 75 x 137cm (DWH)<br><strong>Dimensions (folded): </strong>10 x 75 x 137cm (DWH)<br><strong>Max capacity:</strong> 15kg<br><strong>Time to dry small load:</strong> 2 hours<br><strong>Running cost: </strong>8p/hour </p> <h2><em><strong>* * *</strong></em></h2> <h2><em>Best budget heated airer:</em><br>Black+Decker heated winged clothes airer</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/black-and-decker-winged-heated-airer-1000270495" > £45 at Dunelm </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BLACK-DECKER-BXAR0001GB-Electric-Capacity/dp/B09GRWMM38" > £47.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>The Black+Decker doesn’t get particularly hot, which helps if you have curious toddlers and delicate clothes. It still managed to dry my small load of T-shirts in an afternoon, and at £45 with a 6p-an-hour running cost, it’s a decent budget buy. It’s also one of the easiest airers to fold down and slip under the sofa when not in use.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The Black+Decker winged airer has the smallest footprint in my test, taking up about 50 x 50cm on its beam supports, yet it boasts a capacity of 10kg when unfolded, thanks to its ironing board-style shape. It warmed up to 33C in its hottest spots and dried my small load of T-shirts in just over four hours, with a little help from me flipping them and moving them around.</p> <p>I also like that the wings fold inwards to double up the heat when drying thicker garments, albeit not very large ones, and the dryer is so light (about 3.5kg) that I could move it around using one hand.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> it warmed up slowly and failed to get hotter than 33C even after three hours. That’s great for delicates and damp towels, but not hot enough to dry thick fabrics.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for: </strong>drying light fabrics and warming up towels <br><strong>Available drying space:</strong> 11m (up to 20 hanging T-shirts)<br><strong>Dimensions (open): </strong>54 x 148 x 93cm (DWH)<br><strong>Dimensions (folded): </strong>approx 54 x 100 x 20cm (DWH)<br><strong>Max capacity:</strong> 10kg<br><strong>Time to dry small load:</strong> 4 hours 15 minutes<br><strong>Running cost: </strong>6p/hour</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best heated airer for fast drying</em>:<br>Minky SureDri heat pod drying system</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4013907" > £90 at Argos </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CL4SMF76/" > £89.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>Heat pods turn your old unheated airer into a heated version. This one has a waterproof cover that fits a standard three-tier clothes horse, plus an electric heater that sits underneath to fill the space with hot air.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Minky’s pod system is a damp-blitzing machine. Even on its lowest 360W setting, it was one of the fastest dryers in my tests, because the heater and cover combo kept in the hot air. I measured the highest setting as using 915W, which cost 24p an hour, and it dried a large 8kg load within three hours. That’s as fast as a tumble dryer, but with less damage to your electric bill, or indeed to your clothes.</p> <p>At £90, the Minky isn’t quite a bargain buy, but I love that it brings hot new life to your existing clothes horse. If the cover doesn’t fit yours, you can use a sheet with the Minky heater unit to much the same effect.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> drying clothes with the Minky is more of a faff than with barred heated airers. First, you have to set up the pod, then you have to put up with the noise. The cover also makes it fiddly to check your clothes while they’re drying.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> work clothes and school uniforms that need a fast laundry turnaround<br><strong>Available drying space:</strong> about 18m, depending on your clothes horse<br><strong>Dimensions (heat pod unit): </strong>28 x 17 x 33cm (DWH)<br><strong>Max capacity:</strong> about 10kg<strong><br>Time to dry small load:</strong> 1 hour 40 minutes (setting 1); 45mins (setting 3)<br><strong>Running cost: </strong>10p/hour (setting 1); 24p/hour (setting 3) </p> <p>* * *</p> <h2><strong>The best of the rest</strong></h2>    <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>Dunelm XL 3-tier square heated airer</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/extra-large-3-tier-square-heated-airer-1000241570" > £125 at Dunelm </a>  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> a never-ending cycle of laundry that needs constant access</p> <p>This huge, uncovered airer lets you get at your washing as it dries, so you can check, rearrange and replace items easily. It’s so big that I could lay an entire 4kg load of 10 T-shirts across the bars, and they dried in two hours at a cost of less than 20p. To save space, you can fold down half of the airer while it’s drying.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> this airer will be too big for many homes to accommodate.</p> <p><strong>Available drying space:</strong> 25m; <strong>dimensions (open): </strong>73 x 85 x 136cm (DWH); <strong>dimensions (folded): </strong>10 x 85 x 136cm (DWH); <strong>max capacity:</strong> 25kg; <strong>time to dry small load:</strong> 2 hours; <strong>running cost: </strong>9p/hour </p> <p><strong>* * *</strong></p> <h2>Dunelm 3-tier A-frame heated airer</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/3-tier-a-frame-heated-airer-1000225368" > £100 at Dunelm </a>  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> runners and dog walkers who need to dry soggy shoes and socks</p> <p>Heated shoe stands are a simple addition and work well on this airer, drying my thick walking socks faster than if I’d laid them across the bars. The A-frame design also makes this among the sturdiest smaller airers I tested, and it stood firm even when I threw a large load of washing at the top tier.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> my small 4kg load needed an unusually long five hours, even after I’d moved things around and flipped them over. I also hated risking my fingers in the metal-hinged supports each time I folded and unfolded the airer.</p> <p><strong>Available drying space:</strong> 17m, including shoe stands; <strong>dimensions (open): </strong>54 x 91 x 146cm (DWH); <strong>dimensions (folded): </strong>18 x 91 x 146cm (DWH); <strong>max capacity:</strong> 15kg; <strong>time to dry small load:</strong> 4 hours; <strong>running cost: </strong>9p/hour</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>Argos Home 3-tier heated airer</h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/7441765" > £105 at Argos </a>  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> solo households and small living spaces</p> <p>Argos’s three-tier airer took several minutes to heat up and maxed out at a reasonable 45C – hot enough to dry my small load in four and a half hours (after a bit of rearranging). The pivoted frame makes it feel less sturdy than airers with feet at each corner, but it’s a breeze to fold and unfold.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> the Argos Home airer feels less robust than similarly priced rivals.</p> <p><strong>Available drying space:</strong> 17m; <strong>dimensions (open): </strong>73 x 70 x 144cm (DWH); <strong>dimensions (folded): </strong>13 x 70 x 144cm (DWH); <strong>max capacity:</strong> 15kg; <strong>time to dry small load:</strong> 4 hours 20 minutes; <strong>running cost: </strong>9p/hour </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/dec/27/best-electric-blankets-heated-throws">The 8 best electric blankets and heated throws – tried and tested to keep you toasty for less this winter</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>JML DriBuddi indoor clothes airer</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.robertdyas.co.uk/jml-a001249-dribuddi-1200w-10kg-portable-indoor-electric-clothes-dryer-white" > £59.99 at Robert Dyas </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/JML-DriBUDDI-Compact-Electric-Clothes/dp/B0DFR3L3MG" > £69.99 at Amazon </a>  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> drying shirts and dresses</p> <p>The DriBuddi uses an electric heater to blast your clothes inside a tent-like structure, with hooks for clothes hangers rather than bars. Its highest power settings dried my clothes quickly and helped remove wrinkles, but it wasn’t as efficient as the Minky, perhaps because air circulates better when clothes are laid across tiered bars rather than hanging in a bundle.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> it’s quite noisy, and there’s no way to lay items flat for drying. You can dismantle the heater stand if you want, but it doesn’t fold down in the way other airers do.</p> <p><strong>Available drying space:</strong> holds up to 18 garments on hangers; <strong>dimensions</strong><strong>: </strong>60 x 60 x 160cm (DWH); <strong>max capacity:</strong> 10kg; <strong>time to dry small load:</strong> 2 hours 20 minutes; <strong>running cost: </strong>31p/hour</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>Aldi Ambiano winged heated airer</h2>    <!-- Invalid or incomplete link element -->  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> small living spaces and limited budgets</p> <p>Aldi’s Ambiano-branded airer is the cheapest I tested and well worth a trip to the shops – but Aldi isn’t kidding with that “while stocks last” label. After waiting for a restock, I finally tested this bargain airer on the coldest days of January, and it performed almost as well as the more widely available Black+Decker winged airer. With the free cover in place and a bit of rearranging halfway through, it dried my small load in just over four hours. It’s a smart pick if you’re short on space because it folds down easily to merely 6cm high for slipping under a bed or chest of drawers when not in use.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> it’s not powerful enough to dry a full load on a cold day without resulting in stinky slow-dried clothes, as with the Black+Decker and Argos three-tier models here. However, it will dry a few items laid flat – especially if you fold in the wings to double up the heat.</p> <p><strong>Available drying space:</strong> 12m; <strong>dimensions (open): </strong>54 x 148 x 83cm (DWH); <strong>dimensions (folded): </strong>54 x 94 x 6cm (DWH); <strong>max capacity:</strong> 10kg; <strong>time to dry small load:</strong> 4 hours 15 minutes; <strong>running cost: </strong>8p/hour </p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>GlamHaus digital electric clothes airer</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.robertdyas.co.uk/glamhaus-digital-electric-clothes-airer-heated-drying-rack-45-4-45-tier-extendable-dryer-45-eco-design-with-cover-for-faster-drying-45-energy-efficient-300w" > £136.99 at Robert Dyas </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/GlamHaus-Clothes-Digital-Electric-Extendable/dp/B0BTJ6CL9M" > £140.45 at Amazon </a>  <p><strong>Best for: </strong>sizeable wardrobes that contain delicate fabrics</p> <p>This is one of the biggest and most feature-rich airers I tested, with a ventilated cover, timer and digital temperature controls that I found fairly easy to use. The top setting reached nowhere near the claimed 70C but did manage 52C in places, and I love having the lower-temperature settings for drying flimsy fabrics on the bars. You can attach peg hangers to dangle your smalls in the heat, but they don’t allow much dangle room. As with all the airers I tested, you get a much quicker dry if you lay items across the bars.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> it doesn’t dry clothes quite as fast as the Dry:Soon Deluxe, and it’s a right old jigsaw to put together the first time you use it. After that, though, I found it easy to open and close.</p> <p><strong>Available drying space:</strong> 30m; <strong>dimensions (open): </strong>73 x 70 x 147cm (DWH); <strong>dimensions (folded): </strong>15 x 70 x 147cm (DWH); <strong>max capacity:</strong> 25kg; <strong>time to dry small load:</strong> 3 hours 30 minutes; <strong>running cost: </strong>9p/hour</p> <p>* * *</p> <h2>What you need to know</h2>    <p>Heated clothes airers are such a simple and smart idea that it’s weird they haven’t been around longer. They’re wildly popular, too: I waited four months to test <a href="https://www.aldi.co.uk/ambiano-winged-heated-airer/p/836188795682100">Aldi’s winged heated airer</a> because there were none left in the warehouse within days of it going on sale last September. But do they deserve the hype – and how can you get the best out of yours?</p> <h2>How much do heated airers cost to run?</h2> <p>Minimal running cost is the biggest selling point of heated airers. Their packaging bears promises that they’ll dry your clothes for as little as 6p an hour, dramatically undercutting all rival methods other than blazing sunshine. Really? Yes, in some cases, at least until jumps in energy prices piled on the pennies.</p> <p>Even under energy prices of autumn 2024, when I first tested most of these airers, 6p an hour was a little optimistic. I found that standard barred airers, running at about 320W, worked out at 7p an hour in September 2024 and 8p an hour now. </p> <p>Most heated airers take a full afternoon or more to dry a load of washing, and those 8p hours will add up. Airers that dry clothes faster, such as the fan-heater-based Minky SureDri and JML DriBuddi, cost more to run. At 1,200W, the DriBuddi now costs about 31p an hour, adding up to more than 60p to dry a load.</p> <p>That’s still significantly cheaper than running a tumble dryer or, indeed, a washing machine. Under October 2025 energy prices, a tumble dryer running at 3kW costs 79p an hour to run, and it can cost even more to switch on the central heating. </p> <h2>Can you leave them on all night?</h2> <p>An hour or two on a heated airer won’t make a dent in the dampness of your jumpers or thick towels. Overnight would do it – but is it safe? The good news is that a 300W airer uses about the same amount of electricity as a fridge freezer, so yes, you can leave your clothes to dry while you snooze. Gentle warmth in the room is a lovely bonus.</p> <p>But while barred airers are safe to leave on overnight, as confirmed by brands including John Lewis, Lakeland and retailer Direct365, be more cautious with the fan heater type. The 1,200W JML packs about half the wattage (and noise) of a tumble dryer, and I certainly wouldn’t leave one of those on overnight or while I’m out.</p> <h2>How can you make clothes dry faster on a heated airer?</h2> <p>There are ways you can speed up the drying process. My best tip is to ignore the marketing photos that show airers draped like Christmas trees, with clothes hung from every bar. As I discovered while running this test, your clothes simply won’t dry that way unless it’s a warm day, which rather defeats the point. Instead, lay individual items across the bars.</p> <p>Covered airers cut drying times by almost half, but you can achieve a similar result by throwing a fitted sheet over the top, as long as there’s a gap for moist air to escape. Whatever cover you use, I’d recommend removing it as soon as your clothes are dry. Covers are vented to avoid condensation, but I found that some moisture crept back in if I left my clothes inside.</p> <p>However powerful your airer, always spin your clothes to remove as much water as possible before laying them on it. Wet clothes won’t dry, and water and electricity are not a happy combination.</p> <p>On that note, don’t use a heated airer in the bathroom. Electric peril aside, bathroom air is notoriously damp. I had the best results when using my test airers in the bedroom with the window ajar – and the faint fabric softener scent was a sweet bedtime bonus.</p> <h2>Do heated airers make your house damp?</h2> <p>When you dry clothes on any warm surface, whether it’s a heated airer or a radiator, the moisture rises from the clothes – to where? I asked a range of experts about this, and they broadly agreed that the key is to let the moist air escape from your home.</p> <p>“It’s not the drying method alone but the combination of moisture and lack of ventilation that leads to damp problems,” says Dr Anastasia Mylona, technical director at the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. “You can manage this by ensuring good ventilation when drying clothes indoors; for example, by opening windows or using extractor fans.”</p> <p>A dehumidifier can help avoid damp, as well as speed up the drying process, says cleaning expert Nancy Emery of bathroom retailer <a href="https://www.drench.co.uk/">Drench</a>. “If you’re investing in a heated airer, my advice is to invest in a dehumidifier as well, and always run them together.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/oct/21/best-dehumidifiers-tested-uk">The best dehumidifiers: 14 favourites to beat damp and cut bills, tested</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I’ve found heated airers much less likely than radiators to cause damp walls, and property expert Phil Spencer explains why. “Airflow is key, so if you want to use a heated airer, put it in the middle of the room rather than next to the wall,” says Spencer, who, among other things, has founded the property advice website <a href="https://www.moveiq.co.uk/">Move iQ</a>. “This is why heated airers are preferable to wall-mounted radiators.”</p> <p>However, radiators can heat up the room, and heated airers can’t, at least not significantly. That’s an important factor in the battle against damp, says Emery. “Maintaining your home’s temperature above 18C helps because condensation can’t settle on warmer surfaces.”</p> <p>I put these tips to the test using <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07TV22X9M">an affordable humidity meter</a>. I measured the moisture in my spare room’s air before doing any laundry, and then again at various stages of drying a medium load on a large heated airer – with and without opening the windows and using a dehumidifier.</p> <p>It had rained all week, so perhaps it’s no surprise that my house boasted a base humidity level of 70%, 10% higher than the recommended UK maximum. I <em>was</em> surprised, though, when this only rose to 72% once I’d loaded the airer with damp clothes. Running my dehumidifier brought the room’s humidity down to 70%. When I opened the windows, it dropped to 65% – even before the load was completely dry. I’ve now defaulted to leaving the windows open whenever possible, whether or not I’m drying clothes.</p> <p>“Opening windows regularly is the best way to allow humid air to escape, though it may seem counterintuitive in colder weather,” says Nicholas Donnithorne, UK technical services manager at Rentokil Property Care. “Leave quarterlights ajar or trickle vents open. Dehumidifiers can help, but they require regular emptying and aren’t a substitute for proper ventilation.”</p> <p><em><strong>For more autumn and winter home essentials, read the Filter’s guides to:</strong><br></em>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/dec/27/best-electric-blankets-heated-throws">The best electric blankets and heated throws</a><br>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/07/the-8-best-electric-heaters-tried-and-tested-from-traditional-stove-style-units-to-modern-smart-models">The best electric heaters, tested</a></p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Jane Hoskyn is a </em><em>features journalist and WFH pioneer with three decades</em><em> of experience </em><em>in rearranging bookshelves and “testing” coffee machines while deadlines loom.
