<p>After Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory this week, <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/articles/tips-look-after-your-mental-health-during-traumatic-world-events">a briefing</a> handily re-appeared in the “most popular topics” section of the <a href="https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/">Mental Health Foundation </a>website: “Tips to look after your mental health during traumatic world events.”</p> <p>The briefing has been well-read before, at times of war, conflict, violence and social tension – and people were turning to it for advice once again as Trump’s win ushered in a phase of deep despondency and political uncertainty for many people.</p> <p>“These are difficult and intense moments for many people. Anxiety is not an unreasonable response, and you should not feel diminished for being worried,” said Lee Knifton, a Mental Health Foundation director.</p> <p>The potential changes augured by the Trump presidency – economic and social upheaval, threats to human rights, the prospect of racial divisiveness – can create or exacerbate feelings of anxiety, foreboding and loss of control.</p> <p>Even if we are not directly involved, watching traumatic world events unfold that cause actual or portents of harm or suffering, whether to ourselves, loved ones or complete strangers, can affect our mental health, the foundation says.</p> <p>It is worth trying to pause, reflect and see if perspectives settle after the initial shock and despair, it says. Try to accept events may be out of your control and influence. “Time is important. It’s useful to see how things land,” said Knifton.</p> <p>If the feelings of gloom persist there are ways to cope, the foundation says, however helpless things may seem. One strategy is to limit your news consumption and reduce social media use, especially if it puts you in low spirits. Avoid long scrolling sessions.</p> <p>Another strategy is to find ways to connect and engage with others. Don’t bottle things up, and remember many others share your feelings. Volunteering and activism are practical ways to find a sense of agency and esteem, often expressed as a desire to make a difference.</p> <p>The beneficial mental health effects of volunteering are well documented. A <a href="https://www.ncvo.org.uk/news-and-insights/news-index/time-well-spent-2023/">2023 study</a> by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations found 75% of respondents reported that volunteering was good for their mental health and wellbeing.</p> <p>Nine out of 10 respondents reported that volunteering – with a charity, community group, or school or civic institution – made them feel they were making a difference. Seventy-four per cent said it brought them into positive contact with people from different backgrounds, and 68% that it made them feel less socially isolated.</p> <p>Getting involved in political and civic activism can help lessen the feelings of being voiceless or having little control. The foundation recommends exploring involvement with political, civic or social groups, or seeking out public events and debates.</p> <h2>Get involved in local civic causes</h2> <p>Politicians and activists often say they were inspired to start by local injustices encountered in their own lives or neighbourhoods. This could be campaigning against the closure of a school or library, opposing controversial planning decisions, or proactively setting up services where none exist, such as self-help groups for parents, or sports teams for children.</p> <h2>Volunteering</h2> <p>Charities are often crying out for volunteer expertise. <a href="https://reachvolunteering.org.uk/">Reach Volunteering</a> is a national charity offering a range of opportunities for people with professional and technical skills – it might be finance, legal, IT, building work, education or cookery – and links them with voluntary roles at a wide range of good causes, from local community groups to food banks and hospices.</p> <h2>Political, social and environmental activism</h2> <p>Joining a local political party or activist group can open opportunities to discuss and debate pressing local and international issues. It may give you a voice in the drawing up of local or national policies, and offer opportunities for you to get your point across through elected roles as well as marches, demonstrations, and petitions. Donating financially to good causes close to your heart is another way to show solidarity.</p>
