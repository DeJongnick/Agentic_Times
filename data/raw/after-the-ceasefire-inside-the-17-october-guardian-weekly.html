<p>Last Thursday, after two years of war, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire as part of the initial phase of a 20-point Gaza plan proposed by the US president, Donald Trump. Amid the immediate sense of relief, much remains uncertain, but this could be the biggest step yet towards a durable end to the conflict.</p> <p>There are questions to be resolved: the future form of the governance in Gaza, the devastated territory’s reconstruction, who could provide troops for an international “stabilisation” force, how much ground Israeli forces are going to give up when they pull back to new positions, will Hamas agree to disarm, and much else.</p> <p>For now, though, as leaders from more than 20 countries met in Sharm-el-Sheikh to discuss the next stages of the deal, those affected by the war began to cautiously take their next steps.
