    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:C - Bear cubs are curious and playful. They can climb trees and sometimes hang or dangle. But once they grow up, they’re usually too heavy to swing upside down., 2:D - There isn’t just one cleverest animal. Different animals are smart in different ways. Chimpanzees can use tools, dolphins communicate with clicks and whistles, crows can solve puzzles and octopuses can untie knots and are expert escape artists. We are still discovering all kinds of things about many animals and how clever they are., 3:C - You can’t always use a table lampshade as a ceiling shade, but many easy-fit designs work for both and are simple to install. Otherwise you’ll need a shade made for ceilings, called a pendant., 4:C - Infinity isn’t like normal numbers – it’s an idea that goes on for ever. If you take one away, it’s still infinity, because it never ends., 5:B - Electricity has no colour, though when it sparks it can appear blue or white as it passes through the air, or in neon signs it produces colours. Lightning is a huge bolt of electricity and is usually white.</p>
