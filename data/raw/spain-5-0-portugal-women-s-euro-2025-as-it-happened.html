Portugal were better in the second half, despite Spain showing their strength in depth off the bench but the chasm in quality between these sides was enormous.

Any of our favourite male players does that and we would hail them as a genius. That was a bonafide world class finish.” </p> <p>It’s a fair kop – I didn’t appreciate quite how good that finish was until half-time, when I saw a few more replays. If she’d waited a couple of minutes until I’d got settled into the game, I might have been able to appreciate it in all it’s splendour. What I’m saying is – it’s her fault and if Sunderland’s Wilson Isiodor had done the same thing, he would have got similarly mugged off. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6866ea118f0877cd81d65846" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-03T20:38:53.964Z">9.38pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>77 min:</strong> Spain substitution: Mariona Caldentey makes way for Cristina Matin-Prieto after putting in an excellent shift. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6866e97b8f085e912e5fe472" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-03T20:37:27.039Z">9.37pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Portugal free-kick, wide on the right.

The car accident in which Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva, also a footballer, lost their lives is one of those tragedies that has hit everyone hard, which means an already difficult assignment for Francisco Neto and his Portuguese players has been rendered immeasurably tougher. We wish each and every one of them well.</p> <p>A universally popular and admired player who was renowned for his skill, tenacity, humility and cheerful disposition, Jota’s death has prompted an understandable outpouring of shock and grief throughout and beyond the football family. The players of Spain will also be struggling to process the sadness many of us are feeling at the awful news that a son, a father of three, a brother, a new husband and a very fine footballer has been lost. The weather forecast in Switzerland’s capital city tonight is for bright sunshine but this morning’s news about Diogo and André means this match will be played under a very dark cloud.</p> <p>There will, of course, be a tribute to both brothers ahead of tonight’s match between these Iberian neighbours and Portugal’s players will wear black armbands as a mark of respect for their fallen comrades. “Uefa announces that a moment of silence will be observed at all of today’s and tomorrow’s Women’s Euro 2025 matches in memory of Portugal international and Liverpool FC forward Diogo Jota and his brother André Silva who tragically passed away today,” said European football’s governing body earlier today.
