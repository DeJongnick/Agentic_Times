He will be looking ahead to Saturday’s four Premier League fixtures, from the lunchtime kick-off of Leeds v Tottenham to the late afternoon game of the weekend, Chelsea v Liverpool. There’ll be team news and breaking stories and any washup from Friday night’s Bournemouth v Fulham game and the Championship blockbuster Wrexham v Birmingham. Elsewhere in the Championship, Stoke, making headway under Mark Robins, face Blackburn, who were beaten in midweek by Swansea, plus Hull meet Sheffield United, who finally got off the mark under Chris Wilder with a win last weekend at Oxford, before being beaten at home by Southampton in midweek.</p> <p>12pm</p> <p> Manchester City v Arsenal live</p> <p>Women’s Super League</p>  <p>Arsenal are under pressure just four games into the season having dropped points in their past two games and sorely underperforming in the 1-1 draw against Aston Villa last weekend, a result that followed a goalless meeting with Manchester United. Renee Slegers’ Gunners already trail Chelsea by four points. City on the other hand have rebounded from their opening round defeat by the serial title winners to notch up three straight victories and sit third in the WSL table to Arsenal’s surprising fifth. <strong>Billy Munday</strong> offers minute-by-minute coverage, with <strong>Tom Garry</strong> reporting from the Joie Stadium.</p> <p>2pm</p> <p>Singapore Grand Prix qualifying </p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p><strong>Niall McVeigh</strong> keeps you up to date lap by rapid lap in what is certain to be a compelling session as back-to-back race wins for Max Verstappen have added a bit of spice to the title race. Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris will be desperate for solid outings at Singapore this weekend. McLaren’s dominance for most of the season means they should wrap up a 10th constructors’ title on Sunday, but Verstappen’s resurgence in the Red Bull has triggered a few nerves. While Piastri still leads Norris by 25 points in what still looks like a two-horse race to the driver’s title, any hiccups at the weekend could allow the Dutchman to cut further into the 69-point gap to first place. <strong>Giles Richards</strong> reports.</p> <p>3pm</p> <p> Arsenal v West Ham and Manchester United v Sunderland live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p><strong>Tom Bassam</strong> has all the latest on two compelling fixtures with two managers particularly under the spotlight. The unrelenting focus on Ruben Amorim’s travails at United has ramped up to critical of late and the meeting with Sunderland has all the makings of a watershed before the international break. Amorim’s 50th match in charge could be his last, despite United winning their past two home fixtures. After 49 games, Amorim’s record reads: won 18, drawn 12, lost 19. That 36.7% win rate contrasts starkly with his predecessor Erik ten Hag’s 70% (W35 D7 L8) at the same stage. West Ham, meanwhile, run out for their second match under Nuno Espírito&nbsp;Santo, following Monday’s 1-1 draw at Everton. The Hammers have the curious record of having beaten Arsenal back-to-back at the Emirates. Another home defeat by their London rivals seems unlikely given the Gunners’ form – six wins from their last eight top-flight fixtures. <strong>Will Unwin</strong> reports from Old Trafford, with <strong>Ed Aarons</strong> at the Emirates. </p>   <p>5.30pm</p> <p>Chelsea v Liverpool live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Saturday’s late afternoon fixture sees the collision of clubs in a slight slump. Enzo Maresca’s Blues have suffered successive Premier League losses, to Manchester United and Brighton, while the defending champions lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace before stumbling in the Champions League in Istanbul in midweek. Arne Slot’s side are winless in their last four Premier League games at Stamford Bridge but have not lost consecutive league matches since April 2023. Looking for omens? Alexander Isak, Liverpool’s summer signing, has scored in his last two Premier League appearances at Stamford Bridge, though both games ended in defeats for for his then club Newcastle. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> helms our live blog while <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> and <strong>Barney Ronay</strong> bring reports and analysis from Stamford Bridge.</p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p><strong>Tom Bassam</strong> and <strong>Xaymaca Awoyungbo</strong> sort through the fallout from Saturday’s matches before our live football countdown blog looks forward to a Sunday fixture list that features five Premier League matches as well as the East Anglian derby, as Ipswich host Norwich in the Championship at lunchtime. In the Scottish Premiership, both Glasgow giants are in action. Celtic take on Motherwell and woebegone Rangers travel to Falkirk. On the continent, Sevilla v Barcelona is among five La Liga games, while Juventus meet Milan in a top-level Serie A clash. </p> <p>11.45am</p> <p>Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe live</p> <p>Racing</p>  <p><strong>Tony Paley</strong> has all the buildup and washup from one of the racing calendar’s biggest events. In a field of 17 for the 3.05pm big race, the Aidan O’Brien-trained Minnie Hauk is the 3-1 favourite after being handed a favourable draw in stall one. O’Brien, who is seeking a third win in the race, also fields Los Angeles, third last year, but he will have to defy stall 14 to claim victory while Aventure, who is just behind Minnie Hauk in the betting, was handed stall 12. Hopes of a first Japanese-trained winner were dealt a blow, with the Japanese Derby winner, Croix Du Nord, and the Prix Foy victor, Byzantine Dream, drawn in stalls 17 and 15 respectively. Their compatriot Alohi Alii appears better placed in four, however. André Fabre’s pair of Sosie and Cualificar fared better with stalls three and eight respectively, while Francis-Henri Graffard’s Daryz (two), Quisisana (seven) and Gezora (13) could have done worse. <strong>Greg Wood</strong> reports from Longchamp.</p>   <p>1pm</p> <p>Singapore Grand Prix live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p><strong>Michael Butler</strong> offers lap-by-lap coverage of the big race under the Singapore lights.<br>Clearly Max Verstappen has momentum – he was second at his home race in the Netherlands before his wins in Italy and Azerbaijan – but probably still needs a spectacular McLaren collapse, as well as wins in the seven remaining races and three sprints, to clinch a fifth straight world title. Red Bull have won only once in the last nine years at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, and never with Verstappen at the wheel. The Dutchman has never claimed pole at a circuit where the driver who topped qualifying has won 10 of the 15 editions of the race. Upgrades to the tricky RB21 have undoubtedly helped Verstappen’s cause and Singapore will be the true test of the car’s improvement. <strong>Giles Richards</strong> is our F1 reporter.</p>   <p>2pm</p> <p>Newcastle v Nottingham Forest and  Aston Villa v Burnley live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p><strong>Rob Smyth</strong> hosts our clockwatch that focuses on two of Sunday’s four 2pm kick-offs and there’ll be plenty of noise around Forest’s Ange Postecoglou as his winless run continued on Thursday with a 3-2 home defeat by Midtjylland in the Europa League to heap more pressure on the club’s new manager. That said, it’s a far from merry picture at Newcastle too, since Eddie Howe’s side have lost three of their past four top-flight matches and will be without their summer signing Yoane Wissa. At Villa Park, Unai Emery’s side’s revival is under way on after they notched a third victory in eight days to put their dismal start to the season behind them with a 2-0 defeat of Feyenoord in Rotterdam and make it back-to-back Europa League wins. <strong>Louise Taylor</strong> reports from St James’ Park wih <strong>Ben Fisher</strong> is at Villa Park.</p> <p>4.30pm</p> <p>Brentford v Manchester City live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Hosts Brentford produced their best performance under Keith Andrews last weekend when beating Manchester United 3-1, with Igor Thiago scoring twice. After a 2-2 draw with City at home last season, a win today for the Bees would seen them level on points with Pep Guardiola’s inconsistent side. The visitors are experiencing a stuttering start to the campaign, following up a 5-1 thrashing of Burnley by conceding a last-minute penalty to draw at Monaco in the Champions League in midweek. <strong>Xaymaca Awoyungbo</strong> is your live blog host, with <strong>John Brewin</strong> reporting from the Gtech. </p> <h2></h2> <p>6pm</p> <p>Eagles-Broncos and Ravens-Texans live</p> <p>NFL</p>  <p><strong>Graham Searles</strong> brings all the evening’s American football action from week five in the NFL. Philadelphia defend their perfect start to the season against Denver and have won 20 of their last 21 games, thanks largely to their controversial Tush Push (also known as the Brotherly Shove). It’s a twist on the quarterback sneak, with players helping to push the QB in short-yardage situations, to gain a first down or score a touchdown. Plenty don’t like it, and 22 team owners saw their vote for it to be banned rejected in May. Houston, meanwhile, managed a first win last time out, after three defeats, but they have a good chance to beat the Ravens as Baltimore’s star quarterback, Lamar Jackson, is out injured.</p>
