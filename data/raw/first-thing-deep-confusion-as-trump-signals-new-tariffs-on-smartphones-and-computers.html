<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Donald Trump’s tariff war has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/trump-news-at-a-glance-deep-confusion-as-trump-signals-new-tariffs-on-smartphones-and-computers">plunged deeper into chaos</a> after a cabinet official floated a plan for new levies on semiconductors – a crucial component in electronic goods – just days after the Trump administration exempted computers and smartphones from tariffs.</p> <p>Trump’s commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, told NBC the tariff exemption on several electronic devices was temporary, and that new duties would come in “a month or two”. Semiconductors would be targeted, he said.</p> <p>The president said he would lay out the new tariffs on Monday and that any relief for the electronics industry would be short-lived. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/14/donald-trump-tariffs-china-smartphones-computers-semiconductors-immigration-us-politics-live-updates">he wrote on his Truth Social platform</a>, adding: “Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How is the </strong><strong>continuing tariff whiplash being received? </strong>The billionaire investor Ray Dalio said he was worried the US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/13/ray-dalio-trump-tariffs-recession">would experience “something worse than a recession”</a> as a result of Trump’s trade policies.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>EU foreign ministers meet </strong><strong>after deadly Palm Sunday attack by Russians on Ukraine</strong></h2>    <p>EU foreign ministers are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/apr/14/ukraine-russia-war-zelenskyy-trump-putin-europe-latest-live-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67fcaf608f0825dc3aa1554a#block-67fcaf608f0825dc3aa1554a">meeting in Luxembourg this morning</a> to discuss the key challenges facing the bloc in foreign affairs, with Ukraine top of the pile.</p> <p>Reeling from the shock of Russia’s attack on Palm Sunday on Sumy, in north-eastern Ukraine, which killed at least 34 and injured more than 100, the ministers will discuss what more they can do to help Kyiv deter Russian aggression.</p> <p>There were strong political reactions already on Sunday. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, blamed Moscow for “blatant disregard for human lives, international law, and the diplomatic efforts of president Trump”.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters last night, Trump said the attack on Sumy was “terrible” but added he was “told it was a mistake”. He then blamed Joe Biden for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, adding: “This is not my war.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What has the Ukrainian president,</strong> <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said?</strong> He issued a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/14/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-to-trump-come-and-see-putins-war-for-yourself">dramatic plea to Trump</a> telling him: “Before any kind of decisions, any kind of forms of negotiations, come to see people, civilians, warriors, hospitals, churches, children destroyed or dead.”</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>High levels of toxic chemicals found in paper receipts used by US retailers</strong></h2>    <p>Paper receipts from major retailers in the US are so laden with bisphenol S that holding one for 10 seconds can cause the skin to absorb enough of the highly toxic chemical to violate California’s safety threshold, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/paper-receipt-chemical-bisphenol-s">research has found</a>.</p> <p>The findings are being used as evidence in legal action aimed at pressuring retailers to stop using receipt paper treated with bisphenol S, or BPS, which is linked to cancer and reproductive problems.</p> <p>The Center for Environmental Health (CEH) non-profit has sent violation notices to about 50 major retailers alerting them to the exceedance of California’s Proposition 65 limits for BPS.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Which companies have received notices?</strong> Among the companies to which <a href="https://ceh.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-01-14-Notice-Set-1-BPS-in-Thermal-Paperfx.pdf">notices</a> were sent for the allegedly illegal levels of BPS in their receipts are Burger King, Chanel, Dollar General, AMC Theaters, GameStop, Subway, Foot Locker and Ace Hardware.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In other news …</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>Aimee Lou Wood</strong><strong> has described a sketch on the US comedy show Saturday Night Live (SNL) which mocked her appearance as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/apr/14/white-lotus-star-aimee-lou-wood-snl-mean-unfunny-sketch-skit">“mean and unfunny”</a>.</strong> In the skit, the SNL cast member Sarah Sherman impersonated her, appearing in exaggerated prosthetic teeth.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Peruvian novelist </strong><strong>Mario Vargas Llosa</strong><strong>, one of the pivotal figures who ignited a global boom in Latin American literature, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/apr/14/mario-vargas-llosa-dies-aged-89-cause-of-death">died aged 89</a>.</strong> The author of The Time of the Hero and Conversation in the Cathedral died peacefully at home, his family said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In an election seen as a referendum on his “war on drugs”, Ecuador’s right</strong><strong>wing president, </strong><strong>Daniel Noboa</strong><strong>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/14/ecuador-presidential-election-daniel-noboa">won yesterday’s presidential runoff</a></strong>, defeating the leftist candidate Luisa González.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/austin-texas-house-explosion">house explosion</a> in Austin, Texas, destroyed the residence and damaged 24 nearby properties, injuring six people</strong> – including two firefighters.

Having bought into various apartheid fantasies of bunkered safety, they are choosing to let the Earth burn. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/13/end-times-fascism-far-right-trump-musk">Our task is to build a wide and deep movement</a>, as spiritual as it is political, strong enough to stop these unhinged traitors.

It tested new landing barges on ships that could facilitate an amphibious assault on Taiwan. And it unveiled deep-sea cable cutters with the ability to switch off another country’s internet access – a tool no other nation admits to having. China has been flexing its maritime muscle in the Indo-Pacific to send a message of supremacy to its regional neighbours, experts say. But it’s also testing the thinking of a bigger rival farther afield: Donald Trump.</p> <h2><strong>Last Thing: ‘Tornado tortoise’ reunited with its family a month after deadly US storms</strong></h2>    <p>A pet tortoise displaced from its human family’s home during a deadly outbreak of tornadoes in Mississippi in March was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/14/tortoise-reunited-family-mississippi-tornadoes">recently reunited with its people</a>.
