You’re seeing people with thousands of signs that all match, pre-bought, pre-put together… someone is funding it.”</p> <p>Trump has indeed argued, on numerous occasions in recent weeks, that he can tell that antifascists are being paid to protest because, he claims, they carry identical, pre-printed signs at rallies.</p> <p>It is not clear what the president has been referring to, however, since news photographs and video of leftwing protests show no such thing.</p> <p>Here are some recent images of protests in Portland, Oregon and Los Angeles in recent months that Bondi said were organized by antifa.

The second clip, from 2021, showed her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BwVU9gid_pA">shouting at a staffer</a> who wandered into the frame as the then-congresswoman was recording a virtual message with the Biden administration’s energy secretary.</p> <p>Asked on Tuesday by the KTLA host <strong>Nikki Laurenzo</strong> if she has the temperament to be governor, given the new video evidence, Porter said: “When I look at those videos, I want people to know that I understand that I could have handled things better.”</p> <p>“I think I’m known as someone who’s able to handle tough questions, who’s willing to answer questions, and I want people to know that I really value the incredible work that my staff can do.

Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed.”</p> <p>Last month, a deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, urged social media users to send him posts critical of Kirk, saying he was “disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”<br><br>The administration has previously ramped up efforts to identify and potentially expel thousands of foreign students it accuses of participating in unrest in the form of protests against Israel’s mass killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The administration has also required foreign visitors to make their social media accounts public so that they can be checked before they are allowed to enter the land of the free.</p> <p>In recent months, the administration has expelled South Africa’s ambassador to the US for comments critical of Trump, revoked a visa for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York and cancelled visas of the visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan.</p> <p>The government has also said it is reviewing the status of the more than 55 million holders of visas to enter the US for potential violations of its standards.</p> <p>Those actions have been criticized by civil rights groups as blatant violations of constitutional protections for freedom of speech, which apply to anyone in the US, not just citizens.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-14T22:53:17.797Z">at 11.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68eec5538f0894af1b593e71" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/davidsmith"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-14T21:49:15.993Z">10.49pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Erika Kirk delivered an emotional speech, at times dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief, as Trump stood to her right. </p> <p>She said: “I have spent seven and a half years trying to find the perfect birthday gift for Charlie… But now I can say with confidence, Mr President, that you have given him the best birthday gift he could ever have.”</p> <p>The pair then spoke quietly for some moments as a band began to play Amazing Grace.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68eec2228f085f84552e3b8a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-14T21:48:39.464Z">10.48pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump previously called presidential medal 'much better' than top military award</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The White House ceremony in honor of Charlie Kirk has now concluded.</p> <p>At a campaign event last year, Donald Trump said that the Presidential Medal of Freedom for civilians, which he bestowed on Kirk on Tuesday, was “much better” than the top military award for those killed or wounded in action: the Medal of Honor.</p> <p>Trump was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/16/trump-presidential-medal-military-honor">widely criticized</a> for that comment, made as he addressed Miriam Adelson, the widow of the Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson.

He noted </strong>that he plans to cut “egregious, semi-communist” programs that, he claims, Democrats hold dear, but doesn’t plan to touch Republican programs, “because we think they work”. While hosting Javier Milei, president of Argentina, Trump took questions from reporters, in what became a far-ranging, impromptu press conference. </p></li> <li><p><strong>Trump warned that Hamas must disarm ‘or we will disarm them’. </strong>Trump added that could happen “quickly and perhaps violently”. When he was asked about a timeline for disarmament, the president said that it would be “a reasonable period of time … pretty quickly”. So far, Trump has been taking a victory lap, complete with bipartisan praise, for brokering the hostage-prisoner exchange on Monday, and the ceasefire deal in Gaza. </p></li> <li><p><strong>Earlier, Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States has struck another small boat that he accuses of carrying drugs in waters off the coast of Venezuala, killing six people aboard.</strong> “The strike was conducted in International Waters, and six male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel were killed in the strike,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “No U.S. Forces were harmed.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Back in Washington, the government shutdown enters its 14th day, with no end in sight.</strong> House Republicans continued to criticize the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, who they accuse of holding out on the House-passed funding bill to appease the left-wing base of his party. “We’re certainly not going to allow the American people to be taken hostage for his political gain,” House speaker Mike Johnson said today. Meanwhile Democrats, claim their colleagues across the aisle have abandoned good faith negotiations. House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries said that Republicans have gone “radio silent” since congressional leadership met with Trump at the White House days before the shutdown began. The Senate will hold its eighth vote, in the hopes of passing a funding bill to reopen the government. Spoiler alert: it’s unlikely to happen. </p></li> <li><p><strong>The supreme court declined to hear</strong> <strong>Alex Jones’s challenge to a $1.4bn judgment awarded to families of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in 2012</strong>. Jones, a noted conspiracy theorist and founder of Infowars, made several false statements that the shooting – which killed 20 children – was a hoax.</p></li> <li><p><strong>On the campaign trail, Maine’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, has officially announced that she’s running for US Senate, challenging the incumbent, Republican Susan Collins. </strong>Mills, 77, will face a primary challenge from Graham Platner, the progressive oyster farmer entering politics for the first time and backed by Independent senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68eea3968f0894af1b593d71" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-14T19:33:12.877Z">8.33pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump says that list of 'Democrat programs' that White House plans to cut will be released on Friday</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Speaking to reporters while hosting Argentina’s president, Donald Trump said that he plans to cut “egregious, semi-communist” programs that, he claims, Democrats hold dear. </p> <p>“They’re never going to come back,” Trump said. <strong>“The Democrats are getting killed, and we’re going to have a list of them on Friday.”</strong> </p> <p>“We’re not closing up Republican programs because we think they work.
