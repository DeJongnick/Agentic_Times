<p>Mass terminations and billions of dollars’ worth of cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have gutted key programs – from child support services to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/aids-and-hiv">HIV</a> treatment abroad – and created a “real danger” that disease outbreaks will be missed, according to former workers.</p> <p>Workers at the HHS, now led by Robert F Kennedy Jr, and in public health warned in interviews that chaotic, flawed and sweeping reductions would have broad, negative effects across the US and beyond.</p> <p>While Donald Trump’s administration is cutting the HHS workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 through firings and buyouts, <a href="https://doge.gov/savings">grant cuts</a> by Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) have also had a stark impact on state governments – and resulted in firings at state public health agencies.</p> <p>At the South Carolina department of public health, for example, more than 70 staff were laid off in March due to funding cuts.</p> <p>“Disease surveillance is how we know when something unusual is happening with people’s health, like when there are more food-poisoning cases than usual, or a virus starts spreading in a community,” an epidemiologist at the department, whose role was eliminated, said. “It’s the system that lets us spot patterns, find outbreaks early, and respond before more people get sick.”</p> <p>“When you lose public health staff, you lose time, you lose accuracy, you lose responsiveness, and ultimately that affects people’s health,” they added. “Without us, outbreaks can fly under the radar, and the response can be delayed or disorganized. That’s the real danger when these roles get cut.</p>    <p>“It’s invisible work, until it’s not. You may not think about it day to day, but it’s protecting your drinking water, your food, your kids’ schools and your community.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for South Carolina’s public health department declined to comment on specifics, but noted employees hired through grants are temporary. “When funding for grants is no longer available, their employment may end, as happened with some temporary grant employees who were funded by these grants,” they said.</p> <p>In Washington, the HHS has been cut harder by Doge than any other federal department. Hundreds of grants to state, local and tribal governments, as well as to research institutions, have been <a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf">eliminated</a>, worth over $6.8bn in unpaid obligations.</p> <p>The HHS receives about a quarter of all federal spending, with the majority disbursed to states for health programs and services such as Medicare and Medicaid, the insurance programs; medical research; and food and drug safety. Trump’s budget proposal calls for <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5280245-biden-hhs-secretary-slams-trump-nih-cuts-its-a-demolition-plan/">cutting</a> the department’s discretionary spending by 26.2%, or $33.3bn.</p> <p>RFK Jr, who has a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">history</a> of promoting conspiracy theories and medical misinformation, was nominated by Trump and approved by the Senate along party lines, with Mitch McConnell the sole Republican dissenter.</p> <p>Following a reduction in force of 10,000 employees on 1 April, Kennedy Jr <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/04/rfk-jr-said-hhs-would-rehire-thousands-of-fired-workers-that-wasnt-true-00274034">claimed</a> 20% of the firings were in error and that those workers would be reinstated, though that has not happened.</p> <p>An HHS spokesperson blamed any such errors on data-collection issues, and did not comment on any other aspects of the Guardian’s reporting.</p> <h2>Aids relief program ‘dismantled’</h2> <p>At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an operating division of the HHS, employees working on maternal and child health at the President’s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) program were shocked to be included in the reduction in force, as earlier in the administration their work had received a <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-pepfar/">waiver</a> for parts of the program from federal funding freezes.</p> <p>All federal experts on HIV prevention in children overseas were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/health/cdc-hiv-mothers.html">fired</a> as part of the reduction in force.</p> <p>“Our concern initially was that it was a mistake with the name. We hoped around that time it came out that there were 20% errors, that we would be included,” said an epidemiologist who was included in the reduction in force, but requested to remain anonymous as they are currently on administrative leave. They also noted that they were in the middle of planning and delivering a new pediatric HIV treatment medication set to be dispersed this year, and that that work was now at <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-pepfar/#:~:text=Background%20on%20PEPFAR&amp;text=PEPFAR%20has%20been%20reauthorized%20by,long%20as%20Congress%20appropriates%20funding.">risk</a>.</p>    <p>They said 22 epidemiologists in the branch of their CDC division had been fired. Pepfar was created in 2003 by George W Bush to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission and <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-trump-administrations-foreign-aid-review-status-of-pepfar/">credited</a> with saving 26 million lives.</p> <p>“We were very shocked on April 1 that we were put immediately on admin leave,” said another epidemiologist affected by the reduction in force at the CDC. “We really feel our branch being cut was a mistake. The state department had said services were a priority and needed to continue, but then we were cut by HHS.”</p> <p>They noted HIV treatment had already <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/04/14/g-s1-59863/hiv-aids-drugs-usaid-zambia">stopped</a> in regions of countries that had been reliant on USAID programs, such as Zambia.</p> <p>“It is one of the most successful global health programs in history, data driven with high levels of accountability and the dollars spent achieve impact. Our concern now is, yes, they are continuing Pepfar in name, but they are dismantling all the systems and structure that allowed it to succeed,” they added. “The US made a huge investment in this program in 20 years and a lot of it is now undone. We’ve now disrupted those systems that could have reduced and eventually removed US investment in these programs.”</p> <h2>‘Long-term impact’ on US families</h2> <p>Inside the HHS, the Administration for Children and Families is responsible for enforcing court-ordered child-support payments. For every dollar it receives in federal funding, ACF says it is able to collect $5 in child support.</p> <p>A child-support specialist with the HHS, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, said reductions in force at the department have increased workloads on those who were not fired by multiple times, making it so state and tribal agencies have no way of ensuring they are compliant with federal requirements.</p> <p>“The regional staff with direct oversight of the program are gone,” they said. “There are entire regions that have two staff members managing a quarter of the work for the program with no management, no support, no knowledge of the program.”</p> <p>After the Trump administration took office, the agency was under an unofficial stop-work order, where staff were not permitted to provide guidance or support to grantees or even answer phones, until late February, the specialist said. A reduction in force followed on 1 April, when, the child-support specialist claimed, about half the ACF staff working on child support were fired.</p> <p>Their department is responsible for overseeing child-support programs at state, tribal and local levels. States “could very well lose millions of dollars in funding” if ACF does not provide key training and assistance and the states do not have qualified staff, the specialist cautioned. “And that is the long-term impact to vulnerable children and families in the country.”</p> <p>They added: “The entire function of the program is to give economic stability to children and families, so that they do not depend on any other government program, or their reliance on these programs is lower, because the children are supported by both parents.”</p> <h2>‘A living hell’</h2> <p>At the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, also within the HHS, one of 300 workers <a href="https://hospicenews.com/2025/03/27/hhs-lays-off-10000-employees-300-at-cms/">terminated</a> as part of a reduction in force claimed it had been illegal, and had not followed any proper procedures. The National Treasury Employees Union has <a href="https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hhs-layoffs-illegal-rif-kennedy-trump/744865/">filed</a> a grievance over how the firings were carried out, including incorrect information on notices.</p> <p>They explained that, on 1 April, they received a generic letter informing them of an intent of reduction in force. Hours later, they were locked out of their government logins. “We started emailing the management that was left, trying to get clarification on what our status was. Nobody could give us an answer,” the worker said.</p> <p>On 7 April, they discovered through their paystub that they had been placed on administrative leave, despite never receiving a notice. They didn’t receive an RIF notice until weeks later<strong>,</strong> after requesting it.</p> <p>“Based on my tenure, and as a disabled veteran, I should at least have a chance of reassignment,” they said. “I’m not mad about losing my job. It happens. I’ve been laid off. The first time was in the private sector, and it was way more humane, more empathetic, and I was given different offers.</p> <p>“This, on the other hand, is unbridled hate. This administration has gone out of their way to make it a living hell for all of its public servants.”</p>
