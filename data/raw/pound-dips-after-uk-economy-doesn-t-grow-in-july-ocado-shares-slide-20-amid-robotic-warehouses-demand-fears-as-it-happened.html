This increase was driven primarily by the services and construction sectors, but production output fell by 1.3%. However, growth is slowing in these sectors and is likely the result of actions taken by the Labour government now being realised, with the increase in employer national insurance contributions having a significant impact on business confidence. </p> <p>“With the summer now over and the economy supposedly getting out of its slumber, we now face continuing uncertainty in the lead up to the budget in November given the precarious position the Chancellor finds the public finances in. It is estimated that the fiscal hole that needs to be plugged is anywhere between £20bn and £50bn. While that is a wide range, it means one thing for a government that has shown it will struggle to cut spending – more tax rises. </p> <p>“Speculation is already rife about which taxes will be raised, and without the ability to raise the main revenue generators – income tax, national insurance and VAT – the government is left with targeting multiple sectors for small amounts of revenue. This is increasing the headwinds for the UK economy and with still over two months to go, GDP readings for the second half of the year are unlikely to pretty reading. For government under as much pressure as it is at the moment, this will be a very difficult corner to get itself out of.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c3b9418f0880bae9c51f37" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-12T06:13:58.536Z">7.13am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Chart: three monthly GDP growth slowed again in July</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here’s a chart showing how growth has slowed, when looking at GDP over a three-month period:</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c3b8de8f086519d32706bf" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-12T06:09:10.929Z">7.09am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">ONS: production sector is falling back</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>ONS </strong>director of economic statistics<strong> Liz McKeown </strong>says: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Growth in the economy as a whole continued to slow over the last three months.
