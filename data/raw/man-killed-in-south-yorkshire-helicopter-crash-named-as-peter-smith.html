<p>A man who was killed in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/30/helicopter-crashes-into-field-in-south-yorkshire">helicopter crash in Doncaster</a>, South Yorkshire on Thursday has been named by his family as Peter Smith.</p> <p>The family described Smith, 70, as “a beloved husband, father and grandfather” and said they were “all devastated by this sudden loss”, in a statement released by South Yorkshire police.</p> <p>“He had a real passion for aviation, and this was something he shared with his family,” they added.</p> <p>“He particularly liked to spend time with his grandchildren doing crafts and playing. He was a proud family man who spent a lot of his time with his son, both working with and socially. Peter loved to have meals out with his wife and had a particularly sweet tooth.”</p> <p>Three others involved in the crash, the pilot, 41, and two passengers, a 58-year-old woman and a boy, 10, suffered minor injuries.</p> <p>Analysis of the helicopter’s flight path showed it leaving the airfield at about 10am and flying over Doncaster for about seven minutes before stopping suddenly near Bentley.</p> <p>Lee Needham, who lives in the area, told the BBC that the helicopter came down close to houses, train tracks, industrial units and electrical pylons. “Whoever was piloting the helicopter more than likely saved numerous lives,” he said.</p> <p>South Yorkshire police and the government’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) have launched a joint investigation into the incident.</p> <p>The family said they were supporting the investigation and asked people “to not speculate on the circumstances surrounding the accident”.</p> <p>“We would like to ask for privacy during this incredibly difficult time to allow us to come to terms with what has occurred and grieve for the loss of Peter,” they added.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the AAIB said a team of experts in aircraft operations, engineering and recorded data had been deployed to the site on Thursday.</p> <p>Kuki Helicopters, based at Retford Gamston airport, which is understood to have owned the craft, said it would “continue to support” the agencies involved in the investigation into the crash.</p> <p>The firm, which, according to its website, offers flying lessons and experiences, said in a Facebook post: “At this very sad time, all our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of all those involved in the helicopter incident which happened yesterday.</p> <p>“Our heartfelt condolences are sent to everyone affected by this tragedy, and we will, of course, continue to support relevant agencies involved in the continuing investigation.”</p>
