Indeed, one could make the argument that the ingredients for a November rate cut are there.</p> <p><em>So, why not November? </em>We think three things will be important for the MPC to see before dialling down restrictive policy again. One, the MPC may want to see some indicative signs that inflation expectations are coming down – and we should see some signs of tempering in the coming months as spot CPI slows in Q4-25. Two, the Budget. Consolidation is one part of the puzzle. The other is what the Chancellor does to trim 2026 CPI – something we think will be very important given our projections of ~2.6% y/y CPI next year. And third, pay settlements. The MPC has yet to see the Low Pay Commission’s NLW announcement and subsequently what that does to pay settlements. We won’t have much detail on private sector pay deals until after the November meeting. Put simply, there’s a lot more information to be had in December than November.</p> </blockquote> <p>The City money markets are now indicating there is a 40% chance of a rate cut in November, rather high than before we learned yesterday that inflation stuck at 3.8% in September.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/22/uk-inflation-unchanged-rachel-reeves-budget">UK inflation unexpectedly remains at 3.8% for third month in a row</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68f9e6d48f08939322bdf94e" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/lisaocarroll"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-23T08:37:04.960Z">9.37am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Japanese car makers Nissan and Honda are the latest car manufacturers to face the risk of shortages of semiconductor following the Chinese ban on exports of the chips Nexperia in the wake of the Dutch government decision last week to take control of the firm, </strong><em><strong>my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports.</strong></em></p> <p>The <strong>Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association</strong> revealed today that Japanese auto parts makers received the warning about supply from <strong>Nexperia</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>Association</strong> explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“The chips manufactured by the affected manufacturers are important parts used in electronic control units, etc., and we recognize that this incident will have a serious impact on the global production of our member companies.</p> <p>“We hope that the countries involved will come to a prompt and practical solution.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Germany’s <strong>Volkswagen</strong> warned Wednesday that its car production could be hit by a shortage. </p> <p>Dutch officials invoked a Cold War-era law last month to effectively take control of the Netherlands-based but Chinese-owned <strong>Nexperia</strong>, citing national security concerns, as the sector increasingly becomes a focus of geopolitical tensions.</p> <p>The company then said Beijing had banned it from exporting certain goods from China since early October - potentially a serious problem for carmakers as its chips are widely used in vehicles’ electronic control units.</p> <p><strong>Volkswagen</strong>, Europe’s biggest carmaker, confirmed some <strong>Nexperia</strong> components are used in its vehicles but said production was “currently unaffected”.</p> <p>“However given the dynamic nature of the situation, an impact on production cannot be ruled out in the short term,” added the company, whose 10 brands range from Audi to Seat and Skoda, without giving further details.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68f9de6d8f083ffcb1f46f86" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-23T07:56:24.641Z">8.56am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Shares in Tesla dropped by almost 4% in early Frankfurt trading this morning, after the electric carmaker missed <a href="reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL4N3W31GK">Wall Street expectations</a> for quarterly profits.</strong></p> <p>Earnings fell despite record vehicle sales, thanks to a rush to buy electric vehicles before a US tax credit for them disappeared.</p> <p><strong>Victoria Scholar, </strong>Head of Investment at<strong> <a href="https://www.ii.co.uk/">interactive investor</a></strong>, explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Tesla shares are under pressure in Frankfurt after investors shrugged off a 12% increase in third quarter revenue to $28.10 billion, beating analysts’ expectations.</p> <p>Instead, they were disappointed by its earnings per share which hit 50 cents, below forecasts for 54 cents.
