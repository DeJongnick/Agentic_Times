<p><strong>Name:</strong> Clanker.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 20 years old.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Everywhere, but mostly on social media.</p> <p><strong>It sounds a bit insulting.</strong> It is, in fact, a slur.</p> <p><strong>What kind of slur? </strong>A slur against robots.</p> <p><strong>Because they’re metal? </strong>While it’s sometimes used to denigrate actual robots – including delivery bots and self-driving cars – it’s increasingly used to insult AI chatbots and platforms such as ChatGPT.</p> <p><strong>I’m new to this – why would I want to insult AI? </strong>For making up information, peddling outright falsehoods, generating “slop” (lame or obviously fake content) or simply not being human enough.</p> <p><strong>Does the AI care that you’re insulting it? </strong>That’s a complex and hotly debated philosophical question, to which the answer is “no”.</p> <p><strong>Then why bother? </strong>People are taking out their frustrations on a technology that is becoming pervasive, intrusive and may well threaten their future employment.</p> <p><strong>Clankers, coming over here, taking our jobs!</strong> That’s the idea.</p> <p><strong>Where did this slur originate? </strong>First used to refer pejoratively to battle androids in a Star Wars game in 2005, clanker was later popularised in the Clone Wars TV series. From there, it progressed to Reddit, memes and TikTok.</p> <p><strong>And is it really the best we can do, insult-wise? </strong>Popular culture has spawned other anti-robot slurs – there’s “toaster” from Battlestar Galactica, and “skin-job” from Blade Runner – but “clanker” seems to have won out for now.</p> <p><strong>It seems like a stupid waste of time, but I guess it’s harmless enough. </strong>You say that, but many suggest using “clanker” could help to normalise actual bigotry.</p> <p><strong>Oh, come on now.</strong> Popular memes and spoof videos tend to treat “clanker” as being directly analogous to a racial slur – suggesting a future where we all harass robots as if they were an oppressed minority.</p> <p><strong>So what? They’re just clankers. </strong>“Naturally, when we trend in that direction, it does play into those tropes of how people have treated marginalised communities before,” says linguist Adam Aleksic.</p> <p><strong>I’m not </strong><strong>anti-robot; I just wouldn’t want my daughter to marry one. </strong>Can you hear how that sounds?</p> <p><strong>I</strong><strong> have a feeling we’re going to</strong><strong> be very embarrassed about all this in 10 years</strong><strong>. </strong>Probably. Some people argue that, by insulting AI, we’re crediting it with a level of humanity it doesn’t warrant.</p> <p><strong>That would certainly be my assessment.</strong> However, the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roko%27s_basilisk">Roko’s basilisk</a>” thought experiment posits that a future artificial superintelligence might punish all those who failed to help it flourish in the first place.</p> <p><strong>I guess calling it a clanker would count. </strong>We may end up apologising to our robot overlords for past hate crimes.</p> <p><strong>Or perhaps they’ll see the funny side of all this?</strong> Assuming the clankers develop a sense of humour some day.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “The impulse to coin this slur says more about our anxieties than it does about the technology itself.”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Some of my best friends are clankers.”</p>
