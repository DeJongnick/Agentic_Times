<h1>A tale of two suckers: Donald Trump’s plastic straws and Keir Starmer</h1>

<p>It’s difficult to know whether to set any store by Donald Trump’s bleak and yet also often banal pronouncements, which read as if handfuls of offensive concepts have been tossed into the air by a monkey, read out in whatever order they landed and then made policy. Until it’s clear they can’t work. At which point, the monkey must toss again.</p> <p>But this month, Trump, whose morning ablutions increasingly appear to consist of dousing himself in sachets of the kind of cheap hot chocolate powder I steal from three-star hotels, like a flightless bird stuck in the machine that glazes Magnum lollies, declared he wanted to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/welcome-to-trumpworld-where-the-developer-in-chief-sees-dollar-signs-in-the-rubble-of-gaza">build his hotels on the mass graves of Gaza</a>. Hasn’t Trump seen <em>The Shining</em>? It won’t end well. Pity those whose children have the misfortune to die next to a monetisable stretch of shoreline. And hope humanity’s next wave of mass killings happens somewhere uneven and way inland that hopefully wouldn’t even make a decent golf course.</p> <p>Is Ukraine the frontier upon which the future of European democracy hinges, or is it just a massive stretch of undeveloped fairway, its leisure/conference utility value currently compromised only by the desire of some losers to continue living in the country they consider home? Where we see the falling domino chain that starts with Poland and ends in your back garden, does Trump see only a succession of 18-hole courses full of men in caps and enormous flapping flares brokering manly deals at the tee? Drive your golf carts over the bones of the dead!</p> <p>But maybe Trump’s horrible mouth-cack is just continuing evidence of his former acolyte Steve Bannon’s advice to “flood the zone with shit”? Does Trump really hate all sea creatures so much that he has to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/08/trump-plastic-straws">reinstate the plastic straws</a> Joe Biden successfully, and commendably, outlawed? Perhaps he was once told to keep his hands to himself by a mermaid. “These things don’t work,” Trump said of paper straws. “I’ve had them many times, and on occasion, they break, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/trump-plastic-straws-executive-order">they explode</a>.” Must millions of seabirds, turtles, manatees and dolphins die because Trump imagines that paper straws explode? Or so he can suck up his Diet Coke fast enough to amuse Elon Musk, Pete Hegseth and JD Vance by burping a smelly chorus of YMCA in Biden’s face next time there’s a gathering of ex-presidents.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>Like some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval Office</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Because Trump, a fully grown man with unlimited funds, loves Diet Coke, and it’s tempting to wonder how many of his seemingly incomprehensible policy decisions can be traced back to his desire to be continually saturated by the soft drink. Maybe there is a subterranean lake of the stuff somewhere deep beneath the Greenland tundra that the climate crisis, which doesn’t exist, will soon make accessible to Trump’s deep Diet Coke drills? Delighted Inuit strip off their sealskins and dance in the showering liquid as they realise they have just struck a rich seam of their new master’s black gold. Like some kind of infantilised diaper king, Trump has genuinely had a special Diet Coke-summoning button installed in the Oval Office. Hopefully, he won’t get it mixed up with that other button. It will be a shame if all life on Earth is fatally irradiated just because Trump wanted a 500ml bucket of fizz to swill down his Big Mac and fries.</p> <p>But are we meant to take Trump’s erratic announcements seriously? While the last concerned voices of the dying liberal press pen outraged articles to their dying liberal readers about Gaza hotels, the invasion of Canada and Trump making it compulsory to drink everything through a Trump Plastic Freedom Straw Company Deluxe Plastic Freedom Straw ™ ®, even cauliflower cheese soup, his homunculus Musk has been quietly dismantling the infrastructure of American government as you knew it. There are cup-and-ball tricksters on Parisian street corners with more subtle moves.</p> <p>Half a dozen of Musk’s own hand-harvested incels-in-waiting, the kind of people who under normal circumstances would have got rich by inventing a way in which hardcore digital pornography could have been mainlined directly into the bloodstream in liquid form, have, under the spurious authority of Musk’s imaginary “department of government efficiency”, gone in and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/08/judge-temporarily-blocks-musks-doge-team-from-accessing-treasury-records">stolen all the data </a>about everyone and everything in the US ever. Never mind. I am sure they will use it responsibly. What can possibly go wrong?</p> <p>Some people gathered at the scenes of Musk’s cost-cutting exercises and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/05/elon-musk-doge-labor-department-protest">waved placards</a>. Others sat and gawked at news footage of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/04/bianca-censori-kanye-west-grammy">Kanye West’s naked wife’s arse</a> or enjoyed disappointing trailers for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/16/captain-america-brave-new-world-review-anthony-mackie-harrison-ford-uninspiring-superhero-filler">new Captain America movie</a>, while the world as they knew it crumbled beneath their king-sized sofas. Keir Starmer backed away, as one might from a neighbour’s unpredictable weapon dog, avoiding direct comment, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/11/assisted-dying-bill-high-court-judge-kim-leadbetter-danny-kruger-keir-starmer-labour-uk-politics-live-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67ab68a98f0839a6831b0de9">dodging a commitment to the AI declaration</a> like a coward and hoping for the best, while Trumpy growls and foams. Which simply won’t do.</p> <p>Look. I’m as disappointed as the next metropolitan liberal elitist champagne socialist by Starmer’s government. While I accept, for example, the migration crisis must be addressed, I didn’t expect Starmer, who once left his “village and went to the city of Leeds” and “discovered a whole new world of indie bands – like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present”, to do it with Nigel Farage-style performative cruelty. Address the migration crisis, by all means, but don’t be a c*** about it. Did Orange Juice suffer the indignity of their eponymous third album not even entering the top 50 in 1984 just so, 41 years later, Starmer could send <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/feb/10/home-office-launch-new-immigration-raids-deportation-numbers">Yvette Cooper</a> out to downgrade the desperate, like Paul Golding in heels.</p> <p>Currently, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire">Putin puffs up </a>under Trump’s protection and unregulated AI threatens to rewrite history in real time, Starmer is on his knees sucking the paper straw of Trump’s presidency. I fear it may be about to explode in his mouth.</p> <ul> <li><p>Stewart Lee tours <em><a href="https://www.stewartlee.co.uk/live-dates">Stewart Lee vs the Man-Wulf</a></em> this year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in July</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
