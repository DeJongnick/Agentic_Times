<p><strong>Guardian writers’ predicted position:</strong> 1st (NB: this is not necessarily Suzanne Wrack’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips)</p> <p><strong>Last season’s position:</strong> 2nd</p> <h2>Prospects</h2> <p>Just how impactful can a stunning Champions League win be on the psychology of a team that has struggled to challenge domestically in recent years? We are about to find out. Arsenal’s battling run to Lisbon and subsequent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/24/arsenal-grab-womens-champions-league-final-glory-against-barcelona">victory over Barcelona</a> ended a north London trophy drought, yet it has still been six years since the most decorated women’s team in England won a Women’s Super League title. Back-to-back League Cup wins in 2023 and 2024 ensured the cupboard was filled somewhat during that time, but those were widely viewed as not enough for a club with such an illustrious history, and certainly did not match up with the level of investment being pumped into the team.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/19/arsenal-launch-meet-and-greet-prize-draw-for-fans-after-wsl-matches">Arsenal launch meet-and-greet prize draw for fans after WSL matches</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ending Chelsea’s dominance of the WSL is the focus of every team looking to compete at the top and Arsenal are no different. For the latest challenge they boast players riding high on the crest of a trophy-laden wave, with five European champions for club and country in their squad following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/27/chloe-kelly-winning-penalty-england-beat-spain-win-euro-2025">England’s triumph in Switzerland</a>. The key is finding consistency across the four competitions that have eluded them in recent years. Renée Slegers’ squad has been strengthened, with the world-record fee paid for Olivia Smith a real statement of intent. It has, however, also suffered the blow of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/21/leah-williamson-to-miss-start-of-arsenals-wsl-season-due-to-knee-injury">Leah Williamson being ruled out</a> for the start of the campaign following a knee procedure.</p> <p>Arsenal have for some time weathered accusations that they can sell out stadiums but can’t win trophies. May’s glory in Lisbon has quashed that narrative, but the onus is on them now to deliver domestic success. All the ingredients for success are there and, in Slegers, they have a manager clearly capable of bringing them together and cooking up a treat.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/6FcEW/1/" data-alt="Arsenal’s league placing since 2021."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/6FcEW/1/">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Arsenal’s league placing since 2021</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The manager</h2> <p>Slegers’ time at the helm following the departure of Jonas Eidevall in October has rightly led to a place on the shortlist for the Ballon d’Or women’s coach of the year award for the 36-year-old. At the start of last season, Slegers was a relative unknown; an assistant coach at Arsenal who stepped into the breach following a poor start to the season that led to Eidevall’s resignation. An unbeaten run up to the winter break and qualification for the Champions League knockout stage prompted a permanent contract and Arsenal flourished, her inclusive approach and the culture she has encouraged yielding remarkable results. Now Slegers has had the chance to further shape the team the way she wants it.</p> <h2>Off-field picture</h2> <p>The decision to host all WSL games at the Emirates Stadium this season will further elevate Arsenal’s financial position. The club have sold 15,000 season tickets for the main stadium, having increased the number of fixtures they’ve played at the ground year on year. From the 2023 financial year to 2024, Arsenal’s matchday turnover rose from £2.7m to £4.4m; the impact of last season’s games at the Emirates on the club’s finances will be evident next year and the full effects of a permanent WSL-related move to the ground will be seen in the 2027 filings. The scale of the crowds at the Emirates is of benefit to other WSL clubs too, with players from across the world wanting to play there.</p> <h2>Star signing</h2>    <p>The recruitment of Chloe Kelly on a permanent deal following the conclusion of her successful loan spell from Manchester City is significant, but the signing of Smith is a huge statement of intent. After missing out on Naomi Girma and Keira Walsh, who joined Chelsea, and having reportedly failed with record bids for Mary Earps and Alessia Russo (before the latter was signed on a free), Arsenal needed a big transfer. Smith shone at Liverpool and was named the Professional Footballers’ Association young player of the year earlier this month. She is a star.</p> <h2>Stepping up</h2> <p>Kyra Cooney-Cross made 19 WSL appearances for Arsenal last season, starting 10 times, and displayed maturity and confidence on the ball. The 23-year-old has spent time during the summer training with Myles Lewis-Skelly as she looks to ramp up her influence on the side. Supplanting the mercurial Kim Little and the defensive-midfield maestro Lia Wälti is no mean feat but Cooney-Cross is undoubtedly snapping at their heels. This season could well be the year where the Australian shakes off the prospect label and becomes a mainstay.</p> <h2>It was a good summer for …</h2> <p>It would be neglectful to pick out one of Arsenal’s victorious Lionesses given all of them were influential in a bruising and thrilling Euros campaign. Kelly was the gamechanger, Russo led the line, Beth Mead was hugely impactful and, despite not playing a minute of football, Lotte Wubben-Moy’s influence on the side is held in high regard. Then there was Williamson, the captain, and Michelle Agyemang, who was the tournament’s breakout star and has departed for another loan spell at Brighton as part of the 19-year-old’s ongoing development. Agyemang will no doubt return to Arsenal given how highly rated she is in north London.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/4vc0Y/2/" data-alt="Arsenal’s results from the 2024-25 season."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/4vc0Y/2/">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Arsenal’s results from the 2024-25 season</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Main initiative to attract more fans</h2>    <p>The decision to host all WSL games at the Emirates has been in the works for some time, part of a long-term strategy that has led to large crowds for the women’s games in N5, and it is no accident Arsenal have broken attendance record after attendance record. The decision to play Champions League group-stage games at Borehamwood may feel like a step back, but with Arsenal struggling to maintain their high attendances on weekday evenings, there is logic to the decision.</p> <p>The next phase is managing player access with so many more fans in attendance, and the club will draw from a ballot of season-ticket holders and six-game bundle buyers before each game for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/19/arsenal-launch-meet-and-greet-prize-draw-for-fans-after-wsl-matches">a meet-and-greet</a> to curb the growing pressure on players to spend up to an hour or more signing autographs and taking photos after games.</p>
