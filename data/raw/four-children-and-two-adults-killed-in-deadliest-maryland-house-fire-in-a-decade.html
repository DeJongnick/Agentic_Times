<p>A fire killed four children and two adults after ripping through a house in Charles county, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maryland">Maryland</a>, on Sunday, authorities said.</p> <p>Oliver Alkire, the master deputy state fire marshal, told reporters that the blaze was the deadliest fire in Maryland in more than 10 years.</p> <p>“The house was built in a year when they should’ve had hard-wired smoke alarms. I can’t confirm if they were actually activated.</p> <p>One person managed to escape the fire reported at about 8.40am at the home in Waldorf, about 55 miles (88km) south of Baltimore, the local news outlet <a href="https://wtop.com/charles-county/2025/08/maryland-state-fire-marshal-deputies-respond-to-multi-fatal-fire-with-entrapment-in-charles-co/">WTOP</a> reported.</p> <p>It took about 70 firefighters more than an hour to control the flames. One firefighter was hospitalized and another first responder was treated at the scene for unspecified injuries.</p> <p>The cause of the fire was under investigation. Alkire said the blaze originated on the right side of the home within an enclosed porch.</p> <p>The ages and names of the victims were not immediately released.</p> <p>Alkire said officials didn’t immediately know if the residence had working smoke alarms and reminded the public to make sure their homes were equipped with such devices.</p> <p>“We have no reports of someone hearing a smoke alarm activating, so it just shows you the importance of how important those life-saving devices are,” Alkire said.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p></li> </ul>
