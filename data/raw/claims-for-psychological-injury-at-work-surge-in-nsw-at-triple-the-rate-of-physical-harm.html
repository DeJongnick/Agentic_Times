It’s not reasonable and it’s not maintainable.”</p> <p>Janet’s experience is not unusual, with families often affected by the psychological injuries of workers, according to SafeWork. The agency also reported that psychosocial hazards can lead to physical harm, including musculoskeletal disorders.</p> <p>Janet experiences tension headaches, muscle pain, depression and anxiety.</p> <p>“I ended up having to go on stress leave because it was just taking so much of a mental toll,” she said. “I had no energy for anything after work, no energy for my family.”</p> <p>Janet said she felt that the “decision makers” in her workplace did not have the resources or skills to create a safe work environment.</p> <p>The government has pledged $5.6m for workplace mental health training programs for small and medium businesses over the next two years to support the strategy.</p> <p>SafeWork NSW’s acting deputy secretary, Trent Curtin, warned big businesses to expect compliance checks and a hit to their bottom line if they failed to improve practices.</p> <p>“SafeWork NSW … may prosecute workplaces who repeatedly do not comply or where they have seriously breached WHS laws,” he said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/may/19/victoria-workcover-compensation-mental-health-injuries-daniel-andrews">Victoria to limit WorkCover compensation for some mental health injuries, sparking criticism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The digital infrastructure company Waveconn has put its staff through workplace mental health training provided by the government and presented by the Black Dog Institute and Transitioning Well.</p> <p>Josh Maxwell, Waveconn’s workplace health and safety manager, said the training helped the company’s older workforce “transition from how things used to be done years ago”.</p> <p>“It gave them some skills to understand their own capabilities,” he said. </p> <p><em>* Name changed for privacy</em></p>
