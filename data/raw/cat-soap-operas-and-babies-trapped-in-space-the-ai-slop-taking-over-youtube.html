<p>Babies trapped in space, zombie football stars and cat soap operas: welcome to YouTube in the era of AI video.</p> <p>Nearly one in 10 of the fastest growing YouTube channels globally are showing AI-generated content only, as breakthroughs in the technology spur a flood of artificial content.</p> <p>Guardian analysis of data from the analytics firm <a href="https://playboard.co/en/youtube-ranking/most-popular-all-channels-in-worldwide-monthly">Playboard</a> shows that out of the top 100 fastest growing channels in July this year, nine were showing purely AI-generated content.</p> <p>The offerings include channels featuring bizarre narratives such as a baby crawling into a pre-launch space rocket, an undead Cristiano Ronaldo and melodramas featuring humanised cats. AI video generation has surged amid the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-tools-gamechanger-for-film-makers">release of powerful tools such as Google’s Veo 3</a> and Elon Musk’s Grok Imagine.</p> <p>The channels have millions of subscribers in total, including 1.6 million for the space-stranded infant and 3.9 million for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SuperCatLeague/shorts">Super Cat League</a>, which features human-like cats having affairs and, among one of many bizarre scenes, the felines shooting down and dismembering an eagle.</p> <p>Many of these videos qualify as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/19/spam-junk-slop-the-latest-wave-of-ai-behind-the-zombie-internet">“AI slop”</a>, which refers to low-quality, mass-produced content that is surreal, uncanny or simply grotesque. But some contain a brief, rudimentary plot – in a sign of the growing sophistication of AI-generated content.</p> <p>YouTube has tried to stem the slop deluge by <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?sjid=2339649199301046246-EU#zippy=%2Ccreator-integrity%2Cfollow-the-youtube-community-guidelines%2Cfollow-our-programme-policies%2Ccreator-responsibility">blocking the sharing of advertising revenue</a> with channels that post repetitive and “inauthentic” content – a policy targeted at AI content.</p> <p>“All content uploaded to YouTube is subject to our <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9288567?hl=en">community guidelines</a> – regardless of how it’s generated,” said a spokesperson for YouTube, which is owned by Google’s parent company.</p> <p>After being contacted by the Guardian about the channels – which included channels in the fastest growing list for June – YouTube said it had removed three of them from the platform and blocked a further two from receiving advertising income. It did not specify which channels had been sanctioned.</p> <p>One expert said AI video generators herald the next wave of internet “enshittification”, a term first used by the British-Canadian author Cory Doctorow. Coined in 2022, Doctorow used it to describe the decline in quality of users’ online experiences, as platforms prioritise profit over offering high-quality content.</p> <p>“AI slop is flooding the internet with content that essentially is garbage,” said Dr Akhil Bhardwaj, an associate professor at the University of Bath’s school of management. “This <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/26/enshittification-macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-explained">enshittification</a> is ruining online communities on Pinterest, competing for revenue with artists on Spotify and flooding YouTube with poor quality content.”</p> <p>“One way for social media companies to regulate AI slop is to ensure that it cannot be monetised, thus stripping away the incentive for generating it.”</p> <p>Ryan Broderick, the author of the popular Garbage Day newsletter on internet culture, is scathing about the impact of AI video, writing last week that YouTube has become a “dumping ground for disturbing, soulless AI shorts”.</p> <p>Instagram’s Reels video feature is also flooded with AI content. On the platform, a video of various <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJmr7TpoM2o/?igsh=MWs2b2p4NGhqZmpjdw==">celebrities’ heads</a> attached to animal bodies has gained 3.7m views, starring the “Rophant” (Dwayne Johnson and an elephant) and “Emilla” (Eminem on a gorilla).</p> <p>On TikTok, many AI-generated videos have gone viral, including a video of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aidadveo3/video/7519984784207039766">Abraham Lincoln vlogging</a> his ill-fated trip to the opera and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mirto.ai/video/7518425845644545302?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7535040241146234390">cats competing in an Olympic diving event</a>. However, the Lincoln and cat Olympic videos are more in the spirit of the internet’s pre-slop era of playful wit.</p> <p>Instagram and TikTok said they require all realistic AI-content to be labelled.
