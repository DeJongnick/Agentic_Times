<p>At least 27 people were killed by Israeli fire as they waited for food at a distribution point set up by an Israeli-backed foundation in Gaza, according to health officials in the strip.</p> <p>It is the third such incident in three days, with Israel admitting on Tuesday for the first time that its forces shot at individuals who were moving towards them.</p> <p>The Gaza civil defence spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal told Agence France-Presse: “Israeli forces opened fire with tanks and drones on thousands of civilians who had gathered since dawn near the al-Alam roundabout in the al-Mawasi area, north-west of Rafah.” It is the same site where on Sunday more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/01/palestinians-gunned-down-while-trying-to-reach-food-aid-site-in-gaza-hospital-says">30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire</a> while they were heading to the distribution hub.</p> <p>Gaza’s health ministry said 27 people were killed early on Tuesday. Hamas-affiliated media also carried the reports.</p> <p>The United Nations’ human rights chief, Volker Türk, described the “deadly attacks” on civilians around food distribution as a war crime.</p> <p>“Deadly attacks on distraught civilians trying to access the paltry amounts of food aid in Gaza are unconscionable,” Türk said. “Attacks directed against civilians constitute a grave breach of international law and a war crime.”</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/gaza_aid_attack/giv-32554fPL2HQVTUM3x/" data-alt="Map"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/gaza_aid_attack/giv-32554fPL2HQVTUM3x/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>“There were three children and two women among the dead,” Mohammed Saqr, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital, which received the 27 bodies, told the Guardian. “Most of the patients had gunshot wounds, others had shrapnel all over the bodies, which means they were targeted with tanks or artillery munitions.”</p> <p>Doctors at Nasser hospital said the Israeli forces had mostly targeted the heads, the chest and the upper parts of the bodies of the victims, and that the health facility was running out of blood units and medical supplies.</p> <p>Hisham Mhanna, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross, confirmed its field hospital in Rafah had received 184 wounded people, 19 of whom were declared dead on arrival. Eight more later died from their wounds.</p> <p>A video circulating on social media documented the arrival of injured people at the Red Cross hospital from a food distribution point in Gaza’s Rafah governorate. It showed dead bodies and the injured being dragged by people inside the health facility.</p> <p>In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said troops fired shots near a food distribution complex after noticing “a number of suspects moving towards them”.</p> <p>“The forces fired evasive shots, and after they did not move away, additional shots were fired near the individual suspects who were advancing towards the forces.</p> <p>“The individuals were moving towards forces in a way that posed a threat to them,” the military said, without specifying who the suspects were. </p>    <p>A spokesperson for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-backed organisation that has taken over the distribution of food in Gaza, told the Associated Press the group ‘‘was saddened to learn that a number of civilians were injured and killed after moving beyond the designated safe corridor”.</p> <p>Witnesses told the Guardian the shooting started in the city’s Flag Roundabout area, about 1km (0.6 miles) away from the food distribution hub.</p> <p>Fadi Abu Mohammad, 43, said his relative Mohammad Abu Shamala, 22, was killed near the aid site.</p> <p>‘‘When gunfire opened on the civilians, he was struck by a bullet in the back and died instantly,’’ he said. ‘‘He was supposed to get married next month.’’</p> <p>‘‘Going back to the aid distribution is a huge risk and a potential death sentence, but everyone who went had no other choice. If they aren’t killed by bullets or shelling, they will die of hunger,’’ said Fadi.</p>    <p>Ahmad al-Shaer, 22, who went to the aid distribution point with his friend Hasni Abu Shanab, 35, said the gunfire started at about 5am. “When the shooting began, Hasni lay flat on the ground to avoid the bullets, but even then a bullet hit him, it pierced one of his legs, exited, and then penetrated the other leg, where it lodged. The gunfire was coming from all directions and bullets were falling everywhere around him,” he said.</p> <p>Shaer said Abu Shanab was moved to Nasser hospital and that the facility was “full of people in critical condition. There aren’t enough beds, rooms or medical equipment for all the cases.”</p> <p>He added: “Hasni went to the aid site because he had no other choice. He was desperate to feed his three children. He had nothing to offer them and couldn’t meet their basic needs.”</p>    <p>Tamer Nassar, 33, from Beit Hanoun, who has been displaced to al-Mawasi in Khan Younis said: “I went at dawn to the American food aid distribution point in Rafah. The gunfire suddenly and deliberately erupted at everyone present in the distribution area. Bullets were raining down on us from everywhere: from the sea, from the air, from the hills, from all directions. I was a victim, along with many others around me; some were injured, others were killed.</p> <p>“I raised my shoulder while trying to lie on my stomach, and that’s when the first bullet struck my shoulder,” he said. “Anyone who tried to help the wounded was also shot at. We decided to go there today despite the extreme danger. If we had food at home to silence our children’s hunger, we wouldn’t have gone and risked our lives. They took images of my injuries and found that the first bullet had entered and exited, but the second one remained lodged in the bone and shattered it.” </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/03/public-support-for-israel-in-western-europe-lowest-ever-recorded-yougov">Public support for Israel in western Europe at lowest ever recorded by YouGov</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The shootings follow other similar incidents recently in which Palestinians have been killed and injured by Israeli fire as they sought food at newly established distribution points.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/28/dead-injured-in-israeli-gunfire-at-gaza-food-point-reports">Hamas accused Israel of killing at least three Palestinians</a> and wounding 46 others near one of the GHF distribution sites. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound to re-establish control as thousands of Palestinians rushed to the site.</p> <p>More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/01/palestinians-gunned-down-while-trying-to-reach-food-aid-site-in-gaza-hospital-says">30 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire on Sunday</a> as they went to receive food at a GHF distribution point, according to witnesses. A hospital run by the Red Cross confirmed it treated many wounded.</p> <p>The Israeli forces denied “firing at civilians” in Sunday’s incident. However, an IDF official admitted that Israeli soldiers fired “warning shots toward several suspects who advanced toward the troops”, near the food distribution site, without specifying who the suspects were.</p> <p>Gaza’s Government Media Office said Israel had killed more than 102 civilians since the opening of the of aid centres run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.</p> <p>Israel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/02/israel-cuts-off-humanitarian-supplies-to-gaza-as-it-seeks-to-change-ceasefire-deal">imposed a blockade on all supplies</a> in March, saying Hamas was seizing deliveries for its fighters, which the group denies. Earlier this month, a global hunger monitor said half a million people in the strip faced starvation.</p> <p>The GHF took over the handling of aid despite objections from the UN and other humanitarian organisations, who criticised the new system for food distribution, saying it would not be able to meet the needs of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, and it allowed Israel to use food as a weapon to control the population.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.</em></p></li> </ul>
