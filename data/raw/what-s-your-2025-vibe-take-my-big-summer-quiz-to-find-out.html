<p>Teen summers before the internet were supposed to be wild and free, but mine were mostly boring, spent clumsily painting my toenails, eating Quavers, alone in a rain-battered tent. The one thing that made all of that tolerable was magazines and, more particularly, teen magazine big summer quizzes. I, for one, loved them. Agonising over my answers, totting up my points using an unnecessarily complex scoring system, then reading earnestly what my “summer style” or “party personality” was or whether I was a “great best friend” was as good as it got.</p> <p>And so, in honour of the magazines loved and gone, I’ve just <s>wasted</s> spent hours crafting my own summer quiz, which I’m calling “What’s your 2025 vibe?” Apologies to aficionados – it’s insufficiently granular for a proper 90s girls’ mag quiz (true masters could craft 20 psychologically probing questions to tease out what swimsuit style you should try). But if, despite the entirety of the internet, you’re bored this summer, give it a go.</p> <p><strong>1. You’re caught on the Coldplay jumbotron. How do you react?</strong></p> <p>a. That would never happen for, like, a million reasons.</p> <p>b. Instantly start working on a strategy to monetise my five seconds of fame.</p> <p>c. Go into therapy.</p> <p>d. Join the Foreign Legion.</p> <p><strong>2. What’s on your style wishlist for this summer?</strong></p> <p>a. Nothing – I’m doing “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/apr/24/how-to-not-buy-new-things">no-buy 2025</a>”.</p> <p>b. Something fishy: I’m having a <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/a65461167/sardine-girl-summer-trend/">sardine girl summer</a>.</p> <p>c. I’m still searching for barrel-leg jeans that don’t make me look like an actual barrel.</p> <p>d. I’m plotting how to replace my panama with a cardinal’s biretta. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/shorts/dBpOR6cDL0g">The conclave</a> was a hotbed of “steal his style” temptation.</p> <p><strong>3. What would Donald Trump post about you on Truth Social?</strong></p> <p>a. “In great shape, beautiful, wow!”</p> <p>b. “No longer HOT.”</p> <p>c. “A boring and wrong individual, very disappointing.”</p> <p>d. “RUDE!”<br><br><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Which billionaire </strong><strong>would you least hate to marry?</strong></p> <p>a. Bill Gates – at least he’s quite old.</p> <p>b. Elon Musk – at least it’s likely to end in lucrative divorce.</p> <p>c. Bryan Johnston – at least he goes to bed early.</p> <p>d. I’ve always had a soft spot for the eccentric Regency rake <a href="https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Mad-Jack-Mytton/">John “Mad Jack” Mytton</a>. I’m partial to a bit of naked duck hunting.</p> <p><strong>5. What are you </strong><strong>taking?</strong></p> <p>a. I’m microdosing.</p> <p>b. Lion’s mane, collagen and ashwagandha.</p> <p>c.

Take a Break,<em> </em>from Hamilton<em>. </em>If you know (about the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bestofwivesandbestofwomen">wave of TikTok parodies reframing Alexander Hamilton as a wife-hating commitment-phobe</a>), you know.</p> <p>b. “Darling hold my hand … <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/18/travel/new-york-floods-tiktok-meme.html">Nothing beats a Jet2 holiday</a>,” ha ha ha (help).</p> <p>c. Earworm is actually my nickname for my tinnitus.</p> <p>d. A nightingale singing in Berkeley Square.</p> <p><strong>7. You</strong><strong> have half-an-hour to spend on LinkedIn. What do you do with it?</strong></p> <p>a. Look for a job.</p> <p>b. Look for a new job.</p> <p>c.

(You must be very tired and unhappy – have you considered creatine?)</p> <p><strong>Mostly Cs: Mid</strong></p> <p>You’re trying hard, but it’s not quite working.
