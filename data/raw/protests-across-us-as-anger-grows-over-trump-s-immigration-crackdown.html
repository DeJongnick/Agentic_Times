<p>Protests against the Trump administration’s newly intensified <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> raids, centered on Los Angeles, spread across the country on Tuesday, with demonstrations in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Omaha and Seattle.</p> 
<p>Thousands attended a protest against the federal government’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in New York City’s Foley Square.<br><br>Some protesters held signs reading “Ice out of New York” and others chanted “Why are you in riot gear? I don’t see no riot here.”</p> 
<p>Shirley, a 29-year-old protester, condemned the Trump administration for targeting workers, which she called antithetical to the country’s essence.</p> 
<p>“I come from immigrant parents,” she said, with a large Mexican flag draped across her back. “It’s infuriating to see that this particular government is going into labor fields, taking people from construction sites, into industry, plants, into farms, and taking away what is the backbone of this country.</p> 
<p>“So I’m here today to remind everybody that the United States started as an immigrant country, and it’s a nation of immigrants, and I just want to make sure that I’m here for those who can’t be here today.”</p> 
<p>Councilmember Shahana Hanif of Brooklyn spoke before the large crowd in Foley Square. She criticized the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> and New York’s mayor, Eric Adams, for the crackdown on immigrants.</p>

<p>“Mayor Adams has made it clear that he doesn’t care about working class people,” she said. “He does not care about any one of us. He is collaborating with Trump to use tactics. He’s complicit.”</p> 
<p>She also expressed her desire to keep New York a sanctuary city, and called for more protections for international students.</p> 
<p>“Stop the attacks and assaults on our students!” she yelled, and was met with cheers from the crowd.</p> 
<p>Thousands also gathered outside an immigration court in Chicago, and then marched through downtown streets, drumming and chanting: “No more deportations!”</p> 
<p>At one point, a car drove through the marchers, narrowly missing the anti-Ice protesters, according to WGN TV News, which broadcast <a href="https://x.com/WGNNews/status/1932600312038064330">video of the incident</a>.</p>
