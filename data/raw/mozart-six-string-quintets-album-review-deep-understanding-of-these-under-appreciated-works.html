<p>Formed by string players from some of Europe’s leading orchestras and ensembles specifically to give historically informed performances of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/mozart">Mozart</a>’s string quintets, <a href="https://www.spunicunifait.com/home">Spunicunifait</a> takes its name from a nonsense word used by Mozart in one of his letters, the meaning of which remains a mystery. “We wanted to make a recording that would approach the quintets with the same reverence that [Mozart’s] quartets receive,” they say, and that approach results in performances of the six works that have transparency, flexibility and easy athleticism. There are the five well-known mature quintets, as well as the early B flat work K174, for which Spuncunifait play two versions of its finale. All are composed for a quintet of strings with two violas (unlike Boccherini’s quintets and Schubert’s famous C major quintet, which employ two cellos).</p>    <p>The players – Lorenza Borrani and Maia Cabeza (violin), Max Mandel and Simone von Rahden (viola) and Luise Buchberger (cello) – use a mix of 18th-century instruments and 21st-century copies; the recorded sound is close and involving. Not all aspects of the group’s approach will be to all tastes: vibrato is very sparingly used, and its absence can often be starkly effective, but the tendency to link notes in phrases with tiny glissandi can sometimes seem a little overdone. These are minor quibbles, though. The performances reveal the group’s musicality and deep understanding of these under-appreciated works in every bar.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Mozart: Six String Quintets">  <iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write" frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/gb/album/mozart-6-string-quintets-on-historical-instruments/1823826815"></iframe> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Stream it on Apple Music (above) or on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2WDZynOy5O88c190rM1tnd?si=JbrlngZNQQGGSK3yf0fQuA">Spotify</a></strong></em></p> <p>• This article was amended on 7 September 2025 to correct Simone von Rahden’s name.</p>
