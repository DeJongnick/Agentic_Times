<p>Vinay Prasad is returning to his role overseeing vaccine, gene therapy and blood product regulation at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a little more than a week after he left the agency.</p> <p>“At the FDA’s request, Dr Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,” Department Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement to Reuters.</p> <p>Prasad left the agency on 30 July after just a few months as the director of the center.</p> <p>Endpoints News, which covers the biotech industry, <a href="https://endpoints.news/vinay-prasad-is-back-at-fda/">first reported</a> the return of Prasad.</p> <p>Prasad, an oncologist who was a fierce critic of US Covid-19 vaccine and mask mandates, was named the center’s director by the FDA’s commissioner, Marty Makary, in May.</p> <p>Criticism of Prasad’s tenure intensified around the agency’s handling of a gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) from Sarepta Therapeutics.</p> <p>The FDA-approved therapy played a role in the death of two teens who had advanced DMD. After a third death in a separate experimental gene therapy from the company, the FDA asked Sarepta on 18 July to stop all shipments of the approved DMD therapy, saying it had safety concerns.</p> <p>The FDA changed course on Sarepta on 28 July and said shipments to the main group of patients for the drug could restart.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/09/trump-tammy-bruce-deputy-un-ambassador">Trump nominates ex-Fox commentator Tammy Bruce for deputy UN ambassador</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/who-is-laura-loomer">Laura Loomer</a>, a far-right influencer and conspiracy theorist with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/06/laura-loomer-donald-trump-maga-influencer">outsized sway</a> over Donald Trump, had called Prasad a “progressive leftist saboteur” who was undermining the agency’s work.</p> <p>Two days before Prasad stepped down last month, Loomer had released <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/maga-diehards-say-loomer-is-on-big-pharma-payroll-vinay-prasad-kash-patel-alexis-wilkins">misleadingly edited audio</a> to suggest that that Prasad had admitted sticking pins in a Trump voodoo doll, when the full audio made it clear that he was talking about the kind of thing an imagined liberal Trump-hater would do.</p> <p>Loomer reacted to the news of Prasad’s return on Saturday by renewing her attacks on him in <a href="https://x.com/LauraLoomer/status/1954204298461765854">a social media post</a> in which she promised to produce “exposes of officials within HHS and FDA” in the weeks ahead. “There are several Senate Confirmation hearings coming up and I have multiple oppo books ready for distribution!” she wrote.</p> <p>Prasad was a physician who joined the agency from the University of California, San Francisco. He has had stints at the National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health.</p> <p>The FDA and other health agencies have seen multiple shake-ups in recent months under the leadership of health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.</p>
