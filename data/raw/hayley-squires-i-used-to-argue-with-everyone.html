<p>A couple of years ago, Hayley Squires decided to get a new tattoo. “I’d been romantically involved with somebody for a little while, and it had driven me a bit nuts,” she explains. “Then he was out of my life, and it was coming up to my birthday.” She kept thinking up various symbols and signs that might mean something, but nothing rang true. Then she remembered this line. It’s a quote from <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em>, and it’s tucked nearly underneath the crook of her left arm. It reads: “And though she be but little, she is fierce.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Why can’t it be down to how good we are at our jobs? It shouldn’t just be about the way I sound when I open my mouth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Squires, 29, is both of those things. She’s also direct, talks a lot, and quickly, and is a genuine laugh, despite her talent for plumbing the depths of despair in the Ken Loach film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/sep/11/i-daniel-blake-ken-loach-director-film-movie-benefits-system"><em>I, Daniel Blake</em></a>. When we meet, she’s wearing a Tupac T-shirt – one of four Tupac T-shirts she owns – and a pilot’s jacket, which she bought because it looked a bit like the one Tom Hardy wears in the film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/14/christoper-nolan-dunkirk-first-full-trailer-tom-hardy-mark-rylance"><em>Dunkirk</em></a>. “Because I’ve got a bit of an obsession with him, I walked into Topshop and saw it and thought: ‘Ahhh!’” she says, smiling.</p>    <p>She’s about to star in <em>The Miniaturist</em>, a gorgeous three-part BBC adaptation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/01/jessie-burton-frustrated-strong-women-still-considered-novelty-fiction"> Jessie Burton’s bestselling novel</a>, though she almost decided not to go for it at all. “My agent told me: ‘It’s for the part of Cornelia, and she’s the maid.’ And I went: ‘No. I don’t want to.’ She said: ‘Just read the script.’ I read all three scripts in one night, and rung her and said: ‘I really want to go in for this.’ Because, you know, she’s the servant and she’s the lady-in-waiting and all of that, but it was so much more.”</p> <p>Why was she reluctant to play the maid? “It’s the age old…” she begins, stops, then sighs. Squires grew up on a council estate, and that, combined with <em>I, Daniel Blake</em>, has propelled her into a role as a sort of spokesperson on class, and particularly on being a working-class actor. She’s both happy to take that on, and weary of the necessity for it. “It’s to do with class, again – like everything in this country is to do with class, one way or the other,” she explains. “And so I did sort of go, is it going to be underwritten? Is it going to be clichéd? Is it going to be a stereotype? I hadn’t read the book, and I called my friend who had, and she said: ‘It’s an amazing part.’ It also taught me a lesson: not to have such a chip on my shoulder.”</p> <p>Still, you can see why her instinctive reaction might be to say no. In <em>I, Daniel Blake</em>, she played Katie, a single mother of two kids who is moved to Newcastle and driven to starvation by the punitive bureaucracy of the benefits system. In one of the film’s most memorable scenes Katie goes to a food bank and is so hungry she opens a tin of beans on the spot and starts to eat them, cold, before breaking down, embarrassed and distraught at what she’s been driven to. While promoting the film, Squires found herself on the sofa at <em>This Morning</em> to talk about austerity Britain. “That was such a car crash,” she whispers, her eyes widening.</p>    <p>The interview is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvu3rRZrFqY">YouTube</a>. It’s fine and friendly but, towards the end, the presenter Phillip Schofield expresses mild astonishment that politicians are being told to watch <em>I, Daniel Blake</em> in order to learn about the real world. “The Tories certainly don’t [need to], they’re more than aware of the system they put in place,” Squires declares. “Well, all parties,” Schofield interrupts, hastily talking over her. “We can’t be biased on that one.”</p> <p>“Nobody had said to me, don’t mention the Tories,” she says, half-amused, half-cringing at the memory. “But I’d had a great honest conversation with the producer and I thought, brilliant, they’re doing something about food banks. Why are you talking about food banks existing, if you don’t talk about why they exist? It’s like pouring water into a boat that’s leaking. There’s no point in me giving the information about what we need to do to help, when you’re not talking about the root cause of it.”</p> <p>Squires grew up in Forest Hill, southeast London, with her mum, dad and brother. When she was 14, they relocated to Sittingbourne in Kent. It was a difficult age to move. “It was <em>trouble</em>,” she says. Her brother is 18 months older, so he looked after her a bit at school, but it sounds like a difficult time.</p> <p>“People don’t believe it, but I was very, very shy.” Eventually, she was moved up an academic band and, in Year 10, started to do drama. “Then it became very sociable, because you do plays after school and all the rest of it, so I came out of myself much more and had found my group and had found my people.”</p>    <p>She set about applying to drama schools, got into Rose Bruford College when she was 18, but took a gap year to work and save money, though she spent most of it on clubbing. “It was at that time when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/18/sean-paul-dancehall-returns-observer-live-reveiw">Sean Paul</a> first came out, the early 2000s, a good, decent wave of R&amp;B and hip-hop.” She loved drama school, for the most part. “There were a lot of frustrations in the third year and I grew a little bit tired and a little bit jaded,” she says. “But I also wanted to argue with everyone when I was in my third year of drama school.” About what? “Life! Anything I could argue about! Absolutely anything. You know when you get to that point in your 20s where you feel like everything’s a battle? I didn’t have any patience with anything. Everyone used to say to me, just calm down.”</p> <p>What was it that finally made that stick? “It was probably relationships that taught me that, to be honest. It was relationships that had an impact, that gave me a bit of calm.” Romantic ones? “Bit of both, romantic and friendships. Romantic relationships, mainly – I look back now and go: ‘If you’d been a little bit calmer, that wouldn’t have played out like that.’ Also it’s a little bit in my nature. It’s not aggression, it’s a <em>care</em>. It’s a care for things.”</p> <p>That’s why she doesn’t mind being asked about class all the time, really. “It’s an important conversation to have,” she says, carefully. “But I get to the point of such frustration with it. I mean, <em>I</em> get frustrated with it, and my God, I’m not a black actor trying to work in this industry. One of my very good friends, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/14/daniel-kaluuya-i-resent-i-have-to-prove-i-am-black-samuel-l-jackson-get-out">Daniel Kaluuya</a>, was working from the age of 18, and went through so many struggles just to be cast as not ‘the black man’, but the leading man. And then he made a film about race and now people are putting him in Marvel films which is bloody brilliant and is right. But it gets to the point where you just go: ‘Why can’t it be down to how good we are at our jobs?’ It shouldn’t just be about the way I sound when I open my mouth.”</p>    <p>Before she got the part of Katie in <em>I, Daniel Blake</em>, she was acting, but inconsistently. She’d been in <em>Call the Midwife</em>, and in the drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/jul/26/southcliffe-harrowing-tv-drama"><em>Southcliffe</em></a> in 2013, but was mostly working in an office in London to get by, and writing plays. “Any time I went for an audition or to do a job, there was a ‘major family crisis’. And I had to have time off work. So bad!” she laughs. “They thought I came from a very difficult family where everybody kept dying.” Eventually, she gave herself a cut-off point for the office job; it coincided, roughly, with Ken Loach getting in touch. <em>I, Daniel Blake</em> won the Palme D’Or and Squires got to take her mother to Cannes.</p> <p>For the first time in seven years, she’s been working without a break. When we speak, her “brain is fried” from a 12-week run in the West End, where she had a scene-stealing turn as the glitzy, ditsy and vicious Mae in <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em>, alongside Sienna Miller and Jack O’Connell. She’s finished with <em>The Miniaturist</em>, which looks set to be one of the BBC’s big festive showpieces, and she’s about to star in the new film by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/duke-of-burgundy-review-toronto-film-festival">Peter Strickland</a>. “On paper it’s about a haunted dress that gets passed to different people, and their life then goes into a spiral, but it’s actually about longing and desire and relationships and how you feel in your own body. It’s bloody brilliant.”</p> <p>Squires is also getting back to writing, working on a film about three generations of working-class women in Kent. “It’s about feminism in the women I grew up with, and the idea that feminism is lacking in their world, because they haven’t got the education for it, but actually it manifests itself in different ways. The middle woman, who is my age, makes money through bare-knuckle fighting,” she explains, excitedly. Little, and fierce, indeed.</p> <p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09lgqs7">The Miniaturist</a><em> starts on BBC1 on 26 December at 9pm</em></p> <p><em>Styling by Bemi Shaw; hair by Liz Taw at Stella Creative Artists using Aveda; make-up by Justine Jenkins using Marc Jacobs Beauty, assisted by Rebecca Richards</em></p>
