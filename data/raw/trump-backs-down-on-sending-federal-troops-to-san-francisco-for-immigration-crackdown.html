<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> canceled plans for a deployment of federal troops to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-francisco">San Francisco</a> that had sparked widespread condemnation from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> leaders and sent protesters flooding into the streets.</p> 
<p>The Bay Area region had been on edge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/trump-federal-agents-san-francisco">after reports emerged</a> on Wednesday that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> was poised to send more than 100 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other federal agents to the US Coast Guard base in Alameda, a city in the East Bay, as part of a large-scale immigration-enforcement plan. By early Thursday morning, hundreds of protesters had gathered outside the Coast Guard base, holding signs with slogans such as “No ICE or Troops in the Bay!”</p> 
<p>But just hours later, the president said he would not move forward with a “surge” of federal forces in the area after speaking with the mayor, Daniel Lurie, and Silicon Valley leaders including Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO who recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/17/marc-benioff-apologizes-san-francisco-national-guard">apologized</a> for saying Trump should send national guard troops, and Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia.</p> 
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p> 
<p>Lurie said he spoke with the president on Wednesday night, and that Trump told him he would call off the deployment. </p> 
<p>“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning,” Lurie said in a statement.</p> 
<p>Trump confirmed the conversation on his Truth Social platform, saying: “I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around.”</p> 
<p>In a statement, a spokesperson for Gavin Newsom’s office, Diana Crofts-Pelayo, said of the decision: “Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason – and heard what we have been saying from the beginning.”</p> 
<p>The sudden reversal came as protesters had mobilized in anticipation of a surge in troops this week. Outside the Coast Guard base in Alameda on an overcast Thursday morning, tensions flared between demonstrators and police, who used flash-bang grenades to clear the crowd as CBP vehicles drove through.</p> 
<p>Later on Thursday morning, protesters were walking in a slow circle at the gates of the Coast Guard base. Many were carrying signs that read: “Protect our neighbors, <em>protegemos nuestros vecinos</em>.” There was at least one person dressed as Batman, and Marvin Gaye was blasting through a loudspeaker.</p> 
<p>Josh Aguirre, 39, had come to participate in his first ever protest. “It’s scary what’s going on right now, and we’ve got to just stand in solidarity,” said Aguirre, who had come, along with his dog, from East Oakland – a largely Latino and immigrant community.</p> 
<p>He found out that federal agents would be deployed to the Bay Area from his four-year-old daughter’s school administrators. “And the first thing I thought was the families that I know who bring their kids to school are going to be affected the most,” he said. “It’s important to show up for your community.”</p> 
<p>Raj, an educator who asked to be identified only by his first name, had come with his 10-year-old daughter. “In the Bay we’re involved … and our kids know what’s happening,” he said. “When federal troops come in here, they won’t just see what they think they’re gonna see, which are like violent agitators. They’re going to see entire communities come out with their kids, with their families, with their teens.”</p> 
<p>By Thursday afternoon, local leaders and organizers had gathered outside San Francisco’s city hall, where they grappled with the whiplash. It remained unclear whether Trump’s decision to pull back was focused only on San Francisco, or if other Bay Area cities such as Oakland would still be targeted. Further demonstrations were planned throughout the evening.</p> 
<p>Barbara Lee, the mayor of Oakland, said she had not received any communication from the White House or the homeland security department about federal operations in Oakland. Officials in San Francisco said on Thursday that exact details were still unknown.</p> 
<p>“At this time, we do not know which federal agencies are being called off. We don’t know if that’s the national guard. We don’t know if it’s ICE, if it’s border patrol,” said Jackie Fielder, the San Francisco city supervisor representing parts of the city’s Mission neighborhood.</p> 
<p>Fielder also criticized Benioff, Elon Musk and other tech leaders who had voiced support for a national guard deployment in the Bay Area. “I condemn every tech billionaire who supported this,” she said. “This city doesn’t belong to them.”</p>

<p>Fielder and other organizers emphasized that even as the region awaits clarity on whether and where there will be a federal deployment, and the extent to which the administration plans to ramp up immigration enforcement in the city, local leaders are going to continue to mobilize rapid response networks, legal aid and other support systems for the residents most affected.</p> 
<p>“We don’t need to get ready because we’ve been ready,” Fielder said. “This is not a time for panic. It is a time for power across this area.”</p> 
<p>Trump had signaled for weeks that San Francisco could be the next Democratic city to face an administration crackdown. In an interview on Fox News on Sunday, the president claimed “unquestioned power” to deploy the national guard and argued that San Francisco residents want the military in their city.</p> 
<p>It was unclear if the national guard would have played a role in operations in the region. But state and local leaders on Wednesday had responded swiftly and strongly to the news of the CBP operations, and vowed to fight any potential deployment of the military.</p> 
<p>California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, called Trump’s moves “right out of the dictator’s handbook”.</p> 
<p>“He sends out masked men, he sends out border patrol, he sends out ICE, he creates anxiety and fear in the community so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the [national] guard,” Newsom <a href="https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1981103617265586655">said in a video statement</a>. “This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.”</p> 
<p>Lurie said earlier in the week that his city was prepared.</p> 
<p>“For months, we have been anticipating the possibility of some kind of federal deployment in our city,” he said.</p> 
<p>Rob Bonta, California’s attorney general, vowed to “be in court within hours, if not minutes”, if there is a federal deployment, and the San Francisco city attorney, David Chiu, has promised the same.</p> 
<p>San Francisco’s district attorney, Brooke Jenkins, said she was ready to prosecute any federal agents who violated California law.</p> 
<p>San Francisco has been the latest major US city to face Trump’s threats. The administration has previously sent the military to Los Angeles and Chicago, and has tried to deploy troops in Portland. All deployments have faced legal challenges from local and state authorities.</p> 
<p>Trump in recent weeks argued that a federal operation in San Francisco was necessary to combat crime. “Every American deserves to live in a community where they’re not afraid of being mugged, murdered, robbed, raped, assaulted or shot” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/san-francisco-trump-national-guard-troops">he said</a> at an appearance on 16 October.</p> 
<p>Local leaders, including the city’s mayor and district attorney, have said crime in the city is under control, pointing to falling crime rates and growing police recruitment. The city’s homicide rate this year is expected to be the lowest since 1954, the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/homicides-data-sf-record-low-21086889.php">San Francisco Chronicle</a> reported.</p> 
<p>Community groups had readied themselves to support affected residents. Organizers have mobilized to stage a mass rally in the city, as well as vigils at local libraries.</p> 
<p>Fielder told reporters last week she and her constituents in the Mission district had been bracing for this moment.</p> 
<p>“The moment that people stop going to work, when anyone Black or brown can’t freely walk outside without the fear of Trump’s federal agents racially profiling and arresting them, the moment when parents stop sending kids to school, become too afraid to go to the grocery store or doctor,” Fielder said. “What we have been preparing for in the Mission is essentially a shutdown the likes of which we haven’t seen since Covid.”</p>
