<p>Woolworths bears responsibility for the empty shelves seen in supermarkets across parts of Australia by attempting to treat workers like “robots”, the head of the Australian Council of Trade Unions has said, as a strike of warehouse workers extends into a second week.</p> <p>Up to 1,500 employees began rolling 24-hour strikes on 21 November in warehouses in New South Wales and Victoria, seeking improved wages and safety. One of the major issues is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/23/woolworths-staff-efficiency-productivity-crackdown-timed">a new framework system</a> employed at the warehouse that tracks workers down to the minute, and logs performance each shift using an algorithm.</p> <p>This week the strike extended to six sites in three states with workers at the Queensland Heathwood distribution centre joining the strike. Lineage, a cold storage warehouse that supplies Woolworths stores out of Melbourne, also began striking this week over improved pay and conditions.</p> <p>The strike has resulted in bare shelves in stores across at least two states in the past week.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/dash_nehring/status/1860543993832178113">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Woolies Vermont running out of promotional snacks and basically ALL of its smaller water bottles.

Woolworths must prioritise the safety and wellbeing of workers above all else.”</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/read_about_it/status/1861324493060264347">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey at <a href="https://twitter.com/woolworths?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@woolworths</a>, how’s that strike going?
