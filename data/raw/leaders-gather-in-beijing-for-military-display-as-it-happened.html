For the PLA, this has meant integrating its electro-optical and radar systems into counter-drone applications,” Lin told the Guardian.</p> <p>“The clear message they want to send is that their air force now has the ability to conduct system-of-systems operations,” he said, referring to multiple independent systems that coordinate for a joint purpose.</p> <p><strong>Raymond Kuo</strong>, senior political scientist and director at Rand Corporation, said the range of missiles on display showed progress in China’s efforts to build a “triad” of systems.</p> <p>He said China had developed fields of siloes holding ICMB launchers deep inside Chinese territory, but they had weaknesses. “They’re relatively slow to prepare and launch, and everyone knows exactly where they are,” said Kuo.</p> <p>To compliment them, China has planes - like the H6 bombers mentioned earlier - that can fire missiles from the sky, and sea-launch missiles that rely on stealth, like the new JL3 ICBM noted by ex PLA colonel <strong>Zhou Bo</strong>.</p> <p>“You can potentially get a nuclear submarine right up to the border [of your target] and then launch with about five minutes warning,” he said.</p> <p>“Each leg of the triad offsets a problem found in the others.”</p> <p>Kuo also said there were clear signs of China building its nuclear arsenal, no longer satisfied with just having enough to back up its doctrine of no first strike, and minimal retaliation.</p> <p>“They’re no longer comfortable with the US having more nuclear weapons, and they want to make sure silos don’t get knocked out and if they do they can strike back,” he said.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Jason Tzu Kuan Lu. </em><br></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68b7b0648f08020a75f124e3" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-03T03:52:29.583Z">4.52am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Event summary</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Thank you for keeping up with our coverage of China’s victory day parade in Beijing.

The two sides paused their battle fight alongside each other against Japan.</p> <p>After Japan surrendered, Taiwan, which had been ruled by Japan, was returned to the ROC. But the civil war had resumed, and soon, the CCP took control of the mainland and the ROC’s KMT leaders fled to Taiwan. The CCP established the People’s Republic of China, and the KMT established the ROC government in exile, intending to regroup and one day retake the mainland (spoiler: they didn’t).</p> <p>This is the very simplified background to the CCP’s claim over Taiwan today.</p> <p>But when it comes to the second world war, the two sides are also in dispute over who really led the fight against Japan.</p> <p>Beijing has mounted a campaign to emphasise the “correct view” of the history, emphasising that China and Soviet Russia played a pivotal role, and claiming that the CCP’s wartime efforts were “deliberately belittled and vilified”. Throughout the summer cinemas showed blockbusters that celebrated the battles fought by China against fascist aggressors, prompting a wave of patriotism among viewers.</p>    <p>In Taiwan, officials say the fight was mostly led by the KMT and its leader, <strong>Chiang Kai-shek</strong>, noting that they were the ones to sign peace agreements as allied nations.</p> <p>“During the Republic of China’s war of resistance against Japan, the People’s Republic of China did not even exist, but the Chinese communist regime has in recent years repeatedly distorted the facts, claiming it was the [Chinese] Communist Party who led the war of resistance,” Mainland Affairs Council minister <strong>Chiu Chui-cheng</strong> said last month.</p> <p>The council said the communists’ strategy at the time was “70% about strengthening themselves, 20% dealing with the Nationalist government and 10% about opposing Japan,” repeating an old wartime accusation against <strong>Mao</strong> the CCP has denied.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-03T03:11:19.735Z">at 4.11am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b7a7d88f08bb514e0fae36" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-03T02:40:11.299Z">3.40am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>A new photograph has emerged showing <strong>Dan Andrews</strong>, the former Labor premier of the Australian state of Victoria, standing among global leaders before the parade.</p> <p>You can spot him in the back right corner, behind <strong>Putin</strong>, <strong>Xi</strong> and <strong>Kim</strong>.</p> <p>Another former Labor state premier, <strong>Bob Carr</strong> of New South Wales, is also reportedly a guest at the parade.</p> <p>Critics, including opposition leader <strong>Sussan Ley</strong>, say the pair risk being used in CCP propaganda.</p> <p>But Carr told <a href="https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/dan-andrews-bob-carr-guests-of-honour-in-chinese-victory-parade/news-story/5c75fc9f5992c19420005cc54435e061?">The Australian </a>his attendance was in recognition of China and Australia’s shared second world war history, arguing that Chinese resistance defended Australia from direct naval assault by Japan.</p> <p>Carr led the Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney from 2014 to 2019.</p> <p>Andrews signed Victoria on to China’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-what-is-it-and-why-is-victoria-under-fire-for-its-involvement">belt and road initiative</a>, before it was vetoed by the Morrison government.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-03T02:59:51.662Z">at 3.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b7a90b8f08bb514e0fae38" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/helen-davidson"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-03T02:34:29.837Z">3.34am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Military hardware on display</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>There’s an extraordinary amount of military hardware on display.</p> <p>We’ve seen everything from tanks and drones to long-range and nuclear capable missiles, fighter jets and stealth aircraft.

He said the past showed that Chinese people always rally together “to defy the enemy” when faced with adversity.</p> <p>Xi’s speech contained several references to the “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” – a common phrase for Xi’s overarching plan for China’s future which hinges on Taiwan.</p> <p>Xi and the CCP claim Taiwan is a Chinese province, now run by illegal separatists, and he has vowed to annex it under what he terms “reunification”. Taiwan’s government and people are opposed to this.</p> <p>But Xi’s speech, while not specifically referencing Taiwan, makes it very clear that it’s still high on his agenda. He has pledged that China will take Taiwan by military force if necessary – and the parade display is also a strong demonstration of military capabilities.</p> <p>The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has been undergoing modernisation under Xi, but it is also been beset by corruption issues, and in the last few years there have been purges of officials and personnel at levels not seen since the <strong>Mao Zedong</strong> era.</p> <p>Xi seemed to reference that in his speech too, with a line that could be read as reassurance to people worried about it, and a warning to those inside the force.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The Chinese People’s Liberation Army has been and always will be the heroic armed forces that the party and the people can fully trust and rely on.

Instead China retains far greater influence over what happens next.</p> <p>China sells weapons to and is an ally of the military, though their relationship is complicated. Beijing was displeased by the coup in 2021, fearing the military’s seizure of power would create instability, and threaten China’s economic investments and its strategic interests.</p>    <p>Over the years, it grew increasingly frustrated at Min Aung Hlaing’s inability to control the country and impose order. It has been especially concerned by the explosion in organised crime in Myanmar, with which it shares a border - especially the proliferation of “scam compounds” that have trafficked large numbers of Chinese nationals, and targeted the Chinese public with online scams.</p> <p>Frustration prompted Beijing to give its tacit support to a 2023 offensive in northern Shan State by a coalition of ethnic armed groups that opposed the junta. However, when the success of this offensive looked like it might create a domino effect, and ultimately threaten the military’s grasp on power, China stepped up its support for the junta. It apparently feared the collapse of Min Aung Hlaing’s regime could ultimately be even worse for China’s interests.</p> <p>China has since increased its diplomatic engagements with the junta, and has backed the junta’s plans to hold elections, due to be held in phases, starting 28 December. Many western governments will perceive the vote as a sham, but Min Aung Hlaing will hope the vote will lead to a reopening or normalisation of diplomatic relations with some regional countries. India, as well as China, have signalled support for the vote.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68b7812f8f08020a75f123b0" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/justinmccurry"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-03T01:33:48.397Z">2.33am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">What is at stake for Kim Jong-un?</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Kim Jong-un</strong> has not left North Korea for two years, while it has been six years since he last visited China. The North Korean leader does not seem to share his father <strong>Kim Jong-il’s</strong> fear of flying - he flew to Singapore to meet <strong>Donald Trump</strong> in 2018 - but he could hardly be described as an enthusiastic traveller. So why has he decided to go to Beijing - again in a heavily armoured train - to attend Wednesday’s military parade?</p> <p>Having once been isolated as part of <strong>George W Bush’s</strong> “axis of evil”, North Korea has exploited changes in the global geopolitical landscape to come out of the cold, triggering concern in South Korea and Japan. Now it is one third of what western analysts are calling an “axis of upheaval” along with China, Russia and Iran.</p>    <p>While the Trump administration invites a backlash through punitive trade measures imposed on traditional allies, Kim has improved his regime’s ties with <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> and <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>. Reports that Kim and Putin will sit either side of Xi at Wednesday’s military parade to commemorate 80 years since Japan’s defeat in the second world war will be irrefutable evidence of a trilateral relationship designed to issue a direct challenge to what they see as western hegemony.</p> <p>Kim’s friendship with Putin, whom he met in Russia in 2023 and again in Pyongyang last year, has proved useful for both leaders. Kim has sent thousands of his troops to fight alongside Russian forces against Ukraine - a show of support that has reportedly given him access to Russian expertise in developing weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Kim’s relationship with Xi is more complicated. The Chinese leader has appeared more reluctant to antagonise the US through moving dramatically closer to Pyongyang, but China is still the North’s biggest aid donor - a role Kim is keen to build on for the sake of his country’s perennially struggling economy.</p> <p>Kim is also wary of the recent thaw in ties between China and South Korea, prompting some analysts to speculate that his presence at the parade is a pre-emptive move to frustrate any potential meeting of minds between Xi and the South’s new president, <strong>Lee Jae-myung</strong>.</p> <p>While Russia continues to attract international condemnation over its invasion of Ukraine, an unambiguous show of Chinese support for North Korea would represent a diplomatic coup for Kim - and make his long train journey to and from Beijing worth the effort.</p> <p>A successful trip to the Chinese capital could result in a reciprocal visit by Xi to Pyongyang in October for the anniversary of the founding of North Korea’s ruling Workers’ party, according to <strong>Lim Eul-chul</strong>, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies Kyungnam University in South Korea. “If Kim succeeds in securing Xi’s visit, it would raise the regime’s status to its highest level,” Lim said.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-03T01:42:11.794Z">at 2.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b799608f08bb514e0faddb" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-03T01:28:32.832Z">2.28am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump sends 'warmest regards' to Xi, Putin and Kim 'as you conspire against' the US</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>US president Donald Trump</strong> is clearly aware that the parade is taking place.

Many Americans died in China’s quest for Victory and Glory. I hope that they are rightfully Honored and Remembered for their Bravery and Sacrifice!

a few years ago, would have been dismissed as a piece of mischievous photo-shopping: the leaders of Russia and China, accompanied by the head of a pariah regime whose mission to arm his country with nuclear weapons had been opposed in the United Nations by his two companions.</p> <p>But dramatic shifts in the geopolitical landscape – Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and, crucially, the re-election of <strong>Donald Trump</strong> – have combined to bring <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> and the North Korean leader <strong>Kim Jong-un</strong> together.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, the three men led a group of more than 20 world leaders as they strode towards a rostrum in Tiananmen Square in Beijing to watch a “victory day” parade in Beijing.</p>    <p><strong>Xi Jinping</strong>, dressed in a grey Mao suit and flanked by Putin on his right and Kim on his left, is presiding over what could justifiably be described as proof that a second cold war has begun – led by a triumvirate of nuclear powers that have positioned themselves in diametric opposition to the US and its allies in the west.</p> <p>The symbolism attached to the first-ever meeting between the three leaders threatened to overshadow the huge military parade snaking through the streets of the Chinese capital.</p> <p>Just how the photo op will translate into action remains to be seen, but one world leader not on Wednesday’s guest list must surely be looking on with a mixture of curiosity and alarm.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time
