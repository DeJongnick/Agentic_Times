<p>A new plug-in hybrid EV ute that could rival Australia’s top selling vehicles, the Ford Ranger and Toyota Hilux, has received almost 1,000 pre-orders within hours of going on sale.</p> <p>The BYD Shark 6, which has a range of about 80km on battery electric before switching to petrol, could be the start of China muscling in on the market dominated by diesel vehicles.</p> <p>Australian customers interested in the ute, which has an introductory price tag of $57,900, were asked to pay a refundable $1,000 deposit to secure a pre-order.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/01/farms-switching-diesel-to-electric-australia">Electrifying the farm: ‘It could add a couple of hundred thousand to our bottom line’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Almost 1,000 pre-orders were received but BYD expects the total to be higher because dealers were forced to manually log orders late into the night after the website crashed.</p> <p>David Smitherman, the chief executive of local importer EVDirect, said the interest had been enormous.</p> <p>“Over 20,000 people have expressed an interest in the Shark 6,” he said. “In my 25 years in the car industry I’ve never seen interest like this in a new vehicle.”</p> <p>The Chinese carmaker, which sits second to Tesla on the EV sales charts, has clearly captured the attention of the big players.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>In the days leading up to BYD’s pricing announcement – revealed on the outskirts of Broken Hill and livestreamed to dealer events around the country – rivals ramped up their marketing activity.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning Toyota announced it was trialing an electric Hilux with the mining company BHP.</p> <p>Within hours Ford confirmed it would this week reveal the plug-in hybrid version of its Ranger, a direct rival to the BYD that’s due in dealerships in 2025.</p> <p>It’s indicative of an intensifying ute battle that will soon include Kia, which on Tuesday revealed its new Tasman that will hit the road in mid-2025 and will eventually include an EV alternative.</p> <h2>Changing of the guard?</h2> <p>While the ute market has been evolutionary and broadly predictable for years, it looks set to undergo an electric revolution mimicking what’s brewing with hatchbacks, sedans and SUVs.</p> <p>From the outside the Shark 6 follows a familiar formula: four-door body with the chest-beating styling that ute buyers crave.</p> <p>But beneath the skin it eschews a diesel engine for electric motors and a compact 1.5-litre petrol engine that predominantly acts as a generator.</p>    <p>The so-called plug-in hybrid EV – the first of many PHEV utes expected in Australia – can travel about 80km on electricity and charge overnight, allowing tradies, families and even mining companies to do their everyday driving on electrons.</p> <p>But venture to the bush or outback and the Shark 6 relies on petrol, travelling up to 800km between a charge and refill.</p> <h2>Fuelling the fight</h2> <p>Once the battery has been depleted it is far less economical. In hybrid mode the Shark 6 uses a claimed average of 7.9 litres of premium unleaded every 100km. The diesel-powered Hilux dual-cab auto uses the same amount and a Ranger 2.0 slightly less (7.6L/100km).</p> <p>However, those figures are according to a laboratory test. In the real world the diesel rivals typically use more, but the regenerative braking of electric motors – which puts electricity back into the battery pack when braking – means hybrids have an advantage in stop-start driving.</p> <p>So the Shark 6 is very much in the hunt and, of course, it has 80km of zero fuel use before the fossil fuel starts flowing.</p> <p>It’s that promise of EV that has fleets and government departments interested.</p> <p>“They’re looking for vehicles like this because they’ve got targets they’ve got to hit in terms of environment numbers,” said Ross Booth, the general manager of valuations giant <a href="http://redbook.com.au/">Redbook</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/01/ev-electric-vehicle-sales-prices-australia">Price driven: electric cars have never been cheaper. Is it now time to buy an EV?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All are trying to reduce their carbon footprint – and running costs – and electrifying the vehicle fleet is an easy way to tick a big CO<sub>2</sub> box.</p> <p>Opinions are split on whether electric can work in the bush, but Booth believes the ute market will respond.</p> <p>“The impact [of Shark 6] will be substantial because it’s giving something that the market needs,” he said. “We’re pretty bullish about it.”</p> <p>BYD is also undercutting alternatives powered by internal combustion engines. The Shark 6 comes with gear often reserved for luxury models, including heated and ventilated front seats, a head-up display and a Tesla-like 15.6 inch touchscreen as well as a digital instrument cluster.</p> <p>Spend that money on the Ford Ranger or Toyota Hilux – which between them command more than half the ute market in Australia – and you get more modestly appointed machines.</p>    <p>Not that the Ranger and Hilux are about to lose their sales lead. Booth believes utes fighting in the second tier of the ute segment could come under more pressure.</p> <p>“People aspire so much in the ute market to Hilux and Ranger; they’ve got such strong brands,” he said. “The market to conquer is that next level down.”</p> <p>That includes a varied selection, but three he nominates as targets include the Mitsubishi Triton, Nissan Navara and GWM Cannon.</p> <h2>Going the distance</h2> <p>Despite the injection of fresh tech, the BYD ute faces blustery headwinds. Whereas most utes can tow 3.5 tonnes, the Shark 6 lugs one tonne less.</p> <p>Dual-range transfer cases for solid off-road work are common in utes, but the Shark 6 does without, instead relying on tech and torquey electric motors to get power to the ground.</p> <p>And the Shark 6 gets coil springs at the rear versus the leaf springs of most rivals.</p> <p>But the big thing missing for the Shark 6 is reputation, which counts for plenty in the heat and dust of the outback.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/12/australian-states-too-much-rooftop-solar">Some Australian states are discovering what happens when they have too much rooftop solar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Toyota in some ways owns the bush with a reputation for reliability and durability that people pay extra for.</p> <p>Australians expect to be able to punish their vehicles over harsh terrain and have it come back in one piece.</p> <p>Longer term the Shark 6 may well deliver, but right now it’s an unknown quantity that some may remain wary of.</p> <p>“That always happens when you release a new brand,” Booth said. “There’s an uncertainty … Hilux has been in the market for 50 years.”</p>
