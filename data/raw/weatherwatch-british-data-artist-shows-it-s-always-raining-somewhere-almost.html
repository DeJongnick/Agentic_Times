<p>“It was really apparent when cycling from my home in Edinburgh that it could be dry if you headed west, but wet if you headed east, and vice versa,” says <a href="https://ploterre.com/pages/studio">artist Rebecca Kaye, alias Ploterre</a>, who produces pieces that involve plotting data in creative ways. This observation led her to wonder if it was always raining somewhere.</p> <p>Kaye gathered Met Office precipitation records for 366 different locations across the British Isles. <a href="https://ploterre.com/products/rain?_pos=1&amp;_sid=c2ea2e5a7&amp;_ss=r">The resulting piece, Always Raining Somewhere</a>, has 122 rows representing the days from 1 October to 31 January – the wettest period, says Kaye – and 90 columns for the years since 1934.</p> <p>Faint diagonal lines show light rainfall, denser lines are heavier rainfall. The overall effect resembles looking out a window on a rainy day. However, a few gaps show that there are a small number of dry days. It is only <em>almost </em>always raining somewhere.</p> <p>The image also illustrates gradually changing weather patterns.</p> <p>“You can see the pattern getting darker at the bottom right,” says Kaye. “It looks to be getting wetter later on in more recent years.”</p> <p>Kaye says she wants to make data more human, noting that weather observations were originally spurred by the sort of curiosity behind her own musings.</p> <p>“It makes the numbers less dry – pun intended,” she says.</p>
