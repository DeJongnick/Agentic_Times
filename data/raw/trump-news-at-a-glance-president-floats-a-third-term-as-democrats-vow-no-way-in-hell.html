<p>Donald Trump has declined to definitively say he will not seek <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/trump-third-term-extremist-ideas-mainstream">an unconstitutional third term</a> as US president. “I would love to do it: I have my best numbers ever,” the 79-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/donald-trump-third-term-vice-president">told reporters on Air Force One</a> during a trip to Asia. Pressed on whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you’ll have to tell me.”</p> <p>It’s not the first time the president has openly expressed interest in finding a way to stay in power beyond the two terms allowed in the US constitution. But his remarks on Monday provided more details into some MAGA minds’ thought process about how to pull it off.</p> <p>Some of his supporters have floated the idea that he could run as vice-president and then, if his ticket wins the 2028 election, have the president resign so he could reassume the presidency. Trump said Monday that such a move would be “too cute” and too unpopular to try.</p> <p>“I think the people wouldn’t like that,” he told reporters. “It wouldn’t be right.”</p> <p>But Trump’s unwillingness to rule out a third term altogether is ruffling some Democrats.</p> <p>“Despite what the Constitution says, [Steve] Bannon vows Trump will be president for a third term,” US Rep. Rashida Tlaib <a href="https://x.com/RepRashida/status/1982818317539684537">wrote on X Monday</a>.<strong> “</strong>But they all start crying when we call them fascists. No way in hell we’re going to let that happen.”</p>  <h2>Trump ‘would love’ unconstitutional third term but rules out running for VP</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> said on Monday morning that he would rule out running for the vice-presidency in the 2028 US election, an unorthodox approach that some of his supporters have floated to allow the Republican US president to serve a third term in the White House.</p> <p>“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, the latest leg of a five-day trip to Asia which he hopes to cap with an agreement on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting">trade war truce</a> with the Chinese president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping">Xi Jinping</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/donald-trump-third-term-vice-president"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump describes Russia’s new cruise missile test as ‘not appropriate’</h2>  <p>Donald Trump has described Vladimir Putin’s announcement of a nuclear-powered cruise missile test as “not appropriate” amid growing tensions between Moscow and Washington.</p> <p>Putin said on Sunday that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> had successfully tested its “unique” nuclear-capable Burevestnik cruise missile, which the Kremlin described as part of efforts to “ensure the country’s national security”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/27/russia-cruise-missile-test-trump-putin"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump cuts likely hindered Alaska storm warnings</h2>  <p>A faltering federal response to one of the worst storms in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alaska">Alaska</a>’s history, which caused hundreds of people to become homeless, is drawing further scrutiny over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s efforts to dismantle federal weather and climate protections.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/alaska-typhoon-halong-aftermath">The powerful remnants of Typhoon Halong hit remote communities</a> in the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta of south-west Alaska on 12 October, inundating a vast low-lying area of tundra that is home to some of the most remote and inaccessible communities in the country.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/alaska-storm-emergency-response-trump-cuts"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US debt set to soar above Italy and Greece under Trump</h2>  <p><br>Donald Trump is on course to push <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/GGXWDG_NGDP@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD/ITA/USA/GRC/GBR">US debt levels above those of Italy and Greece</a> by the end of the decade after wide-ranging tax cuts and increased <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/will-trumps-big-beautiful-defense-spending-last">defence spending</a>, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts.</p> <p>Illustrating the rising debt levels in Washington and efforts made by Rome and Athens to bring spending under control after the 2008 financial crash and Covid-19 pandemic, the IMF predicts the US will see its debts climb from 125% to 143% of annual income by 2030, while Italy’s will flatline at about 137%.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/27/us-debt-set-to-exceed-italy-and-greece"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump officials ask supreme court to allow firing of top copyright official</h2>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> on Monday asked the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court">supreme court</a> to allow it to fire Shira Perlmutter, the director of the US Copyright Office.</p> <p>The case is the latest that relates to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s authority to install his own people at the head of federal agencies.
