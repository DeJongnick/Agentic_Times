<h2><strong>24 Hours in Police Custody: Lost Boys</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>This week’s gripping investigation is at times surprisingly moving, as it exposes a wider problem of the exploitation of teenagers by organised crime groups. When a 15-year-old boy is reported missing again, it leads to police finding more young people being used to sell drugs, a phone with text messages threatening to hurt their family, and a 17-year-old who was first exposed to heroin as a child. Will they find the “elders”? <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Doherty’s Big Bear Rescue</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>Jamie Oliver’s farming pal continues his attempt to expand his wildlife sanctuary to cater for ursine residents. This week, he attempts to rehome two new polar bears, as well a pack of 12 arctic wolves. Brace yourself for some dramatic escapes and adorable baby animals. <em>Alexi Duggins</em></p> <h2><strong>Summer Night Concert from Vienna 2025</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Four</strong></p> <p>A magical night of open-air classical music in the grounds of Schönbrunn Palace. Tugan Sokhiev will conduct the Vienna Philharmonic and world-class Polish tenor Piotr Beczala for goosepimply performances from Carmen and Turandot, and the Vienna Boys’ Choir make their debut at the annual concert. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Live Aid at 40: When Rock ’n’ Roll Took on the World</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>The concluding episode of the star-stuffed documentary series about Bob Geldof’s passion project, featuring Tony Blair, George Bush and Condoleezza Rice among others. But before we tip too far into hagiography, Bono has some frank words about 2005’s Eurocentric Live 8, namely: “We fucked up”. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>999: On the Front Line</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, More4</strong></p> <p>The stressful paramedic documentary series returns. A woman with low blood pressure is found on her kitchen floor – but she refuses to go to hospital because it’s her mother’s funeral the next day. Elsewhere, another woman isn’t responding to pain and needs a second crew to take her to hospital. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Walter Presents: Arcadia</strong></h2> <p><strong>Midnight, Channel 4</strong></p>    <p>This Dutch sci-fi has undertones of Black Mirror, imagining a near-future in which a person’s “citizenship score” dictates their life chances. When Pieter manages to tweak the algorithm in favour of his daughter, he thinks he’s doing her a favour. Bad move: soon, his whole family is banished to the hostile wasteland of the show’s title. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Film choice</strong></h2> <p><strong>Passport Pimlico, 1.50pm, BBC Two</strong></p>    <p>Very possibly the greatest Ealing comedy ever made, Passport to Pimlico has one of the most wonderful premises of the 20th century; thanks to a confusing legal loophole, an area of Pimlico is declared part of Burgundy. As such, a forgotten bit of Westminster ends up breaking away from the rest of the country and becoming its own self-governing micronation, with all the greed and pettiness that comes with it. It might have been made in 1949, but the themes in Passport to Pimlico feel incredibly current, especially in post-Brexit Britain. <em>Stuart Heritage</em></p> <h2><strong>Live sport</strong></h2> <p><strong>Women’s Euro 2025 Football: England v Wales, 7pm, ITV1 </strong>Third and final Group D matches.</p>
