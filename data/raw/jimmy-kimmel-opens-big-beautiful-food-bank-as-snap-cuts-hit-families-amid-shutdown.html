<p>The late-night TV show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live! is stepping up to help during the ongoing US federal government shutdown by opening a new center for food donations.</p> <p>The ABC program announced the program, titled “the Jimmy Kimmel Live Big, Beautiful Food Bank” on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jimmykimmellive/p/DQpICO0kbX_/">Instagram</a> on Tuesday, just after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> reaffirmed his plan to block Snap benefits despite a federal judge’s earlier order for the administration to use emergency funds to continue the food assistance program.</p> <p>“Cutting SNAP benefits creates uncertainty for American children, seniors and families,” the post said. “To support our community members in need, we’re starting a donation center in our Hollywood backlot to benefit the @LAFoodBank &amp; @StJosephCtr … If you are in LA, please come by to donate food and if you are not, please consider supporting your local food banks.”</p> <p>The message also noted that specific donations such as crackers, trail mix, fruit snacks, 100% juice boxes, dried fruit, cereal boxes, wipes, diapers, facial cleanser, deodorant, soap, lotions, oral hygiene items and feminine products would be appreciated.</p> <p>Before Kimmel’s announcement, Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115492285081397189">posted</a> on his Truth Social platform that Snap benefits would “be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government” and that the benefits “were haphazardly ‘handed’ to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP”.</p> <p>Kimmel, known for his outspoken criticism of the Trump administration, also recently took aim at the president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/03/donald-trump-halloween-party-australia-richest-person-gina-rinehart-spotted">Great Gatsby</a>-themed Halloween celebration.</p> <p>“You know, throwing a party at your private golf club where the theme is rich white people hours before millions of Americans are set to lose their food assistance might be the Trumpiest Trump move of all time,” Kimmel said Monday night. “It felt like the last big bash before the Epstein files come out.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kimmel’s popularity has soared and reportedly surpassed Trump’s following a dispute with the administration that led to his show being briefly taken off the air in September, according to a recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/06/jimmy-kimmel-trump-poll">survey</a>.</p> <p>Kimmel’s suspension was announced on 17 September after he criticized the administration’s handling of the previous week’s killing of the rightwing political activist Charlie Kirk. Brendan Carr, Federal Communications Commission chair and a Trump ally, allegedly threatened to revoke ABC affiliates’ licenses unless the network acted against Kimmel.</p> <p>The decision sparked protests, debates about free speech, and boycotts targeting Disney, ABC’s parent company. The network reinstated Kimmel six days later, with many industry peers crediting the reversal to those who had joined the boycott.</p>
