<h2><strong>Stay with a herding family in Mongolia’s Gobi Desert</strong></h2> <p>Eternal Landscapes offers individual and small-group trips to Mongolia, with a focus on supporting local communities. On the five-day Erdenedalai Explorer trip, guests stay with a herding family in the vast steppes of the “Middle Gobi”, an area often bypassed by travellers heading to the better-known sights of the desert’s southern region.</p> <p>The trip offers a glimpse into local life in a wild landscape. A tour of the capital Ulaanbaatar is also included, during which you can visit projects working to improve life in the community. Eternal Landscapes (a member of <a href="https://www.theconscioustravelfoundation.com/">The Conscious Travel Foundation</a>) also visits other towns overlooked by mainstream tourism and provides employment for local women by using only female trip assistants. <br><em>From </em><em>$1,045pp (£773) in a group of six ($1,800 for a solo traveller or $1,265pp in a group of two)</em><em>, including </em><em>meals and transfers outside the capital, <a href="https://www.eternal-landscapes.co.uk/tours/erdenedalai-explorer-homestay/">eternal-landscapes.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Book into a hotel run by women</strong><strong> in Sri Lanka</strong></h2>    <p>Opened in January, Amba Yaalu, on a mango plantation on the banks of the Kandalama Reservoir, is Sri Lanka’s first hotel fully managed and staffed by women. In a country where less than 10% of the country’s workforce is female, the aim is to promote equality and provide employment for women – many of whom leave the island in search of opportunities in the Gulf states.</p> <p>Part of the eco-friendly hotel chain the Thema Collection, the idea for Amba Yaalu came from its founder, Chandra Wickramasinghe, who was inspired by his mother raising eight children while working as a nurse. A selection of immersive experiences are on offer, from cooking classes to village visits, allowing guests to delve into local life and culture.<br><em>Rooms from $120 (£89) B&amp;B, <a href="https://www.themacollection.com/amba-yaalu-kandalama/">themacollection.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Take the road less travelled in&nbsp;Morocco</strong></h2>    <p>Intrepid Travel’s 11-day South Morocco Discovery adventure heads to the Atlas Mountains and deep into the Sahara, and includes plenty of community-led experiences. Guests stay in a family-run mountain gite, and head to Tafraoute to visit an Amazigh home and learn about traditional life and how it’s changing.</p> <p>There’s the chance to visit a women’s cooperative outside Essaouira, which specialises in argan oil production. Camping under the stars, a camel safari at sunset and discovering ancient sites with a local guide are also part of the&nbsp;package.<br><em>From </em><em>£</em><em>662</em><em>, including accommodation, breakfast, two lunches and dinners and activities, <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/uk/morocco/south-morocco-discovery-159521">intrepidtravel.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Serengeti safari with a clean cooking initiative in Tanzania</strong></h2>    <p>Small-group adventure specialist G&nbsp;Adventures puts community tourism at the heart of many of its itineraries, with more than 130 projects built into its trips, working with nonprofit partner Planeterra. Local nurseries also grow a tree for every day a&nbsp;traveller is on a trip, providing revenue&nbsp;for communities too.</p> <p>Among its initiatives in Tanzania is the Masai Clean Cookstoves project that helps people to replace their traditional stoves, which cause deadly household air pollution, with modern models. An all-female team of engineers has so far installed 4,000 stoves across 60 Masai villages in the&nbsp;Serengeti.<br><em>The </em><em>12-day </em><em>Serengeti Safari and Zanzibar trip includes a visit to the Clean Cookstove project, from </em><em>£2,649pp,</em><em> including hotels, camping, breakfast and some meals, <a href="https://www.gadventures.com/trips/serengeti-safari-zanzibar/7205">gadventures.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Preserving traditional customs in&nbsp;Georgia</strong></h2>    <p>Adventure specialist Wild Frontiers offers a range of tailored community-led trips, including Adventures with Purpose: Georgia, a 13-day itinerary with a focus on social enterprise projects that are preserving traditions and empowering locals, combined with classic sights such as Tbilisi old town and the Gergeti Trinity church.</p> <p>Highlights include staying in the Tusheti region, a protected landscape managed by the Tushetian people, contributing to the preservation of the area and village life.

Despite being on a popular trekking route, the village was marginalised, with poor living conditions, until tour operator Valencia Travel Cusco launched the initiative to improve infrastructure and develop community-based experiences.</p> <p>Now, the 25 families there welcome travellers into their homes and share their cultural heritage, food and crafts, with tourism bringing a welcome new revenue stream. Valencia Travel Cusco is a finalist in this year’s <a href="https://icrt.global/2025-global-responsible-tourism-awards-finalists/">ICRT Global responsible tourism awards</a>, the winners of which will be announced in&nbsp;November.<br><em>The </em><em>14-day Colours of Peru</em><em> trip </em><em>costs&nbsp;from </em><em>$2,607</em><em> (£1,929), including a&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;the&nbsp;project, </em><em>accommodation, breakfast&nbsp;and some other meals</em><em>, <a href="https://www.valenciatravelcusco.com/colours-of-peru">valenciatravelcusco.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Safaris and storytelling in rural India</strong></h2>    <p>One of the newest trips from operator Village Ways takes visitors to the central Indian states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to stay with forest-dwelling communities and learn about traditional life and crafts, and ancient beliefs.

One option is the Ghana Teaching and Childcare Project, where volunteers work alongside locals in a school or childcare centre. This involves spending between four and six hours a days supporting children.</p> <p>Staff and volunteers live together, and there’s plenty of free time to get immersed in Ghanaian culture and explore the country’s national parks and beaches. Volunteers can get involved in a youth development programme too.
