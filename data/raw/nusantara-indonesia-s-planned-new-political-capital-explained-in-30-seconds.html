<p>Indonesia is moving its capital from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/nov/22/jakarta-great-garuda-seawall-sinking">rapidly sinking Jakarta</a> to Nusantara – a new city under construction in the jungles of Borneo.</p> <p>But the ambitious $32bn project has been stunted by logistical and financial challenges since it was announced by then-president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/joko-widodo">Joko Widodo</a> in 2019, with inauguration originally slated for 2024.</p> <p>Debate reignited in September when a new government regulation was publicised downgrading Nusantara’s status from “national capital” to “political capital”.</p> <p>Officials insist it is a commitment to “support the realisation of Nusantara as the political capital in 2028”, but the budget has also been substantially cut by Indonesia’s new president, Prabowo Subianto.</p> <p>Critics have dubbed Nusantara a “white elephant”, citing failure to attract the private foreign investment needed for <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/3/25/crowdfunding-a-capital-indonesias-unusual-pitch-raises-eyebrows">80% of the estimated bill</a>.</p> <p>Construction remains limited. By mid-2025, only 800ha of the planned 6,600ha core government area had been developed, including a presidential palace shaped like the mythical bird Garuda.</p> <p>Authorities say the project is in its “second phase” with public transport, housing for civil servants, legislative and judicial buildings under construction.</p> <p>They aim to have 20% of government buildings and half of housing complete with core infrastructure at 50% capacity by 2028.</p> <p>With mounting concerns for Borneo’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/01/indonesia-balikpapan-bay-borneo-nusantara">Indigenous communities and biodiversity</a> due to deforestation, the city’s long term future remains uncertain. It is due to be fully completed by 2045, with a population goal of two million.</p>
