In South Kesteven, my constituents don’t want to join a mega-Lincolnshire council. Yet they’re being pushed towards this. In Leicestershire my constituents do not want a Leicester city takeover. What reassurance will the government give that democracy will not die under these reforms and local people’s voices will be heard?”</p> <p>Rutland had its county status abolished in 1974, becoming a district of Leicestershire. However it was restored as its own county in 1997 before the Conservatives lost the general election. It led to the creation of a unitary authority.</p> <p>Communities minister <strong>Alison McGovern</strong> said: “I can certainly confirm that democracy will not die.

She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In a classic move by this Labour government, they accept the 78% tax rate is costing jobs – but they won’t do anything about it for another five years.</p> <p>So we call on the chancellor today – don’t wait, replace the destructive fiscal regime at the next budget with a fair one. One that protects workers and enables the energy transition. </p> </blockquote> <p>Forbes said the North Sea’s bountiful revenues had been “frittered away on unjust wars and pet projects” by successive UK governments, while Scotland endured some of the UK’s highest rates of fuel poverty, highest energy prices and repeated welfare cuts.</p> <p>In a plea to imagine Scotland as independent, she contrasted that with Norway’s $2 trillion oil fund and its low rates of child poverty and fair welfare system.</p> <p>However, Norway’s oil profits levy, which funds day to day spending, has been very similar to the UK’s, at 78%, while Norwegians pay more in tax, equivalent to 40% of GDP versus 35% in the UK. The VAT sales tax, a regressive tax, is 25% in Norway compared to 20% in the UK.</p> <p>To warm applause and a long-standing ovation following her swansong speech, Forbes echoed speeches from other delegates by lambasting Labour’s decision to reinvigorate the nuclear power station building programme.</p> <p>The SNP has a long-standing policy of hostility to civilian and military nuclear projects; Scottish Labour believes both stances are out of step with voters, in the belief a majority prize energy and military security, and will campaign at the May election for new nuclear plants in Scotland.</p> <p>Forbes said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We are leading the world in the innovation, technology and commercialisation of renewable energy. </p> <p>That is why it is so bewildering that the UK government would rather focus on the distraction of new nuclear, rather than on Scotland’s renewable potential.</p> <p>It will take longer. It will be more expensive. It will increase bills. And it will leave our communities to deal with dangerous nuclear waste.</p> <p>So conference, let us be clear with the Labour government today – Scotland will not be the UK’s nuclear playground.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68ecd8b98f08f99dceddd6b7" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-13T10:51:42.292Z">11.51am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has said that he hopes Gaza and Israel are now on “a sustainable path to a long-term peace”.

But they have abandoned the bravado of the 2024 Reform manifesto, which implied rebalancing the economy in that way was relatively straightforward.</p> <p>At their party conferences Labour and the Conservatives both claimed that Reform’s irresponsible economic policies would crash the economy just like Liz Truss’s mini-budget, and it is now clear that this line of attack seems to have had an impact.</p> <p>In its manifesto, Reform proposed tax cuts worth £90bn, alongside spending commitments worth £50bn. The key tax cut would have been lifting the tax-free personal allowance to £20,000.</p> <p>Today <strong>Tice</strong> told Times Radio that this was no longer a commitment, but just an “aspiration”. He said Reform remained committed to getting rid of net zero environmental levies, but he went on: “All the other details [in the manifesto] go because we’re in a different time.”</p> <p>Tice explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>A manifesto is based on a point in time. The principles behind it are absolutely rock solid. We said we’ve got to make very significant savings in order to fund a different way to run the economy. </p> <p>What’s happened since then is that the state of the economy, because of the mismanagement by this Labour government, the numbers have got far worse. And we will be focusing relentlessly, as I’ve been saying, on the savings.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tice was speaking after <strong>Farage</strong> told the Times <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/nigel-farage-abandon-reform-manifesto-tax-6cctqsz6h">in an interview</a> that Reform would have a “rigorous and fully-costed manifesto” at the next election and that a Reform government could cut spending before it cut taxes. Farage said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Reform will never borrow to spend, as Labour and the Tories have done for so long; instead, we will ensure savings are made before implementing tax cuts. I will have more to say on all this in the coming weeks.</p> </blockquote> <p>The tax and spending policies in Reform’s 2024 manifesto were widely seen an unrealistic. Although the party claimed that its proposed cuts were affordable, the Economist published<a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/05/08/nigel-farages-economic-plans-are-a-disaster"> an analysis</a> claiming that a more realistic assessment of the plans showed “the annual costs are in the region of £200bn and savings around £100bn”. The Economist said: “The gap between the two would amount to a colossal fiscal shock, blowing up the deficit and straining the gilt market to its limits.”</p> <p>The Reform manifesto also including a commitment to abolish stamp duty. One irony is that, while this is no longer a firm Reform pledge, abolishing stamp duty for primary residences has now become <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/08/tories-scrap-stamp-duty-kemi-badenoch-conservative-conference-speech">an official Conservative party promise.</a></p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68ecc5508f08563c9da77e25" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-13T09:27:06.457Z">10.27am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Tom Tugendhat</strong>, the Tory former security minister, used an interview on the Today programme this morning to attack the government for its stance on the China spy prosecution that collapsed.

In it, Badenoch said Starmer should arrange for a minister to make a statement about it in the Commons today and she set out six questions that she said needed to be answered.</p> <p>For the record, here they are:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>· Is your argument that no minister knew anything of the government’s interactions with the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] over the “many months” in which your government refused to give the CPS the material it wanted?</p> <p>· Did ministers at HMT [His Majesty’s Treasury], Home Office or the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] ever brief you, the prime minister, about this matter or refer to it in any way? Did Jonathan Powell mention it to you at any point?</p> <p>· Is your government still denying that a meeting including Jonathan Powell and FCDO permanent secretary took place in early September? If not, why did the home secretary and your spokesman deny this?</p> <p>· Ministers now say your national security adviser was “not involved in the substance of the case and discussions around that”. What does this mean? If he was “not involved” in the decision over months not to give the CPS what they needed, then who was?</p> <p>· Does the government now accept that what Dan Jarvis told the House of Commons on 15 September, ie that the government had no warning and wasn’t involved, was misleading? Will you ensure that the record is corrected urgently?</p> <p>· Is it still your government’s position to claim that it would have been impossible to argue that China was a threat in court? If so, do you think the former head of public prosecutions, two former cabinet secretaries, and a former head of MI6 are all wrong?</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-13T12:08:39.540Z">at 1.08pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68eca2188f08563c9da77d16" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-13T08:53:23.263Z">9.53am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Jonathan Powell praised as 'incredible' by Trump envoy as MPs prepare to debate his role in collapse of China spy trial</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Good morning. <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> will be in Egypt today, attending the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/12/uk-to-host-international-summit-on-gaza-recovery-plan"> Middle East peace summit</a> being co-chaired by Donald Trump.

But, in a curious twist, a tweet from <strong>Steve Witkoff,</strong> President Trump’s peace envoy, has managed to link Gaza with the main talking point in Westminster politics this morning.</p> <p>About two hours ago Witkoff posted <a href="https://x.com/SEPeaceMissions/status/1977613594499199390">this on X</a>.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I would like to acknowledge the vital role of the United Kingdom in assisting and coordinating efforts that have led us to this historic day in Israel.

She can thank @realDonaldTrump anytime just to set the record straight.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Witkoff tweet read like an White House-sanctioned mini rebuke, and a reassurance to London that the ambassador was not speaking on behalf of the administration.</p> <p>But Witkoff’s decision to also go public with lavish praise for Powell also implies that he is trying to be helpful to the UK national security adviser when he is under intense pressure because the opposition parties are blaming him for the collapse of the China spy trial. Here is <strong>Peter Walker’</strong>s overnight story on this.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/12/jonathan-powell-no-role-dropping-china-spy-case-senior-minister-says">Jonathan Powell had no role in dropping of China spy case, senior minister says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Powell is under increasing pressure because, with recess over, MPs can now use all the parliamentary levers available to them to demand a fuller explanation from ministers as to what happened. They can table urgent questions, or even use the SO24 (standing order 24) procedure to demand an emergency debate. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, was furious about the decision to drop the spying prosecution (because it involved allegations of spying happening within parliament) and he is likely to be sympathetic to requests for UQs or emergency debates. When ministers know that a UQ is likely to be granted, they often decide to make a formal ministerial statement instead.</p> <p>This is what <strong>Hamish Falconer</strong>, the Middle East minister, implied would happen in a Today programme interview this morning. Asked if the public would get a proper explanation in parliament as to why the spy trial collapsed, he replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I will not get ahead of the Speaker on what is tabled in parliament, but I would expect that parliament will discuss this later.</p> </blockquote> <p>Falconer was referring to the fact that the Speaker’s Office only formally announces what statements and UQs are being allowed at about 1pm on a Monday.</p> <p>Powell is being blamed for the collapse of the trial because it is alleged he refused to agree to the government giving the prosecution a statement saying China is a threat to national security, and that without this the prosecution could not make this case. It is alleged Powell held back to avoid antagonising the Chinese government.</p> <p>Ministers say the decision to drop the case was taken by the Crown Prosecution Service, not the government, and that they were constrained by what official government policy was at the time the alleged offences were committed – when the Conservatives were in power.</p> <p>In his Today interview Falconer offered a slightly new version of this argument, saying the Official Secrets Act should be been updated earlier. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There was a case taken about alleged offences under the Official Secrets Act, which is a rather archaic piece of legislation … which was written in 1911.</p> <p>The case, unfortunately, involves a period before successor legislation was put in place in 2023 [the National Security Act].</p> <p>So the CPS, who do these things, rightly, independently from government, were trying to put together a case based on evidence from both a period where the Official Secrets Act, rather than National Security Act was the legislation in place, and it was this Conservative government, rather than the Labour government, who were in place.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> Kemi Badenoch is visiting Grantham to mark the 100th anniversary of the day Margaret Thatcher was born.</p> <p><em>10.30am:</em> Kate Forbes, Scotland’s deputy first minister, opens the final day of the SNP’s conference in Aberdeen.
