Dominique Pelicot, who admitted the charges, kept hundreds of videos of the attacks on his computer in a file entitled “abuse”. A French court <a href="https://theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/19/gisele-pelicot-trial-husband-jailed-for-20-years-as-all-51-men-found-guilty">sentenced him to 20 years in prison in December</a>.</p> <p>“Every time the intimacy of our client’s personal life is violated, we will react and seek a court decision,” the lawyer Antoine Camus said on Thursday. Camus said it was “shocking” and “disappointing” that Paris Match would secretly take pictures of Pelicot, “whose ordeal was the subject of 3,000 pictures and videos”.</p> <p>He accused the magazine of “having learned nothing from the four-month trial”.<br>Contacted by Agence France-Presse, Paris Match had no comment.</p> <p>Pelicot was included in Time magazine’s list published on Wednesday of the world’s most influential people in 2025.<br></p>
