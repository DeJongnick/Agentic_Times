<p>The Spanish football federation (RFEF) has confirmed the contract of its women’s team manager, Montse Tomé, will not be renewed when it expires at the end of August. The under-23 manager, Sonia Bermúdez, has been appointed to replace Tomé, with the former Spain international to be assisted by Iraia Iturregi in a new joint model.</p> <p>Tomé was appointed in 2023, the assistant manager taking over from Jorge Vilda, who was sacked after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/aug/20/spain-england-womens-world-cup-final-match-report">Spain’s first World Cup win</a>. Long-held frustrations boiled over after the federation’s then president Luis Rubiales’s inappropriate actions during the medal ceremony, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/20/luis-rubiales-verdict-spanish-footballer-jenni-hermoso">including kissing Jenni Hermoso</a>.</p> <p>Tomé left Hermoso out of her first squad, citing a need to protect her, a decision the player criticised. She guided the team to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/feb/28/spain-france-womens-nations-league-final-match-report">2023-24 Nations League title </a>and to the final of Women’s Euro 2025, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/27/chloe-kelly-winning-penalty-england-beat-spain-win-euro-2025">where they lost against England last month</a>.</p> <p>The federation’s board thanked Tomé for “her work, professionalism and dedication in various roles during her time as a member of the national teams at the RFEF, especially during her time as the national team coach”.</p> <p>Bermúdez scored 35 goals in 63 games for Spain and played for Rayo Vallecano, Barcelona, Western New York Flash, Atlético Madrid and Levante, winning nine league titles and three Copa de la Reina trophies. She coached the under-19 and under-20 women’s national teams, winning two consecutive European titles, before taking charge of the under-23 side.</p> <p>Iturregi played 15 seasons in the Spanish top flight, winning four league titles with Athletic Club.</p> <p>David Aznar has been appointed coach of Spain’s under-19 and under-20 sides and Milagros Martínez will be the under-17 coach.</p>
