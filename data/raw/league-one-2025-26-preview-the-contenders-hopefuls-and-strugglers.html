<h2><strong>Promotion hopefuls</strong></h2> <p>Last season was grim for <strong>Luton</strong>, culminating in them suffering a second successive relegation. But there remains plenty of quality at Kenilworth Road. Teden Mengi could easily be playing in the top flight, while Millenic Alli is a leading light of the recent intake. Most importantly, perhaps, the manager, Matt Bloomfield, knows this division well. <strong>Cardiff</strong> were also relegated from the Championship last season and will be hoping their new manager, Brian Barry-Murphy, can arrest the Welsh club’s slide.</p> <p><strong>Stockport</strong> missed out in the playoffs last season after finishing third. They also lost Isaac Olaofe to Charlton but have invested a club-record fee in Malik Mothersille from Peterborough to fill the void. The Hatters will be confident of another promotion push as long as they can hold on to the highly rated Ethan Pye and Lewis Bate, who have attracted Championship interest over the summer. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/30/league-two-2025-26-preview-the-contenders-hopefuls-and-strugglers">League Two 2025-26 preview: the contenders, hopefuls and strugglers</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Huddersfield</strong> are another who have changed manager, bringing in Lee Grant for what is the former Stoke goalkeeper’s first managerial role. Grant has sought experience on the pitch, signing Ryan Ledson, Murray Wallace, Lynden Gooch and Alfie May. Tom Cleverley has taken the reins at <strong>Plymouth</strong> after their relegation from the Championship, while Mike Dodds will need Richard Kone to stay put if <strong>Wycombe</strong> are to battle for a spot in the Championship.</p> <h2><strong>Playoff hopefuls</strong></h2> <p>Steve Bruce will not want to be known as a League One manager for another season. He arrived at <strong>Blackpool </strong>midway through the last campaign and has been given the resources to push for a return to the second tier. Fraser Horsfall and Michael Ihiekwe have been acquired to strengthen central defence, and with Ashley Fletcher leading the line, Bruce’s men will be hoping to rustle feathers.</p>    <p><strong>Reading</strong> did well to finish seventh last season considering the issues surrounding the club. Rob Couhig has become the new owner and a calmer presence in the boardroom could translate on to the pitch.</p> <p><strong>Bolton</strong> finished eighth last season and their manger, Steven Schumacher, will be hoping to better that this time around. The loan signings of Teddy Sharman-Lowe and Amario Cozier-Duberry should excite but the loss of the captain, George Thomason, to Wrexham will need addressing.</p> <p><strong>Leyton Orient</strong> made it to Wembley but fell just short in the playoff final. Ethan Galbraith and the loan stars Josh Keeley, Charlie Kelman and Jamie Donley have departed but there is plenty of excitement around the impending arrival of the Manchester United youngster Jack Moorhouse.</p> <p><strong>Rotherham</strong> were expecting to challenge under Steve Evans last season but eventually stumbled to 13th. They have subsequently had a clearout of some big earners and allowed Matt Hamshaw to shape a more youthful squad. Conor Hourihane has used the loan market wisely to bring <strong>Barnsley</strong> up to scratch, while Ryan Lowe will be hoping Paul Mullin can spearhead <strong>Wigan’s</strong> promotion push. <strong>Lincoln</strong> and <strong>Mansfield</strong> have an outside chance of getting into the playoffs.</p> <h2><strong>Relegation candidates</strong></h2> <p><strong>Doncaster</strong> won the League Two title last season and their manager, Grant McCann, quickly moved to sign Connor O’Riordan as a replacement for Joseph Olowu after his move to Stockport. <strong>Port Vale</strong>, who finished runners-up to Doncaster, have enjoyed a busy summer in the market as the manager, Darren Moore, attempts to balance youthful potential with old heads. <strong>Bradford</strong>, the third team to be promoted from League Two, may have half an eye on more than consolidation this season. For sure, Ibou Touray and Max Power will provide Graham Alexander’s men with plenty of knowhow at this level.</p>    <p>The League Two playoff winners, <strong>AFC Wimbledon</strong>, have been here before, playing six consecutive seasons in the third tier. Gary Bowyer oversaw the great escape with <strong>Burton</strong> last season and a continuation of that momentum should result in a better campaign for them. <strong>Exeter</strong>, <strong>Northampton</strong> and <strong>Stevenage</strong> might be fearful should they not start the season well.</p> <h2>Three to watch</h2> <p><strong>Andre Garcia, Reading, 17</strong> The defender does not turn 18 until late November but already has 38 League One games under his belt. Garcia’s performances at left-back also earned him an England Under-18 call-up in March and plenty of scouts are known to be tracking his progress.</p> <p><strong>Benon</strong><strong>y Breki Andrésson, Stockport, 19 </strong>Having spent time in Bologna’s academy, Andrésson’s career began in earnest in his homeland of Iceland. Stockport were alerted to his potential and duly signed the striker in January to be part of their development team. He was quickly promoted to the first team and repaid the faith of his manager, Dave Challinor, with four goals in 11 games.</p>    <p><strong>Cian Ashford, Cardiff, 20 </strong>The local boy who has risen through the ranks and become a regular will be looking to push on this season. The arrival of Barry-Murphy as manager should help with that given the Irishman has worked with some of the best talent in the country during his time at Manchester City.</p>
