<p>The leading US public health agency faced a number of top-level resignations on Wednesday after its director was ousted from her job, with one departing official reportedly saying he was leaving “because of the ongoing weaponization of public health”.</p> <p>US officials announced CDC director Susan Monarez had left her role <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-ousted">just weeks after being sworn in</a>. This was followed by the resignations of three senior CDC officials – Dr Debra Houry, the chief medical officer, Dr Daniel Jernigan, director of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and Dr Demetre Daskalakis, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.</p> <p>Daskalakis told colleagues “I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponization of public health”, according to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/27/cdc-director-susan-monarez-ousted/">an email obtained by STAT</a>, a health news site.</p> <p>Houry echoed his concerns and wrote that “ongoing changes prevent me from continuing in my job as a leader of the agency”, adding that science should “never be censored or subject to political interpretations”.</p> <p>Here is the key Trump administration news of the day.</p>  <h2>CDC director ousted after less than a month in job</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/health/cdc-monarez-kennedy-vaccines.html?smid=url-share">Reporting</a> from the Washington Post and the New York Times indicated that Susan Monarez ran afoul of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, after she declined to commit to fully support changing the coronavirus vaccine policy.</p> <p>Monarez was the agency’s 21st director and the first to pass through Senate confirmation following a 2023 law.
