<p>Hello readers, and welcome to today’s election edition of Afternoon Update.</p> <p>We’ve made it to day six of the campaign and gaffes about the price of bread or the rate of unemployment have not made headlines (yet?).</p> <p>Anthony Albanese and Peter Dutton both started their days in Victoria, talking big on the economy before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/01/trumps-liberation-day-tariffs-what-to-expect-and-will-the-uk-be-spared">Trump administration’s latest tariff announcement</a>.</p> <p>The PM <a

NSW town of Richmond</a>, launching an election plan to increase environment spending.</p> <h2>Today’s big stories</h2>    <p>The Greens have promised to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/02/australian-election-2025-greens-albanese-federal-epa-environment-adam-bandt">push the government to boost environment spending to $7.8bn</a> – 1% of the federal budget – next financial year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/16/bandt-says-labor-greens-power-share-would-bring-golden-era-and-confirms-goal-is-to-stop-dutton">if they hold the balance of power after the election</a>.</p> <p>The party’s pitch came as the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor (pictured), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/02/australia-election-2025-campaign-live-labor-coalition-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-cost-of-living-wages-emissions-ntwnfb?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67ec93a98f08b5dc8a06a681#block-67ec93a98f08b5dc8a06a681">delivered his budget reply</a> at the National Press Club in Canberra, declaring the “election is about the economy” and flagging a small business policy package to be unveiled “over the coming weeks”.</p> <p>Speaking of things yet to be unveiled (the clock’s ticking!), Dutton <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/02/australia-election-peter-dutton-abc-cuts-kim-williams-meeting">hasn’t ruled out cuts to the ABC</a> and is still refusing to say which public servants will be axed as part of his plan to slash 41,000 jobs.</p> <p>Pressed on when the costings would be released, Taylor said he wouldn’t delve into the “sausage-making process” but it would be before the federal election.</p> <h2>What they said</h2>    <p>“If I needed to have a fight with Donald Trump … I’d do it in a heartbeat, and I’ll put the Americans on notice.”</p> <p>***</p> <p>Dutton channelled his inner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/14/tony-abbotts-threat-to-shirtfront-putin-immature-russian-official">“shirtfronting” Tony Abbott</a> on Sky by talking tough on his ability to stand up to world leaders in the national interest.</p> <p>The opposition leader was asked whether Labor’s repeated comparisons of the Coalition to the Trump administration were hurting the Liberal campaign, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/01/labor-dutton-trump-comparison-doge-school-curriculum">the treasurer calling him “Doge-y Dutton”</a> in reference to the US department of government efficiency.</p> <h2>How social media saw it</h2>    <p>The Coalition wasted no time in rolling out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/02/australia-election-2025-campaign-live-labor-coalition-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-cost-of-living-wages-emissions-ntwnfb?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67ec8e558f087bcb8730a93f#block-67ec8e558f087bcb8730a93f">official campaign posters</a> poking fun at Monique Ryan, whose husband Peter Jordan was filmed last month removing a promotional sign for Kooyong’s Liberal candidate, Amelia Hamer.</p> <p>Jordan later apologised, admitting he made a “mistake” in taking the sign – which he thought was illegally placed – from outside the home of a Coalition supporter.</p> <p>If you thought that would be the end of the matter, think again. The Liberal party took to X to share their new creation, which reads, “Monique, please DO NOT take this sign!” We have four more weeks of this.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2>    <p>Election campaigns go by fast. Sometimes it’s nice to stop and smell the roses. Or, in this case, the sunflowers.</p> <p>Dutton had a chance to do just that when he left a press conference at the estate home of a family in Donnybrook, north of Melbourne, who had an impressive bed of sunflowers in their front garden.</p> <p>The outer suburban, mortgage belt electorate is <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal/2025/guide/mcew">held by Labor</a>, but only by a 3.8% margin. The Coalition needs to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2025/mar/31/australian-election-2025-polls-today-opinion-poll-tracker-essential-newspoll-2pp-party-labor-coalition-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-latest">flip 19 seats</a> to gain a majority, making marginal contests like this critical for Dutton to secure a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/28/australian-federal-election-2025-analysis-liberal-labor-dutton-albanese">path to victory</a>.</p> <h2>Watch</h2>    <p>The electoral roll will snap closed at 8pm on 7 April, meaning you only have a few days to enrol to vote or update your details.</p> <p>As part of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/series/voting-101-2025">Guardian Australia’s Voting 101 series</a>, Matilda Boseley <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2025/apr/02/voting-101-how-do-you-enrol-to-vote-in-australias-2025-federal-election-video">guides you through</a> what you need to do to make sure you’ll be able to turn up and vote on election day</p> <h2>And in other news …</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/apr/02/val-kilmer-death-age-65-pneumonia">Val Kilmer, star of Top Gun and The Doors, dies aged 65, NYT reports</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/myanmar-earthquake-death-toll-monsoon-rain-forecast-mandalay-sagaing">Myanmar earthquake deaths set to pass 3,000 as looming monsoon sparks urgent call for aid</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/02/australian-exporters-brace-for-immediate-us-tariffs-on-trumps-liberation-day">Australian exporters brace for immediate US tariffs on Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/02/rick-nugent-victoria-acting-police-commissioner-steps-down-peter-dutton-jacinta-allan-victoria-ntwnfb">Jacinta Allan denies Victoria police force is in chaos as another top cop quits</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/02/rpa-hospital-closes-hiv-psychiatry-clinic-with-200-patients-after-staff-resignations">RPA hospital closes HIV psychiatry clinic with 200 patients after staff resignations</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/02/ukraine-war-briefing-us-pressure-builds-on-russia-over-refusal-to-accept-ceasefire">Ukraine war briefing: US pressure builds on Russia over refusal to accept ceasefire</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>Daily word game</h2>    <p>Today’s starter word is: <strong>ILIA</strong><strong>. </strong>You have five goes to get the longest word including the starter word. <a href="https://www.wordiply.com/">Play Wordiply</a>.</p> <h2>Sign up</h2> <p>If you would like to receive this Afternoon Update: Election 2025 briefing to your email inbox every weekday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/13/afternoon-update-newsletter-best-daily-news-email-guardian-australia-free-sign-up?CMP=copyembed">sign up here</a>, or start your day with a curated breakdown of the key stories you need to know with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/sep/23/morning-mail-newsletter-best-daily-news-email-guardian-australia-free-sign-up-inbox-subscribe?CMP=copyembed">our Morning Mail newsletter</a>.
