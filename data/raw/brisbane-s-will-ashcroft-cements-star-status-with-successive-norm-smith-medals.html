<p>Having engineered the Lions’ dominant second half performance in the grand final, Brisbane midfielder Will Ashcroft cemented his meteoric rise to the summit of the AFL by securing a second successive Norm Smith medal.</p> <p>The 21-year-old with the flowing blond mane became just the third player after Andrew McLeod and Dustin Martin to have won the grand final’s best player in consecutive years. With just 58 games to his name, few would dare put a ceiling on what the Lions’ father-son pick might achieve with another decade in the game.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/27/afl-grand-final-winner-results-geelong-cats-vs-brisbane-lions-match-report">Brisbane win back-to-back AFL premierships with grand final thumping of Geelong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His contribution on Saturday was marked by dominance around the contest, as well as a spark in major moments. No other Lion accumulated more than his 32 disposals, and he led the game in clearances with 10. Three goal involvements reflected his calm usage going inside 50, and his fourth-quarter goal effectively ended the contest, putting the margin out behind five majors.</p> <p>Ashcroft admitted he was surprised to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/sep/28/afl-grand-final-norm-smith-medal-winner-will-ashcroft-brisbane-lions">win the medal last year</a>, and having his brother Levi alongside him this time around made the accolade even more special. “For me individually last year, I was probably a bit more shocked when I was announced as the Norm [Smith winner] and won the premiership last year, just because of where I was halfway through the year,” he said.</p> <p>“I was coming back from my ACL, just trying to find my feet, I think I played nine games potentially in the home and away season and was just sort of grateful to be playing finals really. Then to have that moment was amazing.</p> <p>“But then to, this year, build [on that] and then have Levi at the club all the way through was probably a bit more emotional for the family and a pretty amazing feeling to have him here.”</p>    <p>Lions coach Chris Fagan praised his young midfielder, and joked he might have had a third if he had played in the 2023 decider. “He’s had a very, very positive impact, he’s a real professional, he loves the big games,” he said. “Not just a skilful player, but he’s a tough player as well and he’s still young.”</p> <p>The repeat by Ashcroft was remarkable, but he was not a sure thing for the award as the players gathered around the stage after the siren. Co-captain Harris Andrews was imperious in defence, and Ashcroft’s colleagues in midfield helped roll through the Cats in an unforgettable second half. Hugh McCluggage finished with 26 disposals along with four goals, Jaspa Fletcher was effective with the ball, accruing 29 touches, and Dayne Zorko was was reliable and incisive as ever.</p> <p>But Ashcroft was named winner having earned the maximum three points from three of the judges, and two from the other two. Andrews was second, Zac Bailey – who finished with three goals and an unlikely six behinds – was third, Fletcher was fourth and Zorko fifth.</p> <p>Small forward Charlie Cameron was unfortunate not to be recognised. His two goals in the third quarter were the first of the avalanche that by the end totalled 13 in one half.</p> <p>Andrews praised the 31-year-old Cameron after the game. “His pressure, his ability to get the ball forward and hunt is incredible,” he told Channel Seven. “He went through it a bit this year, the way critics were after him, but Fages [Fagan] and the playing group wrapped our arms around him and reminded him how good he is. On the biggest of days he comes to the fore.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/sep/27/afl-grand-final-2025-live-updates-geelong-vs-lions-blog-scores-results-start-time-cats-v-lions-mcg">AFL grand final 2025: Brisbane Lions crush Geelong Cats to win back-to-back premierships – as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But history will remember Ashcroft’s contribution most of all. He celebrated with his younger brother Levi and Lachie Neale at the siren, an image representing the passing of the torch for Brisbane.</p> <p>The younger Ashcroft was also influential, having bagged a vital goal himself just before half-time. And they were well supported by Neale, who was effective after he was introduced at half-time, gathering 17 disposals and seven clearances.</p> <p>The maroons’ surge while Neale was on the field was no coincidence, and the 32-year-old’s third quarter goal closely followed Cameron’s, sending the Lions on their way to back-to-back flags.</p>
