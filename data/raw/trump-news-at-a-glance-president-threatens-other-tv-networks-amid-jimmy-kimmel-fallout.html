<p>Donald Trump suggested on Thursday the TV networks that cover him “negatively” could lose their licenses after he celebrated ABC suspending late-night host <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a>.</p> <p>The president said major US networks were “97% against me”, though he did not offer evidence to support this figure. “They give me only bad press. I mean they’re getting a license. I would think maybe their licenses should be taken away.”</p> <p>The president’s claim that US TV networks need to be licensed by the government to operate is incorrect. While local TV stations do require a license from the Federal Communications Commission, the FCC says clearly <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/public-and-broadcasting">on its website</a> that it does “not license TV or radio networks (such as CBS, NBC, ABC or Fox)”.</p> <p>The move has prompted numerous calls for a boycott against Disney, ABC’s parent company, and other major media conglomerates that have refused to air Kimmel’s show.</p>  <h2>Obama decries Trump’s ‘dangerous’ attack on free speech</h2>  <p>Barack Obama condemned what he called a “dangerous” escalation by the Trump administration over the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel’s show. “After years of complaining about cancel culture, the current administration has taken it to a new and dangerous level by routinely threatening regulatory action against media companies unless they muzzle or fire reporters and commentators it doesn’t like,” Obama <a href="https://x.com/BarackObama/status/1968679167286763678">wrote on X</a>.</p> <p> FCC commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat on the commission, <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-414616A1.pdf">also accused</a> ABC of “shameful” corporate capitulation that “has put the foundation of the first amendment in danger”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/18/jimmy-kimmel-show-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Calls grow to boycott Disney over Jimmy Kimmel suspension</h2>  <p>The indefinite suspension of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel’s</a> late-night show has prompted impassioned calls for a boycott against Disney, ABC’s parent company, and other major media conglomerates that have refused to air Kimmel’s show.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/18/jimmy-kimmel-cancelled-disney-boycott"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Harris dismayed with Walz and wanted Buttigieg as her VP</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a> watched mortified as her running mate, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/tim-walz">Tim Walz</a>, fell into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a>’s trap in last year’s vice-presidential debate and “fumbled” a crucial answer, she writes in a campaign memoir.</p> <p>The former Democratic presidential nominee also admits that Walz had <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/kamala-harris-running-mate-pete-buttigieg/684249/">not been her first choice</a> for vice-president in her book 107 Days, obtained by the Guardian ahead of its publication next week.
