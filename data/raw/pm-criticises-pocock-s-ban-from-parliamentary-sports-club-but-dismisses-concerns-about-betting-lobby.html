<h1>PM criticises Pocock’s ban from parliamentary sports club but dismisses concerns about betting lobby</h1>

<p>Anthony Albanese says independent senator David Pocock should not be kicked out of parliament’s social sports club despite the prime minister dismissing his concerns about lobbying as “absurd”.</p> 
<p>But the secretary of Unions NSW and the founder of the group Labor for Gambling Reform, Mark Moray, said Pocock raised “legitimate questions” about the influence of the gambling lobby and its access to politicians.</p> 
<p>Pocock – a former Wallabies captain – was banned from the social club on Thursday night after raising concerns about the club’s listing as a lobbyist group representing the gambling lobby and alcohol and fossil fuel companies.</p> 
<p>The ACT senator had also asked questions during Senate estimates hearings about whether it was appropriate for the prime minister to be the president of the club, given it was listed as a lobbying organisation.</p> 
<p>In text messages seen by Guardian Australia, Pocock was told by the club’s chief executive, Andy Turnbull, that he was no longer welcome at its events and accused him of politicising the organisation. He was removed from group chats a short time later.</p>

<p>The messages were verified by Turnbull, who was contacted for comment. Turnbull confirmed he had banned Pocock from the group on Friday morning.</p> 
<p>Pocock was one of several crossbench MPS who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/17/gambling-lobby-sponsorship-australian-parliament-sports-club-condemned-by-crossbench-mps-kate-chaney">criticised the Responsible Wagering Australia’s (RWA) corporate sponsorship of the sports club last month</a>, alleging it had paid to secure access to decision-makers and entrench wagering’s close association with sport.</p> 
<p>The club and the lobby group have rejected claims the social games are anything other than a chance for politicians and staff to relax and exercise during parliamentary sitting weeks, alongside sponsors who cover costs.</p> 
<p>In a statement, Albanese said he would not waste any time on the issue, but called for Pocock to be allowed to play.</p> 
<p>“The idea that parliamentarians voluntarily playing sport has any impact equivalent to lobbying is absurd, but participation should be open to everyone,” Albanese said.</p> 
<p>Moray, who is campaigning for Labor to take tougher action on gambling, said Pocock was right to question why the peak body for the gambling industry was sponsoring the sports club.</p> 
<p>“How can you raise these issues and then be kicked out of a club?” Moray said. “It’s a legitimate question and it is about influence.</p> 
<p>“Why the ALP members need to be sponsored by a gambling mob to play sports after the Peta Murphy inquiry into gambling just baffles. It’s crazy.”</p>

<p>Pocock said he was dismayed the club had decided to ban a senator who raised concerns about the club’s operations, rather than restrict who can sponsor its operations.</p> 
<p>“Being kicked out of the club for raising concerns around gambling lobbyists buying access to the club shows the influence vested interests have here in parliament and just how normalised this has become,” Pocock said.</p> 
<p>Independent MP Allegra Spender announced after Pocock was banned that she had quit the club, describing his ban as “an absolute disgrace”. Fellow crossbench MP Monique Ryan resigned from the club last month due to its links to gambling.</p> 
<p>Independent MP Sophie Scamps also quit the club and criticised it for telling corporate sponsors that in return for payment, they could access key opinion leaders and decision makes in Canberra.</p> 
<p>“The gambling industry is doing enormous harm, particularly to our children, by normalising gambling through sport,” Scamps said. “Get them out of the game.”</p> 
<p>Earlier on Friday, before the news of Pocock’s ban had been reported, Albanese was asked whether it was appropriate to remain the president of a group listed on the lobbyist register.</p> 
<p>“The amount of time I’ve spent on the Australian Parliament Sports Club this year is zero,” Albanese said in response.</p> 
<p>When concerns were first raised about the sponsorship by lobbyists and their attendance at games, Turnbull suggested they were misplaced. He said he listed the group on the lobbyist register out of an abundance of caution and he had since been advised it was not required.</p> 
<p>“There is an unwritten rule that no one talks business on the sports pitches. It’s the only time the parliamentarians get any time to relax and not do business, and I work very hard to ensure this is the case,” Turnbull said.</p> 
<p>Last month, RWA’s chief executive, Kai Cantwell, said it did not use the club to lobby politicians and that he attended matches “simply to enjoy exercise and socialising – something important for all Australians, particularly in high-pressure roles”.</p> 
<p>“RWA’s work on regulation and harm reduction happens through the proper parliamentary and regulatory processes, not on the sporting field,” Kantwell said.</p>
