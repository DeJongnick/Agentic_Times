The plan, published today, sets out proposals to rebuild the area by 2030 without removing its population.<br><br>The $53bn plan is counters Donald Trump’s widely condemned call to remove Gaza’s around two million Palestinians permanently so the US can develop the territory as a tourist site for others.<br><br>According to an Associated Press report, the first phase of the Egyptian plan, which is expected to be endorsed by Middle Eastern leaders later on Tuesday, calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing the more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives.<br><br>Hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up where Gaza’s population could live while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, and some of it would be used as infill to create expanded lands on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast.<br><br>In the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building “sustainable, green and walkable” housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas.<br><br>It also calls for opening an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and commercial port in Gaza, but of these only an airport was built, in 1998, and it was closed and then destroyed within about three years as the peace process collapsed.</p> <p><em>• This post was amended on 4 March 2025.
