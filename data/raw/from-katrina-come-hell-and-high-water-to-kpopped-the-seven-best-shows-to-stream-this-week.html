<h2>Pick of the week<br>Katrina: Come Hell and High Water</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/aug/17/hurricanekatrina.film">Spike Lee </a>executive produces a part elegy, part polemic commemoration of one of 2025’s saddest anniversaries: two decades have now passed since the brutal Hurricane Katrina laid waste to both the physical reality and also, somehow, the soul of New Orleans. The first part of this tragedy may have been unavoidable, given the force of the storm; the second element certainly wasn’t. Via some beautiful footage of pre-Katrina New Orleans at Mardi Gras time, this documentary series remembers the city as it once was. It also doesn’t hesitate to call out the trail of mendacity, negligence and incompetence that made the disaster – and its aftermath – so much worse than it needed to be.<br><em>Netflix, from Wednesday 27 August</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>KPopped</h2>    <p>As the performer who, as he modestly puts it “brought K-pop to the world”, it’s fitting that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/18/gangnam-style-psy">Psy</a> should present this cross-cultural light entertainment spectacular. Each episode sees western pop stars (including Spice Girls, Jess Glynne, Kylie Minogue and Kesha) collaborate with K-pop acts before performing head-to-head in a competition. The opening episode sees Megan Thee Stallion face off against Patti LaBelle, each backed by half of girl group Billie. It turns out that both Savage and Lady Marmalade work perfectly as K-pop bangers, even if Lady Marmalade was released before anyone else on the stage was born.<br><em>Apple TV+, from Friday 29 August</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>With Love, Meghan</h2>    <p>It is remarkable that something as bland as Meghan Markle’s lifestyle show could become a culture war. But, in defiance of the wishes of certain furious British tabloids and in celebration of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/aug/11/harry-meghan-netflix-sign-film-tv-deal#:~:text=The%20Duke%20and%20Duchess%20of,renew%20its%20contract%20with%20them.">her and Harry Windsor’s new deal with Netflix</a>, Markle is back with yet more performative signifiers of pastel-coloured domestic bliss. It’s the usual assemblage of cooking, flower-arranging and crafting tips – basically, she really loves the idea of “finding new ways to show people you care”. Think Blue Peter for millionaires and you’re somewhere close. <br><em>Netflix, from Tuesday 26 August</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Emma and Bruce Willis: The Unexpected Journey</h2>    <p>Bruce Willis officially retired from acting after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/16/bruce-willis-frontotemporal-dementia-aphasia-ftd">his diagnosis with frontotemporal dementia in 2023</a>. This tear-jerking interview sees his wife Emma Heming Willis sit down with Diane Sawyer to talk candidly about the impact of her husband’s illness on their life together. She also voices the hope that other people suffering from this cruel degenerative condition will be able to take some comfort from hearing it discussed openly. It is, by definition, an emotionally draining watch but the love Emma has for her husband is palpable. <em><br>Disney+, from Wednesday 27 August</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>The Terminal List: Dark Wolf</h2>    <p>Fans of the 2022 military drama The Terminal List are about to find out how Ben Edwards (Taylor Kitsch) and James Reece (Chris Pratt) got so messed up. This origin story takes us into the heart of the black ops mission at the root of their trauma. Reece is recruited to a covert anti-terrorist initiative but it becomes increasingly unclear who stands to gain from this plot. Soon, questions of loyalty threaten to derail the mission. It’s generic and deeply humourless, with a range encompassing enigmatic scowling, gratuitous gunplay and not much else besides. <em><br>Prime Video, from Wednesday 27 August</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Dating Naked</h2>    <p>Hosted by the very likable <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/06/rylan-on-his-breakdown-comeback-and-the-hidden-story-of-x-factor">Rylan Clark</a>, the second series of this dating show brings together 10 singletons, places them in an idyllic resort in Panama and asks them to shed their clothes and their inhibitions. It does its best to promote body positivity – all the participants admit to nervousness and one proclaims himself to be “average. I prefer going down the pub to going to the gym.” Once the initial gimmick has become familiarised, it settles down to become pretty routine. Never outrageous but sadly, never that interesting or revelatory either. <em><br>Paramount+, from Friday 29 August</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Unknown Number: The High School Catfish</h2>    <p>The true story behind this documentary sounds uncannily like the plot outline for an overheated YA drama. A clean-cut and popular teenage couple at an American high school find themselves besieged by a relentless, mysterious cyberbully. Soon, everyone is a suspect. Even the FBI gets involved. But the actual identity of the bully wrongfoots them all. With access to the main players in the Michigan school where this scenario played out, this film is yet another remarkable and chilling cautionary tale of the digital age. <em><br>Netflix, from Friday</em> <em>29 August</em></p>
