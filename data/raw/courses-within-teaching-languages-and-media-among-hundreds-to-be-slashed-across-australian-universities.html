<p>Hundreds of university courses within teaching, languages, archaeology and media are among those being slashed as the tertiary sector pushes back against “confused” government policies.</p> <p>Almost half of Australia’s universities have restructured in the past year, leading to the merging or disbanding of more than 50 schools of study and drastic reductions in course options for students, particularly in the humanities.</p> <p>The University of Wollongong is cutting a string of disciplines including cultural studies, languages, archaeology and linguistics, while the University of Tasmania will merge its school of humanities and social sciences, combine politics and international relations into a single major, and no longer offer German.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/21/something-is-rotten-in-australias-tertiary-education-and-utss-suspension-of-teaching-courses-is-one-of-its-biggest-disgraces">Something is rotten in Australia’s tertiary education.

About 143,000 people worked in the sector as of 2024, according to the Department of Education – equating to a cut of about 1.6% of the workforce.</p> <p>About 847 staff have already been made redundant nationwide, including 218 at the ANU and 259 at the University of Southern Queensland. </p> <p>The proposed cuts across the sector include up to 400 positions – or a 10th of the workforce – at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).

The exact number of job losses at each institution has not been announced.</p> <p>“As distressing as this decision is, it should not come as a surprise,” the vice-chancellor of CSU, Prof Renée Leon, said. “In recent years, the Australian university sector has been in crisis … jeopardised by needlessly restrictive and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/05/australia-international-students-visa-university">unsupportive government policies</a>.</p> <p>“Charles Sturt has been hard hit by the loss of international students and has no indication from government that it will receive a fair share.”</p> <p>The president of the National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU), Dr Alison Barnes, said the cuts would have a “devastating impact”. She said they followed 4,524 redundancies during 2020 and 2021.</p> <p>“It’s a shortsighted strategy,” Barnes said. “In almost every case [the cuts] are completely unjustified. No consideration is given to the enormous damage this does to the institutions, the colleagues that are left behind and the student experience.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/11/international-students-australia-numbers-rising">Before the Australian election, both parties wanted to cut international student numbers.

WSU expects to cut 300 jobs and have an $80m deficit next year.</p> <p>“The cost of degrees is limiting access and participation, disproportionately affecting … students from low socioeconomic backgrounds,” they said.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
