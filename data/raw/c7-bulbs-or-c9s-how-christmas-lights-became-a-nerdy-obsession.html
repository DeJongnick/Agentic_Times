<h1>C7 bulbs or C9s? How Christmas lights became a nerdy obsession</h1>

<p>I love Christmas lights. I am writing this in my living room, with no overhead lights on. All the illumination is coming from seven strands of lights – one on the tree, six more around the walls; several hundred bulbs. I love them so much that the ones that aren’t on the tree stay up all year. Every year I buy a few more sets, for no good reason – I just find it hard to walk past a shelf of lights without buying a set. I’m not alone in my passion. Although John Lewis won’t give out exact figures, its spokeswoman tells me the chain sells hundreds of thousands of sets of lights each year, its bestseller being an <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-480-led-vine-christmas-lights-pure-white-11m/p3230039">11m string of 480 white lights in a vine style</a>, yours for 50 quid.</p> <p>People obsess over lights. Search online and you’ll find forums full of people debating bulb types, strand length, how to build their own strands without having to sully themselves with inferior shop lights. <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-selvidge-mn0000127034/credits">My friend Steve Selvidge</a> is that kind of person. He is a rock guitarist from Memphis, and Christmas lights fit into the same part of his mind that is very particular about guitars. “I’m an analogue guy,” he says. “I like vinyl. I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibson_Les_Paul">Les Pauls</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Telecaster">Telecasters</a>. I’m the same with Christmas. So I use incandescent bulbs.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/16/christmas-a-biography-judith-flanders-review-feast-of-illusions">Christmas: a Biography review – ‘a feast of illusions’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most of us now use LED bulbs – safer (because they don’t get hot) and cheaper (because they use less electricity). But light purists such as Selvidge stick with incandescents because of their softer, warmer light. He uses C7 screw-in bulbs – significantly larger than the bulbs you would likely have had on your last string of incandescent lights, which were likely the tiny candle bulbs. “Some people are happy with the little guys,” he says. “But I’m a tree-light gearhead.” So when the big supermarkets around Memphis stopped selling C7s, he found an online warehouse and bought 175 bulbs. More than he needed, but enough to futureproof his lights. “C7s won’t burn your tree down,” he says approvingly, as if that is a selling point rather than a basic minimum requirement. “If C9s” – a larger bulb – “weren’t so hot, I’d still use those. But time has moved on. It’s like the way you don’t smoke in the room with your baby any more.”</p> <p>Lights on Christmas trees are a Germanic innovation, and prosperous Germans first started illuminating their trees with candles in the 18th century: “Coleridge describes seeing it in northern Germany in 1798,” says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/16/christmas-a-biography-judith-flanders-review-feast-of-illusions">Judith Flanders, author of Christmas: A Biography</a>. “The problem with that is that it was dangerous: candles on a tree drying out indoors ended up with something highly flammable.”</p>    <p>The first electrically illuminated tree was unveiled on 22 December 1882, in the New York home of Edward H Johnson, a friend of Thomas Edison and vice president of the Edison Electric Light Company. He draped his tree with 80-handwired bulbs in red, white and blue. Thirteen years later, President Grover Cleveland oversaw the first electrically lit tree in the White House and, over the following half-century, electric Christmas lights followed the democratisation of electricity.</p> <p>“It wasn’t until the 1930s or later that a lot of houses got electricity,” Flanders says. “We forget how late electricity actually came to a lot of houses. The manufacturing of strings of lights was there, so what happened in the early days was that you could buy battery-powered lights so houses without electricity could have some lighting, and those were manufactured as early as 1903. But they were very expensive. It’s around the 1910s and 1920s that they start to become affordable for the middle classes.”</p> <p>In fact, Flanders says, one of the key drivers of electric Christmas lights in the home was the insurance industry. “Because candles were so dangerous, many insurance companies refused to insure houses with candles, rather than electric lights. Not only do you have to affix candles to trees but, as they burn down they tilt, because the weight on the candles changes. They were lethal.”</p> <p>Nowadays, of course, Christmas lights aren’t limited to the home. For years, every town centre worth its salt has a Christmas lights display, often turned on by a minor celebrity – or, in the case of <a href="http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/update/2017-12-01/piers-pressure-fails-to-switch-on-christmas-lights/">Piers Morgan and Stockbridge in Hampshire this year</a>, not turned on, when the plunger didn’t work. The big displays in the central London shopping streets are largely the work of two companies, <a href="http://www.christmas-lighting.co.uk/">Field and Lawn</a> – a marquee hire company that moved into Christmas lighting seven years ago – and <a href="http://www.jamesglancydesign.com/seasonal/">James Glancy Design</a>. Between them, they are responsible for the lights on Oxford Street, Bond Street, Regent Street, Carnaby Street, Jermyn Street, St Christopher’s Place, Seven Dials, as well as shopping centres and town centres across the UK.</p> <p>“On Oxford Street, we used around three quarters of a million lights,” says Nick McLaren of Field and Lawn, who got the company into the lighting business after joining from another Christmas lighting firm. “On Bond Street, it’s about half that number.” Field and Lawn, he says, spends about £1m each year on brand new lights for its designs. This is big business. And presumably it costs a fortune to power the Oxford Street display? “Oh, no,” McLaren says. “It could almost run off a dozen 13-amp plugs. That’s an exaggeration, but the electricity usage is nominal. When lights weren’t LED, the electricity bills would run to tens of thousands of pounds. Now it’s less than £1,000.”</p>    <p>Obviously, providing a bespoke lighting display to a huge shopping street isn’t simply a case of finding some spare plug sockets and stringing up some lights you got from Homebase. James Glancy, who co-founded the firm that bears his name with Paul Dart, who does the design work, lists the things that have to be taken into consideration: the ability of your design to withstand snow and wind, the likelihood of your street acting as a wind tunnel, its length and width, the height of the buildings, the ownership of the buildings (the more that are owned by one landlord, the easier it is to get permission to erect design-specific infrastructure). You have to take into account whether your design is going to make it hard for office workers to get on with their jobs, and if it will annoy people who live within its glare. From bidding for the job, through assessing the site, drawing up the design, testing a full-scale prototype and getting it approved, to then hanging the lights can take up to 11 months. And, at the end, you must have something memorable, or you can be sure people will let you know their dissatisfaction. “In terms of a particular style, I would say we historically come from more of a theatre background,” Glancy says, “but I think more and more of our designs are modernist and less theatrical. If you look at this year’s designs, they’re quite flamboyant, perhaps more fun.” Hence the Carnaby Street lights feature no angels, but a multicoloured carnival theme that is almost tropical in its brightness (“Every company would say: ‘We could do that,’” McLaren says of the Glancy designs, “but they’re the ones with a client base that allows them to do more crazy, unique displays”).</p> <p>One thing that irritates people about the displays in central London is how early they are put up. There is a reason for that, McLaren says. “In order to get them up, the roads have to be shut at night, and you can only do that one road at a time. That’s why they have to go up in October. We often get a flurry of social media and news coverage about lights going up early.”</p> <p>In fact, for all that you would be hard pressed to find anyone who says they don’t like Christmas lights, people spend an awful lot of time complaining about them. That might be at the level of domestic irritation (my wife likes blinking lights; I think they’re vulgar and can’t stand them). Or it might be neighbourly – usually when one householder’s tastes tend to exterior decorations that are a little more garish than their neighbours might like.</p>    <p>A mile or so up the road from me is a house so spectacularly decorated that we always take a trip to look at the lights – <a href="http://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/does-this-house-have-the-best-christmas-lights-in-camden-1-4812740">which festoon the whole frontage, front garden and front wall</a>. Last year, however, the homeowner received an anonymous note: “I must say I was appalled … by the eyesore of your Christmas display. This has really taken the biscuit. I am currently looking to relocate myself elsewhere as a result. God only knows what you must have in store for St Valentine’s Day. Season’s greetings from a Disgruntled Neighbour.” That story is replicated wherever there is a brightly decorated house and a neighbour who cares about the tone of the street.</p> <p>“I don’t think it’s anything to do with lights,” Flanders says. “It’s that British people need to have other people to despise. I was talking to a very posh American who lives here yesterday and she said to me, in some confusion: ‘We put our Christmas lights up yesterday, and none of our neighbours seem to do that.’ I didn’t know what to say. First of all, outside lights in Britain are much less of a thing than in North America. The less polite response is that middle-class people think it’s trashy.”</p> <p>Come January, the lights will come down. Field and Lawn and James Glancy Design will carefully repair and pack away the lights they need to reuse. You and I will shove ours in cupboards under the stairs, and perhaps take broken strings to the recycling. And what of them then? Chances are they will end up in Shijao in China, where about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/12/the-chinese-town-that-turns-your-old-christmas-tree-lights-into-slippers/250190/">9,100 tonnes of discarded Christmas lights from the West are recycled every year</a>. Next Christmas, you might encounter your old lights again: one of the things they end up being recycled into is slipper soles. Christmas: truly the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
