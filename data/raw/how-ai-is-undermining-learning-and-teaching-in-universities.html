<p>In discussing generative artificial intelligence (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/sep/13/its-going-to-be-a-life-skill-educators-discuss-the-impact-of-ai-on-university-education">‘It’s going to be a life skill’: educators discuss the impact of AI on university education, 13 September</a>) you appear to underestimate the challenges that large language model (LLM) tools such as ChatGPT present to higher education. The argument that mastering AI is a life skill that students need in preparation for the labour market is unconvincing. Our experience is that generative AI undermines teaching and learning, bypasses reflection and criticality, and deflects students from reading&nbsp;original material.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/24/preparing-students-for-a-world-shaped-by-artificial-intelligence">Preparing students for a world shaped by artificial intelligence | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Student misuse of generative AI is widespread. Claims that AI helps preparation or research is simply cover for students taking shortcuts that do not develop their learning skills. Assessments are widely channelled through ChatGPT, disregarding universities’ usually feeble guidance and rules. Generative AI results in generic, dull and often factually incorrect output.</p> <p>For example, we asked students to interpret a short article by Henry Ford from 1922. Many answers suggested that the autocratic and racist Ford was developing a “sophisticated HR performance management function for his business” and that he was a “transformational leader”.</p> <p>In many degree programmes, LLMs have little to no practical value. Their use sabotages and degrades students’ learning and undermines critical analysis and creativity. If we are to make better&nbsp;sense of the impact of AI on&nbsp;work, education and everyday life, we need to be more sceptical&nbsp;and less&nbsp;celebratory.<br><strong>Prof Leo McCann</strong><br><strong>Prof Simon Sweeney</strong><br><em>University of York</em></p> <p><em><strong>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
