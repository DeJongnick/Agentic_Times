The anecdotal evidence now that people who are down living by the sea, where the foam and the sea mist, where the bloom has been, are getting sick, that the irritations, the cold-like symptoms, the respiratory systems, the rashes, you know, the government advises that this goes away in a few days.</p> <p>We’re finding that people who live down in these areas are being impacted every day and they feel like the government is just not responding with the full force of resources that’s needed.</p> </blockquote> <p>The SA government <a href="https://pir.sa.gov.au/sardi/aquatic_sciences/marine_ecosystems/algal_bloom">says</a> the algal bloom does not produce toxins harmful to humans or one that could cause long-term effects. But officials say exposure could cause skin and eye irritation and symptoms such as shortness of breath or coughing.

remove the 11% interest rate applied to the tax debt.</p> <p>The ombudsman said it had received 134 complaints from taxpayers and tax professionals about a general lack of consistency and transparency in how interest is applied to debts.</p> <p>Attempts to reduce or remove tax debt interest are determined by the ATO and can only be reviewed in the federal court.</p> <p>From July 2025, tax debt interest is no longer tax deductible, placing additional pressure on taxpayers and small businesses already under financial stress, the watchdog said.</p> <p>The ombudsman, <strong>Ruth Owen</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Taxpayers have an obligation to pay their tax bills, and we know most people are trying to do the right thing, but there are certain circumstances where we think the ATO could take a more compassionate approach to debt collection.</p> <p>Although [applying debt interest] is an important element of the tax system, to ensure that those who deliberately avoid paying tax are not given an unfair advantage, it should not punish those trying to do the right thing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time

talks</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>An expected call on the future of a major Australian gas project could cast a shadow over the final days of a climate change-heavy Pacific leader talks, Australian Associated Press reports.</p> <p>The final go-ahead for the Woodside North West Shelf gas hub to continue operating until 2070 could be granted by the federal environment minister, <strong>Murray Watt</strong>, today, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/28/labor-approves-extension-of-woodsides-contentious-north-west-shelf-gas-development">following years in approvals limbo</a>.</p> <p>Australia’s fossil fuel exports have long been a source of tension for climate-vulnerable Pacific islands on the front line of rising seas and severe weather, a point reiterated by the Vanuatu climate change adaptation minister, <strong>Ralph Regenvanu</strong>, in Honiara on Wednesday.</p> <p>Regenvanu said Australia’s long-held argument that it was only responsible for cutting the greenhouse gases it emitted within its borders “is no longer tenable” following a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/24/australia-warned-it-could-face-legal-action-over-fossil-fuels-after-icj-landmark-climate-ruling">landmark world court advisory opinion in July</a>.</p> <p>“We want Australia to start seriously talking about its fossil fuel production pipeline,” Regenvanu said at a Pacific Island Forum side event on Wednesday.</p>    <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> said he would “act in Australia’s interests but also in the interests of engaging in action on climate change” when queried on the Pacific reaction to the looming North West Shelf decision.</p> <p>“We know that gas has an important role to play in the transition,” he told reporters from the leaders-only retreat in the Solomon Islands yesterday.</p> <p>You can read more on
