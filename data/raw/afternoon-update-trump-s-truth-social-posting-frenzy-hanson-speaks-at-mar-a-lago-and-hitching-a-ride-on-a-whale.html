<p>Good afternoon.</p> 
<p>The fallout from the Democrats’ clutch of election wins continues, with Donald Trump responding online in trademark fashion. Among his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/trump-truth-social-posts">30 Truth Social posts in less than two hours</a> was a series of bizarre AI-generated videos covering topics from his G2 meeting with Xi Jinping to Walmart allegedly lowering its prices.</p> 
<p>It came as seasoned New York political analyst Michael Lange identified a small cohort of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/new-york-election-trends-michael-lange-zohran-mamdani">Trump voters who turned out for Mamdani</a> in the Democrat’s mayoral election win. The mayor-elect has wasted little time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/zohran-mamdani-transition-team">announcing an all-female transition team</a> as he prepares to get to work on 1 January.</p>
