  <p>Muslims worldwide will celebrate one of their biggest holidays under the long shadow of the coronavirus, with millions confined to their homes and others gripped by economic concerns during what is usually a festive time of shopping and celebration.</p> 
  <p>The three-day Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan for the world’s 1.8bn Muslims. People usually celebrate by travelling, visiting family and gathering for lavish meals, all of which will be largely prohibited as authorities try to prevent new virus outbreaks. The holiday will begin on Saturday or Sunday, depending on the sighting of the new moon, and the dawn-to-dusk fasting of Ramadan will come to an end.</p> 
  <p>Some countries, including Turkey, Iraq and Jordan, will impose round-the-clock curfews for the holiday. In Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, people will be allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and medicine. </p> 
  <p>Most restrictions have been lifted in Jerusalem, but the Al-Aqsa mosque compound – the third holiest site in Islam – will remain closed until. Shopkeepers in the Old City, empty of tourists and pilgrims since March, are reeling from the six weeks of lockdown. </p> 
  <p>In Egypt, authorities have extended the curfew, which will now begin at 5pm instead of 9pm, and halted public transportation until 29 May. Shopping centres, malls, beaches and parks will be closed.<br></p> 
  <p>In Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country, the president, Joko Widodo, said restrictions would remain in place through the holiday. The country, with a population of 270m, has reported more than 18,000 cases, including about 1,200 deaths. Since the start of the Ramadan, the government has imposed an outright ban on “mudik”, a holiday tradition in which millions of Indonesians living in big cities flock to their home towns to celebrate with relatives. Health experts had warned it could set off a wave of new cases.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Brazil beats Russia in coronavirus cases, second only to US</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Brazil overtook Russia on Friday in terms of the number of coronavirus cases, Reuters reports, having registered 330,890 people who have contracted the virus – second only to the United States. Brazil registered 1,001 daily coronavirus deaths on Friday, taking the total deaths to 21,048, according to the health ministry. However, the true numbers – both of cases and deaths – is probably higher as Latin America’s top economy has been slow to ramp up testing.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile Brazil’s environment minister, <strong>Ricardo Salles,</strong> called on the government to push through further deregulation of environmental policy while people are distracted by the coronavirus pandemic, in a video the supreme court ordered to be released. The video of a ministers’ meeting surfaced in an investigation of whether the president, <strong>Jair Bolsonaro,</strong> interfered in appointing leaders of the federal police for personal gain.</p> 
  <p>During the meeting, other ministers spoke, including Salles, with environmental groups saying his remarks prove that the Bolsonaro government is systematically seeking to dismantle environmental protections. “We need to make an effort while we are in this calm moment in terms of press coverage, because they are only talking about Covid, and push through and change all the rules and simplify norms,” Salles said in the video.<br></p> 
  <p>Deforestation hit an 11-year high last year and has increased 55% in the first four months of the year, compared with a year ago, with environmentalists blaming Bolsonaro’s policies.</p>

  <p>Travellers arriving in Britain will face 14 days’ quarantine from next month to prevent a second coronavirus outbreak, the government announced on Friday, warning that anyone breaking the rules faced a fine or prosecution.</p> 
  <p>The new rules will apply to all international arrivals except Ireland from 8 June and come after weeks of calls for tougher restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19. Healthcare professionals travelling to work in the crisis, seasonal agricultural workers and those working in freight and road haulage, among others, will be exempt.</p> 
  <p>“We want to reduce the risk of imported cases being introduced into the UK,” the home secretary, <strong>Priti Patel,</strong> told the government’s daily media briefing. </p> 
  <p>Patel said the measure would be reviewed every three weeks, adding: “We are not shutting down completely. We are not closing our borders. What we are seeking to do is control the spread of the virus because we do not want a second wave of this virus.”</p> 
  <p>The quarantine move is controversial, especially with the aviation sector, where flights have been grounded and passenger numbers slumped. France also expressed disappointment that despite initial reassurances it would not be exempt from the plan.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>New Zealand bookshops are experiencing an “extraordinary” boom in New Zealand as Kiwis commit to buying local to resuscitate the economy after seven weeks of lockdown. <strong>Eleanor Ainge-Roy</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/like-christmas-new-zealands-post-covid-books-boom">writes that many readers have sworn off shopping offshore after the Covid-19 crisis, which claimed 21 lives in New Zealand</a>.</p> 
  <p>“People are really thinking about where they want to spend their money and the businesses they love. They got a taste of what it was like if you weren’t there,” says Jenna Todd of Time Out bookstore in Mt Eden, Auckland. </p> 
  <p>Libraries have also benefited from the book boom, with borrowers queuing round the block.</p> 
  <p>There have been no new cases of the virus in New Zealand since 19 May1. </p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, the finance minister, Grant Robertson, has said the government is considering distributing free cash directly to individuals as a way of policy stimulus to help boost the economy.</p> 
  <p>“I am pretty keen on making sure that fiscal policy remains the role of the government,” he said.</p>

  <p>Good morning, <strong>Melissa Davey </strong>here in Melbourne, taking over from <strong>Kevin Rawlinson </strong>in London to continue bringing you updates from around the world. </p> 
  <p>While many countries are still struggling to contain the virus, here in Australia people are heading into the weekend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/20/coronavirus-australia-lockdown-rules-travel-restrictions-nsw-victoria-queensland-qld-wa-sa-act-how-far-can-you-drive-visit-friends-family-parents-covid-19-guidelines">with more freedom to visit cafes, travel throughout their state or territory and visit friends and family</a>. Restrictions are loosening at different rates around the country, with just over 500 active cases. There have been 101 deaths.</p> 
  <p>State leaders continue to spar over the refusal of some premiers to reopen state borders as debates continue over when interstate travel should resume. It prompted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/peter-dutton-encourages-people-to-challenge-queenslands-covid-19-border-closures">the federal home affairs minister, <strong>Peter Dutton, </strong>who describes himself as a “proud Queenslander”,<strong> </strong>to weigh in on Friday</a>, telling people in that state to test whether the border closures were allowed by the constitution.</p> 
  <p>“People are right to test that if they think it’s not [allowed by the constitution] because it’s affecting people’s lives,” he said. “I’m not taking advice from people south of the border at all, but I believe it’s in Queensland’s best interests, given that we are a mining state, we’re a tourism state, and we want to get people back to work.”</p> 
  <p>Dutton’s comments came as the federal government blamed employers incorrectly filling in a form for massively overestimating the size of the jobkeeper payment scheme. The error between the number of employees businesses estimated would be covered by the scheme and the actual amount receiving the payment means the scheme will cover 3.5 million workers, down from 6.5 million.</p> 
  <p>It makes this exchange particularly interesting:</p>

  <p>It will also cost about $70bn, not $130bn. The government is so far resisting calls from Labor to extend the payment to casuals and those workers who were not eligible for the payment.</p>

  <p>Indigenous organisations in Brazil have protested against the inclusion in a bill on emergency assistance to tribes in the pandemic of a paragraph authorising Christian missionaries to remain in indigenous communities.</p> 
  <p>It provides rapid Covid-19 tests, medicine and food to indigenous communities while allowing them to control access to their territories to avoid the spread of virus.</p> 
  <p>But in an inclusion called “sneaky” by critics, the bill said evangelising missionaries that are already in indigenous communities could stay subject to medical exams. The largest umbrella organisation representing Amazon indigenous tribes, COIAB, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We absolutely reject this attempt to allow access of missionaries to indigenous territories here there are isolated tribes.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>COIAB said the presence of evangelizing missionaries has historically brought “tragedy and death” to indigenous people in the Amazon, and was a particular threat to isolated tribes that have only entered recent contact with Brazilian society.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In the UK, police have spoken to the prime minister’s key adviser <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong> about breaching the government’s lockdown rules after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had symptoms of coronavirus.</p> 
  <p>Officers approached him days after he was seen rushing out of Downing Street when the prime minister tested positive for the virus at the end of March, a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Mirror has found.</p> 
  <p>At the time, the government had instructed people not to travel and to stay at their family homes. Cummings, however, was seen in Durham. A member of the public is understood to have seen him and made a complaint to the police.</p> 
  <p>Downing Street has previously refused to disclose where Cummings was staying during the lockdown.</p>

  <p>Chile’s president, <strong>Sebastian Piñera</strong>, has kicked off a programme to provide support for families struggling during the pandemic.</p> 
  <p>About 2.5m packages of food and hygiene products will be distributed over the weekend to families in Santiago before the scheme expands to other parts of the country. Piñera said:<br></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is a support and relief for millions and millions of Chilean families who need urgent help.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>However, poorer communities claim they are not receiving the support they need to survive during the pandemic, with many unable to work as parts of the country approach a second month of strict lockdown measures. Among those most affected are the 30% of the Chilean workforce who make up the country’s informal economy.</p> 
  <p>Unrest broke out earlier this week in several parts of the country over hunger, most notably in the Santiago district El Bosque, when dozens of people took to the street to express their desperation.<br></p> 
  <p>Police swiftly arrived, leading to violent clashes between police and protesters.</p> 
  <p>“After four weeks of quarantine, despair and hunger begin to appear,” said the mayor of El Bosque, <strong>Sadi Melo Moya,</strong> who condemned the police’s heavy-handed reaction.</p> 
  <p>The hunger protests have led to the emergence of dozens of makeshift soup kitchens in the city’s working-class neighbourhoods, where communities have united under the mantra “only the people help the people”.</p> 
  <p>Videos circulating on social media show police interrupting community support efforts, confiscating donated goods and shutting down soup kitchens.</p> 
  <p>The police denied accusations of excessive repression, claiming one of the gatherings filmed required intervention as it had “initiated disorder” and did not respect the quarantine.</p> 
  <p>Chile’s former president and the current UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, <strong>Michelle Bachelet</strong>, said: “It is key to generate important mechanisms for social protection.”</p>

  <p>A Berlin church is hosting Muslims who are unable to fit into their mosque for Friday prayers because of physical distancing guidelines, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>The Dar Assalam mosque in the Neukölln district normally welcomes hundreds of Muslims to its Friday services. But it can only accommodate 50 people at a time under Germany’s restrictions.</p> 
  <p>During Ramadan, the nearby Martha Lutheran church stepped in to help, hosting Muslim prayers in Arabic and German.</p> 
  <p>“It is a great sign and it brings joy in Ramadan and joy amid this crisis,” said <strong>Mohamed Taha Sabry</strong>, the mosque’s imam, who led his congregation in prayer watched over by a stained-glass window depicting the Virgin Mary. “This pandemic has made us a community. Crises bring people get together.”</p> 
  <p>Places of worship reopened in Germany on 4 May after being shut for weeks, but worshippers must maintain a minimum distance from one another of 1.5 metres.</p> 
  <p>The church, a red-brick neo-Renaissance building in Berlin’s Kreuzberg district could hardly offer a sharper contrast to the cultural centre in Neukölln where the Muslim congregation is accustomed to gathering. One worshipper, <strong tabindex="-1">Samer Hamdoun</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It was a strange feeling because of the musical instruments, the pictures. But, when you look, when you forget the small details. This is the House of God in the end.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Islamic Council, an umbrella group of 400 mosques, said in April that many face bankruptcy because the closures stretched into the holy fasting month of Ramadan, usually a vital period for donations.</p> 
  <p>The church’s pastor, <strong>Monika Matthias</strong>, said she had felt moved by the Muslim call to prayer.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I took part in the prayer. I gave a speech in German. And during prayer, I could only say yes, yes, yes, because we have the same concerns and we want to learn from you. And it is beautiful to feel that way about each other.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>South America has become a new centre of the pandemic, with Brazil hardest-hit, while cases are rising in some African countries that so far have a relatively low death toll, the World Health Organization has said.</p> 
  <p>“In a sense South America has become a new epicentre for the disease,” <strong>Dr Mike Ryan</strong>, WHO’s top emergencies expert, told a news conference, adding Brazil is “clearly the most affected”.</p> 
  <p>Ryan noted Brazilian authorities have approved broad use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. He reiterated that current clinical evidence does not support the unproven drug’s widespread use against the new disease, given its risks.</p> 
  <p>Some nine African countries had 50% rises in cases in the past week, while others have seen a decline or have stable rates, Ryan said. The low mortality rate may be due to half of the continent’s population being 18 years old or younger, he said, adding he still is worried the disease will spread on a continent with “significant gaps” in intensive care services, medical oxygen and ventilation.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Key developments in the global <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>About 80 million infants may have missed out on vaccines</strong> for diseases including diphtheria, measles and polio as a result of the disruption to healthcare services caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization says.</li> 
   <li><strong>Fighting has forced 660,000 people to flee their homes since the UN secretary general called for a global ceasefire to focus on handling the pandemic</strong>, an NGO says. The Norwegian Refugee Council says the UN security council has failed to provide leadership for ceasefires during the pandemic.</li> 
   <li><strong>Two-week quarantines will be imposed on new arrivals to the UK from 8 June</strong>, with a £1,000 fine awaiting anyone who breaches the measure. The home secretary, Priti Patel, announces that mandatory self-isolation would not apply to people coming from Ireland</li> 
   <li><strong>The UK’s coronavirus epidemic is “either flat or declining ... and in most areas it is declining,”</strong> said thegovernment’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. He said the country’s coronavirus R0 number - the number of people to whom each infected person passes the virus - is between 0.7 and 1.</li> 
   <li><strong>The 54 countries in Africa have collectively identified more than 100,000 cases of infection</strong>, according to figures collated by the Africa Centres for Disease Control. There have so far been 3,101 deaths across the continent.</li> 
   <li><strong>Germany’s tax revenues for April fell by a quarter compared to the same month last year</strong>. According to the finance ministry’s monthly report, the central government and the 16 federal states pulled in about €39bn (£34.87bn). </li> 
   <li><strong>The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area will be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday</strong>, the Spanish government says. The two regions have been the areas hardest hit by Covid-19.</li> 
   <li><strong>One of Europe’s biggest music events, Exit festival in Serbia, has been rescheduled for August</strong>. Originally meant to take place in July in Novi Sad, the fate of the festival was uncertain. But, as Serbia emerges from its lockdown, its prime minister, Ana Brnabić, said the event can take place after all.</li>

  <p>Human rights activists in <strong>Zimbabwe</strong> have accused the country’s police and other officials of more than 200 violations linked to the country’s coronavirus lockdown. </p> 
  <p>The Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum, a coalition of 20 rights groups, said it had petitioned the country’s police chief and home affairs minister over escalating rights abuses, according to <strong>AFP</strong>.</p> 
  <p>“About 245 violations … have been recorded since the start of the lockdown,” Jestina Mukoko, who chairs the coalition, told reporters in Harare.<br></p> 
  <p>The forum is “appalled and outraged by the continued human rights violations that are openly taking place in Zimbabwe and perpetrated by the members of the … police”, Mukoko said.</p> 
  <p>The monitors in particular called on police to launch a criminal investigation into the “abduction and torture” of a lawmaker from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change and two other senior party officials.<br tabindex="-1"></p> 
  <p>They said the women, who were arrested after flash demonstrations over food shortages, were taken by unidentified men and driven several miles out of town, beaten up, sexually assaulted and dumped by a roadside.</p> 
  <p>Zimbabwe has so far recorded 51 cases of coronavirus, including four deaths. Last weekend the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, said a lockdown imposed on March 30 to control the spread of the virus would stay in place for the moment, but be reviewed every two weeks.</p>

  <p><strong>Italy</strong> recorded 130 new deaths from Covid-19 epidemic on Friday against 156 the day before, the civil protection agency said, while the daily tally of new cases rose marginally to 652, from 642 on Thursday, <strong>Reuters</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>The total death toll now stands at 32,616, the agency said, the third highest in the world after those of the US and Britain.</p> 
  <p>However, statisticians believe Italy, like many other countries, has had considerably more deaths from the virus than its official data suggests, because many casualties were never tested.</p> 
  <p>A study this week by Italy’s social security agency, INPS, showed there were almost 47,000 more deaths between 1 March and 30 April than in the average for the same period over the previous five years.</p>

  <p>Senior government officials in <strong>Russia</strong> have said the country will experience a sharp rise in mortality figures for May, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread. </p> 
  <p>“There will be a significant mortality increase in May,” the deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, was quoted by AFP as saying at a government meeting with the president, Vladimir Putin, referring to official analysis and the country’s coronavirus curve.</p> 
  <p>“The illness and chronic conditions don’t always have a positive ending,” Golikova said, despite doctors trying to “save the maximum number of patients.”</p>

  <p><strong>Germany</strong> has announced a series of reforms of the country’s meat industry, including a ban on the use of subcontractors and fines of €30,000 (£26,000) for companies breaching labour regulations, as slaughterhouses have emerged as coronavirus hotspots, writes <strong>Holly Young</strong> in Berlin.</p> 
  <p>A number of meat plants across the country have temporarily closed after hundreds of workers tested positive for Covid-19 in recent weeks.</p> 
  <p>This week more than 90 workers were reported to have fallen ill at a plant in Dissen, Lower Saxony. Following an outbreak at a plant in Coesfeld, where more than 270 out of 1,200 workers tested positive, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia announced mass testing of industry employees.</p> 
  <p>An outbreak at a plant in Bavaria in the district of Straubing-Bogen coincides with numbers of infections reaching the “emergency break” level of 50 cases per 100,000 residents. States passing this point are allowed to reimpose lockdown restrictions.</p> 
  <p>“The corona outbreaks have not surprised us at all,” said Jonas Bohl, from the German <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/food">Food</a>, Beverages and Catering Union. “Rather the surprise was that they took a while to emerge.</p> 
  <p>“The people not only work closely together but more importantly they live together, in very cramped conditions where there is no possibility to keep social distance.”</p>

  <p>A study of nearly 100,000 coronavirus patients has shown no benefit in treating them with anti-viral drugs <strong>hydroxychloroquine</strong> and <strong>chloroquine.</strong></p> 
  <p>According to the study, which was published on Friday in the Lancet, the drugs actually increased the likelihood of patients with Covid-19 dying in hospital.</p> 
  <p>Hydroxychloroquine is normally used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and other conditions, but pronouncements from public figures including Donald Trump, who announced this week he is taking the drug, has prompted governments to bulk buy the medicine.</p> 
  <p>Chloroquine is an anti-malarial. Both drugs can produce potentially serious side-effects, particularly heart arrhythmia. </p> 
  <p>“Treatment with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine does not benefit patients with Covid-19,” said Prof Mandeep Mehra, lead author of the study and executive director of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital Center for Advanced Heart Disease in Boston.</p> 
  <p>“Instead, our findings suggest it may be associated with an increased risk of serious heart problems and increased risk of death.”<br></p> 
  <p>The authors estimated that the drugs put patients at up to 45% higher risk of dying from Covid-19 compared with underlying health issues.<br tabindex="-1"></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">80 million infants may have missed out on routine vaccines</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>About 80 million infants may have missed out on vaccines for diseases including diphtheria, measles and polio as a result of the disruption to healthcare services caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. </p> 
  <p>According to data collected by WHO and its partners, the provision of routine immunisations for under-ones has been hindered in at least 68 countries, causing disruption to vaccine programmes not seen since their inception in the 1970s. </p> 
  <p>More than half of the 129 countries where data was available reported moderate-to-severe disruptions, or a total suspension of vaccination services during March-April 2020, WHO said in a press release on Friday.</p> 
  <p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Immunisation is one of the most powerful and fundamental disease prevention tools in the history of public health. Disruption to immunisation programmes from the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to unwind decades of progress against vaccine-preventable diseases like measles.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The WHO’s warning comes before a global vaccine summit due to be hosted on 4 June in London, where international donors will be asked to pledge support to the vaccine alliance Gavi, a public-private partnership that aims to increase roll out of vaccines in poorer countries. Tedros added: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>From the bottom of my heart, I urge donors to fully fund the alliance. These countries, these children especially, need vaccines, and they need Gavi.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In April, WHO and its partners recommended a temporary halt to polio vaccine campaigns despite recognising that the move would lead to a resurgence of the highly infectious, water-borne disease. </p> 
  <p>More than a dozen countries in Africa have reported polio outbreaks this year, all caused by a rare mutation in the virus contained in the vaccine. </p>

  <p><strong>France</strong> will hold the postponed second round of municipal elections next month if the coronavirus crisis remains under control, the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, has said, writes <strong>Kim Willsher</strong>, the Guardian’s Paris correspondent.</p> 
  <p>A commission will look at the rules for postal and proxy voting so a maximum number of the electorate can take part in the vote on 28 June, Philippe added.</p> 
  <p>The first round of France’s municipal election was held on 15 March, two days before the country went into strict lockdown. The second round was to be held the following Sunday, but was cancelled.</p> 
  <p>A second round vote will only be held just under 5,000 communes – with a total of 16 million voters – out of more than 30,643 places where the mayor was not elected outright in the first round. Many of the 5,000 second votes are in major towns and cities including Paris.</p> 
  <p>Philippe said if there was a second wave of Covid-19 cases, the election would be put back until the beginning of next year.</p> 
  <p>The interior minister, Christophe Castaner, announced that voters would be required to wear face masks. “The election must not be a factor in spreading the virus,” he said. He added that candidates would be expected to campaign differently, giving priority to online and television canvassing as opposed to public meetings, currently banned.<br tabindex="-1"></p>

  <p><strong>Sweden</strong> reported 54 more deaths from Covid-19 on Friday, taking the total death toll in the country to 3,925. </p> 
  <p>According to the latest figures from Sweden’s public health agency, 637 more people have tested positive for the coronavirus. In total, Sweden has 32,809 confirmed cases, with 4,971 recoveries. </p> 
  <p>As regular readers of the blog will now, we have been following the situation in Sweden with some interest, after its government chose not to implement the kinds of compulsory lockdown measures imposed elsewhere in the world. <br></p> 
  <p>Today, the Guardian’s comment section has published an op-ed by Tae Hoon Kim, a South Korean geopolitical and economic analyst based in Stockholm, on why he believes that, despite it having a much higher death rate than its neighbours, Sweden is unlikely to make a U-turn on its strategy. He writes:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Sweden has received considerable media scrutiny in recent days. According to figures published on Tuesday, it now has the highest <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/20/sweden-becomes-country-highest-coronavirus-death-rate-per-capita/">coronavirus-per-capita death rate in the world</a>, with an average of 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants a day on a rolling seven-day average between 13 and 20 May. As of 22 May, Sweden has had 32,172 confirmed cases and 3,871 deaths. These figures are lower than those of Italy or the UK. But they are higher than those of Portugal and Greece, two countries with a similar size of population to Sweden. The <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">figures</a> are also much higher than Sweden’s Nordic neighbours, with Denmark at 11,182 cases and 561 deaths, Norway at 8,309 and 235, and Finland at 6,537 and 306 ...</p> 
   <p>But despite the high number of deaths, about 70% of Swedes <a href="https://www.msb.se/contentassets/01163f676a3348cfa68491c617b5e1d0/1544449-msb_resultat-coronaundersoknng_200510.pdf">support</a> their government’s approach. In fact, there has not been much public debate or organised opposition to the strategy. The deaths have indeed shocked many Swedes, especially the disproportionately high number of deaths among those over 70 in care homes and those from working-class, immigrant backgrounds. The debates, however, seem to be taking a more socioeconomic angle. In other words, the reasons for these deaths are being blamed on structural, economic, and social deficiencies – but not on the strategy itself.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Africa reaches 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>More than 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus have now been reported across Africa, according to figures collated by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).</p> 
  <p>According to the <a href="https://africacdc.org/covid-19/">interactive coronavirus dashboard</a> hosted on the African Union health agency’s website, there have so far been 3,101 deaths across the continent from Covid-19, while 39,416 people have recovered. </p> 
  <p>Unlike other regions, particularly Europe to the north, the coronavirus has been slow to spread across Africa. After the first confirmed case was reported in mid-February in Egypt, many countries responded with strict lockdowns. </p> 
  <p>The figures show the burden of the pandemic is mainly being felt in north Africa, followed by the western then southern nations. East and central Africa have far fewer cases. </p>

  <p>As <strong>Canada</strong>’s most populous province moves forward with its reopening plans, concerns are growing that coronavirus cases in Ontario are not yet under control, writes <strong tabindex="-1">Leyland Cecco</strong> in Toronto. </p> 
  <p>For a brief period in May, new cases showed a steady decrease, leading to optimism that an easing of the province’s lockdown was on the horizon – and justified. </p> 
  <p>In response, Ontario has given the green light to having given the green light to retailers, golf courses and pet groomers to resume operations. Lawmakers in the governing Progressive Conservative party have also pushed for restaurant and bar patios to reopen, with modifications. </p> 
  <p>But in recent days, the province’s infection numbers have trended upwards, averaging more than 400 new cases per day this week – a figure the province’s chief medial officer called “disappointing”. </p> 
  <p>The province had also aimed for 20,000 tests per day. But this past week, an average of less than 10,000 were conducted daily – including only 5,813 on Monday. </p> 
  <p>“I will be like an 800-pound gorilla on their backs every single day if I have to until I see these numbers go up,” said the Ontario premier, Doug Ford. </p> 
  <p>At the same time, there is growing concern among health experts that the province is unable to account for the source of nearly two-thirds of infections, leading to concern that the reopening of the province is premature. </p> 
  <p>Ontario’s ministry of health said determining the source of infection was “ongoing work”, citing incomplete information from local health authorities. </p> 
  <p>“As we try to get our economy back on its feet, we are very, very likely to experience surges in disease,” Dr David Fisman, an infectious diseases expert, told CBC News. “Covid’s proven itself to be a very slippery foe and you can’t fight an enemy that you can’t see.” <br tabindex="-1"></p>

  <p>It might have lost 90% of its hotel bookings but Amsterdam shouldn’t rush to welcome back international tourists, according to its mayor.

  <p>“I hear you talking about international tourism, and I know that there are 55,000 hotel beds waiting for guests, too,” she told a digital council meeting on Tuesday. “But in the coming time we need to be extremely cautious about stimulating regional, national and international traffic.

  <p>Few residents of the world’s great metropolises would have thought much about plagues before this year. Outside China and east Asia – made vigilant by swine flu and Sars – the trauma of the 1918 flu pandemic or typhoid epidemics has largely faded from popular memory. But our cities remember.</p> 
  <p>An outbreak of yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793 <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-pandemics-have-changed-american-cities-often-for-the-better-137945">prompted administrators</a> to take over the task of cleaning streets, clearing gutters and collecting rubbish. It worked, and governments across the US adopted the responsibility over the next decades. A misconception that the odour emanating from wastewater was responsible for diseases such as cholera prompted one of <a href="https://www.history.com/news/cholera-pandemic-new-york-city-london-paris-green-space">the world’s first modern underground sewer systems</a> in London, and the development of wider, straighter and paved roads – which helped prevent water from stagnating.</p> 
  <p>The legacy Covid-19 may leave on the world’s great cities is being hotly debated, although most specialists admit it is too early to know for sure.</p> 
  <p>“It will depend in the end on how we analyse this virus: how is it spreading? How is it making people sick?” says Roger Keil, a professor of environmental studies at Toronto’s York University. “We don’t know the full answers, but once they become clearer, urban planners and other professionals will start to think as their predecessors did 100 years ago, as they laid sewer pipes and cleaned out parts of the city that were considered insalubrious.”<br></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Madrid and Barcelona to ease lockdown on Monday</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area will be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday, the Spanish government has announced.</p> 
  <p>The two regions have been the areas hardest hit by Covid-19, which has so far killed 27,940 people in the country and infected 233,037.</p> 
  <p>The loosening of the restrictions in both areas – and in parts of Castilla y León – means that all of Spain is now in at least the second phase of the lockdown exit plan.</p> 
  <p>From Monday, people in the three areas will be able to meet in groups of up to 10 individuals, and restaurant and cafe terraces will reopen at 50% capacity. Places of worship will also be able to operate at 30% capacity.</p> 
  <p>The health minister, Salvador Illa, said 47% of the country will move to the third and penultimate stage of the de-escalation on Monday. People in the Balearic Islands, the Canaries, and some parts of the mainland will then be able to visit shopping centres and eat inside restaurants – both of which will operate at 40% capacity.</p> 
  <p>The government’s latest two-week extension of the state of emergency originally declared on 14 March was hard-won, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/anger-in-madrid-but-calm-in-barcelona-at-extended-lockdown">protests against the lockdown have spread from Madrid</a> to other regions. The far-right Vox party has called on people to take to their cars to demonstrate across Spain on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>María Jesús Montero, the finance minister who serves as the government’s spokeswoman, said that people had a right to protest, as long as their demonstrations did not risk spreading the coronavirus:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The only things that the state of emergency limits its people’s freedom of movement and reunion. Very often, some of the shouts you hear during these demonstrations are contradictory because people are out protesting. Some people shout, ‘Freedom!’, when they’re actually exercising the right to criticise things and protest. But you can’t mix up freedom with the freedom to infect people.</p>

   <li><strong>Fighting has forced 660,000 people to flee their homes since the UN secretary general called for a global ceasefire</strong> to focus on handling the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.</li> 
   <li><strong>Tax revenues in Germany fell by a quarter last month, compared with a year earlier</strong>, as Europe’s largest economy faced its most severe recession since the second world war. The central government and the 16 federal states pulled in about €39bn in April, 25.3% less than the same month in 2019.</li> 
   <li><strong>A senior official in South Africa told MPs that it is time to reopen the country’s economy</strong>. Lionel October, director-general of the department of trade, said the government was finalising consultations on how to reopen industries.</li> 
   <li><strong>Pictures have emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a visit in Michigan.</strong> The US president had previously been called a “petulant child” by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear the covering during a tour of a Ford plant.</li> 
   <li><strong>India has reported 6,000 new cases in its biggest one-day rise since the outbreak started.</strong> The country has also reported over 118,000 confirmed cases – around a 5% increase from yesterday.</li> 
   <li><strong>Coronavirus cases in war-torn Yemen are believed to be “widespread”, while its health system has “in effect collapsed”. </strong>A UN spokesman said on Friday that the reported total of 184 cases in the country is also “almost certainly much higher”.</li> 
   <li><strong>Indonesia has reported 973 new infections – its highest daily figure – bringing the country’s total cases to 20,162. </strong>The figures come as millions of people in the world’s fourth most populous country mark the festival of Eid al-Fitr without the usual celebrations.</li> 
   <li><strong>The leader of New Zealand’s main opposition party has been ousted after opinion polls showed Jacinda Ardern’s soaring popularity. </strong>Around 84% of New Zealanders approve of the prime minister’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which has helped to boost her ratings ahead of a general election in September.</li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Exit festival given new date in August</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good news for ravers, many of whom have been wondering if they’ll ever get to throw shapes and hug strangers ever again. One of Europe’s biggest music events, Exit festival in <strong>Serbia</strong>, has been given a new date in August, Agence France-Presse reports. </p> 
  <p>Originally scheduled for mid-July in the northern city of Novi Sad, the fate of the festival had been uncertain since the coronavirus pandemic spread. But after Serbia emerged from its lockdown without a major outbreak, the prime minister, Ana Brnabić, recommended the event could take place after all. </p> 
  <p>“We expect the (health) situation to be completely calm by August,” she said Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Organisers of the festival, which drew 200,000 people last year, welcomed the “excellent news” and said there could be changes to the format of the event, whose exact dates are still not confirmed.<br></p> 
  <p>“If necessary, we are ready to substantially reduce the number of visitors and limit ourselves to the local and regional public,” they said in a statement.</p> 
  <p>Exit, now in its 20th year, was born out of the student movement that opposed the former leader Slobodan Milošević, who was overthrown in 2000 by mass protests.</p> 
  <p>This year, headliners were expected to include David Guetta, Tyga and Fatboy Slim.</p>

  <p>A little over a month ago, health experts were saying <strong>Japan</strong> risked becoming one of the world’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-japan/japan-urges-citizens-to-isolate-as-reports-warn-of-400000-deaths-idUSKCN21X149">coronavirus “disaster zones”</a>, writes <strong>Justin McCurry</strong>, the Guardian’s Tokyo correspondent.</p> 
  <p>Its government was already facing criticism over its decision to quarantine passengers and crew onboard the <a draggable="true" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/14/love-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-valentines-day-on-the-quarantined-ship-diamond-princess">Diamond Princess</a> cruise liner, and had been accused of underplaying the Covid-19 threat while it clung to the increasingly faint hope of <a draggable="true" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/massively-let-down-disappointment-in-japan-after-tokyo-olympics-postponed">hosting the Olympics</a> this summer.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan">Japan</a> was testing too few people, critics said, opting instead to focus on clusters of cases rather than overburden its healthcare system with patients displaying no or only mild symptoms who, by law, had to be admitted to hospital. One of the world’s richest countries was bungling its response, critics said.</p> 
  <p>But today, Japan can make a strong case for being another coronavirus success story, albeit one that has failed to resonate globally in the same way as those in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.</p>

  <p>White flags first began to appear on the streets of <strong>Guatemala</strong> <strong>City</strong> in early April, writes <strong>Jeff Abbott</strong> from the Guatemalan capital.</p> 
  <p>Since then, flags have become common across the country, with an entire lexicon of need reflected in their colours: white means hunger; red means medicine is needed; black, yellow, or blue means that a woman, child or elderly person is in danger of violence.</p> 
  <p>Guatemala has reported 45 coronavirus deaths and 2,265 infections. But the economic fallout of the pandemic has affected millions.</p> 
  <p>Measures imposed by the government of President Alejandro Giammattei to slow the spread of the virus – including suspension of public transportation and daily curfews – have hit those living in poverty the hardest.</p> 
  <p>“It is another sign of a society that lacks social services and that does not have a labour market that permits people to have savings to confront the crisis,” said Jonathan Menkos, the executive director of the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies.</p> 
  <p>“[The white flags] are the most clear evidence that the social and economic model leaves most people behind. They cannot go one month without resources to eat.”</p>

  <p>Unions in <strong>Italy</strong> have accused a <strong>US</strong> multinational of breaking the law after it sacked 190 workers in Naples during the coronavirus crisis, writes <strong tabindex="-1">Lorenzo Tondo</strong> in Palermo.</p> 
  <p>On Friday, unions and workers protested against the decision of Jabil, a company which spans numerous industries, including healthcare, life sciences, clean technology and has 100 plants in 28 countries, and 170,000 employees worldwide. </p> 
  <p>Media in Italy reported that the company has announced that, from Monday, 190 workers at a plant in Marcianise would be laid off because of “falling production volumes and under-utilised resources”.</p> 
  <p>“Leaving all those workers in the middle of the street during a pandemic is an intolerable and illegal decision,” Rocco Palombella of the Uil union told the Italian newspaper la Repubblica. “It is an irresponsible attitude from the American company.”</p> 
  <p>Michele Madonna of the Fiom union said: “Companies do not stop even in the face of the pandemic drama. We are desperate.”</p> 
  <p>Italian unions allege that Jabil breached a government-imposed decree to deal that prohibits the layoffs until mid-August. The aim of the decree is to prevent the household finances of Italian families worsening during the coronavirus emergency. </p> 
  <p>However, in a note reported by Corriere della Sera and Repubblica, Jabil said the decree had been respected because the layoffs in Marcianise were already planned in June 2019, more than eight months before 23 February cut-off point for layoff procedures to be suspended under the new law.</p> 
  <p>The company also said it had done everything possible to help its workers and that it had “also made available significant economic resources both for employees, as incentives to leave, and for the companies that will hire Jabil’s employees, in support of their business plans”.<br tabindex="-1"></p>

  <p>An editor has been jailed for two years in <strong>Myanmar</strong> after his news agency reported a coronavirus death that turned out to be incorrect, <strong>Agence France-Presse</strong> reports. </p> 
  <p>Zaw Ye Htet, the chief editor of the Dae Pyaw news agency, was arrested on 13 April, the day he published an article that wrongly reported there had been a death due to the Covid-19 in eastern Karen state.</p> 
  <p>He stood trial on 20 May. On Friday, his lawyer, Myint Thuzar Maw, told AFP: “He was sentenced under section 505(b) to two years in jail.”</p> 
  <p>Section 505(b) is a vaguely worded law, and often used against journalists and activists for making any statement that cause fear or alarm.</p>

  <p>Children and young people could be half as likely to catch coronavirus than adults, a review of studies from around the world has suggested, <strong tabindex="-1">PA Media</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Researchers found the under-20s appeared to be 56% less likely of catching the virus. But the review of global test and tracing and population screening studies led University College London said evidence remained “weak” on how likely children were to transmit the virus to others.</p> 
  <p>Researchers also concluded they did not have sufficient data to examine whether children under 12 differed to teenagers in terms of susceptibility to the virus.</p> 
  <p>The research’s lead author, Prof Russell Viner of the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said it was the “first comprehensive study” to review what was and was not known about “susceptibility and transmission” among children.</p> 
  <p>He said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Our findings show children and young people appear 56% less likely to contract Covid-19 from infected others.</p> 
   <p>Susceptibility is a key part of the chain of infection, and this supports the view that children are likely to play a smaller role in transmitting the virus and proliferating the pandemic, although considerable uncertainty remains.</p> 
   <p>This new data provides essential evidence to governments around the world to inform their decision-making on whether to reopen schools and reduce or end lockdown measures.</p>

  <p>Despite a national lockdown slowing the spread of the virus, South Africa has already has the highest number of infections on the continent, with more than 18,000 identified cases and 339 deaths. </p> 
  <p>Taking into account the southern hemisphere winter, the modelling by scientists suggests there could be between 35,000 and 50,000 Covid-19 deaths by November. </p>

  <p> The models, which consider best and worst scenarios, suggest as many as 3 million coronavirus cases by November and demand for hospital beds peaking at 45,000, about 10 times the country’s intensive care bed availability. </p>

   <p>While people are being displaced and killed, powerful members of the UN security council squabble like children in a sandbox.</p> 
   <p>World leaders must rise to the occasion and jointly push parties to cease their fire and unite in protecting all communities from Covid-19. Now is not the time for kindergarten politics.</p>

  <p>According to NRC, the worst affected country was the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where 480,000 people have been forced to escape fighting between armed groups and the country’s army. </p> 
  <p>NRC also pointed to Yemen, where despite the Saudi-led coalition announcing it would implement a unilateral ceasefire, airstrikes have continued. Those attacks and other armed operations have resulted in the displacement of 24,000 people.</p>

  <p>The coronavirus is tearing through <strong>Native Hawaiian</strong> and other <strong>Pacific Islander</strong> communities in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california"><strong>California</strong></a>, fanning longstanding health disparities and killing community members at a higher rate than any other racial group in the state, <strong>Mario Koran</strong> reports for the Guardian US from Oakland.</p> 
  <p>Data from California’s department of public health reveals that Pacific Islanders have contracted coronavirus at <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Race-Ethnicity.aspx">nearly twice</a> the state’s overall rate. As of 17 May, they have died from the virus at a rate 2.6 times higher than the state average – the highest death rate of any racial or ethnic group.</p> 
  <p>The pattern extends beyond California. <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/pacific-islanders-in-oregon-have-the-highest-rate-of-covid-19/">Oregon</a>, Utah, Washington and <a href="https://www.kuaf.com/post/coronavirus-spreads-arkansass-pacific-islander-community#stream/0">Arkansas </a>– where many Marshallese work in meatpacking plants – have all seen similar trends.</p> 
  <p>Public health experts have often said the group’s relatively small size can skew the numbers, making percentages appear outsized. But to community members and advocates, that argument obfuscates a long history of overlooked needs and health disparities.</p>

  <p>It would be hard to overstate the importance of developing a vaccine to Sars-CoV-2 – it’s seen as the fast track to a return to normal life, writes <strong>Ian Sample</strong>, the Guardian’s science editor.

 <h2 class="block-title">Germany's tax revenues fall by a quarter in April</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Tax revenues in <strong>Germany</strong> fell by a quarter last month, compared with a year earlier, as Europe’s largest economy faced its most severe recession since the second world war.</p> 
  <p>According to the finance ministry’s monthly report, published on Friday, the central government and the 16 federal states pulled in about 39bn euros in April, 25.3% less than the same month in 2019, <strong>Reuters</strong> reported. </p> 
  <p>The revenue decline was most severe for income, corporate and air traffic taxes, the report showed. The pandemic’s impact on tax revenues were first visible in March but has now accelerated.</p> 
  <p>Germany authorities imposed a strict lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus, closing most businesses and limiting people’s movement outside their homes. </p> 
  <p>The finance minister, Olaf Scholz, said earlier this month that the plunge in tax revenues will not stop the government from presenting a stimulus package next month to help companies recover from the coronavirus crisis.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus increased by 460 to 177,212, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday.</p> 
  <p>The reported death toll rose by 27 to 8174, the tally showed.<br></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p> 
  <p>Here’s an outline of some of the key global coronavirus updates so far this morning. </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Pictures have emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a visit in Michigan.</strong> The US president had previously been called a “petulant child” by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear the covering during a tour of the Ford plant. </li> 
   <li><strong>India has reported 6,000 new cases in its biggest one-day rise since the outbreak started.</strong> The country has also reported over 118,000 confirmed cases – around a 5% increase from yesterday. </li> 
   <li><strong>Coronavirus cases in war-torn Yemen are believed to be “widespread”, while its health system has “in effect collapsed”. </strong>A UN spokesman said on Friday that the reported total of 184 cases in the country is also “almost certainly much higher”. </li> 
   <li><strong>Hong Kong activists have called for citizens to rise up against Bejing’s plans to impose national security legislation in the financial hub. </strong>Many believe the plans have reignited the anti-government movement that had lost its focus and dwindled amid the coronavirus pandemic. </li> 
   <li><strong>Indonesia has reported 973 new infections – its highest number of daily coronavirus cases – bringing the country’s total cases to 20,162. </strong>The figures come as millions of people in the world’s fourth most populous country mark the festival of Eid al-Fitr without the usual celebrations. </li> 
   <li><strong>The leader of New Zealand’s main opposition party has been ousted after opinion polls showed Jacinda Ardern’s soaring popularity. </strong>Around 84% of New Zealanders approve of the prime minister’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, which has helped to boost her ratings ahead of a general election in September. </li>

  <p>The transmission of coronavirus is believed to be “already widespread” in <strong>Yemen</strong>, the UN has said.</p> 
  <p>Aid agencies have said the country is “really on the brink right now” and that its health system “has in effect collapsed” according to a spokesman. </p> 
  <p>During a Geneva briefing, Jens Laerke, spokesman for the UN office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said: “They are talking about having to turn people away because they do not have enough (medical) oxygen, they do not have enough personal protective equipment.”</p> 
  <p>“The actual incidence is almost certainly much higher,” Laerke said.</p> 
  <p>Authorities in Yemen have reported just 184 cases including 30 deaths from the virus to the World Health Organisation.</p> 
  <p>The UN has estimated that it will need to seek $2bn to maintain aid programmes in the country until the end of the year.<br></p>

  <p><strong>Amazon</strong> is to hire 50,000 temporary workers in <strong>India</strong> to meet a surge in online shopping in the country amid a national coronavirus lockdown. </p> 
  <p>Although online outlets faced a massive disruption to operations in the first days of lockdown, an easing of restrictions has allowed many to resume business as usual. </p> 
  <p>“We want to continue helping customers all over India get everything they need so they can continue to practice social distancing,” Amazon senior executive Akhil Saxena said in a statement on the company’s blog.</p> 
  <p>“[The move] will also keep as many people as possible working during this pandemic while providing a safe work environment for them.”</p> 
  <p>Amazon said the temporary workers will be recruited to its “fulfillment centres” and as part of its delivery network. </p> 
  <p>The announcement comes at a time when many companies in India have cut jobs as they try to tide over the financial impact of the health crisis. </p>

  <p>The Afghan health minister asked the waring sides to don’t shelter inside medical centres as number of confirmed coronavirus cases has passed 9,000 and <strong>Kabul</strong> recorded its third worst day of the crisis straight. </p> 
  <p>Ferozuddin Feroz, the country’s health minister has asked the militant groups, Afghan government and international forces to don’t use medical centres as shelter. </p> 
  <p>“Our medical centres are servicing all sides, so I ask to don’t use medical centres as shelter” Feroz said on Friday.</p> 
  <p>War has been intensified across the country as the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, in response to an attack on a maternity hospital last week, ordered a resumption of a full offensive against the Taliban and other militant groups, ending a period of reduced military activity ahead of US-brokered peace talks that had been expected to start this year.</p> 
  <p>Feroz also ask the nation to avoid Eid gatherings. He warned that if people continue to break lockdown rules, the number of transmission will continue to surge across the country as despite governmen authorised lockdown in several provinces, streets are still crowded. </p> 
  <p>On Thursday the ministry said it has run out of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients. “The hospitals which had empty beds until 10 days ago and we were sending patients to, are paked, with no more beds. We should launch more hospital immediately” Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said. </p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, number of confirmed cases has passed 9,000 as more than half of tests done in a 24-hour period come back positive across the country and Kabul recorded its third worst day of the crisis straight. </p> 
  <p>Health ministry tested 1,060 suspected patients of which 542 came back positive in last 24 hours, 12 deaths of Covid-19 have also been recorded, pushing the total number of infections to 9,216 and death toll to 205. </p> 
  <p>There have so far been 993 recoveries. Capital Kabul recorded 316 new cases out of 609 tests, four patients also died of Covid-19 in Kabul in last 24 hours. </p> 
  <p>Total number of confirmed cases in <strong>Afghanistan</strong>’s worst affected area stands at 3,083 with 29 deaths. Concerns are high in Afghanistan as Eid Al-Fitr is scheduled for end of this. </p> 
  <p>“Do stay at home during Eid and don’t make the happiness of Eid to grief” Majroh told the nation Thursday. “If you have doubt about the virus, just go and stay an hour in front a coronavirus hospital and look at the number of patients entering the hospital and deads bodies coming out of that”</p>

  <p>The US president’s decision to appear without a protective mask during part of the visit drew the ire of the state attorney general, Dana Nessel, who told CNN: “The president is like a petulant child”.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>India</strong> has reported 6,000 new cases of the coronavirus, the country’s biggest 24-hour rise since the pandemic began. </p> 
  <p>Figures on the new infections come as New Delhi eases the nationwide lockdown and some domestic flights resume. </p> 
  <p>On Friday, India reported over 118,000 confirmed cases – roughly a 5% increase from Thursday. A total of 3,853 people have died after contracting the virus. </p> 
  <p>Although the current lockdown, which began on March 25, has been extended to May 31 by prime minister <strong>Narendra Modi</strong>, rules have been relaxed in areas with lower case numbers.</p> 
  <p>State governments are also allowed to issue their own guidance on some matters.</p>

  <p><strong>Thailand </strong>is to maintain its state of emergency over the coronavirus until the end of June. </p> 
  <p>The country’s Covid-19 taskforce said on Friday that the measure would be kept in place to keep infections under control as the government prepares to ease restrictions further in early June. </p> 
  <p>Last weekend, shopping malls and department stores reopened after almost two months of closure. But despite the slowing of cases, bars, nightclubs, cinemas, playgrounds and some sports are still off-limits. </p> 
  <p>“The reason for extending the emergency decree for one more month is health security, enabling a unified and continued operation by officials in a pandemic situation that has not been resolved,” said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government’s Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA).</p> 
  <p>The extension is subject to Cabinet approval on Tuesday.</p>

  <p><strong>Australia</strong> has almost halved the number of people it will support with its wage subsidy scheme during the pandemic. </p> 
  <p>The revision, which will save the government around $60bn (Australian dollars), comes as the Treasury said successful efforts to control the outbreak and errors on subsidy applications meant only 3.5 million people will need to be covered. </p> 
  <p>In May, the government said it would spend $130bn to subsidise the wages of around 6 million people until September as social distancing restrictions forced hundreds of thousands out of work. </p>

  <p>The revision to the scheme, which is now expected to cost $70bn, comes hours after Fitch Ratings downgraded its outlook on Australia’s coveted ‘AAA’ rating to “negative” from “stable”, citing the hit to the country’s economy and public finances from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

  <p><strong>Hong Kong </strong>activists have called for people to rise up against Beijing’s plans to impose national security legislation in the city, saying that the new laws could erode its freedoms through “force and fear”.</p> 
  <p>A proposed march at noon on Friday in the central financial district did not materialise after the online calls drew the attention of only a handful of activists and as riot police made their presence visible on the streets. </p> 
  <p>But new calls have emerged for flash mobs at night across the territory, with activists planning to meet the press to announce “street action” later today.</p> 
  <p>“This is a great moment to reboot the protest,” university student Kay, 24, told Reuters. She participated in last year’s often violent anti-government and anti-Beijing protests which have since entered a lull due to the coronavirus.</p>

  <p><strong>Bulgaria</strong>, which has started to ease its lockdown, has scrapped a ban on the entry of visitors from the European Union and Schengen visa zone countries, the health ministry said in a statement late on Thursday. </p> 
  <p>In mid-March European Union member Bulgaria banned entry to its territory to travellers from many countries in an attempt to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. </p> 
  <p>The health ministry said that the lifting of the ban also covers San Marino, Andorra, Monaco and Vatican City. The ministry said that people arriving in Bulgaria would continue to spend 14 days in quarantine. </p> 
  <p>But the 14-day period will no longer apply to Bulgarian citizens and citizens of other EU countries who are travelling for humanitarian reasons and those who are “representatives of the trade, economic and investment activities”. </p> 
  <p>The quarantine will also not apply to people directly related to construction, maintenance, operations, and ensuring the safety of the strategic and critical infrastructure of Bulgaria, the ministry said. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Our global report today looks at the growing number of cases in the world’s fourth most populous nation, Indonesia.</p> 
  <p><strong>Rebecca Ratcliffe </strong>writes:</p> 
  <p>Indonesia has reported its highest number of daily coronavirus cases as millions of people in the world’s fourth most populous country prepared to mark the festival of Eid al-Fitr without the usual celebrations and gatherings.</p> 
  <p>This year’s festivities will be dampened by the economic hardship for many as Indonesian migrant workers, who usually send money back home to their families, have been left stranded and with no income.</p> 
  <p>Indonesian president Joko Widodo has banned people travelling home to their families for the holiday, though thousands have reportedly made the journey this week, despite fears that this could prompt further rises in transmission.</p> 
  <p>Officials said the virus has been spreading at its fastest rate over the past nine days, due in part to a worsening outbreak in East Java.<br></p> 
  <p>On Thursday, the country reported 973 new infections, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 20,162. The authorities have asked the military and the police to prevent arrivals in Jakarta until a full reopening of the capital is permitted.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>If you are just joining the blog, here’s a summary of the key events so far:</p> 
  <p><strong>Global infections have passed 5.1 million, deaths pass 332,000: </strong>Global cases stand at 5,102,573, with deaths reported at 332,924, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. Deaths in the US, stand at 94,702. The UK’s death toll is 36,124, with 252,246 infections</p> 
  <p><strong>China has not set a GDP target in due to “great uncertainty”: </strong>Beijing has taken the rate step of not setting a GDP target for the first time since it began publishing such goals in 1990. Instead, given “great uncertainty” caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, China will “give priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards”, Premier Li Keqiang told the opening of the National People’s Congress. He also said governments at all levels should “tighten their belts”, and that all types of surplus, idle and carryover funds will be withdrawn and re-allocated, to be put to better use. China reported four new cases of Covid-19 on Friday.</p> 
  <p><strong>Trump didn’t wear mask at factory visit and has pushed for churches to open:</strong> The president toured a Ford plant in the battleground state of Michigan, without wearing a face mask in front of TV cameras.<strong> </strong>The plant had been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment. On Tuesday Ford said its policy was that all visitors must wear face masks. Trump told reporters he had put one on out of the view of cameras: “I had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,” he said. Earlier Trump said there would be an announcement “very soon” on reopening churches to the public.</p> 
  <p><strong>Brazil has passed 20,000 deaths: </strong>Latin America’s biggest country passed the grim milestone with a record one-day death toll of 1,188, taking the confirmed total to 20,047. The country has 310,087 infections, third behind the US (1,577,287) and Russia (317,554). President Bolsonaro, a long-running advocate of malaria drug chloroquine to treat Covid-19, said on Thursday he knew there was no proof it works, but said there are cases in which it appears to have been successful.</p> 
  <p><strong>Russia’s industrial output dropped 6.5% in April: </strong>The country’s economic performance was hit by the coronavirus lockdown. The state statistics agency said “consumer demand fell for a range of goods and services”. Russia’s commodities sector only decreased by 3.2% year-on-year, and oil production actually grew by 0.2%. Pharmaceutical industries grew by 13.5%, year-on-year.</p> 
  <p><strong>Indonesia has had its biggest one day jump in cases: </strong>The world’s fourth most populous country reported 973 new infections on Thursday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 20,162. The authorities have asked the military and the police to prevent arrivals in Jakarta.</p> 
  <p><strong>South Korea has reported 20 new cases: </strong>The new coronavirus cases came as health authorities worked to contain the cluster connected to Seoul nightclubs. South Korea has had a total of 11,142 infections and 264 deaths.</p> 
  <p><strong>Australian’s most populous state eased restrictions further: </strong>New South Wales has announced cafes and restaurants will be allowed to have up to 50 patrons from 1 June, up from 10 currently allowed. Australia has had remarkable success in flattening the curve of infections from the coronavirus. The country of 25m has recorded 101 deaths and just over 7,000 cases. The country is consistently recording fewer than 20 new cases a day.</p> 
  <p><strong>Tributes have flowed for the former White House butler who died from Covid-19: </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/first-families-pay-tribute-former-white-house-butler-wilson-jerman-dies-covid-19">Wilson Jerman, who has died from Covid-19, aged 91,</a> was a fixture in the White House under 11 presidents. Jerman started working as a cleaner under Dwight Eisenhower and retired as an elevator operator during the presidency of Barack Obama. <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffRBennett">Michelle Obama said:</a> “With his kindness and care, Wilson Jerman helped make the White House a home for decades of first families, including ours.”</p>

  <h2>Australian state of New South Wales announces easing of restrictions</h2> 
  <p>The leader of Australia’s most populous state has announced that restrictions imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus will be eased to allow cafes and restaurants to have up to 50 patrons from 1 June.</p> 
  <p>The premier of the state of New South Wales (NSW), Gladys Berejiklian, said the easing of restrictions, which currently limit restaurants and cafes to 10 patrons, was needed to revive the local economy.</p> 
  <p>“Losing 221,000 jobs in April was a disaster. We don’t want to see that continue,” Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.</p> 
  <p>Australia’s hospitality industry has been one of the hardest hit by social distancing restrictions imposed in March to slow the spread of coronavirus.</p> 
  <p>Nationally, nearly 600,000 people were in April forced out of work by the restrictions. </p> 
  <p>Berejiklian said that restrictions would still be in place, including limits of 10 people for single bookings, enforced social distancing between tables, no mingling of patrons, and customers at pubs required to sit at tables.</p> 
  <p>Australia has had remarkable success in flattening the curve of infections from the coronavirus. The country of 25m has recorded 101 deaths and just over 7,000 cases. The country is consistently recording fewer than 20 new cases a day.</p>

  <p>Among those imagining a new world post-coronavirus is the technical director of the French secret service, who has said the DGSE wants to recruit geeks rather than budding young James Bonds.</p> 
  <p>In rare public comments, Patrick Pailloux said there was a danger that many young tech-savvy French people did not consider themselves suitable for the stereotypes of France’s directorate-general for external security (DGSE), but that needed to change as France adapts to new demands in the post-coronavirus world.</p> 
  <p>“We need people who are very connected to new technologies – thus young people,” Pailloux told Agence France-Presse. “We have to bring them into the DGSE, it’s essential.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>After weeks of insisting the Washington DC area is not ready to end restrictions, the mayor, Muriel Bowser, has said the numbers are pointing to the start of a gradual reopening process at the end of the month. </p> 
  <p>Bowser has set Friday, 29 May, as a potential start date for phase 1 of the District of Columbia’s proposed three-phase reopening plan. That includes restaurants allowing outdoor seating, non-essential businesses offering curb-side pickup and hair salons and barbers operating by appointment at limited capacity.</p> 
  <p>Bowser emphasised the gradual nature of the process and warned residents not to expect the lives they had in February to return in full any time soon.</p> 
  <p>“Let’s be clear on what this is and what this isn’t,” Bowser said. “This is not an on-off switch.”<br></p> 
  <p>Bowser had previously set the nations capital on a timeline that would have it beginning to reopen on June 8 at the earliest. That’s later than most jurisdictions around the country and a stark contrast to the sense of urgency to reopen coming from the White House. </p>

  <p>More on the announcements coming out of China’s National People’s Congress. Ahead of the meeting, which is largely rubber-stamp parliament, China’s top leaders promised to step up stimulus to bolster the virus-ravaged economy amid rising worries that job losses could threaten social stability. </p> 
  <p>In addition to targeting a 2020 budget deficit of at least 3.6% of GDP, above last year’s 2.8%, and fixed the quota on local-government special bond issuance at 3.75 trillion yuan ($527 billion), up from 2.15 trillion yuan, China will also issue 1 trillion yuan in special treasury bonds for the first time this year. </p> 
  <p>Local government bonds could be mainly used to fund infrastructure projects, while special treasury bonds could be used to support firms and regions hit by the coronavirus outbreak, for subsidies to spur consumption or for boosting the capital structure of small banks, analysts say. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">China abandons GDP target for first time</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>China has taken the rare move of not setting an annual GDP target this year after the coronavirus battered the world’s second-largest economy and ravaged global growth, Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday.</p> 
  <p>It is the first time that China has not set target since the government began publishing such goals in 1990. </p> 
  <p>Instead, given “great uncertainty” caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Beijing will “give priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards”, Li told the opening of the National People’s Congress.</p> 
  <p>He also announced that China’s fiscal deficit was expected to be over 3.6% of gross domestic product this year, with a deficit increase of one trillion yuan ($140bn) over last year.</p> 
  <p>Another one trillion yuan of government bonds will be issued for Covid-19 control, he added, calling these “extraordinary measures for an unusual time”. </p> 
  <p>He also said governments at all levels should “tighten their belts”, and that all types of surplus, idle and carryover funds will be withdrawn and re-allocated, to be put to better use.</p> 
  <p>It is the first time since 1990 officials have decided not to issue a numerical growth target, which is typically seen as a signal of the resources leaders are willing to spend to shore up the economy.</p> 
  <p>China’s economy contracted 6.8% in the first quarter, compared to a year earlier.</p> 
  <p>At the annual meeting, Li said China would work with the US to implement phase one of the trade deal, which was struck before the pandemic was declared. He said China would safeguard multilateral trade and advance free-trade agreement talks with Japan and South Korea.</p> 
  <p>Li also reiterated China’s policy on Taiwan, which has been the subject of discussion this week due to Taiwan being excluded from the World Health Assembly. Li said Beijing will firmly safeguard China’s sovereignty, security and development interests, and would encourage Taiwan’s people to oppose independence for Taiwan. </p>

  <p>Heathrow Airport has proposed Britain should set up “travel bubbles” with low-risk countries exempt from the requirement. </p>

  <p>Birmingham said Australia has no plans to open its borders to non-citizens, while all returning locals will still have to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival. </p> 
  <p>Australia has recorded just over 7,000 cases, with 101 deaths. The country hopes to reopen the economy fully by July. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Russia’s industrial output fell by 6.6% in April compared to the previous year, dampened by the country’s coronavirus lockdown, the state statistics agency said Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Russia imposed a “non-working” period across the country at the end of April which “served as the decisive factor in lowering industrial output,” Rosstat said in a statement.</p> 
  <p>Industries were delivered a double blow as President Vladimir Putin ordered companies to stop work activities but continue paying salaries.</p> 
  <p>At the same time, “consumer demand fell for a range of goods and services,” the agency said.</p> 
  <p>However it reported a surge in demand for some products, including food, household products and laptops, sought as people began telecommuting.</p> 
  <p>Russia’s commodities sector only decreased by 3.2% year-on-year, and oil production actually grew by 0.2%, the agency said, noting that for many of those companies ceasing activity was not possible.</p> 
  <p>The Russian economy has already been battered by low prices of oil, a key export shaken by a price war with Saudi Arabia in March which sent the Russian ruble tumbling.</p> 
  <p>Pharmaceutical industries showed growth of 13.5% year on year, while the automotive sector was the worst-hit, plummeting by 79.2%.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump declines to wear mask, calls for churches to open</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It’s been another controversial day in the US for President Trump, who visited a Ford plant in the crucial battle state of Michigan. </p> 
  <p>Trump toured the Ford plant, which has been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment, without wearing a face mask in front of TV cameras. This was despite Ford on Tuesday reiterating its policy that all visitors must wear them. </p> 
  <p>Surrounded by Ford executives who were wearing masks, Trump told reporters he had put one on out of the view of cameras, </p> 
  <p>“I had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,” Trump said. </p>

  <p>When asked if Trump was told it was acceptable not to wear a mask in the plant, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said, “It’s up to him.” <br></p> 
  <p>“Honestly I think I look better in a mask,” Trump added jokingly. </p> 
  <p>Trump has been highly critical of the state’s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer, who is seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for Joe Biden. </p> 
  <p>On Thursday the president called for churches to reopen and said guidelines on that should be issued soon. </p> 
  <p>Guardian US’s Joanna Walters says it looks like the president is putting pressure on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue guidelines of some kind that will indicate it’s okay to restart in-person services.</p> 
  <p>Walters says Trump made an eyebrow-raising statement a little earlier when he told a gathering of African American leaders: “We are opening our churches again. I think the CDC is going to put something out very soon, spoke to them today. I think they are going to put something out very soon. We got to open our churches.”</p> 
  <p>The president said the guidance was expected today or tomorrow. “I said you better put it out and they’re doing it and they’re going to be issuing something today or tomorrow and churches are going to get our churches open,” Trump said.</p> 
  <p>Leading federal public health officials have repeatedly urged caution about easing social distancing restrictions, warning it could cause a surge in coronavirus infections. </p>

  <p>Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s ongoing live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> 
  <p>Donald Trump has promised that he is working on plans to allow churches to hold Sunday services again, and<strong> </strong>“you’re going to see something come out very soon”. He made his remarks at a Ford factory in Michigan, where he did not wear a mask, despite, the state’s attorney general writing an open letter to him yesterday saying the president had “not only a legal responsibility, but also a social and moral responsibility” to wear a mask during his tour. Trump has locked horns with Michigan’s Democratic governor Gretchen Whitmer, over the states lockdown rules and restrictions. </p>
