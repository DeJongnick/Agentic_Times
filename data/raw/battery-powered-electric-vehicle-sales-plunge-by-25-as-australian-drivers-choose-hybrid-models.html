<p>Battery-powered electric vehicle sales fell sharply last quarter and may have temporarily peaked as consumers turn to hybrid models that attract tax concessions, according to new analysis.</p> <p>Quarterly vehicle sales data released by the Australian Automobile Association on Monday reveals petrol-powered cars continued to decline in popularity, with sales falling by 9.16% in the three months to 30 September.</p> <p>During this same period, electric vehicle sales declined by 25% from 25,353 to 18,990, with market share falling from 8.10% to 6.57% – the lowest since 2022.</p> <p>According to the AAA, hybrid sales increased from 46,727 to 48,282 – a 3.3% jump to a total 16.70% market share. While plug-in hybrids – which have a battery that can be charged externally to limit reliance on petrol – increased by 56%, taking the market share to 2.5%.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>“There have been significant quarterly fluctuations over the past seven quarters, but sales figures over that period confirm a clear trend of growth for hybrids, while battery electric vehicle market share appears to have peaked for now,” the AAA analysis said.</p> <p>“In the first half of 2023, battery electric vehicles outsold hybrids, but since then hybrids have outsold battery electric vehicles in five consecutive quarters.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/10/ukraine-russia-drone-attacks-moscow-war">Moscow targeted as Ukraine and Russia trade large drone attacks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Hybrids are now outselling battery electric vehicles even in the ACT, which has long been Australia’s strongest market.”</p> <p>The analysis noted plug-in hybrids were exempt from fringe benefits tax until 1 April 2025, which could save consumers thousands of dollars on new cars under a novated lease.</p> <p>“Many jurisdictions still offer stamp duty and registration discounts for battery electric vehicles, but government rebates for [these] purchases have now ceased in all states and territories, except Western Australia,” it said.</p> <p>“That state had the lowest September 2024 quarter decline in battery electric vehicle market share among all jurisdictions (-0.58% compared to -1.53% nationally).”</p> <p>The analysis found medium SUVs remained the most popular cars on the market with 73,111 sold in the third quarter. Half of these sales were petrol-powered cars, almost a third were hybrids, 8% were plug-in hybrids and another 8% were electric.</p> <p>More than 99% of utes sold during the three-month period were petrol-powered, as were 98% of vans. But the share of petrol-powered people mover sales dropped from 97.6% to 89.1%, thanks to new models.</p> <p>“After releasing a hybrid model in mid-2024, Kia accounted for the bulk of September quarter hybrid people mover sales,” the AAA report said. “Lexus also offers a hybrid people mover (released in December 2023) but this is a low-selling luxury model.”</p> <p>In September, the cheapest electric vehicle on the market was $31,000, after MG cut the price of its entry-level MG4 hatchback.</p> <p>At the time, Polestar Australia’s managing director, Scott Maynard, said Australia’s high-end electric car market was restrained by the 33% tax on high-end cars and greater competition could be unlocked if the federal government removed it.</p> <p>Aman Gaur, head of legal, policy and advocacy at the Electric Vehicle Council, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/05/australians-shunning-petrol-powered-cars-for-hybrid-vehicles-as-bowser-prices-rise">has said he expects sales</a> of purely battery electric vehicles to rise once the federal government’s new vehicle efficiency standard begins to influence the market from next year, which should boost local supply.</p>
