<p>Good afternoon. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/08/rba-interest-rates-reserve-bank-australia-cash-rate-meeting-july">Reserve Bank of Australia has held rates at 3.85%,</a> in a surprise decision that denies further mortgage relief for millions of Australian households. The decision came as a shock to financial markets and a large majority of experts who were sure the RBA board would cut interest rates for a second straight meeting.</p> 
<p>Explaining why the bank did not follow through with market expectations of a 0.25% cut, the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, said economic conditions “remain uncertain” and its board was waiting to confirm whether inflation was still on track to reach 2.5%. For the first time in the bank’s history, the monetary policy board’s votes on the cash rate decision <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jul/08/anthony-albanese-tariffs-trump-east-melbourne-synagogue-bobdi-junction-nine-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-686ca8f88f089731c616e0af#block-686ca8f88f089731c616e0af">were made public</a>, which revealed three of the nine members voted to cut rates today.</p> 
<p>The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jul/08/anthony-albanese-tariffs-trump-east-melbourne-synagogue-bobdi-junction-nine-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-686ca2938f0833eb852108b1#block-686ca2938f0833eb852108b1">said the RBA decision was</a> “not the result millions of Australians were hoping for or what the market was expecting”.</p>

<p>“Even small gaps can be an escape route for a determined dog.” – Lara Shannon</p> 
<p>The dog behaviourist and TV presenter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jul/08/anthony-albanese-tariffs-trump-east-melbourne-synagogue-bobdi-junction-nine-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-686c7da18f08aadc85ad05a4#block-686c7da18f08aadc85ad05a4">has teamed up with the owners </a>of world-famous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/25/valerie-the-dachshund-is-found-safe-and-well-after-529-days-on-the-run-on-south-australian-island">formerly missing dachshund</a> Valerie, who is now raising awareness for National Lost Pet Prevention Month.

Cook said WA’s gas reservation policy, which requires offshore producers set aside 15% of supplies for local users, has resulted in cheaper gas for households and business since it was introduced in 2006.</p>
