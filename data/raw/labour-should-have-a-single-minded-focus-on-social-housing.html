<p>John Harris is absolutely right (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/18/labour-mess-starmer-turn-things-round-panel-part-one">Labour is in a mess. Is there anything Starmer can do to turn things around? Our panel responds, 18 September</a>).</p> <p>The government should stop trying to do everything and concentrate on&nbsp;building social housing for rent&nbsp;with an urgency to&nbsp;match the effort after the second&nbsp;world war.</p> <p>Forget meddling with the private&nbsp;market. Get good-quality factory-built housing up fast, so people can bring their kids up in secure rented homes.</p> <p>Let that tell the story of what Labour government means. It will do the job better than a thousand vague slogans about GP appointments, school meals and&nbsp;nurseries. You can show pictures of&nbsp;houses.<br><strong>Caroline Mozley</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>• “Imagine two or three Labour MPs with different takes, arguing things out at length on YouTube,” says Alan Finlayson (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/19/labour-save-itself-from-disaster-keir-starmer-panel-part-two">Is there anything Labour can do to save itself from disaster? Our panel responds – part two, 19 September</a>). But why just imagine? Look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zBFh6bpcMo&amp;t=1232s">Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn slugging it out in 1975</a>. As Finlayson says, confrontations like this “invite audiences to think for themselves and communicate an image of life beyond desiccated managerialism”. Today’s Labour should welcome such debates.<br><strong>Ken Guy</strong><br><em>Shoreham-by-Sea, West Sussex</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
