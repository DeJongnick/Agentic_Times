<p>Donald Trump gave a rambling, freewheeling address at the Charlie Kirk memorial in Arizona on Sunday, taking aim at Joe Biden and trailing a major announcement on autism as well as praising Kirk, who was shot dead on 10 September.</p> <p>In front of a crowd of tens of thousands, Trump said Kirk was a “great American hero” and “martyr” for freedom. During the event he sat side-by-side with billionaire Elon Musk, a once trusted adviser with whom the US president had a spectacular public falling out.</p> <p>He frequently veered into topics entirely unrelated to Kirk, discussing his use of federal forces to police cities and taking a moment to promote an announcement at the White House on Monday.</p> <p>Here are the key stories at a glance.</p>  <h2>Trump says ‘I hate my opponents’ at Kirk memorial </h2>  <p>Trump’s remarks were an awkward mix of eulogy and campaign speech, during which he frequently veered away from reading somber remarks about Kirk’s life and violent death to make offhand comments and jokes.</p> <p>“He did not hate his opponents, he wanted the best for them,” Trump said, before breaking from his prepared remarks to add: “That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponents, and I don’t want the best for them, I’m sorry.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/thousands-gather-at-charlie-kirk-memorial-in-arizona-where-trump-to-pay-tribute-to-slain-organizer"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Erika Kirk says she forgives shooter </h2>  <p>During an emotional address at his public memorial in Glendale, Arizona, the widow of rightwing youth organizer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">Charlie Kirk</a> said she forgives the man charged with killing her husband.</p> <p>“My husband, he wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life,” Erika Kirk said, before an at-capacity crowd. “That man, that young man – I forgive him. I forgive him because it was what Christ did, and it is what Charlie would do.”</p> <p>Those in the stadium rose to their feet in applause.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/erika-kirk-charlie-kirk-killing"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Kirk memorial mixes rally and revival as mourners vow to spread Maga message</h2>  <p>Lauren Gambino was at the memorial and writes: The memorial was part spiritual revival and part political rally … Mourners obliged the red, white and blue “Sunday best” dress code, filling the at-capacity venue with stars, stripes and Maga hats …</p> <p>As the afternoon wore on, the speeches became sharper and more political – a battle cry that implored the government officials present to be aggressive in “wielding the sword against evil”. There were only a handful of explicit references to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> and the left – but many speeches mixed personal remembrances of Kirk with a searing vilification of his ideological opponents.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/charlie-kirk-memorial-arizona-dispatch"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Analysis - Vance speech at Kirk memorial has an eye on 2028 </h2>  <p>David Smith writes that JD Vance’s appearance at the event comes as he methodically builds a profile that blends Trump’s populist bombast with a sharper focus on economic nationalism and cultural warfare.</p> <p>Smith writes: Vance’s presidential campaign for 2028 is already said to be <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/17/behind-the-curtain-gop-future-foretold">in “soft launch” mode</a> as he positions himself as the frontrunner for the Republican nomination. He has reportedly expressed a desire for Susie Wiles, the White House of chief staff, to manage his potential campaign.</p> <p>His most overt move came in March, when he was appointed finance chair of the Republican National Committee – a role unprecedented for a sitting vice-president. It positions him at the nexus of Republican money, allowing frequent interactions with mega-donors.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/jd-vance-charlie-kirk-analysis"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump officials reportedly set to tie Tylenol to autism risk</h2>  <p>Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">administration</a> is on Monday expected to tie pregnant women’s use of the popular medicine Tylenol – known as paracetamol elsewhere in the world – to a risk of autism, contrary to medical guidelines, the Washington Post has reported.</p> <p>Trump officials are also expected to announce an effort to explore how the drug leucovorin could purportedly and potentially treat autism, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/21/trump-autism-announcement-tylenol-leucovorin/">Post</a> report published Sunday, which cited four sources with knowledge of the plans who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement had not been made.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/trump-officials-tylenol-autism"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump says Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch likely part of US TikTok deal</h2>  <p>Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch will probably be involved in the effort to<strong> </strong>buy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok">TikTok</a> in the US, Donald Trump said in an interview on Sunday.</p> <p>The president was asked about the status of the sale of the app during an interview with Peter Doocy on The Sunday Briefing on Fox News.
