<p>The former immunizations director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned of the future of American health under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/rfk-resign-cdc-susan-monarez-fired">leadership</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>.</p> <p>In an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/former-cdc-immunizations-chief-harm-coming-rfk-jr/story?id=125134748">interview</a> on Sunday with ABC, Demetre Daskalakis – who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-rally-staffers-protest">resigned</a> this week in protest over the White House’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-administration-news-today-latest">firing</a> of CDC director Susan Monarez – said: “From my vantage point as a doctor who’s taken the Hippocratic Oath, I only see harm coming.”</p> <p>He went on to add: “I may be wrong, but based on what I’m seeing, based on what I’ve heard with the new members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, or ACIP, they’re really moving in an ideological direction where they want to see the undoing of vaccination.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-leaders-quit-susan-monarez-firing">CDC in crisis: who are the top officials resigning or being forced out?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Daskalakis’s interview comes amid growing chaos across US health agencies and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-susan-monarez-cdc-firing-reaction">rare bipartisan pushback</a> towards the White House’s firing of Monarez, which came amid steep budget cuts to the CDC’s work as well as growing concerns of political interference.</p> <p>There have also been growing public calls for Kennedy to resign, particularly as he has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/rfk-jr-health-claims-cdc-leadership">continued to make</a> questionable medical and health claims – and be lambasted in response by experts and lawmakers alike.</p> <p>Explaining his resignation, Daskalakis said: “I didn’t think that we were going to be able to present science in a way free of ideology, that the firewall between science and ideology has completely broken down. And not having a scientific leader at CDC meant that we wouldn’t be able to have the necessary diplomacy and connection with HHS to be able to really execute on good public health.”</p> <p>Daskalakis also criticized Kennedy’s recent changes to the childhood Covid-19 vaccine schedule, noting that the vaccine is currently approved only for people aged 65 and older, as well as for children and adults with underlying health conditions.</p> <p>“That’s not what the data shows. Six months old to two years old, their underlying condition is youth. 53% of those children hospitalized last season had no underlying conditions. The data say that in that age range, you should be vaccinating your child. I understand that not everybody does it, but they have limited access by narrowing that recommendation. Insurance may not cover it,” Daskalakis said.</p> <p>He also cast doubt on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/jim-oneill-cdc-profile">Jim O’Neill</a>, the new CDC chief who was a top aide to Kennedy and has no training in medicine or infectious disease science.</p> <p>In response to whether or not he trusts O’Neill <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/29/health/james-oneill-cdc.html">saying </a>that he is in favor of vaccines, Daskalakis said: “Honestly, I really want to trust it … But based on the very first post that I’ve seen from him on X where he says that CDC scientists manipulated data to be able to follow an ideology or an agenda in the childhood schedule, makes me think that I know what leader he serves, and that leader is one that does not believe in vaccination.”</p> <p>In a Saturday op-ed for the New York Times, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/bernie-sanders-rfk-jr-resign">accused</a> Kennedy of “endangering the health of the American people now and into the future”, adding: “He must resign.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-rally-staffers-protest">CDC officials who quit in protest lead call to ‘get politics out of public health’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since he assumed leadership over the health department, Kennedy – a longtime anti-vaccine advocate – has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/01/trump-health-agency-layoffs-cuts">fired</a> health agency workers and entertained <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jun/12/chemtrails-rfk-jr-truth-behind-conspiracy-theory">conspiracy theories</a>. Last week, more than 750 current and former employees at US health agencies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/20/hhs-workers-rfk-jr-violence-cdc">signed a letter</a> in which they criticized Kennedy as an “existential threat to public health”.</p> <p>The health agency workers went on to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/20/hhs-workers-rfk-jr-violence-cdc">accuse</a> the health secretary of being “complicit in dismantling America’s public health infrastructure and endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information”.</p> <p>The letter comes after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/19/father-cdc-shooter-covid-vaccine">deadly shooting</a> at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta earlier this month, when a 30-year-old gunman fired more than 180 rounds into the buildings, killing a police officer before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooter had been struggling with mental health issues and was influenced by misinformation that led him to believe the Covid-19 vaccine was making him sick, according to the gunman’s father.</p>
