According to NBC, the latest cache was found by aides to the president, though details of the documents’ content and how many were found were not available. </p> <p>NBC reports the documents were discovered after the president ordered a search for any other classified documents that may have been taken from the White House when he departed in January 2017 at the end of <strong>Barack Obama</strong>’s presidency.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-63bf1baa8f085fda3e65ce92" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2023-01-11T20:37:40.270Z">8.37pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>At 4 pm, the House is scheduled to vote on a GOP-proposed resolution and bill concerning abortion.</strong></p> <p>But first, the Democrats will try to attach an amendment to the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which is meant to protect babies who survive the procedure. The proposed amendment would “prohibit government restrictions on abortion care,” according to Democratic whip <strong>Katherine Clark</strong>’s office. “This would include any limits to providers’ ability to prescribe certain drugs, offer abortion counseling services via telemedicine, or provide emergency abortion services when a delay would risk the health of the mother.” Republicans are certain to vote this proposal down.</p> <p>The chamber will then consider both the born-alive act and the resolution condemning violence against anti-abortion groups. Clark’s office is encouraging Democrats to vote against both, saying the resolution does not contain “any acknowledgment of violent attacks on providers or facilities that offer abortion care,” and the born alive bill “unnecessarily restates current law requiring a doctor to provide the same standard of medical care for an infant born during an abortion procedure as they would for any other infant.”</p> <p>Republicans have the numbers to pass both, but at this stage, the effort is more about signaling priorities to GOP voters than changing the law. When the born-alive act arrives in the Senate, it is unlikely to be considered by its Democratic leadership.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-63bf18998f08fa7950d4c08c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2023-01-11T20:14:56.246Z">8.14pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The calls for George Santos to resign have spread from county level Republicans to the state party, Politico reports:</strong></p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1613262163853905920">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">INBOX: NY state GOP backs call for Rep.
