<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lego">Lego</a> has cut diversity terminology from its annual sustainability report despite trumpeting the recent addition of “diverse” characters to make its toys more “inclusive”.</p> <p>Most recently the world’s biggest toymaker introduced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/dec/03/lego-introduces-characters-wearing-hidden-disability-sunflower-lanyard">sets featuring characters with sunflower lanyards</a>, which are <a href="https://hdsunflower.com/uk/">worn to indicate a hidden disability</a>. At the time its chief diversity and inclusion officer, Lauren von Stackelberg, said the company was embedding diversity and inclusion in everything it did.</p> <p>As part of this mission, Lego has added characters of different skin tones and cultures, as well as physical and non-visible disabilities to its playsets. Figures with limb differences, Down’s syndrome, anxiety and vitiligo have all been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/63594447">warmly received by children</a>.</p> <p>However, despite these efforts, <a href="https://www.lego.com/cdn/cs/sustainability/assets/bltab4c38a57c6b4e8c/LEGO_Group_Sustainability_Statement_2024.pdf">Lego’s 2024 sustainability statement</a> contains no mention of terms such as “diversity”, “LGBTQ+” and “people of colour”, all of which appeared in 2023. The previous document also mentioned “diversity and inclusion” in three places, including in the opening remarks by Lego’s chief executive, Niels Christiansen, but the phrase is absent from the latest release.</p> <p>The 2024 report does discuss gender breakdown at director level, and outlines a target split for 2025 of 57% male/43% female (building on 2024 levels of 57.9%/41.9%). But for the first time it also makes a point of saying “appointments are made on merit”, echoing language used by the US government.</p>    <p>The shift in tone from the Danish company is seemingly the latest example of the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-us-trump-google-amazon-walmart">crackdown on diversity initiatives</a> having an effect in Europe. Several companies across the EU have reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/31/politicians-criticise-us-efforts-to-make-eu-firms-reverse-diversity-initiatives">received letters from US representatives</a> telling them that the rollback applies to firms around the world looking to do business with the States.</p> <p>Asked about the altered language, Lego said it remained fully committed to its diversity and inclusion initiatives. The <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/sustainability/diversity-and-inclusion?CMP=AFC-AffiliateUK-US9P%2F9RI%2FvA-2860710-1539294-10&amp;locale=en-gb&amp;consent-modal=show">diversity page on the Lego Group’s website</a> is also still live.</p> <p>A Lego spokesperson said: “Every year we review and adapt our reporting to ensure it complies with latest requirements and reflects our plans and results. The 2024 sustainability statement does not represent a change in our ongoing approach to diversity and inclusion.”</p> <p>Louise Eldridge, the head of good work at thecampaign group ShareAction, said removing references to diversity and inclusion from company reports sent a “concerning signal to investors”.</p> <p>She aded: “Removing unfair barriers that prevent disadvantaged groups from competing on a level playing field is a good thing for workers and for businesses.</p> <p>“At this critical juncture, companies must make it clear to investors and their customers that they remain committed to tackling unfairness and inequity in the workplace. Now is not the time to step back.”</p>
