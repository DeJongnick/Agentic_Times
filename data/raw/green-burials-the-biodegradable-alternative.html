<p>For those who find the idea of burning their deceased friend’s body distasteful (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/23/the-delivery-man-arrived-with-the-ashes-in-a-gift-bag-why-are-so-many-people-opting-out-of-traditional-funerals">‘The delivery man arrived with the ashes in a gift bag’ – why are so many people opting out of traditional funerals?, 23 July</a>), an alternative to direct cremation is a green burial, which costs more but not excessively so. Here, the grave is not permanent, and everything that goes in it has to be biodegradable – this rules out embalming. Coffins must be made of cardboard or untreated wood – woven willow is becoming very popular. No permanent memorial is allowed, but usually a wooden plaque can be added, which will last for several years if oiled. Natural wildflowers can often be planted, but vases cannot be used. Woodland burial sites often have a pavilion that can be used for a parting ceremony.</p> <p>A grave will presumably last for several years before being reused – long enough for friends and relatives to visit, until memory fades.<br><strong>Tim Gossling</strong><br><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
