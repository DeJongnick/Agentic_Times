<p>While the chief executive of Eli Lilly may lament the UK’s drug prices (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/24/uk-is-worst-country-in-europe-for-drug-prices-says-mounjaro-maker-eli-lilly">UK is ‘worst country in Europe’ for drug prices, says Mounjaro maker, 24 September</a>), the NHS should celebrate them. The system put in place for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new drugs is respected the world over and is successful in applying the principle that funding a new product should not damage the NHS as a whole. This principle of cost-effectiveness has led to widespread price reductions for the NHS that have allowed the service as a whole to benefit.</p> <p>The chief executive of Eli Lilly links the recent pausing or cancelling of pharmaceutical industry investments in the UK to drug pricing here, when these are down to&nbsp;the drug companies’ desperation to kowtow to Donald Trump. </p> <p>Further to this, the talk of increasing Nice’s cost-effectiveness threshold, and even index-linking this, is a disgrace (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/08/nhs-could-pay-25-more-for-medicines-under-plan-to-end-row-with-drugmakers-and-trump">NHS could pay 25% more for medicines under plan to end row with drugmakers and Trump, 8 October</a>). The threshold is not a price that we should increase every year; it is a measure of opportunity cost. It measures what health improvements in the wider NHS we miss out on when we invest more in a new service or drug. If a new drug doesn’t generate more “health” than that which it displaces, the NHS as a whole is worse off. The rate of displacement&nbsp;doesn’t directly&nbsp;change with inflation. Linking the two is nonsense.<br><strong>Simon Dixon</strong><br><em>Former professor of health economics, University of Sheffield</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
