<p>A seventh person has died from injuries suffered during <a href="http://theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/mississippi-leland-shooting-arrests">the mass shooting in Leland, Mississippi,</a> on 10 October, according to officials.</p> <p>Ebanee Williams, 25, died on 17 October at the University of Mississippi medical center, as the local news outlet WLBT.com <a href="https://www.wlbt.com/2025/10/18/seventh-person-dies-leland-shooting/">reported</a>. Sixteen people were reportedly shot in the case, which unfolded in downtown Leland hours after a homecoming high school football game.</p> <p>The Leland shooting was one of at least 14 mass killings in the US so far in 2025, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=14th+mass+murder+in+the+US+2025&amp;oq=14th+mass+murder+in+the+US+2025&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORigATIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRigAdIBCDM3NTVqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">according to the Associated Press</a>. Such killings are generally defined as ones with four or more victims.</p> <p>The killings in Leland also occurred among more than 400 mass shootings in the US for the year as of Monday, according to the Mass Shooting Tracker. The resources <a href="https://massshootingtracker.site/">describes</a> mass shootings as “a single outburst of violence in which four or more people are shot”.</p> <p>Perennially high numbers of mass shootings in the US have prompted many to call on Congress to provide more substantial gun control. But Congress has largely been unable or unwilling to heed such calls.</p> <p>The six other victims who died in Leland during the 10 October mass murder include Oreshama Johnson, 41; Calvin Plant, 19; Shelbyona Powell, 25; Kaslyn Johnson, 18; Amos Brantley Jr, 18; and JaMichael Jones, 34, WLBT said.</p> <p>As of 18 October, nine people have been arrested in relation to the shooting, according to WLBT. While the motive for the violence remains unclear, authorities said that it might have stemmed from a dispute.</p> <p>“It appears the incident was sparked by a disagreement among several individuals,” the FBI’s Jackson, Mississippi, office <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/jackson/news/fbi-establishes-digital-media-tips-website-in-support-of-the-leland-mississippi-mass-shooting-investigation">said</a> in a statement. “This incident remains under investigation by local law enforcement, and the FBI is providing federal assistance in this investigation.”</p> <p>Several of those arrested are facing capital murder charges. The FBI has requested that any members of the public with information contact them.</p> <p>“It was the most horrific scene I’d ever seen,” witness Camish Hopkins <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/mississippi-leland-shooting-arrests">told the Associated Press</a>. Hopkins recalled witnessing four people dead, on the ground, and survivors who were wounded and bleeding.</p>
