<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/illinois">Illinois</a>’s governor JB Pritzker has called on “all to stand up” to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> as the US president prepares to launch a federally led immigration crackdown across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago">Chicago</a>, a plan which has been met with widespread <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/25/trump-national-guard-chicago-democrats">backlash</a> from local leaders and the public.</p> <p>Pritzker’s comments come as White House officials vow to target Chicago next in its sweeping immigration crackdowns across the country. Recently, the White House <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/trump-administration-military-base-chicago">requested</a> that a US military base on the outskirts of Chicago assist with immigration operations as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> plans a broader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-washington-dc-democrat-cities-analysis">takeover</a> of Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”.</p> <p>Pritzker, a Democrat, told CBS on Sunday: “Any kind of troops on the streets of an American city don’t belong unless there is an insurrection, unless there is truly an emergency. There is not … I’m going to do everything I can to stop him from taking away people’s rights and from using the military to invade states. I think it’s very important for us all to stand up.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/chicago-mayor-executive-order-trump-immigration-raids">Chicago mayor signs executive order directing city to resist Trump’s immigration raids</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pritzker spoke after Trump on Saturday took to Truth Social to rant about Pritzker and Chicago, saying: “JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming!”</p> <p>Meanwhile, Pritzker said that no one from the Trump administration has contacted his team, the city of Chicago or any other local officials.</p> <p>In his interview with CBS, he said: “It’s clear that they’re secretly planning this. If they actually send in US troops, it would amount to an invasion. They should be coordinating with local law enforcement, telling us when and where they’re coming, and whether it’s Ice, ATF, or another agency. But they’re not doing that. And I have to say, it’s disruptive and dangerous. It stirs up tension on the ground when we’re left in the dark and can’t coordinate with them.”</p> <p>Pritzker also pushed back against accusations from Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, who said that Illinois “refuses to have our back”.</p> <p>“That’s not true,” he said, adding: “There were police officers who made sure that there was nobody interfering or attacking or causing problems for the Ice officials that were here … People have a right to their first amendment … and we protect that too in the city of Chicago … We have our job, which is to fight violent crime on the streets of our city and by the way, we’re succeeding at that job, but when they bring people in and don’t coordinate with us, they’re going to cause enormous problems.”</p> <p>Pritzker continued: “If he wants to send troops, he should call. I’ve been very clear about what it is that we’d like help with. But, instead, he’s talking about sending troops. Nobody’s called, literally nobody from the White House … If they actually wanted to help, they might call and say, what help do you need? … I don’t know why they haven’t bothered to reach out if they have plans of their own, but honestly, we’d be happy to receive a call.”</p> <p>The governor also accused Trump of having “other aims, other than fighting crime”, pointing out the handful of Democratic cities that have been the target of Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jul/23/trump-ice-data-deportations-detention">immigration crackdowns</a>, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/25/washington-dc-daycare-workers-parents-immigration-raids">Washington DC</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/los-angeles-ice-patrols-union-del-barrio-immigration">Los Angeles</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/trump-administration-military-base-chicago">White House seeks to use Chicago-area military base for ‘sanctuary cities’ crackdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“The other aims are that he’d like to stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections. He’ll just claim that there’s some problem with an election, and then he’s got troops on the ground that can take control if, in fact, he’s allowed to do this. We have sovereignty,” Pritzker said.</p> <p>With an imminent federal crackdown in Chicago expected to take place as soon as the end of this week, Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/30/chicago-mayor-executive-order-trump-immigration-raids">signed</a> an executive order on Saturday in an effort to push back against the White House’s “out of control” plan to deploy federal troops into the city.</p> <p>The new order bars Chicago police from aiding federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or related patrols, as well as traffic stops and checkpoints during the crackdown.</p> <p>Johnson also ordered all city departments to protect the constitutional rights of the city’s residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or national guard deployment by the federal government”.</p>
