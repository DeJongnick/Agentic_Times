<p>Buried in Justice Darryl Rangiah’s 185-page judgment that found the ABC breached the Fair Work Act in its termination of Antoinette Lattouf is a critical assessment of the behaviour of the broadcaster’s top management, including former chair Ita Buttrose.</p> 
<p>Four of the key figures in Lattouf’s removal– Buttrose, the then managing director, David Anderson, former content chief Chris Oliver-Taylor and Sydney radio manager Steve Ahern – have since left the ABC.</p>

<p>But 18 months ago, they were among senior managers in a “a state of panic” after an “orchestrated campaign by pro-Israel lobbyists to have Ms Lattouf taken off air”, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jun/25/antoinette-lattouf-v-abc-unlawful-termination-case-verdict-federal-court-judgment-ntwnfb">the federal court judge said</a>.</p> 
<p>Rangiah traced every text, email and internal discussion between multiple layers of ABC management in December 2023 and compared them with the evidence they gave in the seven-day trial, lifting the veil on decision-making at the public broadcaster. Some individuals came out better than others.</p> 
<p>Buttrose, <a href="https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2025/2025fca0669">Rangiah said</a>, “made clear her displeasure” at Lattouf’s appointment at the outset, forwarding email complaints from pro-Israel lobbyists to Oliver-Taylor. She demanded to know why an “activist” had been engaged in the first place, putting pressure on Oliver-Taylor to act, Rangiah found.</p> 
<p>He said when Buttrose asked David Anderson: “Why can’t she come down with flu or Covid or a stomach upset?” the chair was expressing her “desire for Ms Lattouf to be taken off air immediately under the pretence of illness”. In the witness box, Buttrose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/15/antoinette-lattouf-v-abc-unlawful-termination-case-takeaways">claimed the expression was “just a face-saving idea”</a>. When it came to her performance under cross-examination, Rangiah was not impressed.</p>

<p>“Ms Buttrose’s evidence under cross-examination was somewhat theatrical and difficult to follow at times,” he said. “She had a strong belief that Ms Lattouf was an activist who should have never been engaged by the ABC and she wanted Ms Lattouf gone as soon as possible.”</p> 
<p>But while Buttrose’s forwarding of complaints about Lattouf placed pressure on Oliver-Taylor, Rangiah said that the chair did “not materially contribute” to the decision to take the journalist off air, finding that this was Oliver-Taylor’s decision alone.</p> 
<p>In his assessment of Oliver-Taylor, Rangiah found some of his evidence about whether Lattouf was given a direction not to post about Gaza was “quite implausible”, ultimately finding that he does “not accept” this evidence and Lattouf was not given a direction.</p>

<p>At issue was whether Lattouf had been given a direction by her manager, Elizabeth Green, not to post on social media or just a suggestion to keep a low profile. Oliver-Taylor claimed in court that there was no difference between asking someone to do something and “directing” them.</p> 
<p>When it came to the former managing director, Rangiah found Anderson “materially contributed” to Oliver-Taylor’s decision to remove Lattouf by “expressing his opinion that Ms Lattouf had antisemitic views” after inspecting her social media accounts.</p> 
<p>Lower down the chain, Rangiah was critical of evidence given by Ahern, as well as radio chief Ben Latimer and editorial adviser Simon Melkman – the latter two for “their lack of recollection” about what was said at a Teams meeting before Lattouf was taken off air.</p> 
<p>“The evidence of Mr Latimer, Mr Ahern and Mr Melkman under cross-examination left me with substantial doubts as to the reliability and credibility of their evidence on controversial matters,” Rangiah said.</p> 
<p>“I reject their evidence asserting that Mr Oliver-Taylor was not informed in the Teams Meeting that Ms Green had not given Ms Lattouf a direction and had only given her advice.”</p> 
<p>The judge was definitive in his assessment of what caused the “panic” on the executive floor and why emails were flying between them.</p>

<p>“Ms Buttrose and Mr Anderson received multiple letters and emails complaining about Ms Lattouf, which sought to pressure the ABC to not employ her and/or terminate her employment for reasons including her political opinion and/or race and/or national extraction,” he found.</p> 
<p>“He [Anderson] considered that it was of critical importance for the ABC to have a high degree of actual and perceived impartiality in relation to the Israel/Gaza war.</p> 
<p>“The complaints, as they developed over the ensuing days, were evidently a coordinated campaign to pressure the ABC into taking Ms Lattouf off air or ceasing to employ her.”</p> 
<p>Of Lattouf’s direct manager, Green, Rangiah was highly complimentary, finding “no doubt about the reliability and accuracy” of her evidence.</p> 
<p>“I accept Ms Green to be a reliable witness and accept her account of all her discussions with Mr Ahern,” he said.</p> 
<p>“In summary, Ms Green made it explicitly clear she had not given any direction to Ms Lattouf and had merely provided advice.”</p>
