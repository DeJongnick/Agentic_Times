<p>I love summer, except for the last part of August, which I find really melancholy. The juice has been squeezed out of summer, the grass sun-faded, holidays in the rear view mirror. I’m happy for September to roll around.</p> <p>With the first cool days come the return of layering, which is when we start to see new styling tricks on the streets. And fashion shows start again soon, with lots of new designers bringing fresh ideas. It’s going to be a fun month.</p> <p>Also, you don’t have to be going back to school to buy yourself a back-to-school treat. Read on for the skirts of the season, the high-street steals of the moment and the zeitgeisty styling tricks to jump on. Sharpened pencils at the ready.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Is it Schiaparelli? No, it’s Mango</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Knitted jacket with jewelled buttons</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://shop.mango.com/gb/en/p/women/sweaters-and-cardigans/knitted-jacket-with-jewel-buttons_17064139" > £59.99 at Mango </a>  <p>Eye-catching, witty buttons have been a signature detail of the house of Schiaparelli for a century. Elsa herself commissioned none other than Alberto Giacometti to make buttons in the shape of birds and figures in the 1930s; current designer Daniel Roseberry fastens his pieces with golden ears, jewelled keyholes or coins. So the five different buttons on this Mango jacket give it a distinct “Paris fashion week” sensibility. Sound the high-street bargain klaxon.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Wearable barrel-leg jeans really do exist</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Authentic barrel-leg jeans</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.whistles.com/product/authentic-barrel-leg-jean-31328.html" > £95 at Whistles </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/high-waisted-barrel-ankle-grazer-jeans/p/clp23030766" > £95 at M&amp;S </a>  <p>I get asked about jeans a lot at the moment. Mostly by women who know that their go-to straight or skinny jeans look old-fashioned, but struggle to find loose-fit versions that look good if you aren’t 19 with giraffe legs.</p> <p>Strong recommend for these Whistles jeans, which I bought recently and am so pleased with. They’re non-stretch – essential for a fit that holds shape – with a definite but not-over-the-top curve silhouette at the hip. By the way, they look cropped on the model, but on 5’5” me they’re a perfect top-of-the-shoe length.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>My favourite summer bracelet</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Bohemian amour bracelet</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://latelier73.com/product/bohemian-amour-bracelet-blue/" > £45 at Atelier </a>  <p>I am a big fan of bracelets and rings: it’s so cheering to catch a glimpse of them while you’re typing or cooking. Earrings and necklaces are lovely too, but you only see those in the mirror, right?</p> <p>I’ve been wearing my L’Atelier 73 bracelet for the past few months. It’s charmingly holiday-ish – the mixed textures, the barrel charm, the colour – but elegant, too. Not just a summer fling, I’m sticking with it to bring a much-needed dash of boho free spirit to hard-working September.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Classic pointelle school socks</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Pointelle-knit socks</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.1274632002.html" > £4.99 at H&amp;M </a>  <p>When Bella Freud welcomed Valentino designer Alessandro Michele on to her podcast recently, he was wearing classic pointelle white ankle socks, and they bonded over how much they love them. I hadn’t thought about them since wearing them at school, but I went straight out and bought some. I’m wearing them today with my dark denim Whistles jeans (see above) and loafers.</p> <p>Socks are very important in fashion right now, so this is an excellent style update for a fiver: Alessandro’s were Valentino, but mine are by H&amp;M. Cautionary note: stick to ankle-length, not knee-high, or the school uniform vibe gets a bit icky.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Ethically sourced, affordable cashmere</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Candy floss long-sleeve </strong><strong>T-shirt</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://jeanandtemple.com/products/long-sleeve-silk-cashmere-t-shirt" > £145 at Jean and Temple </a>  <p>Miranda Waller, founder of small British cashmere brand Jean and Temple, designs her pieces at home in Suffolk. The knitwear is made in a small, family-run factory in Nepal, with oversight of working conditions and animal welfare in the yarn production.</p> <p>A blend of 70% silk with 30% cashmere gives a luxe finish that’s useful all year round and featherlight, so the fabric drapes elegantly with no bulk. I love the Jean and Temple cashmere and silk long-sleeve T-shirt in candy floss pink (it also comes in blue, grey and black).</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Just a friendly reminder that you may want to rethink leggings</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Flared sports leggings</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.1276797007.html" > £27.99 at H&amp;M </a>  <p>Back in March, I wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/mar/07/loosen-up-the-age-of-tight-restrictive-gymwear-is-over">a column about how the cool kids are ditching tight leggings</a> and wearing looser workout gear. </p> <p>Now everyone has caught up, and you can’t move for “death of leggings” think-pieces, but you heard it here first.</p> <p>I’m weaning myself off leggings by moving on to these stretchy flared workout trousers from H&amp;M. They don’t flap around when you’re on the reformer pilates bed, but they have a modern silhouette that helps them pass for “proper” clothing before and after class. H&amp;M Move has had a real glow-up, by the way: good colours and fabrics without the price tags of fancy workout brands.</p> <p>***</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/04/back-to-the-grind-buys-men-women-kids">Got that new term feeling? Here are 29 back-to-the-grind buys to refresh your wardrobe, desk and routine</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>This M&amp;S skirt is a total winner</strong><strong>. You need to buy it immediately</strong></h2>    <p><strong>High-waisted mini</strong><strong>skirt</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/fringe-detail-mini-dress/p/clp60747424" > £50 at M&amp;S </a>  <p>I mean, look at it. All-over tassels, a great length (short but not too short), and a chic off-white colour. And £50 from Marks and Sparks! Snap it up.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>One new belt, two new looks</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Luxury black suede belt</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.peachybelts.co.uk/luxury-black-suede-belt-with-simple-detachable-buckle-width-30mm/" > £80 at Peachy Belts </a>  <p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/feb/07/buckle-up-the-return-of-grown-up-trousers-means-belts-are-back">I declared 2025 to be the year of the belt</a>, and lo, it hath come to pass. A great belt is up there with a good pair of socks as the simple, affordable, wearable style hack of 2025.</p> <p>Zoe Gibson founded Peachy Belts in 2005 and has been selling top-notch (sorry) belts handmade in England from Italian leather ever since. Buckles are detachable, so you can buy one belt with two buckles – for instance, this one comes with a simple silver buckle for day, and you can add a snazzy pearl one for evening. Not cheap, but gorgeous quality to last for ever.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>A great transitional jacket</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Suede-</strong><strong>collar </strong><strong>field </strong><strong>jacket</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cos.com/en-gb/women/womenswear/coatsjackets/jackets/product/suede-collar-field-jacket-brown-1293712001" > £189 at Cos </a>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.1293712001.html" > £189 at H&amp;M </a>  <p>Do not underestimate the usefulness of a between-seasons jacket. There are many, many times when you will need more than a cardi but less than a proper coat. The barn jacket is going to be even bigger this winter than it was last year, and this Cos jacket with a softly waisted silhouette is an elegant take. You can wear this with a chunky knit and cords this autumn, and then over shorts or a dress to festivals next summer.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Fashion prediction: a silk skirt with a lace trim</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Carolina silk skirt</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.thereformation.com/products/carolina-silk-skirt/1317132ALO.html" > £218 at Reformation </a>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.harveynichols.com/reformation/carolina-lace-trimmed-silk-satin-midi-skirt-52082-beig-almond-233380/" > £230 at Harvey Nichols </a>  <p>A while ago, Alexa Chung was wearing a pastel silk skirt with a lace trim on an Instagram post, and I had a “I want one of those now” moment, which to be honest I don’t get all that often any more.</p> <p>Mark my words, this will be one of those everyone-is-wearing-it pieces soon. I’m stalking a couple of past-season Dôen skirts on Vinted, but I’m also bewitched by this silk skirt from Reformation. It comes in lots of colours, but the cherry blossom pink with ivory trim is particularly delicious.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Buttons">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2024/11/20/small-blue-link-embed-nov-24.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
