Actually, the “why not” becomes clear pretty quickly, but you can’t make an action omelette without at least a few characters boldly going where they probably shouldn’t have gone.</p> <p><strong>Thelma</strong><br><em>Out now</em><br>Films starring characters over the age of 90 are few and far between, but step forward Thelma Post (June Squibb), the 93-year-old protagonist of writer-director Josh Margolin’s indie comic caper, in which one woman sets out to retrieve $10,000 she’s been scammed into handing over to fraudsters.</p> <p><strong>Blur: To the End</strong><br><em>Out now</em><br>Damon Albarn, Graham Coxon, Alex James and Dave Rowntree formed one of the more successful acts to emerge from the UK’s 1990s Cool Britannia music scene, and have endured in a way that only a very small number of their contemporaries have managed. A&nbsp;new documentary explores why.</p> <p><strong>Janet Planet</strong><br><em>Out now<br></em>This 1990s-set mother-daughter drama wowed critics at festivals with&nbsp;its subtle take on a parent and child’s relationship in rural western Massachusetts, and announces debut director Annie Baker as a new voice to watch. Starring Julianne Nicholson and Zoe Ziegler. <em>Catherine Bray</em></p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <h2>Going out:<strong> Gigs</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Madeleine Peyroux</strong><br><em>Barbican Hall, London, 21 July</em><br>A great interpreter of poetic lyrics, whether her own or those of Leonard Cohen or Bob Dylan, singer-songwriter Peyroux displays a rare mix of haunting vulnerability and quiet power. This gig highlights her latest album, Let’s Walk. <em>John Fordham</em></p> <p><strong>Latitude</strong><br><em>Henham Park, Suffolk, 25 to 28&nbsp;July</em><br>Famed for its multicoloured sheep, beautiful lakes and woods-based singsongs, Latitude festival regularly offers a stellar musical lineup. This year the headliners include&nbsp;Duran Duran, London Grammar and Kasabian. <em>Michael Cragg</em></p> <p><strong>Bicep</strong><br><em>SWG3, Glasgow, 25 July</em><br>Belfast’s Matt McBriar and Andy Ferguson, AKA Bicep, started the year by launching Chroma – a label, event series and hybrid live-DJ audiovisual show. The latter visual spectacular arrives in Glasgow. Expect a sensory overload unlike anything else. <em>MC</em></p> <p><strong>BBC National Orchestra of Wales</strong> <br><em>Royal Albert Hall, London, </em><em>22 July</em><br>In their first Prom of the summer, the Welsh orchestra and conductor Ryan Bancroft reunite Schoenberg’s early tone poem Pelleas und Melisande with&nbsp;Die Seejungfrau (The Mermaid), Alexander von Zemlinsky’s orchestral fantasy based on Hans Christian Andersen’s fairytale. <em>Andrew Clements</em></p> <h2>***</h2> <h2>Going out:<strong> Art</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Liaqat Rasul</strong><br><em>Tŷ Pawb, Wrexham, to 2 November</em><br>There’s more to the Welsh city Wrexham than a Hollywood-tinged soccer team. Locally born Liaqat Rasul started out working on the market here when he was still at school, before&nbsp;becoming a fashion designer and artist. He looks back in this homecoming exhibition at the city’s innovative cultural space.</p> <p><strong>Paris 1924</strong><br><em>The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, to 3&nbsp;November</em><br>The last time the Olympics were in Paris, the French capital was the centre of modern art. That year, André&nbsp;Breton published the Surrealist Manifesto and Left Bank cafes were full of wild new ideas and artists. This&nbsp;exhibition includes Robert Delaunay’s kaleidoscopic celebrations of light and modernity.</p> <p><strong>Phantom Hymn</strong><br><em>Modern Art, London, to 14 September</em><br>Eerie and troubling images of the human figure haunt this group exhibition by four American and European artists. Michelle Uckotter’s paintings depict women alone in mysterious and sinister settings. Joseph Yaeger specialises in implicitly violent hyperrealist canvases. Michael Ho and Michael E Smith add to the subtle sense of danger.</p> <p><strong>Lina Iris Viktor</strong><br><em>Sir John Soane’s Museum, London, to&nbsp;19 January</em><br>If you’ve never visited this small yet mind-expanding museum then make it a summer treat, for no one leaves without being inspired. Viktor’s exhibition of glistening new works responds to the collection amassed by Soane that spans and summarises world myth. Her global treasures mirror his compendium of sculpture suspended over a crypt. <em>Jonathan Jones</em></p> <h2>***</h2> <h2>Going out:<strong> Stage</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Jessie Cave</strong><br><em>Dance City, Newcastle upon Tyne, 25 July</em><strong><br></strong>Cave’s work epitomises the unboundaried, prolific, staunchly DIY art of the oversharing era. Her new show, An Ecstatic Display, sees her mine her private life in bracingly frank style yet again; topics include monogamy, anxiety and her addiction to giving birth. <em>Rachel Aroesti</em></p> <p><strong>Hotbed festival</strong><br><em>Cambridge Junction, 20 &amp; 21 July</em><br>This small but mighty festival of new writing offers a number of shows about to head on tour, exploring topics from homelessness to the politics of toys. One not to miss is Albatross, Martha Loader’s striking&nbsp;new play about motherhood in the age of climate catastrophe. <em>Kate Wyver</em></p> <p><strong>The Daughters of Róisín</strong><br><em>Lyric theatre, Belfast, 23 to 26 July</em><br>A fallen woman. An archaic attitude. A rallying cry. Inspired by her great-grandmother, Aoibh Johnson’s one-woman play explores state-sanctioned abuse against Irish women who get pregnant out of&nbsp;wedlock. <em>KW</em></p> <p><strong>Northern Rascals</strong><br><em>Square Chapel Arts Centre, Halifax, 25 to 28 July</em><br>An exciting young dance-theatre company based in Yorkshire, Northern Rascals’ new show, Reviving Her, uses the real voices of young women to reflect on the journeys women today make through their lives. <em>Lyndsey Winship</em></p>    <h2>Staying in: <strong>Streaming</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Time Bandits</strong><br><em>Apple TV+, 24 July</em><br>What We Do in the Shadows’ Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement reunite (alongside The Inbetweeners writer Iain Morris) for this reboot of the 1981 Terry Gilliam fantasy film. Telling the story of&nbsp;a boy who embarks on a multi-dimensional adventure with a gaggle of thieves, this TV version boasts Lisa Kudrow as the gang’s leader.</p> <p><strong>The Decameron</strong><br><em>Netflix, 25 July</em><br>Boccaccio’s 14th-century story collection – whose framing device involves a group of hedonistic nobles sheltering from the Black Death near Florence – is the latest vintage material to get turned into an irreverently titillating series. Yet the cast for this one is a cut above, with Zosia Mamet, Tony Hale and Saoirse-Monica Jackson.</p> <p><strong>Hell Jumper</strong><br><em>BBC Two &amp; iPlayer, 24 July, 9pm</em><br>The conflict in Ukraine has been dubbed the first social media war; this documentary captures its confluence of technology and nightmarish reality. Collated from the first-person footage, voice notes and texts of volunteer “evacuators”, it centres on 28-year-old Chris Parry from Cornwall, who lost his life attempting to rescue civilians.</p> <p><strong>Linford</strong><br><em>BBC One &amp; iPlayer, 25 July, 8.30pm</em><br>Before 2024 Olympics coverage takes over the TV schedules, take a trip down memory lane with one of our most iconic athletes – that’s Linford Christie, for anyone under 30 – as he revisits the triumphs and the trials of&nbsp;his astonishing career. <em>RA</em></p> <h2>***</h2> <h2>Staying in: <strong>Games</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of&nbsp;the Goddess</strong><br><em>PC, Xbox, PS4/5, out now</em><br>Protect a dancing priestess from hell-sent demons as she&nbsp;purifies a&nbsp;mountain in this strange but fascinating combination of Japanese&nbsp;action and&nbsp;tower-defence.<br><strong>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</strong><br><em>PC, PS4/5, Nintendo Switch, out 25 July</em><br>Whenever you move your cute little runaway character in this comic-book RPG, the whole world moves with&nbsp;them, like a complex sliding-block puzzle. You have to think twice (or thrice) about how to get where you want to go.<br><em>Keza MacDonald</em></p> <h2>***</h2> <h2>Staying in: <strong>Albums</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Glass Animals – I Love You So Fucking Much</strong> <br><em>Out now</em><br>Looking to shake off their one-hit wonder tag – 2020’s US chart-topper Heat Waves has hit a staggering 3bn Spotify streams – the Oxford four-piece return with this fourth studio album. Produced by frontman Dave Bayley, lead single A Tear in Space (Airlock) continues their penchant for earworm electropop.</p> <p><strong>Lava La Rue – Starface </strong><br><em>Out now</em><br>The London-based singer-songwriter, rapper and activist unleashes their long-awaited debut, a sci-fi concept album starring the titular character. Billed as a lesbian Ziggy Stardust, Starface has been sent to Earth to study, and save, humanity, as&nbsp;outlined&nbsp;on the elegantly scuffed‑up pop of Humanity.</p> <p><strong>Childish Gambino – Bando Stone &amp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;New World</strong> <br><em>Out now</em><br>Cultural polymath Donald Glover returns to his Childish Gambino moniker for the sixth and final time on&nbsp;an album that also acts as the soundtrack to his film of the same name. Bando Stone &amp; the New World features production from Max Martin and Oscar winner Ludwig Göransson.</p> <p><strong>Stray Kids – Ate </strong><br><em>Out now</em><br>The follow-up to the K-pop boyband’s 2023 smash 5-Star arrives in the shape of this eight-track EP. Timed to add to the buzz around last week’s headline set at the BST Hyde Park festival, Ate builds on their discography of big, gloriously OTT pop bangers such as last year’s LALALALA. <em>MC</em></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Staying in: <strong>Brain food</strong></h2>    <p><strong><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/silenced/id1619957803?uo=4">Silenced</a></strong><br><em>Podcast</em><br>Journalist Nicola Kelly’s humane and deeply informative podcast returns for a second series, speaking to global reporters who&nbsp;have risked their liberties to document the truth. Featuring impassioned discussion&nbsp;with Gaza correspondents, Israeli photojournalists and&nbsp;others.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mitocw/videos">MIT OpenCourseWare</a></strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mitocw/videos"><br></a><em>YouTube</em><br>For 20 years, MIT course materials have been shared online through the Open Course Ware program.
