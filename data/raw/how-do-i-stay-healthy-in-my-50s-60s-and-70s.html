<p>Staying healthy in your 50s, 60s and 70s means adapting to wear and tear, but also embracing all the different ways to thrive. By focusing on some common areas – like nutrition, exercise and meaningful connections – you can age well in every decade.</p> <p>Here’s what you need to know to extend the quality of life in these decades.</p> <h2>Staying healthy in your 50s</h2> <p>Entering midlife, a person’s health needs can begin to change.</p> <p>Sometimes these changes can be challenging, but there is “plasticity to ageing”, says Nathan LeBrasseur, director of the Mayo Clinic’s Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging, and you do have some control over the process.</p> <p><strong>What are normal signs of ageing and how does your body change in your 50s? </strong>Wear and tear on the body’s cells and molecules increases the risk of ageing-related diseases, says LeBrasseur.</p> <p>Biological age is a measure of these cellular and molecular changes over time. It captures how old your body appears based on <a href="https://www.age.mpg.de/211116/what-is-biological-age">biomarkers</a>, like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/02/green-space-ageing-neighborhood">telomere length</a>, and how well your body is functioning.</p> <p>Biological age is a better measure of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/mar/28/healthspan-revolution-how-to-live-long-strong-happy-life">healthspan</a>, or years of generally good health, than chronological age, or how many years you’ve been alive.</p> <p>Lifestyle factors, like if you smoke or drink, influence how you age – and focusing on your health now will help in the future.</p> <p>For some, the menopausal transition may begin between the ages of 45 and 55 and is linked to symptoms including hot flashes, mood changes and sleep disturbances. Women may also experience vaginal dryness or decreased sex drive, while men may begin to experience erectile dysfunction.</p> <p><strong>What health tests should you get regularly in your 50s?</strong> To extend your healthy years, take preventive and proactive measures. The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK225245/">an annual skin cancer screening</a> for anyone over 40, and talking to a healthcare provider about colorectal cancer screenings, yearly mammograms, and lung and prostate cancer screenings.</p> <p>In the UK, the NHS offers a free health check to people aged 40 to 70 without certain <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-health-check/">pre-existing conditions</a>. It includes blood pressure and cholesterol tests, and checks your risk of health issues like diabetes and stroke. At 50, you’re also eligible for NHS breast, bowel and cervical cancer <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-screening/">screenings</a>.</p> <p><strong>What are the keys to longevity?</strong> Heart health is vital, as is being mindful of your nutrition and exercise. A diet rich in plants, whole grains, healthy fats and lean meats can improve your health. A diversity of physical activity – focusing on endurance, cardio, flexibility and balance – is crucial.<strong> </strong>It’s never too late to start, and what you do over many years will have a long-term impact, says LeBrasseur.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/nov/21/how-to-stay-healthy-in-your-50s-ageing"><sub>How do I stay healthy in my 50s?</sub></a></p> <h2>Staying healthy in your 60s</h2> <p>Your 60s are a period of change. For many, this decade is marked by shifting family dynamics with adult children or new health challenges.</p> <p><strong>What are normal signs of ageing and how does your body change in your 60s? </strong>Getting older, and the physical changes that accompany it, vary person to person. “We’re all more vulnerable to things as we get older, but there’s a lot of heterogeneity of health status among older people,” says Jennifer Schrack, director of the Johns Hopkins Center on Aging and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health">Health</a>.</p> <p>Older adults may walk more slowly because of pain or emerging balance problems, says Schrack, and osteoarthritis symptoms causing discomfort may emerge as well. As the body ages, the immune system <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5291468/">weakens</a> and the risk factor for age-related diseases increases since the body takes longer to fight off infection.</p> <p>Memory tends to change, and forgetfulness is common as you age, explains Dr Angela Sanford, a care provider and associate professor of geriatric medicine at St Louis University. It’s common to see processing speed slow, and for multitasking to become a bigger challenge. If you worry about forgetfulness, a doctor can advise on cognitive screening tests.</p> <p>In your 60s, sleep may become more disrupted, with studies indicating that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2516307/">40 to 50%</a> of those over 60 report difficulty sleeping.</p> <p><strong>What health tests should you get regularly in your 60s?</strong> People in their 60s should be mindful to have regular bloodwork done, says Sanford. An annual eye exam, screening for colorectal cancer and diabetes, are also recommended.<strong> </strong>Women should have mammograms and test bone density, which declines during menopause.</p> <p><strong>What are the keys to longevity? </strong>Genetics, lifestyle choices and environment are the factors that most affect your health, says Schrack.</p> <p>Regular appointments with a healthcare provider benefit all older people, Schrack says, and preventive care can improve longevity. Mobility and staying active contribute to quality of life<strong> </strong>as does maintaining positive relationships.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/24/healthy-aging-process-60s"><sub>How do I stay health in my 60s?</sub></a></p> <h2>Staying healthy in your 70s</h2> <p>Today’s septuagenarians are different. “Many transitions that are happening now at 70 are the types of transitions people in previous generations might have experienced in their early 60s,” says Jeffrey Stokes, an associate professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston who studies ageing. People in this age group now have longer life expectancy, and are also becoming grandparents and retiring later than previous generations.</p> <p><strong>What are normal signs of ageing and how does your body change in your 70s? </strong>Some medical conditions and functional problems, like decreased mobility and impaired balance, become more common as people age, according to Dr Mark Lachs, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.</p> <p>However, lifestyle factors play a role, and how much you feel these changes will be very individualized. And while there is no one “normal” way to age, it is common to experience health challenges like arthritis, hypertension or increased trouble sleeping.</p> <p>In comparison to earlier decades, your 70s can be quite stable healthwise. This is especially true for women, the majority of whom will have already experienced great change when they went through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/17/perimenopause-symptoms">menopause</a>.</p> <p><strong>What health tests should you get regularly in your 70s? </strong>Many recommended screenings are framed as guidelines for those above 65 in the US and UK. This reflects a lack of research and that screenings become more complicated as we age, says Dr Deborah Kado, a professor of medicine and co-director of the Stanford Longevity Center. It can be difficult to provide general recommendations because individual needs at this stage <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/screening-after-age-75">can vary</a>.</p> <p>Some screenings to consider are for bone mineral density and functional limitations (to see, if for example, you are at risk for falling), according to Dr Mark Lachs, chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine.</p> <p><strong>What are the keys to longevity? </strong>Movement is important, says Lachs, and any kind of cardiovascular exercise at modest levels will help. Relationships, both casual and close, can improve a person’s health and sense of purpose, says Stokes.</p> <p>While many people in their 70s will have deep, meaningful relationships – like those with children and grandchildren – there’s often less emphasis on fostering new connections. Targeting this can help improve the loneliness and isolation faced by many in their oldest years, says Stokes.</p> <p>Adequate sleep – at least seven to nine hours each night – and a diet that contains less meat and more plants can contribute to overall longevity, too.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/mar/03/health-tips-70s-longevity"><sub>How do I stay healthy in my 70s?</sub></a></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="How do I stay healthy in my 70s button">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
