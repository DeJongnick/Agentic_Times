<p>Boys in England have opened a wide gap over girls in maths and science, based on analysis by researchers using an authoritative international assessment, overturning recent claims that boys are falling behind girls at school.</p> <p>Researchers at University College London (UCL) found that boys in year 5 and year 9 at school in England “scored significantly higher than girls in maths and science” in <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67c05df4750837d7604dbc5c/TIMSS_national_report_for_england_volume_2.pdf">recent international assessments</a>, compared with those conducted before the Covid pandemic.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Bh7Nb/2/" data-alt="Graph"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/Bh7Nb/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Dr Jennie Golding, of UCL’s Institute of Education and co-principal investigator of the research, said: “It is difficult to say exactly why this gap has opened up but our findings point to some factors including confidence, a sense of belonging and absenteeism. However, more research is needed to understand the reasons fully and address this problem.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/may/18/parents-overestimate-sons-maths-skills-more-than-daughters-study-finds">Parents overestimate sons’ maths skills more than daughters’, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The improvement by boys was particularly noticeable in maths, where the data analysis found that greater confidence was “strongly associated” with higher attainment in the quadrennial tests conducted for the <a href="https://timss2023.org/">Trends in international mathematics and science study</a> (Timss).</p> <p>The results run counter to arguments by politicians and thinktanks that boys are overlooked within England’s education system. A report <a href="https://www.centreforsocialjustice.org.uk/library/lost-boys">published by the Centre for Social Justice</a> last week claimed that “from nursery to university, boys are falling behind girls”. Last year, MPs on parliament’s education select committee <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/203/education-committee/news/200976/why-do-boys-lag-behind-girls-at-all-ages-of-education-mps-to-investigate/">launched an investigation</a> titled “Why do boys lag behind girls at all ages of education?”</p> <p>In the 2019 Timss maths assessment, boys and girls in year 9 in England achieved very similar results, of 516 and 514 respectively. But in the latest version, carried out in 2023, boys opened up a 26-point lead ahead of girls, scoring 538 against 512 for girls.</p> <p>UCL said the gender gap in England was the widest of any of the 72 participating countries, including the US, Japan and Singapore.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/INvYR/1/" data-alt="Graph"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/INvYR/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In science, boys in year 9 overturned a three-point lead by girls in 2019 to significantly outperform them with a 14-point lead of 538 to 524 in the latest assessments.</p> <p>Across both year groups in maths and in year 9 science, the researchers found that “significantly higher percentages of boys reported being very confident on statements related to maths and science,” while a large percentage of girls said they were not confident.</p> <p>In year 9 maths, 21% of boys and 9% of girls reported they were very confident, while 38% of boys and 60% of girls reported they were not confident.</p> <p>The Timss results partially mirror GCSE results among year 11 students in England since the pandemic. In 2024, boys consistently outperformed girls at both grade 4 and grade 7 in maths, physics, economics and statistics.</p> <p>However, stubborn gaps remain between disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers. The UCL researchers found there were significant gaps between pupils who had access to a large number of books at home and those who did not. In year 9 science, pupils in households with fewer than 10 books scored 461, compared with 601 for those with over 200 books at home.</p> <p>Prof Mary Richardson, the study’s principal investigator, said: “Despite efforts within schools, socioeconomic factors are still influencing how many pupils perform in maths and science.</p> <p>“Those who have fewer educational resources at home need extra support and awareness in order to access the same opportunities to learn compared with their better-resourced peers.”</p>
