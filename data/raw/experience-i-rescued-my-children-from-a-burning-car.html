<p>One morning in 2018, my&nbsp;husband Reuben told me about a nightmare he’d had the&nbsp;previous night. He’d been driving over the Hewitt Avenue Trestle, a bridge near our house in Everett, Washington in the US, crashed through the barriers into the estuary below, and had to decide which of our two children to save.</p> <p>Two weeks later, I was getting Talia, then three, and Weston, 10 months, dressed, fed and out of the door to take them to preschool on my way to work.</p> <p>It was a route we’d taken a hundred times before. I was chatting to Reuben on speakerphone with both children in the back, when I smelled something odd, like plastic melting.</p> <p>I mentioned it to Reuben, but neither of us thought anything of it. There are industrial buildings nearby, so I assumed it was coming from one of them.</p> <p>A minute later, and no longer on the phone, I&nbsp;drove on to the bridge my husband had dreamed about, which was busy with rush-hour traffic. That’s when I&nbsp;saw the word “STOP” flash across my&nbsp;dashboard.</p> <p>Before I even had the&nbsp;chance to register it, I saw smoke rising from the bonnet of the car. I&nbsp;knew I needed to pull over, but the bridge, which is 2.5 miles long, didn’t have a&nbsp;hard shoulder. I decided it was safest to get across it and then stop the car.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>The smoke coming out of the bonnet was so thick I couldn’t see the road ahead.

With cars flying past me, I managed to pull over to the&nbsp;side of the road. </p> <p>At this point, I was really distressed. I called the American Automobile Association (AAA), but, as if my luck wasn’t bad enough, my membership had expired. As I was talking to the operator, I saw flames through the windshield – the bonnet was on fire.</p> <p>Terrified, and certain the car was about to explode, I yelled that my car was on fire. Acting on pure instinct, I&nbsp;jumped out, opened the door behind me, and unclipped Weston’s car seat.</p> <p>I could hear the woman from the AAA shouting at me to call 911 as cars and lorries thundered past, just inches away. For a split second I froze. Was it safe to put Weston down on the road while I grabbed Talia? Could I run&nbsp;to the end of the bridge with them both in my arms?</p> <p>Just then, as I was almost overwhelmed with fear, an arm appeared. I looked up into the face of a&nbsp;man who said, “It’s OK, mama”, took Weston<strong> </strong>from my hands and went to his&nbsp;car, which was just behind me.</p> <p>I dashed round to Talia’s door, opening it to see flames inside, and spreading fast. She looked at me in terror and screamed, “Mummy!” Within a second, I had her in my arms, running back to the man’s car. As we zoomed off, I looked over my shoulder and saw flames shooting into the sky. Talia was sobbing into my chest.</p> <p>Unable to think clearly, I didn’t call 911 or Reuben, I just asked for us to be dropped at a nearby car dealership. I&nbsp;thanked my heroic rescuer and hugged him goodbye, only later realising that I&nbsp;didn’t even get his name.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/04/experience-i-was-attacked-by-a-wild-tiger">Experience: I was attacked by a wild tiger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reuben’s work was about 50&nbsp;miles away, so I called a friend nearby, who immediately came to get us. He’s a funny guy, and, as I fell into his arms, weeping, he quipped: “Sorry I’m late. There was some big fire on the road.”</p> <p>I called Reuben on the way to my parents’ house. He was devastated, repeatedly apologising for not knowing the smell was something serious. I tried to reassure him: I hadn’t known, either. </p> <p>Seeing the burnt-out car arrive later&nbsp;that day before it was scrapped was awful. I felt sick at the thought of what might have happened if I hadn’t got the children out when I did.</p> <p>While Weston appeared unaffected throughout, and Talia was back to her happy self within hours, I struggled. I&nbsp;had awful dreams where I endlessly relived it. When driving our new car, I’d obsessively open the windows at the slightest smell, convinced it was on fire.</p> <p>A session of EMDR [eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing] therapy helped a lot. I was even able to drive across the Trestle and stay calm.</p> <p>We never found out what caused the&nbsp;fire. Thankfully, the children have&nbsp;no memory of that day now. And&nbsp;when they moan that Mummy doesn’t do this or that, I remind them that I entered a&nbsp;burning car for them – and I’d do it again in a heartbeat.</p> <p>• As told to Kate Graham</p> <p>Do you have an experience to share?
