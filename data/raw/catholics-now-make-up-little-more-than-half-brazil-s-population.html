<p>Home to the world’s largest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/catholicism">Catholic</a> population, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil">Brazil</a> has once again witnessed a decline in the faith’s following, according to new figures released by the country’s national statistics institute (IBGE).</p> <p>Thirty years ago, Catholics made up 82.9% of Brazil’s population but now account for just over half, 56.7%, according to the 2022 census – whose results on religion were only released on Friday.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the number of evangelicals has continued to grow, rising from 9% of the population to 26.9% over the past three decades.</p> <p>Although the growth rate has slowed slightly – rising by 6.5 percentage points between 2000 and 2010, and 5.3 since – the new data shows that, for the first time, at least one in four Brazilians identifies as evangelical.</p> <p>The analysts did not specify the denominations among evangelicals and said they do not yet know if this will be detailed in the future.</p> <p>“In recent years, we’ve seen a growing presence of evangelicals emerging and gradually asserting themselves in society, taking a stand, expressing their values, ideas, and faith,” said an IBGE analyst, Maria Goreth Santos.</p> <p>Gospel singers and religious influencers <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2024/01/06/the-evangelical-wave-surging-across-brazil_6408020_4.html">have become superstars</a>, evangelical-themed books <a href="https://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/noticia/2025/02/07/cafe-com-deus-pai-como-os-livros-devocionais-furaram-a-bolha-evangelica-e-viraram-aposta-de-editoras-nao-religiosas.ghtml">consistently top bestseller lists</a>, and Brazil’s still immensely popular telenovelas have <a href="https://veja.abril.com.br/coluna/tela-plana/vai-na-fe-as-razoes-do-sucesso-da-novela-evangelica-da-globo/">increasingly incorporated evangelical characters</a> and storylines into their plots.</p> <p>In politics, evangelicals have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/01/brazil-evangelicals-politics-presidential-election">emerged as a significant political force</a>, forming one of the main support bases for the far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro, and now pose an additional challenge for the leftist president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, as he prepares to seek re-election in 2026.</p> <p>A poll released earlier this week showed that, despite positive economic indicators, the veteran South American leader is struggling in his third term: <a href="https://g1.globo.com/politica/noticia/2025/06/04/quaest-governo-lula-junho.ghtml#8">disapproval stands at 57%</a> among the general population but is even higher among evangelicals, at 66%.</p> <p>“Rationally, the government understands it needs to engage with evangelicals, but internally, many of Lula’s party leaders still believe religion is a thing of the past and that the faithful are simply people who haven’t had proper access to education,” said the anthropologist and historian <a href="https://uclpress.co.uk/book/social-media-in-emergent-brazil/">Juliano Spyer</a>, author of books on the evangelical movement in Brazil.</p> <p>The new IBGE data also showed that, proportionally within each group, there are more Black evangelicals than white ones – a particularly relevant finding given that the majority of Brazil’s population, 56%, is Black.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/sep/10/democracy-theocracy-brazil-us">Where does democracy end and theocracy begin? | Petra Costa and Alessandra Orofino</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Catholics remain the majority in both cases, just one in four white Brazilians identifies as evangelical, compared with one in three among Black Brazilians.</p> <p>The data also showed an increase in the number of people with no religious affiliation, rising from 4.6% 30 years ago to 9.3% today.</p> <p>Another significant figure the IBGE researchers highlighted was the growth in the number of followers of Afro-Brazilian religions such as candomblé and umbanda, which rose from 0.3% to 1%.</p> <p>The Brazilian state has historically persecuted followers of Afro-Brazilian religions.</p>    <p>Brazil was the country that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/brazil-descendants-enslaved-africans-black-people-history">kidnapped the highest number of enslaved Africans</a>, and during the more than three centuries of slavery, practising any faith other than Catholicism was prohibited. After abolition in 1888, religions of African origin were still criminalised.</p> <p>It was only with the adoption of the country’s most recent constitution, in 1988, that practitioners of umbanda and candomblé gained some form of state protection – at least in theory. In recent years, however, they have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/candomble-brazil-rio-de-janeiro-evangelical">again faced persecution</a>, this time from extremist Catholics and evangelicals and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/christ-and-cocaine-rios-gangs-of-god-blend-faith-and-violence">drug traffickers who claim to have embraced Christianity</a>.</p> <p>Santos said that although followers of Afro-Brazilian religions still represent a small minority of the population, the rise in self-declared adherents may reflect both people who previously identified with other religions out of fear and actual migration.</p> <p>She sees the growth as a potential result of “all these movements to celebrate Afro-Brazilian culture in recent years … with prominent figures in society, influencers and artists identifying with these religions … and also a massive campaign against religious intolerance”.</p>
