<p>Qantas will pay $120m in compensation to 1,820 baggage handlers the airline illegally sacked in 2020 as the full cost of its controversial outsourcing decision continues to grow.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Qantas and the Transport Workers Union (TWU) announced they had finally reached an agreement over the payout, following a years-long legal battle that included the airline appealing the initial decision to the full bench of the federal court and later the high court – both of which were unsuccessful.</p> <p>After losing its final appeal, the two parties spent more than a year in mediation and remedy hearings to determine how much Qantas would have to pay the outsourced workers for economic losses linked to lost wages.</p> <p>To agree on a final compensation payout, the federal court examined test cases of three outsourced workers with differing circumstances. In October, justice Michael Lee determined that individual compensation amounts should range from $30,000 to $100,000.</p> <p>Lee found that the workers would have been retrenched one year later in 2021 anyway due to the airline’s “laser-like” focus on cutting costs, capping the economic component of compensation calculations at 12 months.</p> <p>The test case compensation figures also took into consideration “non-economic loss” suffered, related to hardship and distress caused by the airline’s decision.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/04/hundreds-of-qantas-customers-caught-in-frequent-flyer-cyber-theft">Hundreds of Qantas customers caught in frequent flyer cyber theft</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A compensation fund will be established early next year, with legal firm Maurice Blackburn to administer payments to eligible employees.</p> <p>In addition to the $120m in compensation, legal costs incurred due to its various challenges and the incident’s contribution to a tumultuous period for Qantas’ brand, the airline still faces significant penalties that could be imposed on it for breaching labour laws. Penalties will be determined next year.</p> <p>The $120m compensation amount – and looming penalties – mean the true cost of the outsourcing has ballooned past the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/29/qantas-annual-profit-down-16-to-21bn-from-record-high-as-airfares-decline">$70m Qantas had budgeted for the saga in its most recent financial results.</a></p> <p>However, Qantas’ strong financial performance – it posted a $2.1bn annual underlying profit last financial year, after a record $2.47bn profit the year before – means the compensation agreement is unlikely to dramatically destabilise the airline’s financial outlook.</p> <p>The $120m price tag for the outsourcing caps off a costly year for Qantas in terms of payouts, after it agreed to a civil penalty of $100m and $20m to customers in compensation over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/may/06/qantas-accc-fine-slot-hoarding-settlement">landmark legal action for allegedly selling tens of thousands of tickets to flights that had already been cancelled</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Qantas CEO, Vanessa Hudson, reiterated the airline’s “sincere apologies” to the illegally outsourced ground handlers.</p> <p>Hudson – who served as chief financial officer at the airline under former CEO Alan Joyce when the outsourcing decision was made – said reaching an agreement with the TWU over compensation was “an important step in bringing closure” to their former employees.</p> <p>“We know this has been a difficult period for those affected and are pleased we have been able to work closely with the TWU to expedite this process and resolve it ahead of Christmas,” Hudson said.</p> <p>The TWU national secretary, Michael Kaine, said the compensation agreement ended “four gruelling years” for the sacked employees, who had suffered “family breakdowns, financial stress and mental hardship”.</p> <p>“These workers helped build the ‘Spirit of Australia’. Many worked decades, proud to play their part in delivering the safety and service standards that made Qantas a national icon,” he said.</p> <p>“Delivering justice to these workers is just the first step in turning Qantas around –but there’s still a long way to go to bring back the flying kangaroo Australians used to love,” Kaine said. He reiterated his calls for a safe and secure skies commission to overhaul how Australia’s aviation industry operates.</p> <p>In the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jul/30/court-to-rule-on-whether-qantas-broke-law-by-outsourcing-2000-jobs"> initial 2021 ruling</a> over the outsourcing, the federal court<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/04/qantas-vows-to-go-to-high-court-after-losing-appeal-over-unlawful-baggage-handler-sackings"> found the decision illegal </a>because it acted against protections in the Fair Work Act and was in part driven by a desire to avoid industrial action.</p> <p>Compensation hearings that followed Qantas’ unsuccessful appeals focused on what would have occurred if the illegal outsourcing did not occur.</p> <p>The court also heard that some of the workers had suffered significant psychological distress after losing their jobs and had to take medication to cope.</p> <p><br></p>
