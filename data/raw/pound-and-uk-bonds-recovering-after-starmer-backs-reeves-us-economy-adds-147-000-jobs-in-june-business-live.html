The Prime Minister has confirmed that Rachel Reeves will remain in place as Chancellor, however, bond yields have not fallen back to the levels that we saw before bonds started to sell off 24 hours ago. The 10-year yield had been down 10bps at one stage, however, this has been eroded, and yields are only down 5bps at the time of writing. A sharp rise in US yields is dragging UK yields higher as we move through Thursday.</p> <p>This suggests 2 things: </p> <p>1: highly indebted western economies can see their sovereign debt markets move in unison, which is bad news for those who hoped there could be a full reversal in UK bond yields today. </p> <p>2: there could be a permanent premium attached to UK yields as we move through the summer months to October’s budget. The premium this time is linked to Labour’s left having increasing control over Kier Starmer and pushing him for ever greater levels of public spending.</p> <p>If the government wants to avoid an embarrassing and devastating fiscal crisis, they need the guts to cut public spending to more reasonable levels. The bond vigilantes are circling, and Labour could be forced to U-turn on the U-turns. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686697a28f08717e1adfe4dc" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-03T14:47:31.266Z">3.47pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Back on Wall Street, Nvidia is on track to become the most valuable company in history.</strong></p> <p>The chipmaker’s market capitalization has risen to $3.915trn today, after its shares rose 2% in early trading, lifted by continued optimism about demand for high-performance chips to power artificial intelligence systems.</p> <p>Tht gives it a slightly higher market capitalization than <strong>Apple’s</strong> record closing value of around $3.915trn on December 26, 2024, <em>Reuters reports</em>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686693c78f08717e1adfe46e" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-03T14:31:26.640Z">3.31pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The US Department of Labor has given Donald Trump the credit for June’s solid jobs numbers:</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/USDOL/status/1940752735252762700">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The jobs report again shattered expectations, with 147,000 new jobs added in June! <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@POTUS</a>’ America First policies continue to unleash historic growth and prosperity for our workers 🇺🇸 <a href="https://t.co/VYDpginpfZ">pic.twitter.com/VYDpginpfZ</a></p>&mdash; U.S. Department of Labor (@USDOL) <a href="https://twitter.com/USDOL/status/1940752735252762700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2025</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <p>The president has reposted this message on his Truth Social site, so I guess we can conclude it was the Trump economy in June rather than the Biden economy (which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2025/may/05/trump-biden-economy">took the blame for GDP shrinking in January-March</a>)</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686690068f08717e1adfe40c" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-03T14:16:06.758Z">3.16pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Ryanair and easyJet cancel hundreds of flights amid French air traffic control strikes</h2>  <div class="block-elements">    <p><strong>Today has been a rough day for some airline passengers in the UK.</strong></p> <p>Low-cost airlines <strong>Ryanair</strong> and <strong>easyJet</strong> both cancelled hundreds of flights due to French air traffic control strikes.</p> <p><strong>Ryanair</strong> said it was forced to make 170 cancellations on Thursday and Friday as the strikes affect flights to and from France – and also flights over the country to destinations such as the UK, Greece, Spain and Ireland – impacting more than 30,000 passengers.</p> <p>Luton-based rival <strong>easyJet</strong> said it had cancelled 124 flights today and was scrapping 150 tomorrow due to the industrial action.</p>    <p><strong>Ryanair</strong> chief executive <strong>Michael O’Leary</strong> renewed calls on EU Commission President <strong>Ursula</strong> <strong>von</strong> <strong>der</strong> <strong>Leyen</strong> to take “urgent action” to reform European Union air traffic control (ATC) services in light of the disruption, which comes at the start of the European summer holidays.</p> <p><strong>O’Leary</strong> said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Once again, European families are held to ransom by French air traffic controllers going on strike.</p> <p>“It is not acceptable that overflights over French airspace en route to their destination are being cancelled/delayed as a result of yet another French ATC strike.</p> <p>“It makes no sense and is abundantly unfair on EU passengers and families going on holidays.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68668ec88f0877cd81d652d3" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-03T14:09:29.586Z">3.09pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Analysts at ING predict that Donald Trump will have to wait until September for a cut to US interest rates.</strong></p> <p>Following today’s stronger-than-expected jobs report, they say:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The June US jobs report shows nonfarm payrolls rising 147,000 versus the 106,000 consensus with 16,000 of upward revisions to the past two months of data.

As a result, hopes for a rate cut from the Fed in July have all but disappeared.</p> <p>All thoughts will now turn to the next inflation report on July 15<sup>th</sup>. If inflation remains some way above the Fed’s 2% target, there will start to be questions about whether rates get cut at all this year. Today’s numbers will not help that case and this in turn will likely do nothing to appease an already agitated President. However, as demonstrated at the last Fed meeting, the President’s unstoppable wave of political pressure is likely to do nothing to the immovable object of the central bank’s resolve.

Indeed, in our mid-year outlook we noted that our “our main concern going into the autumn is...that the existing departmental spending plans look very tight...It seems almost inevitable that current spending will be topped up”; <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Raise taxes.</strong> Hiking income, corporation or value-added taxes would breach Labour’s manifesto commitments, but we estimate it would be challenging to amass revenues of more than £10bn from increasing other levies and surcharges. </p><p>In our mid-year outlook, we noted that the effective rate of income tax in the UK looks relatively low for median earners, implying that reversing the recently cut employee NICs could be one option for the Treasury to consider.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Fiscal rules could be altered.</strong> The rising risks of this option, we think, is what drove the adverse market action [on Wednesday].
