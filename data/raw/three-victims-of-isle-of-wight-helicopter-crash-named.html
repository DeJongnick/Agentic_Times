<p>A couple who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/25/people-killed-isle-of-wight-helicopter-crash">died in a helicopter crash</a> on the Isle of Wight during the bank holiday have been named by relatives.</p> <p>Justyna Czoska, 52, a horse riding instructor, and her partner, Wojtek Kowalkowski, 49, of Bloxham, Oxfordshire, died after the aircraft crash-landed at about 9.24am on Monday between Shanklin and Whiteley Bank. The helicopter had taken off from Sandown airport 20 minutes earlier, the operator said.</p> <p>The third person who died in the crash was named by Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary as Simon Hewitt, aged 54, from Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire, on Tuesday evening. A fourth person, a man aged in his 30s, was airlifted to hospital in Southampton where he remains in a stable condition, the police said.</p> <p>The helicopter ride had reportedly been a birthday present for Kowalkowski.</p> <p>A GoFundMe post written by Jacob Butler, the partner of Czoska’s daughter, Julia Buzar, 22, read: “On August 25th, my partner’s beloved mum and her partner tragically lost their lives in a helicopter crash on the Isle of Wight. This sudden and devastating event has left all us heartbroken and struggling to cope with the loss.</p> <p>“We are now trying to bring them both back to Poland so they can be laid to rest with their families, in the place they called home. The cost of repatriation, funeral arrangements and travel is more than we can manage alone and we are asking for support during this incredibly difficult time.</p> <p>“Any donation, no matter how small, will help us give them the farewell they deserve. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your kindness, support, and for keeping our family in your thoughts. With love, Jacob and Julia.”</p> <p>Posting on Facebook, Buzar said: “I have no words, the world took my mum too soon, she was the best mum you could ask for, loved by everyone.</p> <p>“I never thought I’d be writing something like this. Please, if anyone could help bring them back to Poland so they can be with their families it would mean the world to me … Rest in peace mum and Wojtek.”</p> <p>Czoska worked at Turpins Lodge riding school in Hook Norton, Oxfordshire. In a statement, the riding school said: “Justyna was cheerful, reliable and conscientious. She will leave a huge hole to fill. Our thoughts go out to Justyna’s daughters, family and friends.”</p> <p>The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has launched a formal inquiry into the crash, which is expected to take 12 months. Northumbria Helicopters, a company based at Newcastle airport, has confirmed one of its helicopters was involved.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the helicopter was removed from the field where it crashed. The road next to the field remains closed.</p> <p>An AAIB spokesperson said: “Our current focus is on gathering physical evidence from the accident site and interviewing witnesses. The remains of the helicopter will then be recovered and transported back to our headquarters in Farnborough, Hampshire, for further detailed investigation.”</p> <p>Danial Subhani, Sandown airport’s operations manager, said on Tuesday that he was “absolutely horrified” by the crash. Speaking to ITV, he said: “Everyone here is [devastated]. It’s affected the whole of the Isle of Wight community.” </p>
