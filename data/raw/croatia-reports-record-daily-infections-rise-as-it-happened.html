With winter ending in the southern hemisphere – ergo soon to begin in the north - it has emerged that measures to counter Covid-19 have dramatically slowed the spread of influenza. But that success is not guaranteed for countries about to enter their colder months.</p> <p>(PS I can confirm winter is ending in the southern hemisphere. Gloriously sunny out my window in <strong>Sydney</strong>, but here am I, inside still …)</p> <p>Winter is ending in the southern hemisphere and country after country – South Africa, Australia, Argentina – have had a surprise: their steps against Covid-19 also apparently blocked the flu.</p> <p>But there’s no guarantee the northern hemisphere will avoid twin epidemics as its own flu season looms while the coronavirus still rages.</p> <p>“This could be one of the worst seasons we’ve had from a public health perspective with Covid and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we’ve had,” Dr Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.</p> <p>US health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu in record numbers this autumn, so hospitals aren’t overwhelmed with a “duelling twindemic”.</p> <p>“It’s also becoming clear that wearing masks, avoiding crowds and keeping your distance are protections that are not specific for Covid. They’re going to work for any respiratory virus,” Redfield said.</p>    <p>The evidence: ordinarily, South Africa sees widespread influenza during the southern hemisphere’s winter months of May through August. This year, testing tracked by the country’s National Institute of Communicable Diseases is finding almost none: something unprecedented.</p> <p>School closures, limited public gatherings and calls to wear masks and wash hands have knocked down the flu, said Dr Cheryl Cohen, head of the institute’s respiratory programme.</p> <p>“That not only meant lives saved from flu’s annual toll, but it freed up our hospitals capacity to treat Covid-19 patients,” Cohen added.</p> <p>In Australia, the national health department reported just 36 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths from January to mid-August, compared to more than 480 during the same period last year.</p> <p>The most likely and the biggest contributor is social distancing, said Dr Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The coronavirus is blamed for about 24m infections and more than 810,000 deaths globally in the first eight months of this year.</p> <p>A normal flu year could have the world’s hospitals dealing with several million more severe illnesses on top of the Covid-19 crush.</p> <p>Back in February and March, as the worldwide spread of the new virus was just being recognized, many countries throughout the southern hemisphere girded for a double whammy. Even as they locked down to fight the coronavirus, they made a huge push for more last-minute flu vaccinations.</p> <p>“We gave many more flu vaccinations, like four times more,” said Jaco Havenga, a pharmacist who works at Mays Chemist, a pharmacy in a Johannesburg suburb.</p> <p>Some countries’ lockdowns were more effective than others at stemming spread of the coronavirus.</p> <p>So why would flu have dropped even if Covid-19 still was on the rise?</p> <p>“Clearly the vigilance required to be successful against Covid is really high,” said CDC’s Redfield.</p> <p>“This virus is one of the most infectious viruses that we’ve seen. That’s in part because 40% of people with Covid-19 show no symptoms yet can spread infection,” he said.</p>    <p>Flu hasn’t disappeared, a World Health Organization report cautioned earlier this month. While globally, influenza activity was reported at lower levels than expected for this time of year, it found sporadic cases are being reported.</p> <p>Plus, some people who had the flu in southern countries might just have hunkered down at home and not seen a doctor as the coronavirus was widespread, WHO added.</p> <p>But international influenza experts say keeping schools closed children typically drive flu’s spread and strict mask and distancing rules clearly helped.</p> <p>“We don’t have definitive proof, but the logical explanation is what they’re doing to try to control the spread of (the coronavirus) is actually doing a really, really good job against the flu as well,” said Richard Webby of St Jude Children’s Research hospital, who is part of a WHO committee that tracks flu evolution.</p> <p>In contrast, the US and Europe didn’t impose coronavirus rules nearly as restrictive as some of their southern neighbours and in many cases are reopening schools and relaxing distancing rules even as Covid-19 still is being transmitted and the cooler months that favour influenza’s spread are fast approaching.</p> <p>So the US CDC is urging record flu vaccinations, preferably by October. Redfield’s goal is for at least 65% of adults to be vaccinated, usually only about half are.</p> <p>The US expects more than 190m doses of flu vaccine, about 20m more than last year.

 <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>South Korea</strong> has ordered doctors in Seoul to return to work on Wednesday as they began a three-day strike in protest of several government proposals, including one to boost the number of doctors to deal with health crises like the coronavirus.</p> <p>Trainee doctors have been staging ongoing walkouts, and thousands of additional doctors were due to stage a three-day strike starting on Wednesday.</p> <p>The strikes come as South Korea battles one of its worst outbreaks of the coronavirus, with 320 new cases reported in the 24 hours to midnight Tuesday, the latest in more than a week and a half of triple-digit increases.</p> <p>The walkouts on Wednesday forced South Korea’s five major general hospitals to limit their hours and delay scheduled surgeries, Yonhap news agency reported.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, the doctors reached an agreement with the government to continue to handle coronavirus patients, but failed to find a compromise on the broader issues.</p> <p>“The government now has no choice but to take necessary legal actions such as an order to open business to not put the citizens’ lives and safety in danger,” health minister <strong>Park Neung-hoo</strong> said in a briefing. “We urge all trainee and fellow doctors to immediately return to work.”</p>    <p>He said the Korean Medical Association (KMA) and the Korean Intern Resident Association (KIRA) had rejected several of the government’s offers.</p> <p>In a statement, KMA said the medical community was always open to all possibilities in talks with the government, and that the doctors did not want to have to strike.</p> <p>“We sincerely do want to return,” the statement said. “We ask you citizens to listen to our voice so that we can meet our patients as soon as possible.”</p> <p>KMA and KIRA members have said they oppose government plans to boost the number of medical students over several years, establish public medical schools, allow government insurance to cover more oriental medicine, and introduce more telemedicine options.</p> <p>The government said its goal to increase the number of medical students by 4,000 over the next 10 years is necessary to better prepare for public health crises like the coronavirus pandemic.<br></p> <p>Student doctors, however, said the plan would unnecessarily flood an already competitive market, and that the extra funding would be better spent improving the salaries of existing trainees, which would encourage them to move out of Seoul to rural areas where more health professionals are needed.

<strong>German</strong> scheme that tops up pay for workers who lost work hours because of the coronavirus pandemic has been extended by another year to stave off mass job losses.</p> <p>Chancellor <strong>Angela Merkel’s</strong> ruling coalition of conservatives and centre-left Social Democrats agreed on Tuesday to allow the programme to run for 24 months for any firm that applies by the end of the year.</p> <p>It also resolved to extend financial assistance to small businesses until the end of the year and relax insolvency laws in an effort to avoid cascading bankruptcies.</p> <p>The shorter-hours programme, known as <strong>Kurzarbeit</strong>, sees the German government cover around two-thirds of workers’ wages when employers slash their hours to save costs.</p> <p>The scheme was widely used during the 2008-09 financial crisis and credited with saving tens of thousands of jobs.</p> <p>The programme is one of the main tools used by Berlin to shield Europe’s top economy from the pandemic-induced downturn, accounting for a key part of the government’s trillion-euro (US$1.1 trillion) coronavirus support package.</p> <p>At the height of the coronavirus lockdowns in April, some 6.8m Germans received money through the scheme, the federal employment agency said.</p> <p>To ease access to the programme, ministers reduced the requirements that companies need to meet in order to qualify for assistance.</p> <p>German giants like Lufthansa, Volkswagen and BMW are among the many firms to have tapped into the scheme.</p>    <p>Before the pandemic, German unemployment hovered at a record-low level of around five percent. It has since risen to 6.4 percent. And after years of balanced budgets, the German government has said it plans to borrow around 218 billion euros this year to help pay for its pandemic response.</p> <p>Other European economies, including France and Britain, introduced similar short-time working programmes to battle the economic consequences of the pandemic.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2020-08-26T02:13:17.203Z">at 3.13am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-5f45ba3d8f08f9fdc758e2d0" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/eleanor-de-jong"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-08-26T01:27:43.942Z">2.27am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Staying in the neighbourhood.... <strong>Eleanor Ainge Roy</strong> reports from <strong>New Zealand:</strong></p> <p>New Zealand’s director-general of health <strong>Dr Ashley Bloomfield</strong> says there are five new cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, and significant spread has now been identified at a Mt Roskill church, which is being treated as a “mini-cluster”.</p> <p>Contact tracing is now underway for anyone who attended weddings or services at the church.</p> <p>The minister of health Chris Hipkins said the government had distributed 3 million masks to low socio-economic areas ahead of them becoming mandatory on public transport at midnight Sunday.</p> <p>Masks would also need to be worn in ubers and taxis.

Experts credit the development at least partly to increased wearing of masks, even as the outbreak continues to claim nearly 1,000 lives in the US each day.</li> <li><strong>Turkey</strong><strong> recorded its highest number of new coronavirus cases since mid-June.</strong> Another 1,502 infections were confirmed on Tuesday, according to government data, taking the official tally over 261,000.<br></li> <li><strong>India</strong><strong> reported the highest number of new coronavirus cases globally for the 18th straight day.</strong> Infections rocketed by another 1.5 million since the start of August, taking India’s total to around 3.1 million, more than in the US and Brazil. The rate of new cases in the country is increasing rapidly, climbing by 60,975 in the latest 24-hour period, according to the federal health ministry.</li> <li><strong>Gaza entered a 48-hour lockdown after the first cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the general population.</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/25/fears-of-catastrophic-covid-outbreak-in-gaza-after-first-cases-outside-quarantine-emerge">Four cases of coronavirus were confirmed in a single family in a refugee camp</a>, the first in Gaza that did not involve people quarantined in border facilities after crossing over from Egypt and Israel. Health authorities in the Hamas Islamist-run territory of 2 million people are concerned over the potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital facilities in dealing with an outbreak.</li> <li><strong>Two European patients were confirmed to have been reinfected with coronavirus, raising concerns about immunity.</strong> Regional public broadcasters said a patient in the Netherlands and another in Belgium had also been reinfected. It follows a report this week by researchers in Hong Kong about a man there who had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/24/case-of-man-with-coronavirus-for-second-time-stokes-reinfection-fears-hong-kong">reinfected four and a half months after recovering</a>.</li> <li><strong>The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter,</strong> the sharpest decline since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970. The statistics office said it came as consumer spending (10.9% down), company investments (19.6% down) and exports (20.3% down) all collapsed at the height of the pandemic.</li> </ul> </div>   </div>
