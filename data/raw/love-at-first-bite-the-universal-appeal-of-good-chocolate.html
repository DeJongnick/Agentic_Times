<p>There are few examples of global consensus in this world, but our collective adoration of chocolate is one. Whether it’s the mildly euphoric effects of theobromine, or the nostalgia-evoking comfort, chocolate just hits different.</p> <p>A truly great chocolate experience has multisensory elements. Consider the rich aroma, the way it melts in your mouth, and how the cacao notes linger on the palate, evoking a deep flavour. None of these factors are accidental, but the result of a high level of skill and precision in turning quality ingredients into fine chocolate.</p> <p>It’s a balance that Ferrero has perfected over almost eight decades since the family-owned business began as a small pastry shop in Alba, Italy.</p> <p>The work starts well before the master chocolatiers get to work. Every ingredient is sourced with meticulous care, guided by a core philosophy that has shaped Ferrero for generations: <em>sacco conosciuto</em>. Translating to “known bag”, <em>sacco conosciuto </em>is a company-wide commitment to understanding – and tracing – each ingredient Ferrero uses.</p>    <p>“We have the same approach to traceability as we did 70 years ago,” says Nicola Somenzi, the global head of responsible sourcing at Ferrero.</p> <p>“Of course, we’re now no longer talking about a single buyer in Italy but purchasing and sourcing on a global scale.”</p> <p>Creating a global supply chain based on a decades-old principle requires the use of advanced technologies alongside human expertise. For example, Ferrero partners with the supply chain mapping provider Sourcemap to trace the raw ingredients in Ferrero’s product line – including Ferrero Rocher, Kinder Bueno bars and Nutella products – back to their origins, collecting and relaying key data at each point.</p> <p>A refined chocolate product starts with a quality cacao bean, contributing to the complexity of flavour and mouthfeel. Great chocolate is defined by several characteristics, including a glossy sheen, a clean “snap” when broken, a smooth texture that melts effortlessly at body temperature, and a complex, well-balanced flavour.</p> <p>Cacao is a key ingredient in the Ferrero range, alongside hazelnuts – the principal flavour in the iconic golden Ferrero Rocher. There are about 300 varieties of the nut worldwide, and Ferrero only selects those that meet its precise criteria for taste, size and texture.</p> <p>It was in the hazelnut-rich Italian region of Piedmont that the company’s first product was created in 1946. Giandujot was a way to make expensive and rare cacao go further, eventually becoming the spreadable SuperCrema, and then morphing into Nutella in 1964. Kinder was the business’s next brand, launched in 1968, paving the way for the iconic Kinder Surprise – inspired by the traditions of Easter – in 1974.</p>    <p>Ferrero Rocher chocolates covered in gold foil were launched in 1982 and quickly became a global sensation. Today, the company sells 8bn hazelnut-hearted treats a year. Ferrero’s complex product took seven years to create – raw hazelnuts are roasted fresh, travelling through a 35-metre-long roaster at precisely one metre per minute to achieve an even, golden roast. The development of the spherical wafer shell alone took five years to perfect; each shell is baked, then humidified to prevent brittleness.</p> <p>Flavio Roccia, Ferrero’s head of product development, has spent nearly 30 years as an expert taster and describes the company’s pursuit of perfection as an art.</p> <p>“Our responsibility is to check the right balance of the contrasting ingredients, their aroma, texture, and taste – from the delicate, crunchy hazelnut in a delicious, creamy filling to the crispy wafer shell covered with milk chocolate and gently roasted hazelnut pieces,” Roccia says.</p>    <p>“We want to guarantee that Ferrero Rocher is a quality multisensory experience for you each time.”</p> <p>The trajectory from family-owned pastry shop to global business has been underpinned by a commitment to consistent quality. More than 2,000 Ferrero employees are trained chocolate “taste testers”, making up quality-tasting panels across the globe. Quality checks are performed at raw material and semi-finished stages as well as on the final product.</p> <p>Kinder chocolate, the core product in the two-toned, toy-concealing joy that is a Kinder Surprise egg, is subject to 360,000 controls each year alone.</p> <p>Michele Ferrero, son of the iconic Ferrero company founder Pietro Ferrero, once said that while most chocolate producers assess value through a cost-per-kilogram metric, Ferrero was focused on cost per fragrance. While the product range has evolved – and will continue to do so, with 100 or so new concepts explored each year – the commitment to quality has ensured the Ferrero name has stayed firmly on our lips.</p> <p><em><strong><a href="http://www.ferrero.com/au/en/about-us/quality-at-heart" rel="nofollow">From a small family pastry shop to some of the world’s most loved brands.
