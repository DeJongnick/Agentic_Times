<p>It’s easy to understand why the question is often asked: might Wordle – or the crossword, or the sudoku – be a shield against forgetfulness, senescence, even dementia? After all, puzzles sit right there, new ones appearing among the news every day. And in fiction we’ve seen the very smartest people – the people superspy George Smiley turns to for advice – knocking off wordplay while cracking espionage rings.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2024/oct/21/how-to-solve-cryptic-crosswords-the-ultimate-beginners-guide">How to solve cryptic crosswords – the ultimate beginner’s guide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to detail, though, the answer has one of two flavours. The first, the responsible flavour, is a gentle letdown: dedicated solvers may be intellectually active, but perhaps that’s why they’re dedicated solvers. Or: doing puzzles might make you better at something, but that something could be limited to the doing of puzzles.</p> <p>The second kind of answer is heavy on metaphor: your brain is a muscle and will atrophy without a daily workout. This is the kind of answer you hear only from people who have a product named something like Your Daily Brain Workout App (first week free).</p> <p>Enlightenment comes from asking smaller questions. For example, probability theorist John McSweeney has asked why …</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>a solver, presented with two puzzles of ostensibly equal difficulty, may solve one readily and be stumped by the other</p> </blockquote> <p>… which I discovered in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/why-solving-crosswords-is-like-a-phase-transition/">some recent writing</a> on how <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2462654-maths-quirk-explains-why-crosswords-are-so-hard-until-they-arent/">the term “percolation problem”</a> can be used to describe the moment when the grid contains enough written-in answers that the rest seem to start solving themselves.</p> <p>The utter delight that accompanies that moment is the answer to a much more sensible question than “are crosswords a kind of Alzheimer’s prophylactic?” The question: is it a good thing to solve puzzles? The answer: yes, they bring delight to our lives. In a world seemingly intent on pathologising and medicalising the things we try to do, a puzzle can surely be left alone and understood as something we’re allowed to do purely because it’s fun.</p> <p>PS in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/crossword-blog/2025/jan/27/which-members-of-the-cabinet-are-crossword-worthy">our cluing conference for WHIPS</a>, the runners-up are <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/108179952?page=1">KenJam</a>’s charming “Cats like what chef does with cream” and <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/16906979?page=1">GappyTooth</a>’s stark “Those who give discipline to politicians in leathers”; the winner is the raucous “These cats know how to organise a party!” Kludos to <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/10016346?page=1">Peshwari</a>.
