<p>Tube workers are to stage a series of strikes next month in a dispute over pay and conditions amid an intensifying dispute with managers.</p> <p>The Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said its members would take industrial action for seven days from 5 September amid a dispute over pay and workload, among other things.</p> <p>In a separate dispute, RMT members on London’s Docklands Light Railway will also be striking in the week beginning 7 September.</p> <p>London Underground (LU) workers and management have been discussing workers’ demands on pay, fatigue management, shift patterns and a reduced working week. But union leaders have claimed management have refused to engage seriously.</p> <p>“Our members are doing a fantastic job to keep our capital moving and work strenuous shift patterns to make sure Londoners get to their destinations around the clock,” said the RMT’s general secretary, Eddie Dempsey.</p> <p>“They are not after a king’s ransom, but fatigue and extreme shift rotations are serious issues impacting on our members’ health and wellbeing – all of which have not been adequately addressed for years by LU management.</p> <p>“Coupled with the fact there are outstanding issues around staff travel arrangements, an atmosphere of distrust has been created, where our members feel like no one is listening to them.</p> <p>“RMT will continue to engage LU management with a view to seeking a revised offer in order to reach a negotiated settlement.”</p> <p>Docklands Light Railway workers have also been in discussions about pay and conditions.</p> <p>A Transport for London spokesperson said: “We regularly meet with our trade unions to discuss any concerns that they may have, and we recently met with the RMT to discuss some specific points.</p> <p>“We are committed to ensuring our colleagues are treated fairly and, as well as offering a 3.4% pay increase in our ongoing pay discussions, we have made progress on a number of commitments we have made previously.</p> <p>“We welcome further engagement with our unions about fatigue and rostering across London Underground, but a reduction in the contractual 35-hour working week is neither practical nor affordable.</p> <p>“Given the improvements we have recently put in place in response to concerns raised by our unions, we urge the RMT to put our fair, affordable pay offer to their members and to continue to engage with us rather than threaten strike action, which will only disrupt Londoners.”</p>
