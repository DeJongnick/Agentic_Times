    <p>Blind date is Saturday’s dating column: every week, two strangers are paired up for dinner and drinks, and then spill the beans to us, answering a set of questions. This runs, with a photograph we take of each dater before the date, in Saturday magazine (in the UK) and online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date">theguardian.com</a>&nbsp;every Saturday. It’s been running since 2009 – you can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/31/10-years-of-blind-date-weddings-babies-lost-knickers">read all about how we put it together here</a>.<br><br><b>What questions will I be asked?</b><br>We ask about age, location, occupation, hobbies, interests and the type of person you are looking to meet. If you do not think these questions cover everything you would like to know, tell us what’s on your mind.</p>
    <p><b>Can I choose who I match with?</b><br>No, it’s a blind date! But we do ask you a bit about your interests, preferences, etc – the more you tell us, the better the match is likely to be.</p>
    <p><b>Can I pick the photograph?</b><br>No, but don't worry: we'll choose the nicest ones.</p>
    <p><b>What personal details will appear?</b><br>Your first name, job and age.</p>
    <p><b>How should I answer?</b><br>Honestly but respectfully. Be mindful of how it will read to your date, and that Blind date reaches a large audience, in print and online.</p>
    <p><b>Will I see the other person’s answers?<br></b>No. We may edit yours and theirs for a range of reasons, including length, and we may ask you for more details.</p>
    <p><b>Will you find me The One?<br></b>We’ll try! Marriage! Babies!</p>
    <p><b>Can I do it in my home town?<br></b>Only if it’s in the UK. Many of our applicants live in London, but we would love to hear from people living elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Bryn on Jane</h2> 
<p><strong>What were you hoping for?</strong><br>A free meal and to meet someone new … and you never know where it will go. </p> 
<p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br>A lovely, friendly smile and demeanour.</p> 
<p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br>Sport. Music. Beer. Family stuff. There were no awkward silences. </p> 
<p><strong>Most awkward moment?</strong><br>When I said I needed to get off, as I&nbsp;think Jane wanted me to stay longer. I&nbsp;would’ve done so happily, but&nbsp;the early start time threw me a bit.</p> 
<p><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br>Yes.</p> 
<p><strong>Best thing about Jane?</strong><br>She was just lovely to get on with. She’s a real ale drinker and loves rock music – she even knew the song&nbsp;lyrics that I have etched on my&nbsp;arms – Nick&nbsp;Cave and Roberta Flack.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you introduce Jane to your friends?</strong><br>Yes, and I think she felt the same way.</p> 
<p><strong>Describe Jane in three words?</strong><br>Chatty, friendly, easygoing.</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think Jane made of you?<br></strong>I think Jane thought the same as me – we got on really well.</p> 
<p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?<br></strong>We didn’t as we both had to get home on public transport.</p> 
<p><strong>And ... did you kiss?<br></strong>We hugged as&nbsp;friends.</p> 
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about the </strong><strong>date, what would it be?<br></strong>The timing – 1pm was too early.</p> 
<p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong><br>As a friend and fellow real ale drinker she’s a solid 8/10, but I’m not sure there was a romantic spark.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong><br>We will meet for a drink at some point.</p>
