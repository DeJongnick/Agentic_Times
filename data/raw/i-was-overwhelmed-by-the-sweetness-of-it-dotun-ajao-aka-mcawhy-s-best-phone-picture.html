<p>Dotun Ajao had been juggling a typical Saturday of errands, chores and caring for his&nbsp;three-year-old son, Ireayo. The tired dad had snuck off for a nap when Ireayo found him, and, instead of asking for a snack or to play as he usually would, the toddler quietly climbed into bed and used his father’s head as a pillow.</p> <p>“I was overwhelmed by the sweetness of it,” says the Lagos-born photographer, who now lives in Norfolk. “I picked up my phone to check the time but then I&nbsp;thought, what if we captured this?”</p> <p>Nearly four years on,&nbsp;Ajao describes the image&nbsp;as one of his most cherished. “I believe the&nbsp;role of a father in his&nbsp;son’s life is often underestimated. A father should be a teacher, guide and protector who builds self-confidence and teaches resilience through life’s inevitable tumbles,” he says.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/04/this-reminds-me-of-how-unglamorous-the-film-industry-can-be-jake-polonskys-best-phone-picture">‘This reminds me of how unglamorous the film industry can be’: Jake Polonsky’s best phone picture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ajao says the pair remain the best of friends. “With him, I feel like I can let my guard down and embrace that inner child that gets buried beneath the responsibilities of adulthood. We talk as friends and sometimes I’m amazed by his insight; once he said to me, ‘It doesn’t matter if&nbsp;the photo looks good, as&nbsp;long as it reminds us of a beautiful adventure.’ This would be my advice&nbsp;to anyone who thinks they&nbsp;don’t have a&nbsp;fancy&nbsp;camera, only an&nbsp;old phone.”</p> <p>After taking the photo, Ajao tried to sleep, but only managed a few minutes before he had to get up and continue his day. He manoeuvred himself gently from beneath his son. Ireayo slept on.<br><br></p>
