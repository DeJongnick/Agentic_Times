<h1>Sellafield nuclear clean-up too slow and too costly, say MPs </h1>

<p>MPs have warned about the speed and cost of cleaning up the Sellafield nuclear waste dump and raised concerns over a “suboptimal” workplace culture at the site.</p> <p>Members of parliament’s public accounts committee (PAC) urged the government and bosses at the sprawling collection of crumbling buildings in Cumbria to get a grasp on the “intolerable risks” presented by its ageing infrastructure.</p> <p>In a detailed report into the site, the PAC said Sellafield was not moving quickly enough to tackle its biggest hazards; raised the alarm over its culture; and said the government was not ensuring value for money was being achieved from taxpayer funds.</p> <p>In 2023, the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/series/nuclear-leaks">Nuclear Leaks</a> investigation revealed a string of safety concerns at the site – including escalating fears over a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/05/sellafield-nuclear-site-leak-could-pose-risk-to-public">leak of radioactive liquid</a> from a decaying building known as the Magnox swarf storage silo (MSSS) – as well as cybersecurity failings and allegations of a poor workplace culture.</p> <p>The PAC – which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/20/whistleblowers-at-nuclear-sites-may-face-bullying-and-threats-mps-warn">heard evidence</a> in March from Sellafield and its oversight body, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) – found that the state-owned company had missed most of its annual targets to retrieve waste from several buildings, including the MSSS.</p> <p>“As a result of Sellafield’s underperformance [the MSSS] will likely remain extremely hazardous for longer,” the MPs said.</p> <p>The ultimate cost of cleaning up Sellafield, which contains waste from weapons programmes and atomic power generation, has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/23/sellafield-cleanup-cost-136bn-national-audit-office">estimated at £136bn</a> and could take more than 100 years.</p> <p>Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the PAC, said: “Unfortunately, our latest report is interleaved with a number of examples of failure, cost overruns, and continuing safety concerns. Given the tens of billions at stake, and the dangers on site to both the environment and human life, this is simply not good enough.”</p> <p>He added: “As with the fight against climate change, the sheer scale of the hundred-year timeframe of the decommissioning project makes it hard to grasp the immediacy of safety hazards and cost overruns that delays can have.</p> <p>“Every day at Sellafield is a race against time to complete works before buildings reach the end of their life. Our report contains too many signs that this is a race that Sellafield risks losing.”</p> <p>MPs noted that one project, a now-paused replacement of an on-site lab, had resulted in “£127m wasted”.</p> <p>The cost of cleaning up Sellafield has caused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/23/sellafield-cleanup-cost-136bn-national-audit-office">tensions with the Treasury</a> as the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, attempts to tighten public spending and spur growth. Sellafield, which is home to the world’s largest store of plutonium, said in February that nearly £3bn in new funding was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/sellafield-nuclear-site-cuts-funding-union-spending">“not enough”</a>.</p> <p>Last year, Sellafield apologised and was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/02/sellafield-ordered-to-pay-nearly-400000-over-cybersecurity-failings">fined £332,500</a> after it pleaded guilty to criminal charges over years of cybersecurity failings.</p> <p>The PAC noted that the timeline for a government project to create a long-term deep underground store for nuclear waste, including that held at Sellafield, had slipped from 2040 to the late 2050s. The government is considering sites in Cumbria and Lincolnshire, although Lincolnshire county council is expected to withdraw the latter from the process after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/03/itll-be-a-shortlist-of-one-villagers-in-england-fear-nuclear-dump-proposal">vocal local opposition</a>.</p> <p>The MPs said they had found “indications of a suboptimal culture” at Sellafield, and noted that the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/event/23305/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/">NDA paid £377,200</a> in 2023-24 to settle employment-related claims. Alison McDermott, a former HR consultant who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/06/sellafield-toxic-culture-bullying-harassment-safety">raised concerns over bullying and a “toxic culture”</a> at the site, said she felt “vindicated” by the report.</p> <p>The PAC urged the government to set out how it would hold the NDA and Sellafield to account over its performance. It said Sellafield should report annually on progress against targets and explain how it is addressing the deteriorating condition of its assets. The NDA should publish data on the prevalence of bullying and harassment at nuclear sites, it said.</p> <p>Clifton-Brown said there were “early indications of some improvements in Sellafield’s delivery” but said the government needed to do “far more” to ensure bosses safeguard the public and taxpayer funds.</p> <p>The NDA’s chief executive, David Peattie, responding on behalf of Sellafield, said: “We welcome the scrutiny of the committee and their report. We will now look in more detail at the recommendations and consider how best to address them.</p> <p>“We take the findings seriously, and the safety of the site and the wellbeing of our people will always be our highest priorities.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We expect the highest standards of safety and security as former nuclear sites are dismantled, and the regulator is clear that public safety is not compromised at Sellafield.</p> <p>“We continue to support the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in its oversight of Sellafield, while driving value for money. This is underpinned by monthly performance reviews and increased responsibility for overseeing major project performance, enabling more direct scrutiny and intervention.</p> <p>“We have zero-tolerance of bullying, harassment and offensive behaviour in the workplace – we expect Sellafield and the NDA to operate on this basis, investigate allegations and take robust action when needed.”</p>
