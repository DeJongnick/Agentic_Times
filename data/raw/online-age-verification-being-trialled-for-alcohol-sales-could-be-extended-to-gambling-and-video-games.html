<p>Online age verification for alcohol purchases is being trialled in Australia, new documents reveal, as the federal government considers whether similar technology could be applied to gambling and adult sites.</p> <p>The Morrison government has tasked the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, with developing a “roadmap” for an age verification system for adult content by the end of 2022, but documents released under freedom of information laws reveal options are already being trialled.</p> <p>Draft talking points and a slide deck from early August <a href="https://www.righttoknow.org.au/request/provision_of_online_age_verifica#incoming-23495">released on the transparency website Right to Know this week</a>, show the Digital Transformation Agency has been preparing for age verification and digital ID trials from September this year.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/16/scared-about-the-threat-of-ai-its-the-big-tech-giants-that-need-reining-in">Scared about the threat of AI? It’s the big tech giants that need reining in | Devdatt Dubhashi and Shalom Lappin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the talking points, the trial was to be conducted with online retailers in Australia, using external ID providers Australia Post and Mastercard.</p> <p>The beta trials had been expected to run for between three and six months, with 100 users per use case, starting first with online alcohol purchases in September, and then gambling websites at a date to be determined.</p> <p>When asked about these trials, the Digital Transformation Agency insisted it was “not actively participating in these trials” which they said were being run by private businesses.</p> <p>“DTA’s work with the private sector on the topic of online age verification has focused on discussions and discovery activities with organisations engaged in the Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) accreditation process,” a spokesperson said.</p> <p>The DTA did not answer questions on which businesses were involved or how many customers had been recruited.</p> <p>The documents reveal the government is planning to use the trials to inform online age verification policy, and track the impact on revenue, as well as customer adoption and experience.</p> <p>“Report transaction volumes, technical integration effort and ‘successful’ vs ‘unsuccessful’ authentication ratios to inform Digital Identity charging framework and system oversight,” the notes say.</p> <p>The report recognises the trial is limited to these two areas, and does not explore age verification for online pornography or social media, but says the trials could be expanded in 2022 to cover lootboxes in video games, as well as using the government’s mygovid as a form of age verification.</p> <p>The points recommend the DTA determine whether digital identity legislation would cover age verification, and prepare an “education campaign”, focusing on privacy and security, the accuracy and effectiveness, and the impact on businesses and users.</p> <p>In September, Mastercard announced it was working with the DTA to explore how its digital ID service could support age verification, including signing up for accreditation for the government’s Trusted Digital Identity Framework, which sets out the rules for digital ID providers.</p> <p>The company said it would offer the services to business, but the ID information would be encrypted, and use facial biometrics, “keeping users in complete control of their data and ensuring that only they can access and use it”.</p> <p>In meeting notes from August between the DTA and the esafety commissioner, one DTA staffer stated in the meeting that the agency was focused on finding a system that was least invasive to the user while determining whether they were over 18 years of age.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/16/australia-and-us-sign-cloud-act-deal-to-help-law-enforcement-agencies-demand-data-from-tech-giants">Australia and US sign Cloud Act deal to help law enforcement agencies demand data from tech giants</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We prefer systems that are not an unnecessary burden to those wishing to access content or services which they are entitled to use,” they said.</p> <p>The announcement of Mastercard’s involvement in digital ID was met with concern from adult content creators because of the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-mastercards-new-porn-rules-should-scare-everyone">reportedly stringent rules</a> for adult sites to keep and maintain records, making the sites a target for hackers seeking personal information.</p> <p>Details of the planned trial comes as the Online Safety Act – the legislation which kicked off the process to begin requiring age verification for online content – will be brought into effect in late January next year.</p> <p>In addition to outlining how the adult cyberbullying scheme will come into effect – giving the commissioner powers to issue takedown notices to social media on abusive content – the regulatory guidance issued by Inman Grant on Thursday confirmed plans to develop a code for social media sites, messaging services, search engines, apps and internet service providers to ensure adult content is not accessible to children within six months of the law coming into effect.</p> <p>“Esafety must make reasonable efforts to make sure an adequate code for each section of the online industry is registered within six months of commencement of the Act. However, the Act allows for standards to be imposed if the online industry cannot reach agreement on codes,” the document states.</p> <p>Tech companies have previously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/sep/24/fears-adult-content-and-sex-workers-will-be-forced-offline-under-new-australian-tech-industry-code">raised concern</a> that the plan would force all adult content and sex workers offline.</p>
