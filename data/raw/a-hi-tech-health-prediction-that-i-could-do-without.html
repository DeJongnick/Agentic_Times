If, say, the tool forecasts that I have a 30% chance of suffering from a horrible condition within the next five years, I’m not sure whether that would be good news or bad.<br><strong>Sam White</strong><br><em>Lewes, East Sussex</em></p> <p>• Bringing the dodo back is interesting (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/17/dodo-birds-gene-editing-advance">Scientists claim they’ve made ‘pivotal step’ in bringing back the dodo for first time in 300 years, 17 September</a>), but perhaps futile with <em>Homo sapiens</em>’ insistence on destroying the planet.
