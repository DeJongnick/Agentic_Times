<p>A missing data file containing the details of hundreds of maternity cases was most likely deleted “intentionally or maliciously”, a police investigation has concluded.</p> <p>Nottinghamshire police began an investigation in February into the temporary loss of the computer file at Nottingham university hospitals (NUH) NHS trust.</p> <p>The trust is at the centre of the largest maternity inquiry in the history of the NHS, examining deaths and harm spanning more than a decade at the Queen’s Medical Centre and Nottingham city hospital.</p> <p>The police force’s cyber team said the deletion was “most likely to be the action of an individual” but the loss “was not caused or contributed to by any systemic corruption within NUH”.</p> <p>A letter to families involved in the inquiry, seen by the BBC, from assistant chief constable Rob Griffin, said the deletion was “most likely to have been done intentionally/maliciously rather than accidentally”.</p> <p>Police said the identity of the culprit could not be determined.</p> <p>The trust previously said the computer file went missing in July 2024 for a few days. It was recovered after its deletion was spotted by the trust and led to about 300 more cases being added to the maternity inquiry.</p> <p>Nearly 2,500 cases are being examined by the senior midwife, Donna Ockenden, and a national team of leading doctors and midwives, whose review is due to conclude in summer 2026.</p> <p>A statement from the Nottingham Affected Families Group said: “Nottingham families would like to thank the police for their determined investigation. We are distressed that they were unable to find who did this.</p> <p>“We are appalled to hear this news, though sadly we are not surprised … To know that there is most likely an individual who is capable of such behaviour is devastating for the already harmed and for the future of NUH safety.</p> <p>“We call for openness at this worrying time and for the individual, their colleagues or anyone who knows anything about this to come forward as a matter of urgency. This is a patient safety emergency.”</p> <p>Anthony May, chief executive of NUH, said: “I would like to thank Nottinghamshire police for their support in investigating this matter and we accept their findings. Upon discovering the issue, the trust informed Nottinghamshire police and engaged fully in the investigation.</p> <p>“We have put appropriate measures in place to secure digital files so that this cannot happen again.”</p> <p>Last week, Nottinghamshire police said they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/02/police-launch-corporate-manslaughter-inquiry-into-nottingham-hospital-trust">were investigating possible corporate manslaughter</a> at the trust over the deaths and severe harm of more than 2,000 babies and women.</p> <p>Det Supt Matthew Croome said at the time that the alleged offences related to “circumstances where an organisation has been grossly negligent in the management of its activities, which has then led to a person’s death”.</p>
