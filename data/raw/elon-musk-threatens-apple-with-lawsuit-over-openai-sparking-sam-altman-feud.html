<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> has threatened legal action against Apple on behalf of his artificial intelligence startup xAI, accusing the iPhone maker of favoring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/openai">OpenAI</a> and breaching antitrust regulations in managing the rankings in its App Store. The posts elicited snide responses from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/sam-altman">Sam Altman</a>, the OpenAI CEO, and began a spat between the two former business partners on X.</p> <p>“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action,” Musk said in a post on X.</p> <p>In a post earlier that day, he wrote: “Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/twitter">X</a> is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics?”</p> <p>OpenAI’s ChatGPT currently holds the top spot in the App Store’s “Top Free Apps” section in the US, while xAI’s Grok ranks fifth. Apple has a partnership with OpenAI that integrates <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> into iPhones, iPads and Macs. Apple and xAI did not provide comment.</p> <p>Altman responded to Musk on X: “This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like.” Musk has bent X’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/15/elon-musk-changes-twitter-algorithm-super-bowl-slump-report">algorithmic recommendations</a> to favor his own tweets, according to multiple reports.</p> <p>Altman and Musk founded OpenAI together in 2015, but Musk left the startup and rescinded funding in 2018 after proposing to take it over, a petition other executives rebuffed. Musk has since sued the company twice over its planned transition to a for-profit enterprise, alleging “deceit of Shakespearean proportions”. Altman has cast Musk as a bitter and petty ex-partner who was jealous of the company’s success after departing.</p> <p>Musk replied to Altman’s tweet: “You got 3M views on your bullshit post, you liar, far more than I’ve received on many of mine, despite me having 50 times your follower count!”</p> <p>Altman replied to Musk multiple times, first calling his lack of views a “skill issue”, then “or bots”, and then offered a legal question of his own: “Will you sign an affidavit that you have never directed changes to the X algorithm in a way that has hurt your competitors or helped your own companies? i will apologize if so.”</p> <p>Users on X – through the community notes feature – have pointed out that a few apps besides OpenAI have taken the top spot on the App Store this year.</p> <p>Chinese AI app DeepSeek reached the No 1 spot on the platform in January, while in July, Perplexity took first place in India’s App Store – both occurring after the OpenAI and Apple partnership struck last year.</p> <p>One user asked X’s native AI, Grok, who was right in the feud. The <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1955284926611537983">chatbot replied</a>: “Based on verified evidence, Sam Altman is right.”</p> <p>Musk’s comments come as regulators and rivals intensify scrutiny of Apple’s control over its App Store.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Apple was ordered to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/07/apple-appeals-eu-fine-app-store">pay a fine of €500m</a> ($581.15m) by the EU antitrust enforcer, which said the company’s restrictions prevented developers from steering users outside the App Store.</p> <p>The US Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in early 2024, accusing the iPhone maker of creating and maintaining “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/21/us-antitrust-lawsuit-apple">broad, sustained, and illegal</a>” smartphone monopoly.</p>
