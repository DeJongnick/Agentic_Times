<p>Musician Frank Benbini is most probably known best as the drummer from Fun Lovin’ Criminals and a latter incarnation of UB40, although as this documentary (which Benbini executive produced) reveals, he’s got a lot of different irons on the proverbial fire; these include a beat combo called Uncle Frank and a reggae group called Radio Riddler. There are other side projects as well, musical and music-adjacent – the occasional bit of barbering with an old friend from Leicester with whom he co-owns a salon, and DJing on BBC Radio Leicester.</p> <p>Clearly the man has a strong work ethic despite a hard partying image and songs about getting high. A few of his colleagues and employees dare to suggest that he can be a bit of hard taskmaster with a combustible temper. You can’t help wonder what sort of film might have emerged if this weren’t being directed by one of Benbini’s best friends, Steve Baker, who also shot many of his videos over the years. But Benbini’s chatter about himself, his friends and his life reveals quite a bit: you come away with the impression that he truly loves his family and performing, is a bit of prankster, but whatever, he’s a nice enough bloke – albeit one with his own share of anxiety and occasional inability to cope.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9vp4zUtVDs"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B9vp4zUtVDs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Benbini’s actual music might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but his drumming is certainly tight, and the section where he talks about reggae covers of Prince songs, and collaborating with Sinead O’Connor is arguably the most interesting. (This is also where Baker’s skills as an editor, cutting on the beat, come most to the fore.) The whole thing is clearly a bit of a vanity project, but not an uninteresting one.</p> <p>• To Be Frank is in UK cinemas from 12 September.</p>
