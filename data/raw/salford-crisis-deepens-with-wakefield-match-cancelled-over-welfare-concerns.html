<p>The crisis at Salford Red Devils has deepened on and off the field in the past 24 hours. On Thursday, their chief operating officer claimed she had resigned after the club’s ­ownership suggested she “sleep with someone at the RFL” to ­alleviate their financial issues and on Friday the club’s Super League game against Wakefield on Sunday was&nbsp;cancelled.</p> <p>The Red Devils have been embroiled in controversy for most of 2025, following a takeover by a consortium led by Dario Berta. Players and staff have repeatedly been paid late, most of their first-team squad have left and the club is in court next month over an unpaid tax bill of almost £700,000.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/31/joe-burgess-scores-four-tries-as-hull-kr-thrashing-of-salford-raises-big-questions">Hull KR’s ‘embarrassing’ 74-12 demolition of Salford raises big questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Matters hit a new low when Claire Bradbury, who joined as COO from rugby union’s Sale Sharks last year, announced she was leaving before saying she had been subject to “misogynistic language” from the club’s ownership.</p> <p>In a statement posted online she said: “It’s important to share ­something more personal, as a ­senior woman in business. ­Misogynistic, ­inappropriate language from the ownership ­suggesting I sleep with an individual at the RFL to ‘smooth things over’ is not acceptable.</p> <p>“At the time I stayed quiet because I wanted the club to succeed. I’m disappointed in myself that I didn’t stand up to it then so I’m voicing it now as it should be heard for the integrity and evolution of rugby league, and for all women who work in sport.</p> <p>“Repeated delays in salary ­payments, an absence of ­essential operational tools, and a lack of agreed structure, strategy, or investment have significantly impacted the ability of staff to perform their jobs effectively.”</p> <p>Salford responded to the allegations by announcing they will undertake an internal investigation, but the crisis took a further turn on Friday, when they conceded to the RFL that their game with Wakefield should be called off to protect the welfare of the players.</p> <p>They had 17 available, only two of which have appeared in Super League in the past 12 months, and would have to field a side ­predominantly filled with teenagers. Many Super League clubs have opted against loaning them players, having done so last week when Salford were beaten 80-6 by Hull FC. Unsurprisingly, the reserve game against Huddersfield on Saturday has also been called off.</p> <p>The RFL said they, Rugby League Commercial and Rugby League Cares have been in discussions with Salford throughout the week.</p> <p>Salford will probably have to forfeit the game 48-0, but they remain hopeful of being able to stage next Sunday’s game against Leigh, with several injured players due to return.</p> <p>However, it remains probable that whatever happens in the final six weeks of the regular season, ­Salford will not be a Super League club in 2026 and beyond, with the club set to be removed after a ­turbulent year that has now plummeted to fresh&nbsp;depths.</p>
