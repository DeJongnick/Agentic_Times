<p>The legal rights to an education that meets the needs of children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) are under threat. Many thousands of children risk being denied vital provision, or losing access to education altogether.</p> <p>As new education reforms loom, every sign from the government suggests the right to an education, health and care plan (EHCP) is to be removed from children attending mainstream schools. Local authorities want EHCPs drastically reduced, or removed altogether, to relieve them of duties they often find costly and troublesome.</p> <p>About 85% of children with Send are educated in mainstream settings. Over 270,000 of these children have EHCPs. These legally enforceable documents detail a child or young person’s needs, and the support to enable them to fulfil their individual potential. EHCPs allow children and young people with all kinds of disabilities to receive an education.</p> <p>Without statutory support, underpinned by necessary extra resources for schools, it’s extremely unlikely that ministers will achieve their aim of more children with Send thriving, or even surviving, in mainstream education. A reduction or complete snatching-away of EHCPs in mainstream education wouldn’t mean their needs magically vanish. It would, instead, increase applications for already overcrowded special schools or mean they would be forced out of school altogether.</p> <p>We believe the public are on our side, and we support the newly launched Save Our Children’s Rights (SOCR) campaign led by Special Needs Jungle, IPSEA and others. This campaign is calling for EHCPs to be retained, now and in the future. SOCR’s recent <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/711021">petition</a>&nbsp;reflecting this aim rapidly passed 100,000 signatures, meaning the issue will be considered for a parliamentary debate, and is still growing.</p> <p>For more than 40 years, children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities have had a statutory right to an education that meets their needs. Set alongside catastrophic plans to cut benefits for disabled people, this raises the question of who we are as a country and the kind of society in which we want to live. Whatever the Send system’s problems, the answer is not to remove the rights of children and young people. Families cannot afford to lose these precious legal protections.</p> <p><strong>Amel Alghrani</strong><strong> </strong><em>Professor, school of law and social justice, University of Liverpool</em><br><strong>Elizabeth Archer</strong><strong> </strong><em>CEO, PDA Society</em><br><strong>Jane Asher</strong><strong> </strong><em>President, National Autistic Society</em><br><strong>Prof</strong> <strong>Simon Baron-Cohen</strong><strong> </strong><em>Director, Autism Research Centre, Cambridge University</em><br><strong>Anna Bird</strong><em> CEO, Contact</em><br><strong>Ian Birrell</strong><strong> </strong><em>Journalist and disability campaigner</em><br><strong>Alison Bloomer</strong><strong> </strong><em>Editor, Learning Disability Today</em><br><strong>Carol Boys</strong><strong> </strong><em>Chief executive</em><em>, Down’s Syndrome Association</em><br><strong>Lucy Bray</strong><strong> </strong><em>Professor in child health literacy, Edge Hill University</em><br><strong>Jane Campbell</strong> <em>Disability rights campaigner</em><br><strong>Madeleine Cassidy</strong><strong> </strong><em>CEO, IPSEA (Independent Provider of Special Education Advice</em>)<br><strong>Samantha Clark</strong><strong> </strong><em>CEO, Learning Disability England</em><br><strong>Luke Clements</strong><strong> </strong><em>Cerebra professor of law and social justice, Leeds University</em><br><strong>Dr Mine Conkbayir</strong> <em>Early years researcher, author and consultant</em><br><strong>Justin Cooke</strong><strong> </strong><em>Head of policy and influencing, National Deaf Children’s Society</em><br><strong>Claire Coussins</strong><strong> </strong><em>Director of fundraising and engagement, Kids</em><br><strong>Claire Dorer</strong><strong> </strong><em>CEO, National Association of Special Schools</em><br><strong>Rachel Filmer</strong><strong> </strong><em>Founder, Send Rights Alliance</em><br><strong>Anita Franklin</strong><strong> </strong><em>Professor of childhood studies, Manchester Metropolitan University</em><br><strong>Carrie Grant</strong><strong> </strong><em>Broadcaster and Send parent</em><br><strong>Fazilet Hadi</strong><strong> </strong><em>Head of policy, Disability Rights UK</em><br><strong>Jane Harris</strong><strong> </strong><em>CEO, Speech and Language UK</em><br><strong>John Harris</strong><strong> </strong><em>Journalist, writer and Send parent</em><br><strong>Angela Hassiotis</strong><strong> </strong><em>Professor in intellectual disability, University College London</em><br><strong>Ben Higgins</strong><strong> </strong><em>CEO, Bild</em><br><strong>Cherylee Houston</strong> <em>Actor and disability campaigner</em><br><strong>Dr Rhidian Hughes</strong><strong> </strong><em>CEO, Voluntary Organisations Disability Group</em><br><strong>Sarah Johnson</strong><strong> </strong><em>President, PRUsAP</em><br><strong>Dr Anna Kennedy</strong> <em>Autism charity founder and campaigner</em><br><strong>Jolanta Lasota</strong><strong> </strong><em>CEO, Ambitious About Autism</em><br><strong>Dr Tony Lloyd</strong><strong> </strong><em>Former</em> <em>CEO, ADHD Foundation</em><br><strong>Christine McGuinness</strong><strong> </strong><em>Broadcaster, campaigner and Send parent</em><br><strong>David Mitchell</strong><strong> </strong><em>Novelist and Send parent</em><br><strong>Rosa Monckton</strong> <em>Disability and Send campaigner</em><br><strong>Emma Murphy</strong><strong> </strong><em>Managing director,</em> <em>INFACT (Independent Fetal Anti Convulsant Trust)</em><br><strong>Chris Packham</strong><strong> </strong><em>Broadcaster and neurodiversity campaigner</em><br><strong>Scarlet Page</strong><strong> </strong><em>Photographer and Send parent</em><br><strong>Liz Pellicano</strong><strong> </strong><em>Professor of autism research, University College London</em><br><strong>Sally Phillips</strong><strong> </strong><em>Actor, campaigner and Send parent</em><br><strong>Sharon Pratt</strong><strong> </strong><em>Founder member,</em> <em>Send National Crisis</em><br><strong>Tom Purser</strong><strong> </strong><em>CEO, Autism Action</em><br><strong>Brian Roberts</strong><strong> </strong><em>Director of education and wellbeing, National Association for Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, and Send parent</em><br><strong>Katherine Runswick-Cole</strong><strong> </strong><em>Professor and chair in education, University of Sheffield</em><br><strong>Sara Ryan</strong><strong> </strong><em>Professor of social care, Manchester Metropolitan University</em><br><strong>Saba Salman</strong><strong> </strong><em>Journalist and campaigner</em><br><strong>Melissa Simmonds</strong><strong> </strong><em>Autistic campaigner and Send parent</em><br><strong>Tom Shakespeare</strong><strong> </strong><em>Professor of disability research, London School of Hygiene &amp;
