<p>Amazon has dropped a set of “gunless” James Bond posters from its Prime Video streaming platform after protests that it was sanitising the brand that its studio arm, Amazon MGM studios, bought <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/21/stars-shaken-stirred-amazon-deal-james-bond">for more than $1bn in February</a>.</p> <p>The streaming platform had issued <a href="https://www.joblo.com/amazon-removes-all-guns-from-james-bond-digital-posters-on-prime/">a new set of digital poster artwork</a>, to coincide <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/03/how-do-you-celebrate-james-bond-day-when-you-dont-know-who-the-next-007-will-be">with James Bond day on Sunday</a>, intended for use as thumbnail imagery on its own and other platforms. However fans quickly noticed that even by the standards of bland streaming-platform imagery, the results were particularly startling.</p> <p>Most prominently, all guns appeared to have been removed from already well known images, including a portrait of Sean Connery cradling a Walther PPK pistol in his crossed arms used as a publicity shot for Dr No, and <a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw17287/Sean-Connery-as-James-Bond-in-Dr-No">now in the National Portrait Gallery</a>. A widely seen <a href="https://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/news/international-spectre-teaser-posters">teaser poster for the Daniel Craig film Spectre</a> has been apparently edited to crop out the gun he is holding by his side (though the shoulder holster Craig wears is still visible). A similar crop appears to have been made on a <a href="https://bamfstyle.com/2016/04/01/lald-black-turtleneck/">publicity image of Roger Moore in Live and Let Die</a>, in which Moore is holding a .44 Magnum, a departure from the Bond tradition of relatively small handguns.</p> <p>Criticism of the move erupted immediately across social media, and the new artwork was immediately denounced as “woke” by outlets including <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/36913109/amazon-remove-guns-james-bond-artwork-prime-video/">the Sun</a> and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15161727/James-Bond-fans-blast-woke-Amazon-007-posters.html">the Daily Mail</a>.</p> <p>However, Amazon has now removed the artwork from its Prime Video streaming platform, replacing it with more traditional still images from the films themselves – though notably also gun-free.</p> <p>Amazon has been contacted for comment.</p>
