<p>A Senedd member has demanded that Dŵr Cymru, or Welsh Water, invest more money in pumping stations after beachgoers reported raw sewage “seeping” on to a popular beach in north Wales during the peak of the school summer holidays.</p> <p>The effluent ran on to West Shore, near Llandudno, from under the roller-shutter door of a pumping station at the beach’s car park, Janet Finch-Saunders, MS for Aberconwy, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service.</p> <p>“It is not acceptable. Our hotels are working flat out to accommodate our visitors. The kids are off school.</p> <p>“This is when residents and visitors want to take a dip in the sea. Surfers Against Sewage are also finding that beaches in north Wales in my constituency have pollution levels that are much too high.</p> <p>“I’ve written to Welsh Water … They are going to have to invest some money to stop this happening.”</p> <p>Dŵr Cymru is a not-for-profit that supplies drinking and wastewater services to most of the country. Data suggests it is <a href="https://top-of-the-poops.org/company/dwr-cymru-welsh-water">the worst offender of all UK water companies</a> for sewage pollution.</p> <p>The company said that the leak had been caused by a blockage but that “foul water” did not reach the beach or “enter any watercourse and had no detrimental environmental impact”.</p> <p>A crew had attended to clear the blockage of wet wipes and carried out a deep cleaning using specialist kit, a spokesperson said, adding that “the issue of sewer abuse and the resulting flooding costs the company around £5m a year”.</p> <p>Last month, the Welsh government body Natural Resources Wales (NRW) found that in 2024, Dŵr Cymru was responsible for the highest number of sewage pollution incidents in a decade – a 42% increase over 10 years. Six serious incidents were recorded, down from seven in 2023.</p> <p>Dŵr Cymru has faced a slew of legal and regulatory action, including a £40m fine in March 2024 from Ofwat which concluded the company had “misled customers and regulators on its performance on leakage and per capita consumption”.</p> <p>Urgent changes to the sector promised by NRW include a new monitoring team, guidance on hitting improvement targets linked to new pollution reduction legislation and a tightened framework for annual performance assessments.</p> <p>Under UK government plans to scrap Ofwat, Wales is to get its own water watchdog. It is not yet clear whether this will be a new organisation or whether NRW will take on an expanded role.</p>
