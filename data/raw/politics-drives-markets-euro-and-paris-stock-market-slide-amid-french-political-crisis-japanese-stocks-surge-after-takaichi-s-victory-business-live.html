He can call a new parliamentary election. Or he can resign himself and bring forward the presidential election due in in April-May 2027.</p> <p>Since options two and three might bring Marine Le Pen’s far right to power, we believe that Macron will appoint a new Prime Minister and challenge the disparate far right and left wing opposition to cooperate to avoid a profound fiscal and political crisis.</p> <p>With only 28 days in office, Lecornu, 39, becomes the shortest lived PM of the Fifth Republic. His predecessors in the last 12 months, Michel Barnier and François Bayrou, were censured and toppled by the far right and left-wing opposition in the National Assembly when they tried to pass deficit-cutting budgets.</p> <p>Lecornu faced the same fate later this week but he had also lost the confidence of the centre-right part of his minority centre and centre-right coalition. The centre-right Républicains protested they had not been informed of the return of Bruno Le Maire, whom they accuse of betraying their party to join Macron in 2017 and adding €1 trillion to France’s €3.4 trillion debt in his seven years as finance minister.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-06T10:15:37.135Z">at 11.15am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68e38d678f08ebdd65c93589" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-06T09:37:29.988Z">10.37am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>French economist <strong>Olivier</strong> <strong>Blanchard</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Hard to understand what was in Macron/Lecornu’s minds in presenting more or less the same government, with one largely unpopular addition. </p> <p>But equally striking is the degree to which the discussion is about people, and not about issues.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/ojblanchard1/status/1975098204434956307">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hard to understand what was in Macron/Lecornu&#39;s minds in presenting more or less the same government, with one largely unpopular addition.

French yields are rising across the curve and bond prices are sliding, after the new Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu resigned this morning after his new cabinet faced scrutiny and criticism.

The Cac 40 index is down 1.77%, it is underperforming other European indices.</p> <p>The biggest decliners include the luxury sector, such as Hermes and LVMH.
