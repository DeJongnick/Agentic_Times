<h1>Fit in my 40s: welcome to Zuu, the animal-themed exercise regime that makes everybody look ridiculous</h1>

<p>When you try ballet (surely, on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/02/fit-in-my-40s-zoe-williams-ballet" title="">mysemi-recommendation a few months back</a>, you tried ballet?) it is tremendously difficult at first. You look around at all the people who are better than you, and get a vivid snapshot of the intense, technical precision, the practice and the perfectionism involved, which is what makes it work for them and not for you.</p> <p>Well, a <a href="https://worldzuu.com/" title="">Zuu</a> class is&nbsp;the opposite of that. You move like an animal, it’s incredibly hard and everybody else covers way more ground, whether&nbsp;as a sideways gorilla or a crawling bear. But no matter how fast they are, how fit, how unruffled or how well-dressed, everybody looks&nbsp;ridiculous.</p> <p>It’s quite elaborate, the Virgin Active I visit: vast and futuristic, a bit like the spaceship in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/05/wall-e-critics-poll" title="">Wall-E</a>, except there is nobody fat there. The instructors are the capital’s finest, sleek, slick, focused: and also, at least while doing a frog squat, ridiculous.</p> <p>The exercise is exactly what it sounds like: very short bursts of traversing a gym floor on your hands and knees. The frog squat starts much&nbsp;like a regular deep squat – think sitting on&nbsp;an imaginary step a few inches off the floor – except you press your elbows against your knees.&nbsp;The frog jump. Well, just imagine a frog jumping and approximate it. Physical spontaneity is part of the point. Realistically, you’ll never move that much like a bear; your aim&nbsp;here is only to seek the sensation of bear movement so ardently that you forget how much&nbsp;easier it is to stand on two feet.</p> <p>Zuu fitness was invented in Australia by <a href="https://twitter.com/NathanHelberg?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" title="">Nathan&nbsp;Helberg</a>. He was very fit, but only “in set planes”: when he wasn’t doing specific exercises – bench presses and weightlifting and such – Helberg felt “quite weak, even vulnerable to joint instability”. I think it’s an elite athlete thing, this listening to your body. I hear nothing from mine, except appetite, pain and the odd neurotic rash.</p> <p>In getting you to move differently, more elementally, if you will, Zuu aims to explore&nbsp;the full range of your body’s capabilities. The formless, toddler element of it is&nbsp;supposed to be motivating: when you liberate yourself from your learned habits, you can leap as&nbsp;freely as a rabbit (actually, no rabbits are mentioned in any of the Zuu manuals; I just feel that I’ve talked enough about frogs). This exhilaration will push you through what would otherwise be quite a&nbsp;significant pain barrier, because, much like anything that uses your own bodyweight against you, Zuu is extremely high intensity.</p> <p>I got scant pleasure from the galumphing, to be&nbsp;honest. And when did you last see a gorilla worrying about its quads? It is a&nbsp;wickedly tough 20 minutes, though; like any 20-minute workout, it gives your&nbsp;day a fillip – and is at least better than a full 40.</p> <h2>This week I learned</h2> <p>Traditional weight training can impair your muscle groups by isolating them from one another.</p>
