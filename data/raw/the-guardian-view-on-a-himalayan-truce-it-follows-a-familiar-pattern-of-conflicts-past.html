<h1>The Guardian view on a Himalayan truce: it follows a familiar pattern of conflicts past</h1>

<p>“The arms race between India and Pakistan poses perhaps the most probable prospect for future use of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons,” James Woolsey, the CIA director, <a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/1999/05/20/the-most-dangerous-place-on-earth">told</a> Congress in 1993. That assessment is relevant now, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/india-pakistan-military-reprisals-escalate-what-we-know-so-far">days</a> of escalating conflict that included missile and drone strikes on military bases. It is a uniquely modern arms race: high on nationalist fervour and habitual mistrust, choreographed so that each clash is always just one provocation away from becoming the last.</p> <p>On Saturday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/11/amid-fragile-ceasefire-trump-promises-to-boost-trade-with-india-and-pakistan">Donald Trump</a> announced a “full and immediate” ceasefire between India and Pakistan. The truce, brokered by US officials, came amid <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyn617xv4no">speculation</a> by military analysts that Pakistan was edging closer to using nuclear weapons. It was met with cautious optimism – not least as both sides accused each other of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/india-pakistan-immediate-us-mediated-ceasefire">violating</a> the agreement within hours, with reports of cross-border shelling in Indian-administered Kashmir. Should the ceasefire pause the missiles, it won’t resolve the deeper <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-says-increase-trade-substantially-041623829.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAExDNTLRvcKywnLzWtUxN-4KiasdeUvsaA2FwYNgrt8eCSOOHWFQo5R5Kzx9ImUSX8QERCVc8135RtRFYrb6ybEcGlcEINChRTxm7j-9q_FY4UaJryVjbaUbCFZ_el92OeazFXMeOljA9sEXMssP0vjwclHk71TVD7K7HmqJat-w">dispute</a> at the roof of the world.</p> <p>Since partition in 1947, Kashmir has remained the unresolved centrepiece of the two nations’ rivalry. Mr Trump’s off-ramp for Pakistan appeared to be the offer to find a solution to the Himalayan region, whose populated parts have been effectively split between India and Pakistan. This suggestion won’t find <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/india/india-politely-rejects-trumps-offer-to-mediate-as-tensions-escalate-with-pakistan-3531446">favour</a> with India – it sees Kashmir as a bilateral issue, not one for outside meddling.</p> <p>The pattern is tragically familiar. The world has watched the same chessboard reset too many times. The trigger this time was a brutal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/04/kashmir-crackdown-india-response-to-deadly-tourist-attack">terrorist</a> attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed two dozen Indian tourists and was claimed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistance_Front">group</a> that India – and other <a href="https://www.nationalsecurity.gov.au/what-australia-is-doing/terrorist-organisations/listed-terrorist-organisations/lashkar-e-tayyiba">analysts</a> – say is an offshoot of a United Nations-designated terror organisation. Its actions brought to an end efforts by Pakistan’s political leadership to build bridges with Delhi.</p> <p>It’s easy to overlook now, but in February, Pakistan’s prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, made a bold pitch for talks – even on <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-wants-to-resolve-all-issues-including-kashmir-with-india-says-pm-shehbaz-sharif-101738767097788.html">Kashmir</a> – as his country staggered under sky-high inflation and International Monetary Fund-driven <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/002/2024/310/article-A001-en.xml">austerity</a>. Every time regional peace is within reach, violence snatches it away. The 1999 <a href="https://pakistani.org/pakistan/lahore_declaration.html">Lahore declaration</a>? Erased by the <a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1417105">Kargil</a> war months later. Trade and travel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/apr/18/kashmir.india1">deals</a> in the early 2000s? Blown apart by the 2008 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/27/india-terrorist-attacks-mumbai">Mumbai</a> attacks by Pakistani terror groups. The 2015 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/25/indian-prime-minister-makes-surprise-stopover-in-pakistan">handshake</a> between India’s prime&nbsp;minister, Narendra Modi, and Pakistan’s Nawaz Sharif? Derailed weeks later by an assault on an Indian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/04/indian-air-force-base-attack-enters-third-day-despite-claim-all-militants-were-dead">airbase</a> by militants. So when the 2025 outreach was followed by yet another attack, it wasn’t a surprise. It was deja vu.</p> <p>In India Mr Modi leads a coalition government facing a political <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/10/india-pakistan-ceasefire-kashmir-narratives-analysis">reality</a> that constrains his ability to engage in diplomatic overtures without appearing weak, especially in the face of nationalist pressures – notably from his own hardline base. Mr Modi deserves credit for restraint after the weekend’s ceasefire breaches. But terror strikes against <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyn617xv4no">civilians</a> are a different matter. Each becomes a test of resolve, compelling a response that risks further escalation. Inaction would be perceived as weakness. Every attack forces a decision: how hard to hit back? How far to escalate? How much political capital to risk?</p> <p>Both sides know how to manage tension – until they don’t. The real threat isn’t intent, but <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/india-and-pakistan-were-close-to-miscalculation-either-side-couldnt-afford-13364908">miscalculation</a> under pressure. Ceasefires&nbsp;soothe,&nbsp;but solve nothing fundamental.&nbsp;The tragedy&nbsp;is how predictably the guns speak again when nothing changes.</p> <p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
