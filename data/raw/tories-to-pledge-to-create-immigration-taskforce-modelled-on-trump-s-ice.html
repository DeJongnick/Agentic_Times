<p>The Conservatives will pledge to create a new immigration taskforce modelled on Donald Trump’s controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency, the Guardian understands.</p> <p>The party’s leader, Kemi Badenoch, is expected to announce the policy on Sunday as the Conservatives heads into their annual conference after a year of historic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/02/could-nigel-farage-really-win-the-next-election-heres-what-the-polls-say">low poll ratings</a>. The proposed “removals force” will be tasked with deporting 150,000 people a year in a move to tackle illegal immigration.</p> <p>Badenoch will say that the taskforce would be given £1.6bn and “sweeping new powers” if the Conservatives win the next election. This would include the ability to use facial recognition technology without warning to help identify those eligible for removal from the UK.</p> <p>Under the plans, the taskforce would be expected to “work closely” with the police. Officers would be required to conduct immigration checks on everyone they stop or arrest, Badenoch is expected to add.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/03/the-guardian-view-on-conservative-party-conference-kemi-badenochs-last-shot-at-relevance">The Guardian view on Conservative party conference: Kemi Badenoch’s last shot at relevance | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Badenoch will say that the Ice model has proved to be a “successful approach” in removing migrants who have illegally entered the US. Ice removed nearly 200,000 people in the first seven months of Trump’s second presidency, US media reported. However, it has also faced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/03/trump-ice-immigration-portland">widespread criticism</a>, both for arresting legal migrants and allegedly targeting people on the grounds of their race.</p> <p>Immigration is expected to be a key theme of this year’s Conservative conference, which begins on Sunday. The removals force is understood to be a cornerstone of a new “borders plan”, which Badenoch will announce to delegates in Manchester.</p> <p>Analysis of Home Office figures by the PA news agency shows 34,401 people have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/12/more-than-50000-people-crossed-channel-in-small-boats-since-labour-took-power">crossed the Channel in small boats</a> so far this year. This means 2025 is on course to break records for the most arrivals in a single year.</p> <p>Badenoch will say: “We must tackle the scourge of illegal immigration into Britain and secure our borders. That is why the Conservatives are setting out a serious and comprehensive new plan to end this crisis.”</p> <p>She is also expected to announce a radical overhaul of the asylum system as part of her borders plan. She will propose granting refugee status only to those who have been directly threatened by a foreign government. Those who have escaped conflict or “less tolerant” laws on religion and sexuality will be excluded, Badenoch will say, adding that “few” people would qualify for asylum under the tightened rules.</p> <p>She also wants to abolish immigration tribunals, with decisions instead taken directly by the Home Office. There would be limited rights of appeal, which would apply only in cases where officials have acted without statutory authority, it is understood.</p> <p>The plans would also deny legal aid to those fighting immigration cases. Badenoch is expected to say that lawyers have “defrauded” the UK by “coaching” applicants. Badenoch will argue there is “no need for lawyers” as people “should simply tell the truth about their circumstances”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/04/conservative-conference-like-going-to-in-laws-apathy-kemi-badenoch">‘Like going to the in-laws’: Conservative conference to be steeped in apathy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Badenoch announced on Saturday that the Conservatives would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/03/badenoch-tories-would-take-uk-out-of-echr-european-convention-on-human-rights">remove the UK from the European convention on human rights</a> (ECHR) if the party regains power at the next election.</p> <p>She said: “I have not come to this decision lightly, but it is clear that it is necessary to protect our borders, our veterans and our citizens.”</p> <p>The Conservative leader faces sustained pressure on immigration from the right of her party as polls consistently show Reform could win the next election, despite the fact it currently has just five MPs. Reform’s leader, Nigel Farage, has promised to leave the ECHR and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/26/the-moral-and-economic-costs-of-farages-plan-to-deport-up-to-600000-asylum-seekers">deport up to 600,000 people</a> in its first parliamentary term if it gains power.</p> <p>Badenoch will tell delegates: “Reform have nothing but announcements that fall apart on arrival. Our ‘stronger borders’ plan is serious and credible and backed by a comprehensive legal analysis. That is the difference the next Conservative government will deliver.”</p>
