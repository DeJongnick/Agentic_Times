<p>Morning everyone. Anthony Albanese’s long-awaited meeting with Donald Trump has happened at last. He won the president’s endorsement of Aukus, the pair signed a $8.5bn critical minerals deal, and Trump praised Albanese as a “great leader”. But diplomats held their breath as the topic of Kevin Rudd came up.</p> 
<p>We’re also looking at whether Australia has the skills and personnel to run the Aukus fleet – if there ever is one – plus Gaza officials claim Palestinian prisoners were mutilated by their Israeli captors and Prince Andrew allegedly tried to hire “internet trolls” to hassle Virginia Giuffre.</p>

The pair also signed a $8.5bn critical minerals deal as the US continues its trade war with China. Trump also said America had no greater friend than Australia but, in a less harmonious moment, he turned to ambassador Kevin Rudd <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/21/i-dont-like-you-either-diplomats-hold-their-breath-as-trump-chides-rudd-over-previous-comments">and told him: “I don’t like you.”</a></p></li>
