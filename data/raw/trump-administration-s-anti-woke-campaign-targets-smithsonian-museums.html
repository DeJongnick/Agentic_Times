<h1>Trump administration’s anti-woke campaign targets Smithsonian museums</h1>

<p>Amid the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> administration’s heavy-handed review of Smithsonian museums, the Guardian has seen a document compiled by the White House that details examples of how the administration believes widely visited cultural institutions have overly negative portrayals of US history.</p> 
<p>The document, based on public submissions shared with the administration, points to what it says are problematic exhibits at seven different museums, including a Benjamin Franklin exhibit that links his scientific achievements to his ownership of enslaved people and a film about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd">George Floyd</a>’s murder that it says mischaracterizes the police.</p> 
<p>“President Trump will explore all options and avenues to get the Woke out of the Smithsonian and hold them accountable,” a White House official said. “Until we get info from the Smithsonian in response to our letter, we can’t verify the numbers of artifacts that have been removed because the Smithsonian has removed them on their own.”</p> 
<p>Trump announced the initiative on Truth Social earlier this week, writing: “The Smithsonian is OUT OF CONTROL, where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.”</p> 
<p>The seven museums that have so far been flagged for review include the National Museum of American History, the upcoming National Museum of the American Latino, the National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of African Art, the National Portrait Gallery, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the National Museum of Asian Art.</p> 
<p>The administration argues exhibits at these museums focus excessively on oppression rather than American achievements. At the National Museum of American History, the document flagged the ¡Presente! Latino history exhibition for allegedly promoting an “anti-American agenda” by examining colonization effects and depicting the US as stealing territory from Mexico in 1848.</p>

<p>Examples from the document also shames the museum’s Benjamin Franklin exhibit for linking his scientific achievements to his ownership of enslaved people, and the Star-Spangled Banner display for focusing on American historical failures and controversies rather than celebrating national achievements.</p> 
<p>The National Portrait Gallery is being singled out for focusing on how the Chinese Exclusion Act and other racist immigration laws contradicted the Statue of Liberty’s welcoming message. The African art museum is targeted over the George Floyd film. And the Asian art museum is flagged for exhibitions for claiming to impose western gender ideology on traditional cultures.</p> 
<p>Last week, the White House budget director, Russ Vought, sent letters to eight museums demanding information about exhibits within 30 days and instructing officials to implement “content corrections” including replacing “divisive” language.</p> 
<p>The review follows similar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> pressure on universities, which resulted in institutions paying hundreds of millions to the government and walking back diversity initiatives.</p> 
<p>Separately, the Smithsonian has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/smithsonian-trump-impeachments">already made changes</a> to exhibits referencing Trump, removing all mention of his impeachments from a presidential power display at the American history museum in July, leaving only generic references to three presidents facing potential removal from office. The museum administrators clarified, however, that the removal was part of an update, and that the impeachment information was restored on 8 August.</p> 
<p>It’s unclear, however, exactly which museums are under review. A <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/08/letter-to-the-smithsonian-internal-review-of-smithsonian-exhibitions-and-materials/">letter</a> from the White House to the Smithsonian Institution secretary, Lonnie Bunch, last week included a different list of museums: the museums of American history, natural history, African American history and culture, and the American Indian, along with the National Air and Space Museum, the American Art Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, were all up for internal review.</p> 
<p>The Smithsonian Institution did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the Guardian obtained a statement sent by Bunch, the 14th secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to colleagues.</p> 
<p>“The Smithsonian continues to appear in multiple news stories and social media posts, I have received questions and comments from many of you. The Smithsonian will always be shaped by scholarship and guided by our core values. While our collections may evolve to reflect new discoveries and insights, the intellectual honesty and the integrity of our research and collections will not change. Throughout our 179-year history, we have listened to and learned from our fellow citizens, as part of our mission to provide Americans with high-quality, factual content and world-class science.</p> 
<p>“While we cannot know what future critiques will hold, I do know that I have the greatest faith in your ability to persevere and effectively represent an institution whose goal is simply to help a nation better understand its past, produce and convey the most accurate science and scholarship, and serve the greater good.”</p>
