<p>The company run by the Tory donor Frank Hester, whose remarks about Diane Abbott have been widely condemned as racist, paid a Conservative peer £148,000 to act as a trade envoy, the Guardian can reveal, as evidence of his links to the party deepen.</p> <p>Zahida Manzoor, a former deputy chair of the Commission for Racial Equality in the 1990s who went on to be a Lords whip under Theresa May’s government, took on the part-time role as chair of a Middle East advisory council for Hester’s health tech TPP in September 2016.</p> <p>The £12,300-a-month role, which ended in September 2017, shows that Hester’s ties to the Conservatives go back longer than previously thought.</p> <p>Lady Manzoor confirmed the role at the Phoenix Partnership (TPP) and pointed out that it was <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/globalassets/documents/publications-records/house-of-lords-publications/records-activities-and-membership/register-of-lords-interests/register171017.pdf">declared in the register of members’ interests at the time</a>. She joined the widespread condemnation of the Hester’s remarks last week, and told the Guardian she did not witness any racism when working for TPP.</p> <p>Hester has donated £10m to the party in the last year, in two £5m tranches in May and November, and is reported to have donated a further £5m, which has yet to be declared. The Guardian also revealed that Rishi Sunak was flown to Leeds by Hester for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/16/frank-hester-rishi-sunak-16000-helicopter-flight-to-leeds">private tour of TPP’s offices last November.</a></p> <p>When she took on the role, Manzoor was an not affiliated to a party after resigning the Liberal Democrat whip over Brexit. In October 2016, three weeks after taking the role with TPP, she announced that she had joined the Conservatives.</p> <p>Manzoor left TPP in June 2017. She said: “The contract was ended by mutual agreement as the business decided to focus on China rather than the Middle East … This was purely a commercial decision.”</p> <p>She did not deny the sums involved. “My remuneration is a contractual matter as agreed between TPP and myself,” she said.</p> <p>Asked to comment on Hester’s remarks about Abbott, she said: “That type of language is totally inappropriate and unacceptable in any circumstance. No forms of racism or discrimination should be condoned or tolerated. However, during my short time with TPP, I never heard any comments of this nature and certainly nothing was said to me or in my presence by Mr Hester or anyone else at TPP.”</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Contact%20Guardian%20Politics&amp;description=%3Cli%3ECreate%20a%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2F%22%3EProtonMail%3C%2Fa%3E%20account%20and%20email%20us%20at%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Aguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%22%3Eguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%3C%2Fa%3E%3B%20or%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EUse%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.me%2F%23p%2F%2B447824537227%22%3ESignal%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447824537227%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207824%20537227.%3C%2Fli%3E%20%0A%3Cli%3EFor%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%3C%2Fli%3E&amp;link=false" data-alt="Contact the team securely: create a Protonmail account and email us at guardian.politics.desk@protonmail.com; or use Signal Messenger or WhatsApp to message +44 7824 537227."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Contact%20Guardian%20Politics&description=%3Cli%3ECreate%20a%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fprotonmail.com%2F%22%3EProtonMail%3C%2Fa%3E%20account%20and%20email%20us%20at%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Aguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%22%3Eguardian.politics.desk%40protonmail.com%3C%2Fa%3E%3B%20or%3C%2Fli%3E%0A%3Cli%3EUse%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fsignal.me%2F%23p%2F%2B447824537227%22%3ESignal%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447824537227%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20%2B44%207824%20537227.%3C%2Fli%3E%20%0A%3Cli%3EFor%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%3C%2Fli%3E&link=false">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>TPP has received more than £400m in contracts from the NHS and other government bodies since 2016.

I would suggest this test is re-evaluated periodically – particularly when contracts are up for renewal or if new information comes to light.</p> <p>“Any donations to the Conservative party are a matter for the party itself.”</p> <p>TPP has been approached for comment.</p>
