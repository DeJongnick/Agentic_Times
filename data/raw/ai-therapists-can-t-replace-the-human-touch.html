<p>Artificial intelligence offers many benefits to society, but it should not replace the human support that is essential to mental health care (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/07/experts-warn-therapy-ai-chatbots-are-not-safe-to-use">‘It cannot provide nuance’: UK experts&nbsp;warn AI therapy chatbots are not safe, 7 May</a>). Instead, tools such as chatbots should be used to complement existing services that&nbsp;reduce loneliness and help those who require mental health&nbsp;support.</p> <p>AI cannot replicate genuine human empathy and there is a risk that it creates an illusion of connection rather than meaningful interaction. Concerns also remain about data privacy and the dangers of becoming overly dependent on technology. That said, when used appropriately, AI can offer an anonymous, judgment-free space that’s accessible 24/7. This could be a useful addition to existing in-person mental health services.</p> <p>With NHS waiting lists for mental health support at an all-time high, it could be tempting to see AI as the full solution and as a direct replacement. But AI is not a magic bullet. It must be integrated thoughtfully to support, not replace, human-led care. Increased government investment in the mental health workforce remains essential to meet rising demand and ensure those struggling can access timely, in-person support.<br><strong>Dr Roman Raczka</strong><br><em>President, British Psychological Society</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
