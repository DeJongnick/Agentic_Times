 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>This brings our live coverage of the second Trump administration to an end for the day. We will return on Thursday to resume our chronicle. In the meantime, we leave you with this summary of the day’s developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/white-house-initiative-to-promote-excellence-and-innovation-at-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/">an executive order</a> on Wednesday to establish a White House initiative “To Promote Excellence and Innovation at Historically Black Colleges and Universities” that seemed to very closely echo the text of <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/promoting-excellence-innovation-and-sustainability-historically-black-colleges-and-">an executive order</a> signed by <strong>Barack Obama</strong> in 2010, which established a White House initiative “Promoting Excellence, Innovation and Sustainability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>As he signed the last in a series of executive orders on education, Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/zkDVSD6bA08?si=Acdu2X0Z0ajyWvat">mused aloud</a> that by directing schools to get out of what his aide called “the whole sort of diversity, equity and inclusion cult”, the US was “getting out of that, huh, after being in that jungle for a long time”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Trump is hosting an “intimate private dinner” for the top 220 holders of the Trump memecoin next month, the issuers of the cryptocurrency <a href="https://gettrumpmemes.com/dinner">announced</a> on Wednesday. “It’s buying influence with the president. There’s no if’s, and’s or but’s about it,” <strong>Craig Holman</strong> of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said.</p></li> 
   <li><p>A dozen states, led by the attorneys general of Oregon and Arizona, sued Donald Trump and his administration in the US court of international trade on Wednesday, calling his tariffs illegal because they were implemented under emergency powers in the absence of a true emergency.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <strong>New England Journal of Medicine</strong> <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/23/new-england-journal-of-medicine-us-attorney-letter-scientific-journals/">confirmed</a> on Wednesday to the medical news site Stat that it had received a letter, asking it to account for alleged bias in its publication decisions, from <strong>Ed Martin</strong>, a Republican activist now serving as interim US attorney for the District of Columbia.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> once again attacked <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> for refusing to agree to peace terms that look like a surrender to Russia. Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/23/donald-trump-elon-musk-tesla-doge-immigration-jerome-powell-law-harvard-us-politics-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-680910bf8f08e65b05d1d9e2#block-680910bf8f08e65b05d1d9e2">claimed earlier today</a> to be “very close to a deal” and said Zelenskyy’s stance on <strong>Crimea</strong> (not surrendering it) was “very harmful to the peace negotiations with Russia”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>A federal court accused the Trump administration of “bad faith” in the case of <strong>Kilmar Ábrego García</strong>, whom it deported to El Salvador despite an earlier order against it.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Law firms <strong>Perkins Coie</strong> and <strong>WilmerHale</strong> asked federal judges in Washington DC to permanently bar Trump’s executive orders against them.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">New England Journal of Medicine rejects inquiry about alleged bias from federal prosecutor who calls himself Trump's lawyer</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The New England Journal of Medicine <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/23/new-england-journal-of-medicine-us-attorney-letter-scientific-journals/">confirmed</a> on Wednesday to the medical news site Stat that it had received a letter, asking it to account for alleged bias in its publication decisions, from <strong>Ed Martin</strong>, a Republican activist now serving as interim US attorney for the District of Columbia.</p> 
  <p>The editor of the prestigious medical journal, <strong>Eric Rubin</strong>, told Stat that the letter asked him to respond to six questions from Martin, an organizer of the 2021 Stop the Steal movement who recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/24/us-attorney-trump-lawyers">referred to prosecutors in his office</a> as “President Trumps’ [sic] lawyers”.</p> 
  <p>“As practicing physicians, our editors recognize our responsibility to doctors and patients. We use rigorous peer review and editorial processes to ensure the objectivity and reliability of the research we publish,” Rubin wrote in the reply to Martin he shared with Stat. “We support the editorial independence of medical journals and their First Amendment rights to free expression. The <em>Journal</em> actively fosters scholarly scientific dialogue and remains steadfast in its commitment to supporting authors, readers, and patients.”</p> 
  <p>Last week, a similar letter from Martin to another scientific journal, Chest, published by the American College of Chest Physicians, was <a href="https://x.com/_Eric_Reinhart/status/1912958244768690407">posted online</a> by <strong>Eric Reinhart</strong>, a psychoanalytic clinician. Reinhart reported later that at least two other journals had received similar letters from Martin.</p> 
  <p>In the letter to Chest, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/18/health/trump-martin-us-attorney-medical-journals.html">shared with the New York Times</a>, Martin wrote: “It has been brought to my attention that more and more journals and publications like CHEST Journal are conceding that they are partisans in various scientific debates.”</p> 
  <p>He then asked the journal’s publishers to answer a series of questions, including whether they accept submissions from “competing viewpoints””; what they do if they discover they “may have misled their readers”; how they acknowledge the influence of “supporters, funders, advertisers and others”; and what role funding from the National Institutes of Health plays “in the development of submitted articles”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump signs executive order on historically Black colleges and universities that echoes Obama text from 2010</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Donald Trump signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/white-house-initiative-to-promote-excellence-and-innovation-at-historically-black-colleges-and-universities/">an executive order</a> on Wednesday to establish a White House initiative “To Promote Excellence and Innovation at Historically Black Colleges and Universities” that seems to very closely echo the text of <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/promoting-excellence-innovation-and-sustainability-historically-black-colleges-and-">an executive order</a> signed by Barack Obama in 2010, which established a White House initiative “Promoting Excellence, Innovation and Sustainability at Historically Black Colleges and Universities”.</p> 
  <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ePi0TnNE8g"> <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8ePi0TnNE8g?start=629&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=629" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
   <figcaption>
    Barack Obama signed an executive order to promote HBCUs in the White House on 26 February 2010.
   </figcaption> 
  </figure> 
  <p>In fact, Trump’s new executive order has the exact same title as <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/03/2017-04357/white-house-initiative-to-promote-excellence-and-innovation-at-historically-black-colleges-and">one he signed in 2017</a>, the “White House Initiative To Promote Excellence and Innovation at Historically Black Colleges and Universities”. It also closely echoes an order <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/09/09/2021-19579/white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-through">signed by Joe Biden in 2021</a>, “White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity Through Historically Black Colleges and Universities”.</p> 
  <p>The major difference between Trump’s two orders and those signed by Obama and Biden are that the White House initiative on HBCUs established by Obama, and then <a href="https://x.com/WHI_HBCUs">re-established by Biden</a>, was located in the Department of Education, which Trump has promised to shutter. Trump’s initiative, both in 2017 and now, is “housed in the Executive Office of the President”.</p> 
  <p>George HW Bush also signed <a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/executive-order-12677-historically-black-colleges-and-universities">an executive order</a>, in 1989, to establish an advisory commission, the “President’s Board of Advisors on Historically Black Colleges and Universities”, in the education department.</p> 
  <p>Another order signed by Trump on Wednesday reversed an aspect of education policy that had dealt with racial disparities: during the Obama administration, schools were warned that they could be in violation of federal civil rights law if certain groups of students were disciplined more often than other groups. After Trump rescinded that order during his first term, it was reinstated by Biden.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">12 states sue Trump over his tariffs, calling president's use of emergency powers 'unlawful'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A dozen states, led by the attorneys general of Oregon and Arizona, sued Donald Trump and his administration in the US court of international trade on Wednesday, calling his tariffs illegal because they were implemented under emergency powers in the absence of a true emergency.</p> 
  <p>The states challenge Trump’s claim that he can arbitrarily impose tariffs based on the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-mexico-canada-china-trade-taxes-6c2ae398d0dfab042fc2c9f139b27db5">International Emergency Economic Powers Act</a>. The suit asks the court to declare the tariffs to be illegal, and to block government agencies and its officers from enforcing them.</p> 
  <p>The first lines of <a href="https://www.opb.org/pdf/Multistate%20Tariffs%200077%20PLD%20Complaint%204_1745436751847.pdf">the lawsuit</a> argue that the US constitution grants Congress, and not the president, the power to impose and collect taxes.</p> 
  <p>“Yet over the last three months, the President has imposed, modified, escalated, and suspended tariffs by executive order, memoranda, social media post, and agency decree,” the lawsuit states. “These edicts reflect a national trade policy that now hinges on the President’s whims rather than the sound exercise of his lawful authority.”</p> 
  <p>The 10 states that joined Oregon and Arizona are: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-sues-trump-administration-stop-illegal-tariffs-0">a statement</a>, Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said: “President Trump’s insane tariff scheme is not only economically reckless – it is illegal.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump says 'I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In remarks on the war in Ukraine that were enthusiastically <a href="https://x.com/RT_com/status/1915162152564121741">clipped and shared</a> by Russian state media, Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Wednesday: “I think Russia is ready, and a lot of people said Russia wanted to go for the whole thing. I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelenskyy”.</p> 
  <p>“I hope that Zelenskyy, I thought it might be easier to deal with Zelenskyy. So far, it’s been harder, but that’s OK, it’s all right,” Trump added in a somewhat meandering stream-of-consciousness comment.</p> 
  <p>He then reversed course and said: “But I think we have a deal with both. I hope they do it, because I’m looking to save – and, you know, we spend a lot of money, but this is about – a lot of humanity.”</p> 
  <p>The president refused to comment on a question about a reported US proposal for an end to the war that would require Ukraine to recognize Crimea, which was seized by Russia in 2014, as Russian territory. He also repeated the false claim that the US has spent $350bn on Ukraine’s defense from the Russian invasion.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump says auto tariffs on Canada could go up: 'I really don't want cars from Canada'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Donald Trump <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1915163313442324679">just said</a> that tariffs on Canadian-made cars “could go up”.</p> 
  <p>“They took a large percentage of the car-making and I want to bring it back to this country. I really don’t want cars from Canada,” the president said.</p> 
  <p>“When I put tariffs on Canada, they’re paying 25% but that could go up, in terms of cars,” Trump added, “All we’re doing is, we’re saying: ‘We don’t want your cars, in all due respect. We want really to make our own cars.’”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump offers 'intimate private dinner' and White House tour to holders of his memecoin</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> is hosting an “intimate private dinner” for the top 220 holders of the Trump memecoin next month, the issuers of the cryptocurrency <a href="https://gettrumpmemes.com/dinner" title="Link to Trump memecoin site">announced</a> on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>The dinner, on 22 May at his private club in Washington, will include remarks by Trump on “the future of crypto”, according to the online solicitation from the organizers. The fine print notes that the event “is being arranged by Fight Fight Fight LLC”, one of the companies behind the coin, and that “President Trump is appearing at the dinner as a guest and not soliciting any funds for it”.</p> 
  <p>“From April 23 to May 12, your average $TRUMP balance determines your spot,” according to the organizers. “Get $Trump Memes and climb the ranks.” The top 25 Trump coin holders will also be invited to a reception before the dinner with the president, and will be given a tour of the White House.</p> 
  <p>Craig Holman of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, told Bloomberg that no matter what disclaimers are added, “it’s buying influence with the president. There’s no if’s, and’s or but’s about it.”</p> 
  <p>“We’ve never had a president who is so in love with money as this one,” he added.</p> 
  <p>The name of the company behind the event, Fight Fight Fight, is based on the comment made by Trump after he survived the attempt on his life last July.</p> 
  <p>On Monday, the president spent part of his time with children at the Easter event at the White House <a href="https://defector.com/trump-shows-kids-collectible-card-with-photo-of-him-being-shot">showing them a commemorative trading card</a>, issued the day after the assassination attempt, emblazoned with that slogan above a photograph of him with a raised fist and a bloody face.</p> 
  <p>The card, which was encased in protective plastic, was issued immediately after the failed assassination attempt.

    Instagram video of a police and FBI raid on the home of protest organizers in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on Wednesday.

  </figure> 
  <p>In the video, as a battering ram is used to break open the front door of a house, the voice of someone inside can be heard saying: “No search warrant was provided.” After the door is knocked in, an officer, with gun drawn, wearing what appears to be a Michigan state trooper jersey under a bulletproof vest, enters and says: “Hands up!”</p> 
  <p>Although the activists say the officers refused to show a warrant at this home and three others before detaining eight residents and seizing electronic devices, a spokesperson for Dana Nessel, Michigan’s Democratic attorney general, told the Guardian the officers “executed search warrants on multiple subjects and properties in multiple jurisdictions, including Ann Arbor, Canton, and Ypsilanti”.</p> 
  <p>“These search warrants were not investigative of protest activity on the campus of the University of Michigan nor the Diag encampment; today’s search warrants are in furtherance of our investigation into multijurisdictional acts of vandalism,” the attorney general’s spokesperson, Danny Wimmer, wrote in an email.</p> 
  <p>“There were many agencies involved, including local, state and federal authorities, though there was no Ice presence nor any immigration enforcement purpose to our actions,” Wimmer added. “Furthermore, it is our belief that each subject of the search warrants are American citizens and no persons were arrested today, though some individuals were briefly detained and released during the execution of the search warrants.”</p> 
  <p>Michigan Live <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2025/04/3-arrested-released-in-fbi-raid-on-ypsilanti-home.html">reports</a> that the Tahrir Coalition, a pro-Palestinian advocacy group, asked members to go to the Ypsilanti home on Wednesday morning as the raid unfolded. The local news outlet has video of supporters of the activists who were detained there, and then released, taunting the officers.</p>

  <p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> acknowledged on Wednesday that talks in London had been marked by emotions and expressed hope that future joint work would lead to peace.</p> 
  <p>“Emotions have run high today. But it is good that 5 countries met to bring peace closer,” the Ukrainian president wrote on the X social media platform. “The American side shared its vision. Ukraine and other Europeans presented their inputs.”</p>

  <p>Here is the full story on Trump’s attacks on Zelenskyy from my colleagues <strong>Dan Sabbagh</strong> and <strong>Pjotr Sauer</strong>:</p> 
  <p><em>Donald Trump has accused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> of jeopardising what he claimed was an imminent peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, as he gave the clearest hint yet that the US would be willing to formally recognise Russia’s seizure of Crimea as part of any agreement.</em></p> 
  <p><em>The US president claimed a deal to end the war – largely negotiated between Washington and Moscow – was close, while the vice-president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a>, said the agreement would include a proposal to freeze the conflict roughly along the current frontlines.</em></p> 
  <p><em>After a day of speculation and partial disclosure of the terms of the peace proposal, Trump attacked his Ukrainian counterpart for complaining that Kyiv was unwilling to cede Crimea to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> – the most contentious aspect of the tentative agreement that has leaked so far.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Trump’s White House has attacked <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> once again, accusing the Ukrainian president of jeopardizing peace talks.

Zelenskyy said on Tuesday that his country could not accept recognising Crimea as Russian territory, amid reports suggesting Russia is seeking US recognition of Crimea in exchange for dropping its claims to three Ukrainian regions it only partly occupies (<strong>JD Vance</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/23/donald-trump-elon-musk-tesla-doge-immigration-jerome-powell-law-harvard-us-politics-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6808bf8f8f08ec68f1a2b11c#block-6808bf8f8f08ec68f1a2b11c">also said earlier</a> that the peace agreement would include a proposal to freeze the conflict roughly along the current frontlines, and that <strong>Moscow</strong> and <strong>Kyiv</strong> would need to agree to exchange territory if they want to reach a ceasefire in <strong>Ukraine</strong>).

Meanwhile, in a contrastingly softening approach, the US treasury secretary <strong>Scott Bessent</strong> said that high tariffs between the <strong>US</strong> and <strong>China</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/23/donald-trump-elon-musk-tesla-doge-immigration-jerome-powell-law-harvard-us-politics-live-updates?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6809225f8f0848f875062608#block-6809225f8f0848f875062608">are not sustainable</a>, as the Trump administration signaled openness to de-escalating its trade war.

   <li><p><strong>A federal court accused the Trump administration of “bad faith” in the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, whom it deported to El Salvador despite an </strong><strong>earlier order against it. </strong>The US district judge Paula Xinis has given the Trump administration until 6pm ET on Wednesday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/23/donald-trump-elon-musk-tesla-doge-immigration-jerome-powell-law-harvard-us-politics-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6808ff5e8f086a65ccf840d0#block-6808ff5e8f086a65ccf840d0">to provide details to support its claims</a> that it does not have to comply with orders to return Ábrego García to the US, where he was living and working in Baltimore, because of special privilege.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> is frustrated with the pace of talks on ending the war in <strong>Ukraine</strong> and said <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> is going in the wrong direction when it comes to negotiations, the White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Wednesday:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The president’s frustrated. His patience is running very thin. He wants to do what’s right for the world. He wants to see peace. He wants to see the killing stop, but you need both sides of the war willing to do that. And unfortunately, President Zelenskyy seems to be moving in the wrong direction.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Treasury secretary Scott Bessent says China tariffs are not sustainable as US signals willingness to de-escalate</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>US treasury secretary <strong>Scott Bessent</strong> said that high tariffs between the <strong>US</strong> and <strong>China</strong> are not sustainable, as <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s administration signaled openness to de-escalating a trade war between the world’s two largest economies that has raised fears of a global recession.</p> 
  <p>US stocks rallied on hopes that the two countries might lower the steep trade barriers they have erected over the past month, though there was no sign that negotiations might start anytime soon.</p> 
  <p>Bessent said the tariffs – 145% on Chinese products and a retaliatory 125% on US products – would have to come down before trade talks can proceed, but said Trump would not make that move unilaterally. Bessent told reporters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Neither side believes that these are sustainable levels. As I said yesterday, this is the equivalent of an embargo and a break between the two countries in trade does not suit anyone’s interest.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/white-house-considers-slashing-china-tariffs-to-de-escalate-trade-war-6f875d69?mod=WSJ_home_mediumtopper_pos_1">The Wall Street Journal (paywall) reported</a> that the White House is considering cutting tariff levels to as low as 50% on Chinese imports in a bid to lower tensions. A White House spokesperson dismissed any reports as “pure speculation” and said news on tariffs would come from Trump himself.</p> 
  <p>“We are going to have a fair deal with China,” Trump told reporters, but did not outline any specifics. The tariff levels outlined in the Journal report would likely still be high enough to deter a significant chunk of trade between the world’s two largest economies.</p> 
  <p><strong>Bessent said the third quarter of this year is a “reasonable estimate” for achieving clarity on the ultimate level of Trump’s tariffs</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>US justice department cancels hundreds of grants for police and victims of crime</strong></p> 
  <p>The US justice department has canceled hundreds of ongoing grants that funded everything from services for mental health care for police officers to support programs for victims of crime and sexual assault, according to internal records and four sources familiar with the matter.</p> 
  <p>At least 365 grants from the Office of Justice Programs, the department’s largest grant-making arm, were terminated late on Tuesday, two sources told Reuters. In fiscal year 2023, that office collectively awarded $4.4bn in funding, according to the justice department’s website.</p> 
  <p>Among the programs that are being targeted include grants that supported transgender victims of crime, hotlines used by crime victims, human trafficking grants awarded to organizations that work with immigrants and refugees, programs to curb juvenile delinquency and safeguard incarcerated youth, and funding to help state-run hate crime reporting, according to a partial list of terminated grants seen by Reuters.</p> 
  <p>In an email sent to Office of Justice Programs staff on Tuesday, the deputy assistant attorney general, <strong>Maureen Henneberg</strong>, said that canceled grants <strong>“no longer support the department’s priorities”</strong>. She added that the new funding priorities will focus on “certain law enforcement operations, combating violent crime, protecting American children, supporting American victims of trafficking and sexual assault, and promoting coordination of law enforcement efforts at all levels of government”.</p> 
  <p>A justice department spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.</p> 
  <p>Many justice department employees who work on managing and awarding the grants did not learn about the cancellations until the grantees were notified on Tuesday, the sources said.</p>

  <p><strong>Trump cuts federal grants to Louisiana plantation museum focused on reality of slavery</strong></p> 
  <p>The Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS ) has terminated two grants for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/black-us-culture">Black history and culture</a> that were <a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/available/museum-grants-african-american-history-and-culture">awarded</a> to the <strong>Whitney Plantation</strong>, a former indigo, sugar and rice plantation in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana">Louisiana</a> that focuses on the truths of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/slavery">slavery</a> and the experiences of people who were enslaved. IMLS provides resources and support to libraries, archives and museums in all 50 states and territories.</p> 
  <p>The termination comes as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> has both gutted federal funding aimed at arts and cultural institutions and has pushed to end state and federal initiatives in support of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). </p> 
  <p>The Whitney Plantation already received one of the grants this year, but the other, which was to help fund <strong>an exhibit about how enslaved people resisted on plantations</strong>, was set to be completed in June this year. Without the funding, the Whitney stands to lose about $55,000. The exhibit on resistance to slavery, on which the museum had worked for three years, was due to open in January 2026.</p> 
  <p>When the Whitney Plantation opened in 2014 as a museum, it was <strong>the first plantation in the country dedicated to memorializing slavery and honoring enslaved people</strong> – most plantations in the US, often used as sites for <a href="https://sojo.net/articles/plantation-weddings-erase-legacy-terror">weddings</a> or other<a href="https://eji.org/news/plantation-tourism-continues-to-raise-questions/"> lighthearted forms of tourism</a>, instead erase the history of slavery.</p> 
  <p>In March, the IMLS itself was a target for <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and the so-called <strong>“department of government efficiency” (Doge)</strong>, which has been responsible for numerous cuts to the federal government since it began operating in January. In a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/">March executive order, </a>Trump called for the IMLS to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law” within seven days of the order. Also in March, Doge put nearly all of the IMLS’s employees on administrative leave, rendering it difficult for the federal agency to fully function. As a result, library systems and museums across the country have reported <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/11/mississippi-libraries-race-gender-databases">concerns about receiving promised IMLS grants,</a> while others, like the Whitney Plantation, have been notified that their grants are terminated.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump claims Russia-Ukraine peace deal close but accuses Zelenskyy of harming process and having ‘no cards to play’</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has attacked <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> after <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s president said he would not recognize <strong>Russia</strong>’s occupation of <strong>Crimea</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Trump said the inflammatory statement <strong>would make a peace deal with Russia harder to achieve</strong>. “This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He said “We are very close to a Deal”, adding that Crimea was lost years ago “and is not even a point of discussion”.</p> 
  <p>However, earlier we reported that leaks to the Financial Times and other media have indicated that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a><strong> is willing to abandon its territorial claims to three Ukrainian regions</strong> it only partly occupies after three years of fighting <strong>in return for the US formally recognising its 2014 annexation of Crimea as part of a ceasefire agreement</strong>. Such a recognition would be a formal acknowledgment that it is possible to change borders by force.</p> 
  <p>At present neither Russia nor the US has gone on the record to confirm the reports, though on Monday Trump said he would be providing “full detail” on the peace proposals “over the next three days”.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/lammy-to-host-us-and-european-negotiators-for-talks-on-ukraine">said on Tuesday</a> his country could not accept recognising Crimea as Russian territory. “There is nothing new to mention or discuss. Ukraine will not recognise the occupation of Crimea,” he said, adding that it would be incompatible with Ukraine’s constitution.</p> 
  <p>Here is Trump’s lengthy (sorry) post:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is boasting on the front page of The Wall Street Journal that, “Ukraine will not legally recognize the occupation of Crimea. There’s nothing to talk about here.” This statement is very harmful to the Peace Negotiations with Russia in that Crimea was lost years ago under the auspices of President Barack Hussein Obama, and is not even a point of discussion. Nobody is asking Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian Territory but, if he wants Crimea, why didn’t they fight for it eleven years ago when it was handed over to Russia without a shot being fired? The area also houses, for many years before “the Obama handover,” major Russian submarine bases. It’s inflammatory statements like Zelenskyy’s that makes it so difficult to settle this War. He has nothing to boast about! The situation for Ukraine is dire — He can have Peace or, he can fight for another three years before losing the whole Country. I have nothing to do with Russia, but have much to do with wanting to save, on average, five thousand Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, who are dying for no reason whatsoever. The statement made by Zelenskyy today will do nothing but prolong the “killing field,” and nobody wants that! We are very close to a Deal, but the man with “no cards to play” should now, finally, GET IT DONE. I look forward to being able to help Ukraine, and Russia, get out of this Complete and Total MESS, that would have never started if I were President!</p> 
   <p>• This post was amended on 19 May 2025 to remove an incorrect reference that the US formally recognising Russia’s annexation of Crimea would create “an extraordinary post-second world war precedent”.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> attacked the federal judge overseeing a legal challenge to his effort to punish a major law firm on Wednesday and appeared to confuse two legal cases.</p> 
  <p>Trump said on Wednesday that he was suing the firm, <strong>Perkins Coie</strong>. But it is actually Perkins Coie that is suing him for a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-risks-from-perkins-coie-llp/">6 March executive order</a> that essentially makes it impossible for the firm to do business with the federal government or represent clients who have business before it. Trump had sued Perkins Coie as part of a wide ranging lawsuit in Florida in 2022 before a different judge, Donald Middlebrooks. That case <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.610157/gov.uscourts.flsd.610157.267.0_2.pdf">was dismissed</a> in September 2022.</p> 
  <p>The suit filed by Perkins Coie has been assigned to US district judge <strong>Beryl Howell</strong>, whom Trump attacked on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>“I’m suing the law firm of Perkins Coie for their egregious and unlawful acts, in particular the conduct of a specific member of this firm, only to find out that the Judge assigned to this case is Beryl Howell, an Obama appointment, and a highly biased and unfair disaster,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.</p> 
  <p>“She ruled against me in the past, in a shocking display of sick judicial temperament, on a case that ended up working out very well for me, on appeal,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. “Her ruling was so pathologically bad that it became the “talk of the town.” I could have a 100% perfect case and she would angrily rule against me. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome, and she’s got a bad case of it. To put it nicely, Beryl Howell is an unmitigated train wreck. NO JUSTICE!!!”</p> 
  <p>Neither Perkins Coie nor the White House immediately returned a request for comment.</p> 
  <p>The government previously asked Howell to be recused from the case – a request that she rejected.</p> 
  <p>“When the U.S. Department of Justice engages in this rhetorical strategy of ad hominem attack, the stakes become much larger than only the reputation of the targeted federal judge. This strategy is designed to impugn the integrity of the federal judicial system and blame any loss on the decision-maker rather than fallacies in the substantive legal arguments presented,” Howell wrote <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290/gov.uscourts.dcd.278290.36.0_2.pdf">in an opinion</a> denying the request to recuse herself.</p> 
  <p>Perkins Coie has already secured a temporary restraining order blocking portions of the order. The firm asked Howell this week to permanently block the order.</p> 
  <p>Another firm challenging a similar order, WilmerHale, has made a similar request in a separate case. The firms <strong>Jenner &amp; Block</strong> and <strong>Susman Godfrey</strong> are also suing the Trump administration in challenges of executive orders that are widely seen to be an effort to intimidate lawyers from taking on cases adverse to the administration.</p>

  <p>In a video <a href="https://x.com/SenatorDurbin/status/1915062730580427059">post</a> announcing that he will not seek re-election next year at the end of his latest term in the US Senate, Dick Durbin of Illinois had a warning.</p> 
  <p>“Right now the challenges facing our country are historic and unprecedented. The threats to our democracy and way of life are very real,” he said.</p> 
  <p>He continued: “And I can assure you I will do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.”</p> 
  <p>He said he had spent half his life in national politics. “I’ve always tried to stand up to power,” he said. He pays tribute to his family and his staff and then points out that the Illinois junior senator, <strong>Tammy Duckworth</strong>, who will inherit from him the status as senior senator for the state (ie she will then become the longer serving of the two senators, with someone filling the then junior seat vacated by Durbin), is “a trusted friend and an effective leader”, adding that “she will be a real asset to Illinois and the nation” as our state’s senior senator.</p> 
  <p>Durbin titled the video “Time to pass the torch”. It echoes <strong>Joe Biden</strong> who came into the presidency promising to be a bridge to the next generation but then deciding to run for a second term at 81 and eventually having <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/21/joe-biden-withdraw-running-president">to drop out</a> under pressure four months before the 2024 election, after being urged by his own party <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/17/biden-adam-schiff-election">to “pass the torch”</a>. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/06/us-election-results-map-2024-live-donald-trump-kamala-harris-president">beat</a> Biden’s successor <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a></strong> for the White House.</p>

  <p>In the latest legal wrinkle in the vexed and constitution-testing case of <strong>Kilmar Ábrego García</strong>, the Trump administration moments ago continued to resist the federal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/23/kilmar-abrego-garcia-judge-trump-bad-faith">judge’s orders</a> to produce information about the steps it has taken, if any, to return him to the US after he was, by the government’s admission, mistakenly removed to El Salvador without due process.</p> 
  <p>Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general, filed a sealed motion asking for a stay of the judge’s order to provide sworn testimony and documents about efforts to return Ábrego García, who was living and working in Baltimore and subject to court protection against deportation to his native El Salvador before he was snatched up by the immigration authorities last month.</p> 
  <p>The request comes just hours after federal judge <strong>Paula Xinis</strong> in Maryland castigated the Trump administration and accused it of bad faith in trying to evade her orders without fully describing why it has special privilege to do so.</p> 
  <p>Xinis had given the administration until 6pm ET today to produce information. The White House has instead filed a sealed motion for a stay of seven days of her order, the Associated Press reports, and is also requesting relief from providing daily status updates on the Ábrego García’s status and their efforts to get him back – which courts have characterized essentially as non-efforts.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/joannawalters">Joanna Walters</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sam-levine">Sam Levine</a> in New York and agencies</em></p> 
  <p>The federal court that has found itself in a pitched battle with the executive branch over the summary removal of Salvadorian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/20/senator-chris-van-hollen-kilmar-abrego-garcia">Kilmar Ábrego García</a> despite a previous order against deportation has now accused the Trump administration of “bad faith” in the case.</p> 
  <p>US district judge <strong>Paula Xinis</strong> has given the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> <strong>until 6pm ET on Wednesday to provide details to support its claims that it does not have to comply with orders to return the man to the US</strong>, where he was living and working in Baltimore, because of special privilege.</p> 
  <p>Xinis castigated the administration late on Tuesday saying it is ignoring court orders and obstructing the legal process. She wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For weeks, defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this court’s orders.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Giving the new deadline for information, she added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Defendants have known, at least since last week, that this court requires specific legal and factual showings to support any claim of privilege. Yet they have continued to rely on boilerplate assertions. That ends now.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The US supreme court ordered the Trump administration nearly two weeks ago to facilitate Ábrego García’s return to the US from a notorious Salvadorian prison, rejecting the White House’s claim that it couldn’t retrieve him despite the administration having admitted previously in court that it had sent him out of the country by mistake.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Law firms targeted by Trump ask judges to permanently bar executive orders against them</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Law firms <strong>Perkins Coie</strong> and <strong>WilmerHale</strong> will ask federal judges in Washington DC on Wednesday to permanently bar <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s executive orders against them, calling the measures acts of retaliation that violate US constitutional protections.</p> 
  <p>The court hearings will be the latest flashpoint in a legal battle pitting prominent law firms against the Republican president and his administration. Trump announced earlier this morning he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/23/donald-trump-elon-musk-tesla-doge-immigration-jerome-powell-law-harvard-us-politics-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6808ef108f0835690d817c24#block-6808ef108f0835690d817c24">suing Perkins Coie</a>.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s orders against Perkins Coie and WilmerHale sought to restrict their lawyers’ access to federal buildings and to end government contracts held by their clients, citing the firms’ connections to his legal and political enemies.</p> 
  <p>Reuters reports that US district judge <strong>Beryl Howell</strong> will hear Perkins Coie’s request for summary judgment at 11am ET, followed by a hearing in WilmerHale’s case at 2pm before US district judge <strong>Richard Leon</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Leon, a Republican appointee, <strong>issued a temporary order last month blocking key provisions of the order against WilmerHale</strong>, an 1,100-lawyer firm that has a large office in Washington. Howell, a Democratic appointee, also <strong>temporarily blocked Trump’s order last month against Perkins Coie</strong>. Two other judges weighing lawsuits by other firms have issued similar orders.</p> 
  <p>The justice department has defended the executive orders as lawful presidential directives.</p> 
  <p>Nine law firms, including <strong>Paul Weiss</strong>, <strong>Skadden Arps, Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> and <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong>, settled with the White House to avoid a similar order being issued against them. They and several others have cumulatively pledged nearly $1bn in free legal services and made other concessions in their deals with Trump. Some lawyers at law firms that have cut deals with Trump have resigned in protest.</p> 
  <p>Hundreds of law firms, thousands of lawyers and dozens of attorney bar groups have backed the law firms suing the administration, calling the executive orders an <strong>illegal attempt to intimidate firms from representing clients adverse to Trump’s interests</strong>.</p>

  <p>US treasury secretary <strong>Scott Bessent</strong> on Wednesday called on the <strong>International Monetary Fund</strong> and <strong>World Bank</strong> to refocus on their core missions of macroeconomic stability and development, claiming they have strayed too far into vanity projects such as climate change that have reduced their effectiveness.</p> 
  <p>Reuters reports that Bessent, in remarks outlining his vision for US engagement with the IMF and World Bank on the sidelines of the institutions’ spring meetings, said that they serve critical roles in the international financial system.</p> 
  <p>“And the Trump administration is eager to work with them, so long as they can stay true to their missions,” Bessent said in prepared remarks to the Institute of International Finance.</p> 
  <p>“The IMF and World Bank have enduring value. But mission creep has knocked these institutions off course. We must enact key reforms to ensure the Bretton Woods institutions are serving their stakeholders - not the other way around,” he said, calling on US allies to join the effort. He added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>America First does not mean America alone.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Bessent said the IMF needed to focus on its key mandate and adhere to strong standards in its lending.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The IMF was once unwavering in its mission of promoting global monetary cooperation and financial stability. <strong>Now it devotes disproportionate time and resources to work on climate change, gender, and social issues</strong>. These issues are not the IMF’s mission. </p> 
   <p>And sometimes, the IMF needs to say ‘No.’ The organization has no obligation to lend to countries that fail to implement reforms.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Bessent added that the World Bank must be “tech-neutral and prioritize affordability in energy investment. In most cases, this means <strong>investing in gas and other fossil fuel-based energy production</strong>.” He added that it could also finance renewable energy projects along with systems to manage energy latency in wind and solar.</p>

  <p>Trump’s announcement that he’s suing <strong>Perkins Coie</strong> comes after the law firm successfully sued his administration for punitive executive orders which stripped security clearances from the firm’s lawyers, mandated the termination of any contracts and barred federal government employees from engaging with its attorneys or allowing them access to government buildings.</p> 
  <p>A federal judge on 12 March temporarily blocked most of the executive order Trump issued against Perkins Coie, <strong>finding it probably violated the US constitution</strong>. The judge ruled that the president used national security concerns <strong>as a pretext to punish the firm Perkins Coie for once working with Hillary Clinton</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Trump has punished several law firms with executive orders because of their connection to adversaries or involvement in causes against him. The orders threaten to cripple the firms by essentially making it impossible for them to do business with any client that has business before the government.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/11/g-s1-53218/perkins-coie-trump-law-firm">Per NPR</a>, Trump’s executive order accused <strong>Perkins Coie</strong> of a range of nefarious actions over the years allegedly seeking to undermine democratic elections as well as the integrity of US courts and law enforcement. The order specifically mentioned the firm’s representation of <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong>’s 2016 campaign, and the role attorneys at Perkins Coie played in the creation of a dossier of unsubstantiated allegations about possible <strong>Trump-Russia ties</strong>.</p> 
  <p>While nine other law firms cut deals with the Trump administration to avoid being similarly targeted, <strong>Perkins Coie and two others sued the administration</strong>, its lawsuit pushing back against any allegation of wrongdoing. It noted that Trump filed a lawsuit in 2022 against Perkins Coie, Clinton and others alleging a conspiracy against him. The case was dismissed months later by a federal court.</p> 
  <p>On 4 April more than <strong>500 legal firms moved to file an amicus brief signed a brief in support of Perkins Coie</strong>’s fight back against Trump’s punitive actions.</p> 
  <p>The firm and others named in the executive orders earlier are each representing clients in lawsuits against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> over issues such as immigration, transgender rights and firings of government workers.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump says he is suing Perkins Coie after law firm filed suit against punitive executive order</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> said he was suing <strong>Perkins Coie</strong> law firm for “egregious and unlawful acts” and cited the conduct of an unidentified member of the firm.</p> 
  <p>Trump did not elaborate in his Truth Social post. Trump issued an executive order last month that calls to terminate federal contracts held by Perkins Coie’s clients if the firm performed any work on them. Perkins Coie sued the Trump administration in response, arguing the president’s order violated constitutional protections.</p> 
  <p>In his post, Trump wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m suing the law firm of Perkins Coie for their egregious and unlawful acts, in particular the conduct of a specific member of this firm, only to find out that the Judge assigned to this case is Beryl Howell, an Obama appointment, and a highly biased and unfair disaster. She ruled against me in the past, in a shocking display of sick judicial temperament, on a case that ended up working out very well for me, on appeal. Her ruling was so pathologically bad that it became the “talk of the town.” I could have a 100% perfect case and she would angrily rule against me. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome, and she’s got a bad case of it. To put it nicely, Beryl Howell is an unmitigated train wreck. NO JUSTICE!!!</p>

  <p><strong>Analysis: A battle looms over rule of law as some courts start to flex their muscles against Trump</strong></p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court">US supreme court</a> and other federal courts have begun flexing their muscles to push back on <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s efforts to defy judicial orders, escalating a hugely consequential battle over the rule of law.</p> 
  <p>The supreme court issued a significant order early Saturday morning blocking the federal government from removing people who had been detained in northern Texas from the US. Separately, US district judge <strong>James Boasberg</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/trump-deportation-ruling-venezuelan">has found probable cause </a>to hold the government in contempt for defying his orders to halt deportations.</p> 
  <p>In another case, the US district judge <strong>Paula Xinis</strong> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/judge-abrego-garcia-case-indicates-weighing-contempt-proceedings-trump-rcna201359">has forced the government </a>to provide daily updates in its efforts to comply with court orders to “facilitate” the return of <strong>Kilmar Ábrego García</strong> – the man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador.</p> 
  <p>It is a dynamic that underscores how a constitutional crisis between Trump and the courts is likely to be a push and pull between the government and judges that is simmering through the legal system and could very well break it.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Federal judge in Vermont to consider request for immediate release of detained Palestinian student Mohsen Mahdawi</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A federal judge is scheduled to consider a request on Wednesday to immediately release a Palestinian man who led protests against Israel’s war on Gaza as a student at Columbia University and was arrested during an interview about finalizing his US citizenship.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mohsen Mahdawi</strong>, a legal permanent resident for 10 years, was arrested on 14 April at the US Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Colchester, Vermont, by <strong>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)</strong> agents, his lawyers said. He is being detained at the Northwest state correctional facility in St Albans.</p> 
  <p>Mahdawi’s lawyers say he was detained in retaliation for his speech advocating for Palestinian human rights. “We ask this court to suspend this <strong>unlawful retaliation</strong> and slow the <strong>grave threat to free speech</strong> posed by his continued detainment by releasing Mr. Mahdawi on bail,” they ask in a court document filed on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>The government also filed a response on Tuesday. US district court filings in Mahdawi’s case, with the exception of judicial orders, are not publicly available online. A representative of Mahdawi and a justice department lawyer did not immediately respond to an emailed Associated Press request for the document on Wednesday morning.</p> 
  <p>Mahdawi had attended his interview, answered questions and signed a document that he was willing to defend the US constitution and laws of the nation. “<strong>It was a trap</strong>,” his lawyers said. They said masked Ice agents entered the interview room, shackled Mahdawi and put him in a car. A judge later issued an order barring the government from removing him from the state or country.</p> 
  <p>Mahdawi is still scheduled for a hearing date in immigration court in Louisiana on 1 May, his attorneys said. His notice to appear says he is removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act because the secretary of state has determined his presence and activities “would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling US foreign policy interest”.</p> 
  <p>Last month, secretary of state <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> said the state department was revoking visas held by visitors who were acting counter to national interests, including some who protested Israel’s war on Gaza and those who face criminal charges.</p> 
  <p>According to the court filing, Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank and moved to the US in 2014. He recently completed coursework at Columbia and was expected to graduate in May before beginning a master’s degree program there in the fall.</p> 
  <p>As a student, Mahdawi was an outspoken critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and organized campus protests until March 2024.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Fears grow that Signal leaks make Pete Hegseth top espionage target</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>As more develops about the US defense secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, and his repeated disclosures of sensitive military intelligence in unsecured Signal group chats, there are growing concerns his behavior has <strong>weakened the Pentagon in the eyes of its foreign adversaries</strong> and <strong>made him and his entourage a top espionage target</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Allies, already concerned by <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s aggressive tariffs, have also begun to see the US as an intelligence-sharing liability. There are fears that the increasing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/15/hegseth-pentagon-leak-adviser-dan-caldwell">firings and leak inquiries</a> in Hegseth’s orbit, along with his inability to manage these internal crises, exposes the entire global US war footing – especially, if a geopolitical and external crisis comes across his desk.</p> 
  <p>“[What if] a foreign entity, whether it be a state actor or non-state actor, is able to intercept the movements of troops or department personnel, or something like that, capture them and hold them to ransom,” said <a href="https://www.krisgoldsmith.com/">Kristofer Goldsmith</a>, an Iraq war veteran and CEO at <a href="https://www.taskforcebutler.org/">Task Force Butler</a>. “That kind of thing could very easily happen.”</p> 
  <p>Former officials serving in national security positions under Joe Biden’s administration also told the Guardian on background that <strong>the situation is perilous</strong> and that <strong>Hegseth has endangered the secrets of the defense department and the White House</strong>. One person said Russian and Chinese spies were no doubt directly targeting susceptible people in Hegseth’s inner circle.</p> 
  <p>Goldsmith, a threat intelligence expert, said there were many scenarios wherein a foreign government could gain access to those chats, without the need to directly compromise Hegseth’s devices.</p> 
  <p>“Pete Hegseth is texting his wife and his wife is posting on Instagram, clicks a link, and gets malware on her phone,” said Goldsmith, describing a hypothetical scenario. “Then the Chinese or the Iranians or the Russians just happen to be like, ‘Oh, shit, we’ve got Mrs Hegseth, [without] even targeting her.’”</p> 
  <p>To Goldsmith, Hegseth, who came into power on the heels of publicly characterizing the Pentagon as a “woke” shambles after years of ignoring “war fighters”, has already undermined the overall power of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a> in his months-long reign.</p>

  <p>My colleagues <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/dan-sabbagh">Dan Sabbagh</a></strong><em><strong> </strong></em>and<em><strong> </strong></em><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pjotr-sauer">Pjotr Sauer</a> </strong>have more on <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>’s abrupt cancelation of his trip to London to discuss ending <strong>Russia</strong>’s war in Ukraine and the subsequent downgrading of the talks. </p> 
  <p>Ministerial-level Ukraine peace talks that were due to take place in London on Wednesday have been postponed at the last minute <strong>amid speculation that Russia is willing to change its position</strong> and after the US secretary of state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, said he could not attend.</p> 
  <p>The UK Foreign Office indicated that ministerial-level meetings would be replaced by discussions at an official level – though initial public comments from the Kremlin suggested Moscow still opposed Nato countries sending peacekeepers to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p> 
  <p>The late downgrade came after reports apparently from <strong>Russia</strong> and the <strong>US</strong> suggesting the two countries had made progress in separate bilateral peace discussions between the White House and Kremlin.</p> 
  <p>Leaks to the Financial Times and other media indicate that <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> is willing to abandon its territorial claims to three Ukrainian regions</strong> it only partly occupies after three years of fighting <strong>in return for the US formally recognising the annexation of Crimea as part of a ceasefire agreement</strong>.</p> 
  <p>At present neither Russia nor the US has gone on the record to confirm the reports, though on Monday the US president, Donald Trump, said he would be providing “full detail” on the peace proposals “over the next three days”.</p> 
  <p>But a source familiar with Moscow’s thinking confirmed to the Guardian that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> had offered to freeze the conflict in Ukraine along the current frontlines during recent talks with <strong>Steve</strong> <strong>Witkoff</strong>, Trump’s Middle East envoy.</p> 
  <p>However, the source cautioned that it remained unclear what other demands Putin might present – and cautioned that the apparent concession <strong>could be a tactic to draw Trump into accepting broader Russian terms</strong>.</p>

  <p>Talks between the <strong>US</strong>, <strong>Ukraine</strong> and <strong>European</strong> officials to discuss ending <strong>Russia</strong>’s war in Ukraine faltered on Wednesday as US secretary of state <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> abruptly cancelled his trip to <strong>London</strong> and negotiations were downgraded, reports Reuters.</p> 
  <p>Rubio’s no show prompted a broader meeting of foreign ministers from Ukraine, the <strong>UK</strong>, <strong>France</strong> and <strong>Germany</strong> to be cancelled, although talks continued at a lower level. The US would now be represented by Ukraine envoy <strong>Gen</strong> <strong>Keith Kellogg</strong>. </p> 
  <p>The downgrading of the talks comes at a critical time, just days after president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> warned that <strong>Washington</strong> could walk away if there was no progress on a deal soon. Trump raised the pressure on Sunday when he said he hoped <strong>Moscow</strong> and <strong>Kyiv</strong> would make a deal this week to end the three-year war. </p> 
  <p>According to Reuters, a source close to the discussions said the downgrading of the trip came after Ukraine drafted a paper for the Europeans on Tuesday, in which it said there would be no discussions on territorial issues until “a full and unconditional ceasefire”. </p> 
  <p>The source told Reuters that the apparent US nervousness could indicate that the Ukrainian position did not align with what Washington’s representatives had agreed so far with the Russians. </p> 
  <p>Rubio spoke to the UK foreign secretary, <strong>David Lammy</strong>, late on Tuesday and said he looked forward to rescheduling his trip in the coming months after Wednesday’s “technical meetings”.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on his arrival in London with the foreign and defense ministers, Ukrainian presidential adviser <strong>Andriy Yermak</strong> said the talks would focus on ways to achieve a full and unconditional ceasefire as a first step to peace. “Despite everything, we will work for peace,” he said on social media. </p> 
  <p>The meeting is a follow-up to a similar session in <strong>Paris</strong> last week where US, Ukrainian and European officials discussed ways to move forward and narrow positions. During those talks, Trump’s special envoy <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong> presented a paper to the participants outlining proposals in which Ukraine in particular, but also Russia, would need to make concessions, according to three diplomats aware of the talks, Reuters reports.</p>

  <p>The <strong>veterans affairs department (VA)</strong> is ordering staff to report colleagues for instances of “anti-Christian bias” to a newly established taskforce, as part of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s push to reshape government policy on religious expression.</p> 
  <p>The VA secretary, <strong>Doug Collins</strong>, in an internal email seen by the Guardian, said the department had launched a taskforce to review the <strong>Joe</strong> <strong>Biden</strong> administration’s “treatment of Christians”.</p> 
  <p>“The VA taskforce now requests all VA employees to submit any instance of anti-Christian discrimination to Anti-ChristianBiasReporting.@va.gov,” the email reads. “Submissions should include sufficient identifiers such as names, dates, and locations.”</p> 
  <p>The email states that the department will review “all instances of anti-Christian bias” but that it is specifically seeking instances including “any informal policies, procedures, or unofficially understandings hostile to Christian views”.</p> 
  <p>In addition, the department is seeking “any adverse responses to requests for religious exemptions under the previous vaccine mandates” and “any retaliatory actions taken or threatened in response to abstaining from certain procedures or treatments (for example: abortion or hormone therapy)”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> signed an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/eradicating-anti-christian-bias/">executive order</a> within weeks of his second term aimed at ending the “anti-Christian weaponization of government”, and announced the formation of a taskforce, led by the attorney general, <strong>Pam Bondi</strong>, to end all forms of “anti-Christian targeting and discrimination” in the government.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">‘National disgrace’: US lawmakers decry student detentions on visit to Ice jails</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Congressional lawmakers denounced the treatment of <strong>Mahmoud Khalil</strong> and <strong>Rümeysa Öztürk</strong>, the students being detained by <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">US immigration</a></strong> authorities for their <strong>pro-Palestinian activism</strong>, as a “national disgrace” during a visit to the two facilities in <strong>Louisiana</strong> where each are being held.</p> 
  <p>“We stand firm with them in support of free speech,” the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana">Louisiana</a> congressman <strong>Troy Carter</strong>, who led the delegation, said during a press conference after the visits on Tuesday. “They are frightened, they’re concerned, they want to go home.”</p> 
  <p>Öztürk, a <strong>Tufts University</strong> PhD student, and Khalil, a graduate of <strong>Columbia</strong>, have been detained for more than a month since US immigration authorities took them into custody. Neither have been accused of criminal conduct and are being held in violation of their constitutional rights, members of the delegation said.</p> 
  <p>The delegation included representatives Carter, <strong>Bennie Thompson</strong>, <strong>Ayanna Pressley</strong>, <strong>Jim McGovern</strong>, Senator <strong>Ed Markey</strong>, and <strong>Alanah Odoms</strong>, the executive director of the <strong>ACLU of Louisiana</strong>. They visited the <strong>South <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/louisiana">Louisiana</a> Ice processing center</strong> in <strong>Basile</strong>, where Öztürk is being held, and traveled to the <strong>central Louisiana Ice processing center</strong> in <strong>Jena</strong> to see Khalil.</p> 
  <p>They met with Öztürk and Khalil and others in Ice custody to conduct “real-time oversight” of a “rogue and lawless” administration, Pressley said.</p> 
  <p>Their detention comes as the Trump administration has staged an extraordinary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/people-detained-deported-trump-immigration-crackdown">crackdown on immigrants</a>, illegally removing people from the country and seeking to detain and deport people for constitutionally protected free speech that it considers adverse to US foreign policy.</p> 
  <p>“It’s a national disgrace what is taking place,” Markey said. He added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We stand right now at a turning point in American history. The constitution is being eroded by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>. We saw today here in these detention centers in Louisiana examples of how far [it] is willing to go.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>McGovern described those being held as political prisoners. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is not about enforcing the law. This is moving us toward an authoritarian state.</p>

  <p>US stock index futures leapt on Wednesday, after president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> backed off from his threats to fire the head of the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> and raised hopes for a trade deal with <strong>China</strong>. </p> 
  <p>Shares of <strong>Tesla</strong>, meanwhile, rose 6.3% in premarket trading as the company kicked off magnificent seven – the group of technology stocks that has played a dominant role in the US stock market – earnings on a positive note.</p> 
  <p>According to Reuters, Tesla reported a profit for its core auto business that topped rock-bottom expectations.</p> 
  <p>Trump said on Tuesday he had “no intention” of firing Fed chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, walking back from his comments that Powell’s termination could not come “fast enough” after heavy criticism in the past few days.</p> 
  <p>Hopes for trade negotiations between the US and China, which have been locked in an escalating tit-for-tat tariff war, also helped lift sentiment after Trump expressed optimism that a trade deal with the country could “substantially” lower tariffs on Chinese goods. </p> 
  <p>Markets welcomed Trump’s change in tone, with futures jumping in extended trade on Tuesday and recovering after the attacks on Fed’s Powell had rattled investors and sparked sharp losses in US assets, including stocks and the dollar, earlier in the week.</p> 
  <p>Although Trump backtracked on his statement to fire Powell, he reiterated that he wanted the Fed to be more active in lowering interest rates, reports Reuters. Powell said last week that the central bank will be cautious in easing policy given the lack of clarity on how sweeping changes to US trade rules will impact growth and inflation.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Steve Hilton, former David Cameron adviser, to run for California governor</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>David Cameron</strong>’s former top adviser <strong>Steve Hilton</strong> has joined the 2026 race for <strong>California</strong> governor, running as a Republican to replace the Democrats’ <strong>Gavin Newsom</strong>, who is prevented by law from seeking a third term.</p> 
  <p>Hilton, who hosted a show on Fox News for six years, launched his campaign with the theme “Golden Again: Great Jobs, Great Homes, Great Kids”. His campaign said Hilton would be “reinforcing his commitment to positive, practical solutions instead of today’s ideology and dogma”, and that his brand of “positive populism” would focus on helping working families.</p> 
  <p>Hilton was one of the then <strong>UK</strong> prime minister’s closest advisers before the pair fell out over immigration and Brexit in 2016. Hilton, a former advertising executive, is thought to have been largely responsible for a host of early Cameron measures and photo opportunities including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/20/david-cameron-hug-a-husky-green-legacy-10-years">the husky expedition to </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/20/david-cameron-hug-a-husky-green-legacy-10-years">Alaska</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2016/apr/20/david-cameron-hug-a-husky-green-legacy-10-years"> to popularise his “Vote Blue, Go Green” message</a>.</p> 
  <p>At his campaign launch in <strong>Los Angeles</strong>, Hilton took aim at state Democrats over notoriously high state taxes, soaring home prices and “the destruction of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> dream.”</p> 
  <p>He said he would welcome running against the former vice-president <strong>Kamala Harris</strong>, a one-time California senator and attorney general <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/kamala-harris-california-governor">who has not ruled out a run for the governorship</a>.</p>

  <p>Analysts attribute <strong>Tesla</strong>’s overall difficulties to a number of factors, but ultimately conclude <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Musk</a></strong>’s role in the <strong>White House</strong> has caused a branding crisis for Tesla. The company is at a major crossroads, analysts say, that will only be remedied if Musk leaves his role in <strong>Doge</strong> and returns to Tesla as CEO full-time.</p> 
  <p>In addition to a drop in sales, a 50% dip in share prices, existing Tesla owners are looking to sell their vehicles in droves, Teslas have been vandalized across the country and in response to ongoing protests of the automaker, the <strong>Vancouver International Auto show</strong> removed the electronic carmaker from its March lineup. The company also recalled 46,000 Cybertrucks – nearly all that had been sold.</p> 
  <p>Musk said that the drop in demand is due to the macro economic trends – not branding. “Tesla is not immune to the macro demand for cars,” Musk said. “When there is economic uncertainty, people generally want to pause on doing a major capital purchase like a car. Absent macro issues we don’t see any reduction in demand.”</p> 
  <p>Analysts are not convinced.</p> 
  <p>“If Musk leaves the White House there will be permanent brand damage … but Tesla will have its most important asset and strategic thinker back as full-time CEO to drive the vision and the long term story will not be altered,” read a <strong>Wedbush Securities</strong> analyst note. Wedbush remained bullish on the company’s chances of turning its financials around. “IF Musk chooses to stay with the Trump White House it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow.”</p> 
  <p>The company declined to provide forward-looking guidance for the next quarter citing “shifting global trade policy on the automotive and energy supply chains”.</p> 
  <p>“While we are making prudent investments that will set up both our vehicle and energy businesses for growth, the rate of growth this year will depend on a variety of factors, including the rate of acceleration of our autonomy efforts, production ramp at our factories and the broader macroeconomic environment,” the earnings report reads. “We will revisit our 2025 guidance in our Q2 update.”</p> 
  <p>The company did warn, however, that “changing political sentiment” could meaningfully impact short-term demand for Tesla products.</p>

  <p>Though <strong>Elon Musk</strong> has acknowledged there have been “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/21/elon-musk-tesla-stock">rocky moments</a>” of late, he remained optimistic about <strong>Tesla</strong>’s future.</p> 
  <p>“The future for Tesla is better than ever,” he said. “The value of the company is delivering sustainable abundance with our affordable AI-powered robots. If you say, what’s the ideal future that you can imagine, that’s what you’d want. You’d want abundance for all in a way that’s sustainable, that’s good for the environment. Basically this is a happy future, this is the happiest future you can imagine.”</p> 
  <p>That “happy future” includes the company’s plans for fully self-driving cars, said the billionaire CEO as he laid out an ambitious timeline for when he expects the vehicles to hit US roads in some cities – “by the end of the year”. Tesla has <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/autonomous-driving/timeline-of-tesla-self-driving-aspirations-a9686689375/">historically struggled to meet</a> timelines Musk has publicly set for the launch of new products, especially when it comes to self-driving.</p> 
  <p>“The acid test is, can you go to sleep in your car and wake up in your destination and I’m confident that will be available in many cities in the US by the end of this year,” he said.</p> 
  <p>This would be on top of the Robotaxi service the company plans to roll out in June. “I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,” Musk said.</p> 
  <p>Despite missing <strong>Wall Street</strong> expectations on the top and bottom line, initial analyst reactions are optimistic given many had significantly lowered their expectations after the company reported a massive dip in vehicle deliveries.</p> 
  <p>“Against the backdrop of catastrophic expectations, with everything from sales to margins projected to continue the slump, the less-than-bad numbers have been received as welcome news by Tesla investors,” said <strong>Thomas Monteiro</strong>, senior analyst at <strong><a href="https://www.investing.com/academy/statistics/tesla-facts/">Investing.com</a></strong><em>. </em></p> 
  <p>Monteiro continued:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In a curious turn of events, it’s as if numbers show that even at the worst moment, Elon and the team’s operation can still bring a robust $19.3bn in revenue, with total revenue partly making up for the huge drop in auto revenue.</p> 
   <p>If this is the worst it gets for Tesla, then certainly there must be some upside for the stock once tailwinds, such as the highly awaited cheaper model and the Robotaxi, finally hit the market later this year.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Tesla investors relieved after Musk says he will pull back in Doge role</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>Tesla</strong> chief executive, <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a></strong>, said he will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/22/tesla-sales-musk-white-house-exit">start pulling back from his role at the so-called </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/22/tesla-sales-musk-white-house-exit">“department of government efficiency” (Doge)</a></strong> starting in May. Musk’s remarks came as the company reported a massive dip in both profits and revenues in the first quarter of 2025 amid backlash against his role in the <strong>White House</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Investors were relieved after Musk said he would scale back his government work and spend more time at Tesla, reported Reuters.</p> 
  <p>While the move is welcome one investor told the news agency, they added that it did not go far enough. <strong>Shawn Campbell</strong>, an adviser and investor at <strong>Camelthorn Investments</strong> who holds Tesla shares, told Reuters:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think more attention by Musk on Tesla is a net positive for the stock, but to see a meaningful move in the stock we would need to see a headline more like ‘Musk to leave DOGE to refocus on Tesla’.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Tesla saw a 9% drop in revenue year over year in the first quarter of 2025. The company brought in $19.3bn in revenue, well below <strong>Wall Street</strong> expectations of $21.45bn. The company reported an earnings per share of 27 cents, also well under investor expectations of 43 cents in earnings per share.</p> 
  <p>Tesla profits also slid 71% to $409m compared with $1.39bn in net income the previous year.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/02/tesla-sales-down-elon-musk">The company</a> suffered a 13% drop in vehicle deliveries, making it the company’s worst quarter since 2022. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tesla">Tesla</a> closed the quarter with 336,681 vehicles delivered.</p> 
  <p>“Starting probably next month, May, my time allocation to Doge will drop significantly,” Musk said on an investor call.</p> 
  <p>That said, he expects to spend one to two days a week continuing to do what he referred to as “critical work” at Doge “for as long as the president would like me to do so and as long as it is useful”.</p> 
  <p>More on this story in a moment, but first, here are some other developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has said tariffs on goods from China will be reduced “substantially” but “won’t be zero”</strong>, after US treasury secretary Scott Bessent said he expects a “de-escalation” in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Trump placed import taxes of 145% on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a>, which countered with 125% tariffs on US goods, causing volatility in the stock market and concern about slowing global economic growth.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Bessent has said that he expects a “de-escalation” in the trade war between the US and China and that the high tariffs are unsustainable. </strong>“I do say China is going to be a slog in terms of the negotiations,” Bessent said, according to a transcript obtained by the Associated Press. “Neither side thinks the status quo is sustainable.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump’s tariffs have unleashed a “major negative shock” into the world economy, the International Monetary Fund has said</strong>, as it cut its forecasts for US, UK and global growth.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump has said he has no plans to fire the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> chair, Jerome Powell</strong>. The president’s comment comes days after he called the central bank boss a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/21/us-stock-market-trump-fed-chair-jerome-powell">major loser</a>” whose “termination cannot come fast enough”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The secretary of state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, has announced a proposed reorganisation of the US state department as part of what he called an effort to reform it</strong> amid criticism from the Trump White House over the execution of US diplomacy.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The embattled US defense secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, has defended his most recent use of the encrypted messaging app <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/signal-group-chat-leak">Signal</a> to discuss sensitive military operations</strong>, blaming fired Pentagon officials for orchestrating leaks against the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, on has called sugar “poison” and recommended that Americans eat “zero” added <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/sugar">sugar</a> in their food. </strong>He acknowledged that the federal government was unlikely to be able to eliminate it from products, but said better labeling was needed for foods and that new government guidelines on nutrition would recommend people avoid sugar completely.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Congressional lawmakers denounced the treatment of Mahmoud Khalil and Rümeysa Öztürk, the students being detained by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">US immigration</a> authorities for their pro-Palestinian activism, as a “national disgrace”</strong> during a visit to the two facilities in Louisiana where each are being held.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>More than 150 presidents of US colleges and universities have signed a statement denouncing the Trump administration’s “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” with higher education</strong> – the strongest sign yet that US educational institutions are forming a unified front against the government’s extraordinary attack on their independence.</p></li>
