ProPublica identified the woman as Monica Moreta-Galarza, from Ecuador.</p> <p>The video captures Moreta-Galarza pleading with the now-suspended officer. He tries to dismiss her by saying “adios”. When Moreta-Galarza touches his shoulder, he grabs her, pushes her across the hallway, against the wall and on to the floor, where it appears she bangs the back of her head.</p>    <p>Utterly distraught, the women gets to her feet. After the incident, Democratic congressman Dan Goldman, of New York, said that Moreta-Galarza “fled” to his office with her two young children. ProPublica also reported that Moreta-Galarza was later taken to hospital.</p> <p>Goldman <a href="https://x.com/propublica/status/1971389328044769535">called </a>it an example of “secret police officers who are attacking our communities with excessive violence … and they just think that they can do it with impunity, because nobody is holding them accountable”, in comments to the media posted on X by ProPublica.</p> <p>The New York Times reported that Goldman and Brad Lander, the city comptroller and a Democrat as well, sent a two-page document recommending that Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, and federal prosecutors in Manhattan pursue a felony prosecution against the Ice officer seen pushing Moreta-Galarza.</p> <p>The two-page referral from Goldman and Lander accused the officer using “excessive physical force” as well as depriving her of her federal right to be “free from unreasonable searches and seizures”, the Times noted.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amny.com/police-fire/ice-supervisor-relieved-shoving-mother-nyc-immigration-court/">According to</a> local news outlet AMNY, the agent was seen last month forcibly pulling a teenage girl from her father’s arms as she cried. The outlet also noted that several court observers have raised concerns for months about his physical conduct. The Guardian has reached out to DHS for further comment.</p> <p>In recent months, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/25/new-york-immigration-courts-photo-essay">breaking norms</a>, Ice has been showing up outside immigration court across the country and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/26/cuba-asylum-seeker-ice-courtroom">arresting people</a> in the hallways as they come out of hearings in the small courtrooms.</p> <p>The news of the incident on Friday came as deaths in Ice custody <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/ice-detention-death-toll-trump">reached at least 16</a> so far this year and new federal data showed that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/immigrants-criminal-record-ice-detention">largest group</a> of people in Ice detention are now those with no criminal history.</p>
