<p>Three people have died and at least 15 were injured in separate incidents linked to rough seas battering the Spanish island of Tenerife pulling several people into the ocean, emergency services said.</p> <p>A rescue helicopter airlifted a man who had fallen into the water at a beach in La Guancha, a municipality in the north of the island, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital.</p> <p>A local newspaper, El Día, said the man was a 43-year-old Spaniard who was fishing at the site at the time of the accident and “fell from a considerable height”.</p> <p>A man was found floating at El Cabezo beach in the south. Lifeguards and medical staff tried to resuscitate him but he died at the scene. His identity has not been disclosed.</p> <p>A woman had a fatal heart attack when a giant wave swept 10 people into the sea in the northern city of Puerto de la Cruz. El Día reported that the woman was a 79-year-old Dutch citizen.</p> <p>Emergency services said on social media that several people fell into the water after a sudden tidal surge. An unexpectedly high wave crashed into a pier, dragging people into the ocean. Three people were seriously injured and treated in hospital.</p> <p>The local broadcaster La Radio Canaria shared footage on X that it said <a href="https://x.com/laradiocanaria/status/1987249210027028504?s=20">showed the moment</a> the wave swept several people from the Puerto de la Cruz pier.</p> <p>At least five people were injured at Roque de las Bodega beach in the north-eastern corner of the island when a strong wave towed them into the sea. El Día said all were French tourists.</p> <p>Emergency services had previously issued a warning for sudden sea surges and strong winds, which are common in autumn and winter, and the archipelago is on further alert for coastal hazards.</p> <p>The public have been urged to avoid exposed vantage points on piers and breakwaters where visitors often stop to take pictures and videos of crashing waves.</p> <p><em>Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report</em></p>
