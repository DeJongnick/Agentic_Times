  <p><strong>New ‘bendy’ buses will hit Sydney’s streets</strong></p> 
  <p>Addition to the fleet a first in 12 years, but some locals are sceptical more than $450m in funding is enough to fix a broken network, <strong>AAP</strong> has reported.</p> 
  <p>While a bigger fleet will ease some pressure on commuters, new measures to address longstanding driver shortages are yet to be flagged ahead of next week’s NSW budget.</p> 
  <p>Independent Pittwater MP Jacqui Scruby said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s wonderful there’s a demonstrated commitment in this budget for the bus network.</p> 
   <p>(But) there’s no point having lots of buses in the fleet if there’s no one to drive.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Her comments followed Labor announcing $452m to boost services, accelerate the rollout of new buses and meet rising costs for local bus operators.</p> 
  <p>The bus union welcomed the funding but remains frustrated about driver retention and privatisation.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Independent MP Allegra Spender has said it “is a really positive sign that the Treasurer has recognised the importance of tax reform”, while appearing on the ABC this afternoon.</p> 
  <p>Spender said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Even actually achieving revenue neutrality right now is difficult with our tax system because we have a tax system where things like fuel excise is dropping tobacco excise is dropping, GST as a proportion of our tax system is dropping, and we have fewer working aged people as part of our proportion of community.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked how to get voters to embrace tax change that would slow international unfairness, Spender said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is hard, but it comes back to why is tax reform important?</p> 
   <p>When I talk to people in my community, people really worry their kids and grandkids are not going to be able to meet the same milestones as previous generations and that is really motivating.</p>

  <p><strong>Civil liberties group critical of high court ruling against union leaders</strong></p> 
  <p>The NSW Council for Civil Liberties (NSWCCL) has released a statement after former CFMEU leaders lost their high court challenge against the government putting the union into administration.</p> 
  <p>In part, the statement said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The NSW Council for Civil Liberties (NSWCCL) remains seriously concerned about the administration and its implications for all member-based civil society organisations, unions, and registered clubs.</p> 
   <p>The administration legislation may now operate as a legal model for the takeover of other unions and other member-based civil society organisations in the future.</p> 
   <p>Over the past twelve months there has been a worrying trend of state overreach by the federal Labor government, which threatens to undermine the rule of law, including through the passing of the Administration Act and the introductions of mandatory minimum sentencing late last year.</p> 
   <p>The NSWCCL maintains that everyone has the right to natural justice and procedural fairness, regardless of the allegations they face.</p>

  <p><strong>Netflix producing series based on My Brilliant Career</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>AAP reports</strong> streaming service’s creation of series based on Miles Franklin’s classic novel will create hundreds of jobs and inject a record $17m into South Australia.</p> 
  <p>Netflix is partnering with Jungle Entertainment on the fresh take on the 1901 coming-of-age tale, which resonated deeply with a generation of young Australian women who longed for the freedom to shape their own destinies.</p> 
  <p>South Australian arts minister Andrea Michaels says the production, which has started filming in Adelaide and across SA, will create 450 local jobs across key creatives, crew and extras and engage 260 small businesses.</p> 
  <p>Netflix has not revealed the budget for the series, which will stream globally, but the government says the projected economic return to SA is $17m.</p>

  <p><strong>Study shows more Australians say they are LGBTQ+</strong></p> 
  <p>Australians are becoming more comfortable identifying as lesbian, gay or bisexual as advocates call on policymakers to use population data to improve services and accessibility.</p> 
  <p>Charles Darwin University researchers estimate Australia’s LGBTQ+ population doubled between 2012 and 2020, increasing from 3.3% to 5.8% of adults over 15.</p> 
  <p>The data came from the <a href="https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/hilda">Hilda longitudinal survey</a> of 17,000 Australians, with responses from participants who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or another sexual identity. It was collected in 2012, 2016 and 2020.</p> 
  <p>Lead researcher Fiona Shalley:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Being a minority sexual identity and engaging in that used to be criminal, but Australia has come a long way.</p> 
   <p>There was also stigma and discrimination associated with being a sexual minority, so a lot of people did not disclose their identity until more recently.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>If the young adults who took part in the study maintained their sexual minority identities throughout their life, Australia’s LGBTQ+ population could grow by about 3% each year.</p> 
  <p>By the time the next data is updated from 2024, the population size could be about 1.7 million people, Shalley said.</p>

  <p>Confirmed cases of the disease in dogs are still very low, restricted to NSW and Queensland, and have fallen since the 2022 spike identified by the researchers, although not to 2019 levels.</p>

  <p><strong>Chalmers says he wants to lean in to appetite to be ‘bold and ambitious’</strong></p> 
  <p>Chalmers was asked about the “level of boldness” when thinking about economic reform at the National Press Club. The treasurer said he believes there is an “appetite to be bold and ambitious,” adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is about testing the country’s reform appetite and I don’t see it in personal terms but I am personally willing to grasp the nettle, to use an old saying. I am prepared to do my bit.</p>

  <p>Chalmers responded to a question about any economic reform leading to “losers in the tax system”. The treasurer said the government would need to consider “trade-offs”, some of which would probably be difficult. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Let’s see how far we can go together, recognising those trade-offs, having an appropriate high level of ambition, being upfront with people along the way and explaining why those trade-offs are important and why they might be necessary.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>CFMEU</strong> failed to overturn the Albanese government’s move to force the union’s construction division into administration in the high court, <strong>AAP</strong> reports. The federal government intervened in August 2024, after allegations of bikie and organised crime figures infiltrating the scandal-riddled union in addition to other claims of criminal activity.</p> 
  <p>Controversial leader <strong>John Setka</strong> said the allegations against the union were false, but confirmed he would step down to stop the intense media coverage. Former CFMEU officials challenged the government’s legislation that removed the union’s leadership and placed it into administration.</p> 
  <p>The plaintiffs, sacked CFMEU officials, argued the law was invalid on four grounds, including that it breached their implied freedom of political communication. The full bench of the high court found all four arguments were unfounded.</p> 
  <p>Victoria Police last September said Setka would not face criminal charges over visits to government work sites, after it looked into 20 allegations of “potential criminal activity”.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW Police charge four over alleged six-hour sexual assault of teen girl</strong></p> 
  <p>NSW Police’s sex crimes squad have now charged four males on allegations they sexually assaulted a 17-year-old girl over a six-hour period in Sydney’s west last year.</p> 
  <p>Police allege a male followed the girl to her car last December in the suburb of Liverpool, where she reluctantly let him. Once inside, police allege the male began sexually assaulting her and held a video call with others who authorities allege became his co-conspirators. After the alleged assault, police then allege the woman tried to get the male to leave her vehicle. He refused and convinced her to drive to a park, where two other males allegedly entered the vehicle, where she was allegedly further assaulted.</p> 
  <p>A fourth male then entered vehicle as well, police allege, before the group took control of the car, driving around Sydney for six hours while continuing the assault. When the alleged assault ended, the victim called a friend and reported the allegations to police.</p> 
  <p>A boy, 16, has been charged with 24 offences including nine counts of sexual intercourse without consent and eight counts of aggravated sexual assault. Another boy, 14, has been charged with 10 offences, including seven on aggravated sexual assault. Two other men, aged 18 and 19, were arrested this week and face multiple charges of aggravated sexual assault each.</p> 
  <p>Det Supt <strong>Jayne Doherty</strong> alleged the following<strong> </strong>at a news conference:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The four of them acted together, creating fear on the victim, degrading her whilst the others offended against her and at times there was more than one person offending against this poor young girl. …</p> 
   <p>As I said this morning, this will impact the rest of her life. She’s supported by family, who are very strong and supportive of her. They realise the journey that she will have for the rest of her life and they are supporting her.</p>

  <p><strong>Man charged in Victoria on allegations he fooled family in million-dollar scam linked to fake cancer diagnosis</strong></p> 
  <p>Police in Victoria have charged a man for allegedly fooling his family into thinking he had cancer and convincing them to hand over more than $1m.</p> 
  <p>Police said this morning the man, 30, was arrested earlier this month over the alleged scheme. Officials detailed allegations the man used the profits of a family home sale without telling his partner and attempted to hide the missing money by claiming he made an investment that would pay out a $2m profit.</p> 
  <p>When the money did not appear, the man allegedly made up a fake story he had cancer and was a victim of fraud. He later allegedly deceived family members into handing over an additional $1.2m, creating fake emails and impersonating lawyers to back up his claims.</p> 
  <p>The man was charged with 28 offences, including 10 counts of obtaining property by deception and 13 counts of making a false document. He will appear before court on 25 June.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">PM could make snap visit to Europe to see Trump next week</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> could make a snap visit to Europe next week to meet <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, days after their first talks at the G7 summit were abruptly cancelled. Nato leaders will gather at The Hague on 24-25 June. Albanese said he could join the talks, during which he could meet face-to-face with the US president.</p> 
  <p>“Yes, that is being considered,” he said ahead of his departure from Canada.</p> 
  <p>Trump and Albanese had planned discussions on Australia’s defence spending and the Aukus nuclear submarines agreement this week in Kananaskis, but Trump left the summit a day early to return to Washington to deal with the Middle East war.</p> 
  <p>They are also due to discuss punishing trade tariffs imposed by Trump.</p> 
  <p>Albanese instead met the US treasury secretary, <strong>Scott Bessent</strong>, as well as the US trade representative, <strong>Jamieson Greer</strong>, and the director of the US National Economic Council, <strong>Kevin Hassett</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Albanese said he was “mature” about Trump’s early departure but the prospect of a Nato visit suggests the government is eager to lock in a meeting before long.</p>

  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese says he has accepted the European Union’s offer of high-level negotiations on a new defence and security pact.</strong> The prime minister met the European Commission president, <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong>, and the European Council president, <strong>António Costa</strong>, on the sidelines of the G7 summit here in Kananaskis in the past hour.</p> 
  <p>Albanese says he will task the foreign minister, <strong>Penny Wong</strong>, and the defence minister, <strong>Richard Marles</strong>, with leading work on the agreement. The EU already has similar deals in place with countries including Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.</p> 
  <p>It is not legally binding and would not include troop deployment, but is designed to strengthen cooperation on global security challenges.</p> 
  <p>It comes amid renewed talks on a possible Australia-EU free trade agreement. The deal could be used in areas including foreign interference, cybersecurity, counter-terrorism, defence industries and critical technologies. Negotiations on the new agreement were first proposed at the inauguration mass of <strong>Pope Leo XIV</strong> in Rome last month.</p> 
  <p>Australia was initially cool on the idea, but it has picked up serious momentum at the G7 summit in Canada.</p>

  <p><strong>Lifeblood’s chief medical officer says change to blood and plasma donation rules ‘very exciting day’</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Dr Jo Pink</strong>, Lifeblood’s chief medical officer, said the group is very excited by the changes to its blood and plasma donation rules. She told ABC News this morning:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Every time a male donates at the moment, we ask them whether they have had anal sex with another man. That will cease, and instead, we are moving to gender-neutral rules. You asked me at the beginning why these rules were in place, and they did stem from the HIV period, which was a very difficult and sad period. And those rules were important to have in place to protect the safety of the blood supply. But as you know, things have changed now. So it’s a very exciting day for us.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Dr Pink went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I know that our LBGTIQ + community is very keen to donate. So I’m really hoping that they’ll blast that number out of the park and we will get heaps of donations.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The change related to the blood donation questionnaire still needs “a little bit of work” and will be implemented sometime in 2026.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Lifeblood to change sexual activity rules, opening up blood donation to gay and bisexual men</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Australian Red Cross Lifeblood </strong>said today <a href="https://www.lifeblood.com.au/news-and-stories/media-centre/media-releases/lifeblood-announces-changes-sexual-activity-rules-blood-and-plasma">it would soon remove sexual activity wait times</a> from its eligibility rules, opening up blood and plasma donation to most gay and bisexual men.</p> 
  <p>Current donor rules prevent many men who have sex with men and transgender women who have sex with men from giving blood or plasma if they have had sex in the past three months. But those wait times for plasma will be removed from 14 July, allowing donations for those who meet all other current criteria.</p> 
  <p>Research and modelling shows there will be no impact to the safety of the plasma supply with this change. Lifeblood’s chief medical officer, <strong>Dr Jo Pink</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>With more than 600,0000 people estimated to be covered by the previous wait times, we now anticipate an extra 24,000 donors and 95,000 extra donations of plasma to be made each year.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Lifeblood has been working with the <strong>Therapeutic Goods Administration</strong> to also remove questions specifically aimed at gay and bisexual men from its eligibility questionnaire. All donors will soon be asked the same questions about sexual activity, regardless of their gender or sexuality, under the plan and most people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be able to donate blood. People with new or multiple partners will be able to donate blood if they have not had anal sex in the last three months.</p> 
  <p>Dr Pink said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a significant milestone in being able to safely reduce wait times and make it easier for more people in the LGBTQIA+ community to donate.</p> 
   <p>Blood safety is and always will be our top priority, but we know the current donation rules have been very difficult for many people in the LGBTQIA+ community. While they were put in place to ensure a safe blood supply in the past, we know that they’ve contributed to the stigma faced by the community.</p>

  <p><strong>Findings of Victoria’s Indigenous truth-telling inquiry may be used as teaching resource</strong></p> 
  <p>The findings of Victoria’s Indigenous truth-telling inquiry, set to be handed down by the <strong>Yoorrook justice commission</strong> in the coming days, may be used as a teaching resource in schools, parties to the state’s treaty talks say.</p> 
  <p>A joint statement by the Victorian government and First Peoples’ Assembly, who are negotiating a state-wide treaty, says the parties have discussed the significance of the inquiry’s three-year process to create an official record of the state’s history.</p> 
  <p>It says Yoorrook’s official record could be a “valuable resource for teachers to use when educating students about Victoria’s history.”</p> 
  <p>Yoorrook – tasked with documenting injustices experienced by Victoria’s First Nations people since colonisation – is preparing to hand over its final report to the state in the coming days.</p> 
  <p>The commission’s deputy commissioner, Travis Lovett, will conclude his 400km “Walk for Truth” to highlight the commission’s work, at state parliament this morning.</p> 
  <p>Lovett, a Kerrupmara Gunditjmara man, is expected to present the Victoran premier, Jacinta Allan, with a message stick he has carried along the walk.</p>

  <p><strong>Most Australians support under-16s social media ban, but many have concerns about privacy</strong></p> 
  <p>The federal government is forging ahead with its age assurance trial for its under-16s social media ban, releasing survey results from late last year showing nearly 90% of Australians at the time backed the ban. But a survey of nearly 4,000 adults and children found a huge number of people concerned about privacy and security issues related to the new regime.</p> 
  <p>The operators of the trial will release some early findings later this week, with a final report to go to the government shortly. Ahead of that data, the communications minister, <strong>Anika Wells,</strong> has shared more information to make the government’s case for the change, showing a high level of support for the under-16s ban and stats from a survey of children showing many teens were worried about content they see online and how much time they spend on social media.</p> 
  <p>The survey of around 4,000 people – 3,140 adults and 807 children aged 8-17 – was conducted in October and November 2024. It found 88.9% of those surveyed were somewhat or very supportive of the age assurance change, with 80% willing to use such technology, at the time of the survey.</p> 
  <p>It also found 77% of people were very concerned about privacy issues and 76.8% very concerned about security issues related to implementing an age assurance framework. About half were also worried about accuracy, and also government oversight.</p> 
  <p>It said around 88% were willing to consider a government ID system to enforce the scheme, but only 37.7% were comfortable with biometric methods – which underpins several leading age assurance methods.</p> 
  <p>Of children, about 50% said they were worried about cyberbullying online, and 45% had been exposed to inappropriate contact, with another 49% concerned about what is showing up on their feeds.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, Wells said the under-16s social media ban was to come into effect from December and that she was engaging with the eSafety Commissioner about the rules to underpin the scheme:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This research shows Australians widely support our world-leading age restrictions on social media for under-16s and have strong expectations of platforms when it comes to data protection and security.</p> 
   <p>Our Government knows social media age-restrictions will not be the end-all be-all solution for harms experienced by young people online but they will make a significant impact.</p>

  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers links collapse in trust in liberal democracies to failure to lift living standards </strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> will say today that his three priorities for Labor’s second term are boosting productivity, fixing the budget and making Australia more resilient in an increasingly tumultuous world.</p> 
  <p>The government does not believe it can tackle these three big economic challenges without buy-in from a wide range of stakeholders, from business to unions and, more broadly, without a mood for change among voters and the media.</p> 
  <p>After <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> last week announced an economic roundtable in August to build a national consensus for economic reform, Chalmers will use a speech at the National Press Club this lunchtime to tie the failure to lift living standards with the collapse in trust in liberal democracies around the world.</p> 
  <p>“We have a mandate to deliver the policies and plans we took to the election, and a duty to build on them. And the best way to work out what’s next, is together,” the treasurer will say in Canberra.</p> 
  <p>The government has a “responsibility and an obligation” to revive productivity through reform, not least for the prosperity of future generations.</p> 
  <p>“That’s why productivity matters, why budget sustainability matters, why resilience in the face of global turmoil matters. It’s why reform matters,” he will say.</p> 
  <p>Treasury’s incoming government brief <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/11/labor-wants-to-boost-productivity-does-this-mean-australians-need-to-work-even-harder">blamed Australia’s poor productivity </a>performance on four things.</p> 
  <p>“Firstly, our economy is not dynamic or innovative enough. Secondly, private investment has picked up, but not by enough to make our capital deep enough. Thirdly, skills aren’t abundant enough or matched well enough to business needs.</p> 
  <p>“Finally, our changing industrial base and the growth in services – where productivity is harder to find, and where traditional measures don’t account well for quality.”</p>

  <p><strong>Australia ‘calling for de-escalation’ between Israel and Iran, Marles says</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Richard Marles</strong> would not be drawn on the Trump administration’s policy on the conflict between Israel and Iran and any potential support Australia may lend to its ally. <br><br><strong>Speaking with the ABC’s 7.30</strong> on Tuesday, the acting prime minister said Australia was “deeply concerned” about the conflict broadening and was “very much calling for de-escalation”.<br><br>He said the government wanted “to see a move towards diplomacy and dialogue … implied in that, obviously, is a very clear concern that we have about the opposite – about this escalating into some broader conflict”.</p> 
  <p>When asked whether Australia would support US involvement in the conflict militarily, Marles said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m not going to go down the path of speculating but we’re not a part of this conflict.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In light of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s early departure from the G7 meeting in Canada, Marles said he did not know whether the prime minister had been notified that the president was cancelling Wednesday’s meeting with Albanese before it became public knowledge.<br><br>In the meantime, he advised Australians to shelter in place in Tehran. <br><br>He said 650 Australians in Iran and 600 in Israel had sought an assisted departure and that preparations were being made to start departures when airspace opened “in any form”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sharp rise in Australians identifying as LGBTQI+</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Australians are becoming more comfortable identifying as lesbian, gay or bisexual, with experts likening it to the sexual revolution of previous decades, the <strong>Australian Associated Press</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Researchers at Charles Darwin University estimated Australia’s LGBTQI+ population doubled between 2012 and 2020, increasing from 3.3% to 5.8% of adults over 15.</p> 
  <p>The data came from the Hilda longitudinal survey of 17,000 Australians with responses from participants who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or another sexual identity.</p> 
  <p>The data was collected in 2012, 2016 and 2020.</p> 
  <p>During this time period there was a “burst of acceptance” of sexual minorities in Australia, particularly after the 2017 same-sex marriage vote, the lead researcher, <strong>Fiona Shalley</strong>, said.</p> 
  <p>If the young adults who participated in the study maintained their sexual minority identities throughout their life, Australia’s LGBTQI population could grow by about 3% each year.</p> 
  <p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2024 estimated 4.5% – or about one in 20 – Australians aged 16 and over were LGBTI+, based on combined data from multiple household surveys.</p>

  <p><strong>German chancellor asks Albanese to wrap up negotiations over EU free trade deal with Australia</strong></p> 
  <p>The German chancellor, <strong>Friedrich Merz,</strong> has asked <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> if he can help secure a speedy end to negotiations over a European Union free trade agreement with Australia.</p> 
  <p>The pair have met on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Kananaskis and agreed to do everything they can to finalise long-running negotiations. Progress on a deal stalled in 2023 but have gained new momentum since <strong>Donald Trump</strong> launched his tariff war.</p> 
  <p>Australia has previously offered a possible removal of the luxury car tax, but wants greater access to European markets for lamb and beef exports. Geographic indicators on products such as prosecco and feta cheese also remain a point of conflict from the European side.</p> 
  <p>“Is there anything that we can do, that I can do to speed it up a little bit?” Merz asked Albanese in their meeting.</p> 
  <p>Albanese said Australia was “very keen on getting it done quickly”.</p> 
  <p>He will meet European Commission president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> later today, along with European Council boss <strong>António Costa</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The two sides are also considering a new defence and security pact which could involve military exercises and other cooperation in areas of mutual interest including foreign interference, cybersecurity, counter-terrorism, defence industries and critical technologies.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Albanese tells G7: single countries should not be allowed to control supply of critical mineral</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> is at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, in Canada’s Rocky Mountains, meeting with world leaders and talking about renewable energy and artificial intelligence.</p> 
  <p>The prime minister has joined the traditional leaders family photo and held bilateral meetings with German chancellor <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong> and Japan’s prime minister <strong>Shigeru Ishiba.</strong></p> 
  <p>He is expected to meet the British prime minister, Sir <strong>Keir Starmer,</strong> later in the afternoon, local time, and has shared a hug with Ukraine’s <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong>.</p> 
  <p>In one of the main summit sessions, Albanese made an intervention on critical minerals, telling the summit single countries should not be allowed to control supply.</p> 
  <p>“Critical minerals are the new drivers of energy security,” Albanese said.</p> 
  <p>“Australia is blessed to have some of the largest critical minerals deposits on Earth.</p> 
  <p>“But we are increasingly finding that critical minerals markets are concentrated and vulnerable to manipulation. Producers struggle to remain competitive, and supply chains are affected by export bans and controls.”</p> 
  <p>Albanese told the leaders that Australia remains committed to working with international partners to build new energy industries, ensure regional energy security and advance the energy transition.</p> 
  <p>He said he was pleased that Australia had signed on to the G7’s critical minerals action plan, “which will support secure, diversified critical minerals supply chains”.</p>
