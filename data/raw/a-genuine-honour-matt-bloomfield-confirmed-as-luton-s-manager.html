<p>Matt Bloomfield has been appointed as Luton’s manager on a three-and-a-half-year contract. The 40-year-old takes charge after Rob Edwards agreed to step down last week.</p> <p>Bloomfield arrives from the League One promotion hopefuls Wycombe and inherits a team 20th in the Championship table, two points above the relegation zone. His first game comes at home to Preston on Saturday.</p> <p>“It’s a genuine honour and a privilege to be here, to be appointed as manager of this incredible club,” Bloomfield told Luton’s website. </p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jan/09/rob-edwards-leaves-luton-manager">Edwards departed last week</a> after four straight defeats. Luton had been reluctant to part ways with Edwards, who led the club to promotion to the Premier League in his first season, but both parties felt it was the “right time” for him to move on.</p> <p>Luton identified Bloomfield as the ideal candidate after being impressed by his work at Wycombe and Colchester, his first managerial job. Wycombe, who are second in League One, were top at the turn of the year after an extraordinary start to the season. Bloomfield was interviewed for the Millwall job but did not pursue the opportunity.</p> <p>Bloomfield will be joined by his assistant Richard Thomas, first-team coach Lee Harrison and analyst Ben Cirne. Wycombe said: “The club is naturally disappointed with Matt’s decision to leave in the middle of the season. However, we respect his decision to pursue this new chapter in his career. He leaves with the gratitude and best wishes of everyone at Wycombe.”</p> <p>Wycombe are also braced for a fight to retain their coveted striker Richard Kone, who has scored 13 goals in the third tier this season, amid strong interest from Championship clubs. The 21-year-old has been a revelation since joining from ninth-tier Athletic Newham after a successful trial 12 months ago. The Wales defender Joe Low is a target for Swansea City.</p>
