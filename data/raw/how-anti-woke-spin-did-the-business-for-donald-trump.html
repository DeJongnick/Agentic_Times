<h1>How anti-woke spin did the business for Donald Trump</h1>

<p>While Nesrine Malik is right in stating that woke talking points weren’t a key part of Kamala Harris’s campaign, she is incorrect in concluding that progressive stances on social issues were in no way responsible for Donald Trump’s election victory (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/25/woke-lost-us-election-patrician-class-identity-politics">‘Woke’ didn’t lose the US election: the patrician class who hijacked identity politics did, 25 November</a>). Like&nbsp;Malik, I see structural issues as&nbsp;the primary determining factor, my focus as a Democratic activist being on an economy touted as thriving but in fact failing to benefit a populace struggling with obscenely high grocery prices. But having heard Harris equivocate rather than reject controversial statements that were catnip to Trump, I can assure you that there&nbsp;was palpable cultural antagonism too.</p> <p>Those ads of Trump packed a punch, not least “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you”, which capitalised on Harris’s failure to clarify her 2019 support (based on a reading of constitutional law) for taxpayer-funded gender-affirming surgeries for prisoners. But just as Harris failed in this regard in 2024, the Democratic leadership has mangled&nbsp;election messaging over many years – opening itself to charges of cultural (certainly not economic) extremism.</p> <p>I find it interesting that Malik has to define “defund the police” after claiming that “even a cursory glance shows” it “is not to abolish policing”. No, a cursory glance at this ludicrous slogan implies, however unintentionally, just that. And to refuse to believe that anti-woke propaganda, sometimes false but often made possible by Democrats’ own missteps, played a part in the disastrous 2024 election results is to refuse the obvious.<br><strong>Karen Thatcher-Smith</strong><br><em>Sonoma, California, US</em></p> <p>• Nesrine Malik argues that a “cursory glance” would show that “defunding the police” was never about abolishing the police but rather a call to invest in preventive measures. This rather begs the question: why on earth did progressives campaign with such a slogan? It is hard to imagine populist agent provocateurs coming up with a more effective means of separating well‑meaning&nbsp;progressives from the public at large.<br><strong>Alex Campbell</strong><br><em>Brighton, East Sussex</em></p> <p>• Nesrine Malik is right that the “common enemy is the way in which society itself is designed”. The economic moguls ruling the patrician class successfully sold to many a self-fulfilling investment in a fearful characterisation of wokeness as an absurd and impertinent intrusion in our lives. It is a compelling, too-easy answer&nbsp;when an underlying fear of&nbsp;loss of privilege or self‑challenging the pain of false beliefs around our rightful place in&nbsp;the social order is at stake. Inertia&nbsp;rules – for the moment.</p> <p>Genuine, universal change is hard. It’s hard for the privileged to give up their luxuries and for the oppressed to imagine deserving and enjoying a better life in a truly egalitarian society.</p> <p>Wokeness itself is not the problem. There is no such thing as woke, there is only waking. It is a never-ending process. It is a journey that we must all undertake – towards a society that fully values&nbsp;and expresses the spirituality, democracy, caring, sharing, learning and joy inherent in a naturally evolving life, and no one must be left behind.<br><strong>Daniel O<em>’</em>Sullivan</strong><br><em>McLeans Ridges, New South Wales, Australia</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
