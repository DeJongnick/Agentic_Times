<h1>Donald Trump increases his golf footprint in Scotland while world looks elsewhere</h1>

<p>Even a cursory glance towards the scale of this year’s Open Championship at Royal Portrush emphasised why ongoing and occasionally fevered chatter about Turnberry staging the world’s oldest major is futile. Whether the Turnberry owner was Donald Trump or Donald Duck, its lack of adjacent infrastructure makes it unfit for the Open. The Ayrshire venue, lauded again by its owner, Trump, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/28/trump-uses-press-conference-with-starmer-to-boost-his-golfing-business">during a visit in recent days</a>, is simply incapable of hosting the Open in its present form.</p> <p>This need not be an uncomfortable reality for the US president, who can secure at least a portion of the profile and kudos he desires for Turnberry – one of the world’s most outstanding golf courses – from an alternative source. It would, in fact, now be a surprise if Turnberry does not appear on the Scottish Open’s rota at some point soon. Mutual convenience is staring us all in the face if Trump can even temporarily accept a prize which sits in the shadow of the championship he has craved since buying Turnberry in 2014.</p>    <p>The European Tour Group has proved adept at navigating choppy sporting waters. Or, perhaps, merely dealing with the same away from prying eyes. It was the DP World Tour, formerly European, which eased Saudi Arabia into the golf mainstream and it is the same tour which allows Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton to pursue Ryder Cup ambitions while technically in dispute over fines issued for participation in LIV competitions.</p> <p>As eyes fix on Royal Porthcawl and the Women’s Open this week, where Lottie Woad will look to continue her vertiginous rise, the Legends Tour – Europe’s domain for senior citizens – will stop off at Trump Aberdeen. Only days later, the DP World Tour’s Nexo Championship is to be contested at the same venue. The European Tour Group has continued its trick of hiding in plain sight by arranging these events with no backlash whatsoever. Not so much as a raised eyebrow; a scenario that will inevitably continue as the tournaments take place.</p> <p>Depending on one’s viewpoint, this is either a tremendous example of public relations or an ominous sign that few people care about the European Tour Group’s approach to business. This is not at all to suggest protest or hand-wringing is essential, rather that Trump has quietly and already increased his golfing footprint in a land far from home. The Scottish government has even contributed £180,000 of public money to the Nexo Championship.</p> <p>The stakes look set to be raised. Doonbeg, now Trump Ireland, is known to be under consideration to stage the Irish Open. Reports suggest that could happen as quickly as 2026. Doonbeg and the Irish Open looks a strong alliance; a stunning location which also boasts hotel accommodation. Ireland, like Scotland, should have links venues for its national open.</p>    <p>Guy Kinnings, the European Tour Group’s chief executive, attended a function in Trump’s company in Aberdeenshire on Monday evening before being present for the opening of the president’s New Course on the Menie Estate. As Trump cut the ribbon on the New Course, Kinnings was one of just four people standing behind him; two were the president’s sons.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/13/chris-gotterup-keeps-nerve-to-hold-off-rory-mcilroy-and-win-scottish-open">Scottish Open’s present base</a> at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian is convenient. Leading players can stay on or close to the venue. Renaissance’s American owners want the Scottish Open to stay there in perpetuity. The tournament offers a form of seaside preparation immediately before the Open. Last month’s edition, though, bore witness to audible grumbles from golfers about the nature of that test. It is impossible to shake the feeling that Scotland has too many exceptional, true links courses for this competition to remain at its current home. Chief among them? Turnberry.</p> <p>There may be a necessary break to Renaissance’s run. The R&amp;A will give the Open an overdue return to Muirfield at some point, meaning it would be logistically impossible to stage the previous week’s Scottish equivalent at a course which is basically next door. A switch to the west coast would make perfect sense at that point. Any suggestion Turnberry would be banned from future Open duties by hosting the DP World Tour is undermined by the fact professionals and amateurs crash around St Andrews and Carnoustie every year at the Dunhill Links Championship. Turnberry could not only handle a Scottish Open but would be a celebrated venue.</p> <p>“We love Scotland,” Trump announced before boarding Air Force One on Tuesday. Get ready for a lot more of the same.</p>
