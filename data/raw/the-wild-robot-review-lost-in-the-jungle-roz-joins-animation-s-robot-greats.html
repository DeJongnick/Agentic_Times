<p>It’s a recurring theme in animation: the robot lost in hostile territory who finds that its best tool for survival is a soul. DreamWorks’ latest, a handsome adaptation of Peter Brown’s children’s book, directed by <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/18/the-croods-a-new-age-review-nicolas-cage-emma-stone-ryan-reynolds">The Croods</a></em> film-maker Chris Sanders, follows in the metal footsteps of pictures such as <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/05/wall-e-critics-poll">WALL-E</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/11/the-iron-giant-review-ted-hughes-adaptation">The Iron Giant</a></em> – by any measure two all-time animation greats. It’s a testament to the quality of this sharply written and richly detailed movie that it holds its own in such illustrious company.</p> <p><em>The Wild Robot</em> is a quality production throughout, but one of its key assets is Lupita Nyong’o’s superb voice work. As the robot Roz, who is stranded on a jungle island populated by wild animals, Nyong’o fully inhabits her character’s arc, from synthetic, Siri-style AI perkiness to the world-weary wounded quality that bleeds from every word at the end. It’s sentimental stuff, certainly, but the picture’s unexpectedly dark humour outweighs any maudlin tendencies.</p> <ul> <li><p>In UK and Irish cinemas</p></li> </ul>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znzE8yKHMiE"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/znzE8yKHMiE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znzE8yKHMiE">Watch a trailer for The Wild Robot.</a></figcaption> </figure>
