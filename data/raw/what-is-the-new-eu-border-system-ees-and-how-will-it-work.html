<p>Many travellers to Europe will see changes in border security from Sunday with the launch of the EU’s new digital entry and exit system (EES) after many delays.</p> <p>The system means most non-EU citizens will have to register their biometric information at the border. Travellers’ faces will have to be photographed and fingerprints scanned before they are allowed into Europe’s Schengen area. The system will eventually replace passports being stamped by border officials.</p>  <h2>What is EES?</h2>  <p>It is not a replacement for passport control. Travellers will still have to go through checks with border officials at ports. But eventually they will not have their passport stamped – instead, countries in the Schengen area will log travellers’ faces, fingerprints, and entry and exit dates.</p> <p>The system is being introduced to make border crossing faster and more efficient, while also tracking who is coming in and out. The EU says it will also give it information that will be used for security purposes.</p> <p>This is the start of a phased introduction of the system. It is scheduled to be fully in place by 10 April 2026.</p> <h2>Where does it apply and to whom?</h2>  <p>The EES applies to the Schengen area, which comprises 25 of the 27 EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. </p> <p>It includes countries where British people travel to frequently for holidays such as Spain, France, Portugal, Greece and Italy. </p> <p>The Republic of Ireland and Cyprus are not part of the Schengen area and so will continue to process passports as before. </p> <p>The EES applies to people who are not from an EU country or from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – although there are some exceptions such as people who have long-stay visas, among others.</p> <h2>How does it work?</h2>  <p>When someone arrives at the border for the first time after the EES is in place, they will use a self-service screen to register their name, passport details, fingerprints, and the date and place of entry and exit. The machine will photograph their face. Children under 12 will not have their fingerprints scanned.</p> <p>When people first come into contact with the EES depends on where they are travelling to and when. </p> <p>Coach and foot passengers going through the <a href="https://www.portofdover.com/press-releases/port-of-dover-is-ready-for-the-phased-introduction-of-eu-entry-exit-system/#:~:text=The%20new%20process%20at%20Dover,authorities%20before%20boarding%20their%20ferry.">port of Dover</a> will go through a new facility for EES processing from Sunday. From November, this will apply to all traffic. Coach passengers going <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/new-eu-border-checks-take-longer-wont-snarl-peak-travel-says-port-dover-2025-10-08/">through the Eurotunnel</a> will also go through the checks from Sunday.</p> <p>The process will be rolled out gradually over the coming months on Eurostar, which has installed registration terminals at its departure areas at St Pancras International in London. </p> <p>For other trips the process will happen when travellers get to the destination country. </p> <p>Airports are implementing the changes at different times. For example, Germany will phase in the service starting with a small airport in Stuttgart and then build up to operations in Frankfurt, one of the busiest aviation hubs in Europe.</p> <h2>Will I have to get to Dover earlier?</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/27/will-the-eu-new-fingerprint-entry-system-cause-gridlock-the-guardian-tried-it-out">There have been concerns</a> that the extra time it takes to process the EES data will lead to delays. However, the port of Dover has asked coach drivers not to arrive at the port any more than two hours before travel.</p> <p>Eurostar has said that the time it will take for the process can be squeezed into the current 75-minute window passengers are asked to spend at the station before departure.</p> <p>And the chief executive of Eurotunnel, Yann Leriche, has said the company is fully prepared and does not expect lengthy queues.</p> <p>Border officials have been told they have discretion to suspend EES if queues are building.</p> <h2>What will happen to the data that is collected?</h2>  <p>The data provided digitally through the EES will kept for three years, with some exceptions, after which it is erased. </p> <p>It can be used by border, visa and immigration authorities in the countries using the system as well as local police and Europol, the EU agency for law enforcement. </p> <p>The EU says that the information may be transferred to another country, outside Schengen, or an international organisation, such as a UN body, under “strict conditions”. </p> <p>If travellers cross the border again, within the three-year period, the process should be quicker as the face picture and fingerprints will already be on file. </p> <p>If a person refuses to provide a picture or have their fingerprints taken <a href="https://travel-europe.europa.eu/ees/data-held-by-ees#why-is-your-data-collected-in-ees">then they will be refused entry</a>, the EU says. </p>
