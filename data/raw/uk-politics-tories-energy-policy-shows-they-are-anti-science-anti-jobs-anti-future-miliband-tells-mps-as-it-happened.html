 <h2 class="block-title">Cooper taunts Philp by saying 5 years ago he said Tories hopeful of getting returns deal with France - but only Labour clinched it</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Cooper</strong> is responding to Philp. She says he wants to pretend that the last eight years never happened. The small boats crisis went on for 340 weeks, under the Tories. And she says Philp himself admitted that the Rwanda deportation policies never started. (He missed out the four volunteers who went, she says.)</p> 
  <p>She says, as chair of the home affairs committee, she asked Philp when he was immigration minister about the Tory plans to negotiate a returns agreement with France. Philp said he was optimistic, he says. She says he should have been optimistic for a Labour government – because in five years the Tories never got a deal, but Labour has got one now.</p>

  <p><strong>Chris Philp</strong>, the shadow home secretary, is responding to Cooper.</p> 
  <p>He says she used to talk about “smashing the gangs”. But she did not use the phrase today, he says. He claims that is because she knows this approach is not working.</p> 
  <p>He says the last 12 months have been the worst on record for small boat crossings. Cooper has lost control of the border.</p> 
  <p>He asks Cooper to say how many people will be affected by the returns policy. If it is only 50 per week, as people have reported, that will by only 6% of people arriving per week, he says.</p>

  <p>In the Commons <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, the home secretary, is now making a statement about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/10/starmer-one-in-one-out-deal-allow-uk-return-small-boat-migrants-france">returns deal</a> agreed with France at the summit last week.</p> 
  <p>She says in the space of just five years, the number of small boat crossings increased by more than 100 fold.</p> 
  <p>Summing up what was agreed, she starts by saying it will involve much stronger “upstream cooperation” with other countries.</p> 
  <p>She says action against criminal gangs has intensified.</p> 
  <p>The border is being strengthened, she says. She says 496 boat crossings this year have been prevented. But 385 boats have crossed, she says.</p> 
  <p>She says the French have reviewed their rules, which means they will now be able to intercept boats more effectively.</p> 
  <p>And the border security bill will make prosecuting people who crowd migrants onto boats more easy, she says.</p> 
  <p>She says the deal also means, for the first time, some people arriving on small boats can be sent back to France. And people in France will be able to apply for asylum in the UK. Returns and acceptances will match on a one to one basis, she says.</p> 
  <p>And she says the government will intensive the crackdown on people working illegally in the UK.</p> 
  <p>Already, we have increased illegal working raids and arrests by 50% since the election.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Already, we have more than tripled the value of employer penalties issued to over £89m and we’ve launched a new surge in enforcement linked to the gig economy with changes to the law in the borders bill to compel companies to conduct proper checks on the right to work.</p>

  <p>Back in the Commons, <strong>Sammy Wilson</strong> (DUP) claimed Ed Miliband was losing the argument with cabinet colleagues, who were losing faith in net zero policies.

  <p><strong>Miliband</strong> said he had been arguing with Wilson for this for about 20 years, and Wilson was wrong to dismiss this as scaremongering. He said people could see the impact of global warming with their own eyes.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Bethan McKernan is the Guardian’s Wales correspondent.</em></p> 
  <p>Work has begun on the new electric arc furnace at Tata Steel in Port Talbot after a £500m UK government grant which ministers say will secure 5,000 jobs in the steel-making south Wales town. <br><br>At a groundbreaking ceremony at the site on this afternoon, Labour also launched its steel strategy, which it says will deliver up to £2.5bn of investment to rebuild the steel industry nationwide. <br><br>Indian-owned Tata Steel’s last blast furnace was shut down in September 2024, putting almost 3,000 people out of work. Many in Wales felt Port Talbot had been let down after a UK government decision in April to to step in to save the Scunthorpe steelworks in Lincolnshire from a similar fate. Government ministers have repeatedly argued that the two plants were facing different futures. <br><br>The new £1.25bn furnace at Port Talbot will process scrap steel, rather than make virgin steel, and is expected to cut the site’s carbon emissions by 90%. It is due to come online by the end of 2027.<br><br>Wales’s first minister, Eluned Morgan, the Welsh secretary, Jo Stevens, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and Tata Group chair Natarajan Chandrasekaran were in attendance on Monday. <br><br><strong>Reynolds</strong> described the beginning of construction as “great news for Welsh steelmaking”, which would give “certainty to local communities and thousands of local jobs for years to come”.<br><br>The steelworkers’ union, <strong>Community</strong>, called the groundbreaking ceremony “bittersweet.” <br><br>The Guardian reported last month that Donald Trump had threatened to leave Port Talbot out of a tariff deal because Tata has been importing steel since closing down its blast furnaces. Stevens said on Monday that the UK government is still in talks with the US administration over the issue.</p>

Amy McDonnell, the group’s co-director, said:</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Andrew Bowie</strong>, a shadow energy minster, responded for the Conseratives – not Claire Coutinho, the shadow energy secretary.</p> 
  <p>He said it was “ridiculous” for Miliband to suggest in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/14/ed-miliband-net-zero-betraying-future-generations">his Guardian interview</a> that opponents of net zero were unpatriotic. He went on</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We need to bring back a sense of rationality, of proportion to this debate, because … language like this is alienating more and more people from the important cause of ensuring that the planet we pass on to our children.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Bowie suggested Miliband was not telling the truth about the impact of net zero policies.</p> 
  <p><strong>Lindsay Hoyle</strong>, the Speaker, intervened, to object, saying MPs should not accuse each other of being dishonest. <strong>Bowie</strong> withdrew that suggestion.</p> 
  <p>But he said it was “shameful” of Miliband to use the Met Office report as cover to attack the opposition.</p> 
  <p>Labour’s climate policies would make Britain poorer, he said.</p> 
  <p>In response, <strong>Miliband</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’re in a situation now where the shadow secretary of state goes into hiding when there’s a statement about the climate crisis, because it’s just too embarrassing to try and articulate the opposition’s position.</p> 
   <p>And look at the central chasm. At the heart of [Bowie’s] response is that he and his colleagues have taken the decision to abandon 20 years of bipartisanship when it comes to climate. </p> 
   <p>One of the great strides forward was Theresa May’s net zero by 2050 – now he’s trashing it and saying it was a disaster.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Miliband said Bowie was wrong to claim net zero policies would have a net cost. “All the evidence is delaying action costs more, not less,” he said.</p> 
  <p>He said it was not clear if the Tories have any net zero target at all now.</p> 
  <p>And he said Bowie was wrong to claim, as he did in a recent interview, that the net zero target was not based on science.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The point is net zero was a target that Theresa May adopted, driven by the science. </p> 
   <p>So what are they [the Conservatives]? They are anti-science. They are anti-jobs. They are anti-energy security, and they are anti-future generations. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said he agreed with May, who described opponents of her net zero policies when she was PM as “ideologues at the political extremes” or “populists who offer only easy answers to complex questions”.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Miliband</strong> said that the lesson of history was that people can do something about the climate crisis.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Before the Paris climate agreement was negotiated 10 years ago, the world was on course for four degrees centigrade of global warming. Now, national commitments imply 2.6 degrees of warming, or global warming below two degrees, if countries meet their full climate targets.</p> 
   <p>We remain way off track from where we need to be as a world, but we in this country have helped make a difference.</p> 
   <p>He said parties came together in 2008 to pass the first Climate Change Act,</p> 
   <p>And when the Tories, under Theresa May, legislated for net zero by 2050, Labour supported that, he said.</p> 
   <p>And he said when the UK hosted Cop under Boris Johnson, there was global agreement on a biodiversity framework.</p> 
   <p>The lesson is clear. The choices we make as a country have influenced the course of global action, and in doing so, reduced the impact of the climate and nature crisis on future generations in Britain.</p>

   <p>The impacts of extreme weather and nature loss aren’t simply a future threat to our country. They are already here and having impacts on our way of life. </p> 
   <p>We know heavy rainfall made last year’s harvest the second worst in at least four decades, costing farmers hundreds of millions of pounds.</p> 
   <p>More than half our best agricultural land, and over 6 million properties in England, are already at risk of flooding, according to the Environment Agency.</p> 
   <p>According to the UK Health Security Agency, there were more than 10,000 excess deaths, 10,000 people losing their lives, during English heat waves between 2020 and 2024.</p> 
   <p>And as we know recently, rising temperatures place pressures on every aspect of our national life. We have seen this again over the last few days, with incidents of wildfires from Surrey to Scotland, disruption due to trains overheating and hosepipe bans announced in Yorkshire, Kent and Sussex. </p> 
   <p>The climate crisis is also a massive threat to our economy. The OBR fiscal risks report published last week says the damage caused by climate impacts in a near three Celsius world is forecast to cut our GDP by 8% by the early 2070s, which will be roughly £200bn pounds based on current GDP.</p>

  <p><strong>Ed Miliband</strong> starts by saying the Met Office’s report has been published today. The government intends this to be an annual event, he says.</p> 
  <p>He says the last decade as seen the 10 hottest years on record globally.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Long-term global warming, assessed by a range of methods, is estimated to be 1.34 and 1.41 celsius above pre-industrial levels. And last year was the first time we saw an individual year above 1.5 degrees. </p> 
   <p>Today’s Met Office report shows that, in line with what is happening globally, the UK climate is getting hotter and wetter, with more extreme events. </p> 
   <p>The central England temperature series shows recent warmth has far exceeded any temperatures observed in at least 300 years. </p> 
   <p>Over the last 50 years, the number of days above 28 degrees centigrade have doubled, and above 30 degrees have trebled. </p> 
   <p>This spring was the UK’s warmest on record, beating the record broken last year.</p> 
   <p>Meanwhile, warming oceans and melting ice sheets have contributed to sea levels around the UK rising by 13.4 centimetres over the past three decades, and this is accelerating.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Ed Miliband, energy secretary, is about to make a statement to MPs about the state of the climate. He wants this to become an annual event.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>WWF</strong> environmental charity says this is a good idea. Its chief executive, Tanya Steele, says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The government is right to make an annual ‘state of climate and nature address’ to parliament and the public. The science is clear and is confirms what we are already experiencing: it’s getting hotter, and we need to do something now, not tomorrow. </p> 
   <p>MPs must act now for a healthier, fairer, safer, future. That’s why we’re calling for a new law – a Living Planet Act – to ensure that across everything the government does, it is acting to restore nature, tackle climate change, and provide a safe future for our children and grandchildren. </p> 
   <p>Nature can be our greatest ally in the fight against climate change, but only if we choose to protect and restore it.</p>

Peston explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The question is what Jones means by the “headline rate”. Does he just mean the 20% [rate of VAT] most of us are conscious of because it applies to so many items, or is he also referring to the 0% on food and the 5% on energy (there are also other lesser categories where the rates are 5% or nil)?</p> 
   <p>The point is that the chancellor could cut the main rate of VAT to, say 18%, and raise that kind of money by eliminating the vast categories of our spending that incur nil or 5% VAT.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Ed Miliband, energy secretary, will be making a statement to MPs soon after 3.30pm on the state of the climate report. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/14/latest-live-uk-politics-news-updates-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer?page=with%3Ablock-6874ca908f08755807c833d6#block-6874ca908f08755807c833d6">10.21am</a>.)</p> 
  <p>In a recent <strong>Bagehot</strong><a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/07/03/britain-is-already-a-hot-country-it-should-act-like-it"> column</a>, the Economist complained that Britian has been a bit useless at adjusting to the fact that the planet is getting warmer. As an example, it cited rules on heat pump subsidies. Bagehot said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If there is a conspiracy against air-conditioning in Britain, it goes right to the top. The government offers subsidies worth £7,500 to people replacing a gas boiler with an electric heat pump, but only if it produces solely heat. A system that can heat in winter <em>and</em> cool in summer receives nothing. Mercifully, Labour is considering extending the subsidies, yet that is not guaranteed to happen. A puritanical streak in British policymaking runs deep. Only the most banal conspiracies turn out to be true: the Deep State exists and it tries to keep you warm on summer nights.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But there was good news for the Economist at the No 10 lobby briefing this morning. Asked about this issue, the <strong>No 10 spokesperson</strong> hinted the rules will change. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Keeping homes cool in hot weather is just as important as heating them in the winter. That’s why we’ve consulted on including air to air heat pumps, which also cool air, under the boiler upgrade scheme. Our response to that will be published in due course.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>At the health committee, in response to a question from <strong>Alex McIntyre</strong> (Lab), <strong>Wes Streeting</strong>, the health secretary, says he is pleased that the BMA has agreed to a meeting this week to discuss how the resident doctors’ strike could be averted.</p> 
  <p>He says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I have to be clear with the committee, as I was with the House last week, that there is no more room for manoeuvre on pay, but there are lots of other things that we can do and should do that would lead to material improvements.</p>

  <p>He says, if the BMA goes ahead with the strike, that will be a “catastrophic mistake”.</p> 
  <p>He says he hopes he and the BMA can find a way of avoiding “the misery that will be inflicted” by the strike.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: What impact would it have on waiting lists?</em></p> 
  <p>Streeting says the government can mitigate against the impact of strikes. But it cannot stop them have consequences, he says.</p> 
  <p>He says appointments would be delayed. He says he has a relative waiting for an appointment, and he says they are “dreading what I fear is an inevitable phone call”.</p> 
  <p>He goes on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The other thing that I have found actually shockingly irresponsible about the BMA’s position is their leaders seem to be telling their members not to inform their trusts or their employers if they’re going out on strike.</p> 
   <p>Now, I might not agree with the BMA strike action, but I do accept they have a right to strike. I do accept they’ve followed the rules in order to go on strike.</p> 
   <p>What I cannot fathom is how any doctor in good conscience would make it harder for managers to make sure we have safe staffing levels, would make it harder for other staff who are going to be turning up to work that day, not least the staff who have not had a higher percentage pay rise, many of whom are paid less than resident doctors.</p> 
   <p>So I just think the sort of the BMA’s approach to this from start to finish has been completely wrong.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Downing Street has claimed that the “principles” that government how civil servants can engage with the media have not changed.</p> 
  <p>Asked to respond to the letter in the Times today from experts criticising the ways officials have been gagged from speaking at events where journalists are present (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/14/latest-live-uk-politics-news-updates-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer?page=with%3Ablock-6874e2378f08a97237f2e5ce#block-6874e2378f08a97237f2e5ce">12.09pm</a>), the <strong>No 10 spokesperson</strong> said he would not discuss “internal guidance”.</p> 
  <p>But he went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Civil service rules around media engagement are long standing. They’ve been set out previously in the civil servant management code and in the civil service code.</p> 
   <p>It’s always been the case that ministers are ultimately accountable for decisions to parliament, and to the public, and it’s obviously right that ministers primarily are scrutinised by the media and members [of parliament]. The guidance simply seeks to implement [that].</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked if he was saying nothing had changed, the spokesperson replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The principles around civil servants’ engagement with the media are unchanged …. Clearly it is the case that … senior officials do engage with stakeholders and members of the media, but always with in line with the civil service code.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The experts who have signed the Times letter say the new guidance does amount to a change in approach. They say:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Effective government relies on public servants, whose salaries are paid by the taxpayer, hearing directly from businesses, charities, academics and citizens to help them make better policy. They should be able to explain government activity to those same groups. Baroness Anderson of Stoke-on-Trent, speaking for the government about the guidance, recognised this when she said that there was a “a responsibility on our civil servants to engage every day”.</p> 
   <p>The unpublished guidance contradicts this, saying that “officials speaking at a sector-facing event with Q&amp;A and/or media expected to be in the audience … should not go ahead”. It is causing confusion and a chilling effect on public discussion. It should be withdrawn.</p>

  <p>Downing Street has played down hints that the government might freeze income tax thresholds in the autumn budget.</p> 
  <p><strong>Darren Jones</strong>, chief secretary to the Treasury, hinted as much in an interviews this moning when he suggested that the Labour manifesto commitment not to raise income tax only applied to the “headline” rate.

  <p>At the lobby briefing, asked if the reference to the “headline” rate meant the government was “moving the goalposts” in relation to its tax pledge, the <strong>PM’s spokersperson</strong> denied that and said Jones was just setting out the manifesto commitment. </p> 
  <p>But, when asked if the wording of the manifesto commitment would allow a government to freeze thresholds without the ‘no tax increases for working people’ pledge being broken, the spokesperson just said “you’ve got the manifesto language”. And he said Rachel Reeves, chancellor, and Jones have spoken about tax policy. But he would not “get ahead” of the budget, he said.</p> 
  <p>Asked if the government still stood by what Reeves said in the budget last year, when she said she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/09/pmqs-live-uk-politics-latest-updates-starmer-badenoch-macron-labour-conservatives?page=with%3Ablock-686e57928f082b1b94753f6a#block-686e57928f082b1b94753f6a">would not be extending the income tax threshold freeze</a>, the spokesperson replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You’ve got the chancellor’s language on that. It’s up to the chancellor to set out fiscal policy, as she did at the last budget.</p>

  </blockquote> 
  <p>When asked if he accepted that freezing thresholds would amount to a tax rise for working people, the spokesperson said reporters had “the chancellor’s language” and he did not have any changes to that. The government wanted to keep taxes down for working people, he said. But he said tax policy changes would be announced in the budget.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Proposed law creating mandatory duty to report child sex abuse could have 'little or no impact', MPs and peers say</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A new mandatory duty to report child sex abuse could end up having “little or no consequence”, parliamentarians have warned.</p> 
  <p>As PA Media reports, a mandatory duty to report child sexual abuse will be established by the crime and policing bill, which is currently making its way through the House of Lords.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/48758/documents/255740/default/">a report</a> published today, the <strong>joint committee on human rights</strong> says such a duty – which was one of the key recommendations to come from the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse (IICSA)– is welcome. It describes this as “an important step forward for protection of children’s human rights”.</p> 
  <p>But it also hightlights what it describes as two flaws with the version of the mandatory reporting duty set out in the bill.</p> 
  <p>First, it says that adults involved in looking after children would only have a duty to report chiild abuse if they witness a sex offence. They would not be obliged to report anything that created a reasonable suspicion that a child was being abused.</p> 
  <p>And, second, the bill does not make failure to comply a criminal offence. The government argued that doing this might “inadvertently create a chilling effect on those who wish to volunteer with children or enter certain professions”. Instead, anyone failing to report abuse would would risk being barred from working with children.</p> 
  <p>In its report, the committee says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are concerned that the scope of the duty and particularly the consequences of breach may not do enough to provide effective protection against child sexual abuse.</p> 
   <p>While concerns about making a failure to comply with the duty to report a criminal offence are understandable, the alternative proposed in the bill risks a failure to comply having little or no consequence. This could undermine the efficacy of the duty to report.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>David Alton, the peer and former Lib Dem MP who chair the committee, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/93/human-rights-joint-committee/news/208302/child-sexual-abuse-mandatory-reporting-duty-lacks-teeth-jchr-report-warns/">said</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Without repercussions for those who fail to do their duty and report these horrific crimes [this law] may prove ineffective. If it fails to deliver the necessary change, the government must review its impact and toughen its penalties.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a response, the <strong>Home Office</strong> said the mandatory reporting law was “a significant step in strengthening our child protection and safeguarding systems” and that, although failing to report abuse won’t be a criminal offence, obstructing someone else from reporting abuse will be a criminal offence, punishable by up to seven years in jail.</p> 
  <p>But committee report only backs up what campaigners have been saying about the legislation for some time.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mandate Now</strong>, a group campaigning for a mandatory reporting law, said in<a href="https://x.com/mandatenow/status/1944684272637407287"> a thread on social media </a>today that ministers know the law is “useless”.</p> 
  <p>And <strong>Richard Scorer</strong>, who as head of abuse law and public inquiries at lawyers Slater and Gordon represented many victims and survivors at IICSA, argued in <a href="https://thecritic.co.uk/the-law-is-failing-grooming-victims/">a recent article for the Critic </a>that the law will allow professionals to carry on turning a “blind eye” to abuse. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A core problem with the grooming gang cases is professionals having good grounds to suspect abuse is going on, but doing nothing. This proposal invites those very professionals to carry on exactly as before.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Treasury minister Darren Jones says ‘headline’ rate of income tax won’t go up, in hint thresholds might be frozen in budget</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning. This is the last full week the Commons is sitting before the summer recess starts (on Tuesday next week) and, although there is a fair amount coming up (see below), there is no big story dominating the news agenda. The national newspapers are all <a href="https://x.com/jacksurfleet">splashing on different items</a> – which is normally a sign that it was a slow news day yesterday.</p> 
  <p>The government wants to talk about its new £500m “better futures fund”.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> 
   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/13/rachel-reeves-to-announce-funding-youth-services-child-poverty">Rachel Reeves to announce £500m for investment in youth services projects</a> </p> 
  </aside> 
  <p>And <strong>Darren Jones</strong>, chief secretary to the Treasury, has been in the broadcast studios this morning to promote it – as well as giving <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/13/darren-jones-labour-treasury-chief-secretary-child-poverty-plan">an interview to my colleague Heather Stewart.</a></p> 
  <p>But, as is often the case, in search of stronger news, broadcasters have been trying to tease out details of what might be in the budget in the autumn. And they may have made a tiny bit of progress.</p> 
  <p>At PMQs last week Keir Starmer said that he remained committed to the tax pledges that Labour made in its manifesto. That might sound straightforward, but it isn’t, because there is some ambiguity as to what they mean.</p> 
  <p>People thought Labour promised not to raise income tax, VAT or national insurance contributions (NICs) – which are levied on employers and employees. But in the budget last year Rachel Reeves did put up employer NICs and, when accused of breaking a manifesto promise, she highlighted the eight-word preamble to the pledge, which in retrospect could be read as a hint that employer NICs were not exempt. The <strong>manifesto</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>Labour will not increase taxes on working people</strong>, which is why we will not increase National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of Income Tax, or VAT.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The person who wrote the manifesto clearly knew what was coming – but the clue was hidden so well that almost no one managed to decypher it.</p> 
  <p>In an interview on ITV’s Good Morning Britain <strong>Jones</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The thing I can tell you is that our manifesto commitment coming into this election was that we were not going to increase the headline rate of income tax or employee national insurance on working people in the pay slips that people get when they go to work or on VAT because we know that that disproportionately affects people on lower incomes because they spend more of their money on the day to day shop, essentially.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In fact, the manifesto does not mention the “headline” rate of income tax. But the fact that Jones sees this as relevant can be seen as yet another hint that Rachel Reeves is considering extending the freeze on income tax thresholds in the autumn. This is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/27/reeves-expected-to-freeze-income-tax-thresholds-to-raise-fresh-funds">seen by economists as very likely</a>, and was not ruled out by Starmer<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/09/pmqs-live-uk-politics-latest-updates-starmer-badenoch-macron-labour-conservatives?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-686e57928f082b1b94753f6a#block-686e57928f082b1b94753f6a"> at PMQs last week.</a></p> 
  <p><strong>Ed Balls</strong>, the former Labour shadow chancellor who is now a broadcaster and podcaster, regularly argues on his Political Currency podcast that freezing tax thresholds would in practice be a breach of the manifesto, because it would amount to a tax increase for working people. Jones’s comment can be seen as Treasury rebuttal to this allegation.</p> 
  <p>In his interviews <strong>Jones</strong> declined to rule out a wealth tax, as other ministers have done. But he also suggested that people were “getting a bit carried away” in interpreting what <strong>Heidi Alexander</strong>, the transport secretary, said about tax yesterday. Alexander told Sky News:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We made a commitment in our manifesto not to be putting up taxes on people on modest incomes, working people.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Telegraph has interpreted this as meaning that <a href="https://x.com/jacksurfleet/status/1944508199606026473">taxes will rise for middle-class workers.</a> But, in his Good Morning Britain interview, <strong>Jones</strong> said Alexander was just referring to the manifesto promise. Asked what “modest incomes” meant, he went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Modest income means different things to different people. But it’s not entirely relevant, because the thing that is relevant is our manifesto commitment not to increase national insurance or employee national or income tax in the payslips that people receive every month.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Jack Maidment</strong> from the Telegraph <a href="https://x.com/jrmaidment/status/1944650678095188173">argues</a> that the mixed messaging is a bit of a mess.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Treasury minister Darren Jones says Labour’s “working people” tax pledge refers to “anyone that gets a payslip, basically”.<br><br>Significantly broader than Transport Sec Heidi Alexander’s definition yesterday of “people on modest incomes”.<br><br>What a mess, and not for the first time.</p>

The Guardian has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/13/the-guardian-no-longer-post-on-x-twitter-elon-musk">given up posting from its official accounts on X</a>, but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary.</p> 
  <p>I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog.</p>
