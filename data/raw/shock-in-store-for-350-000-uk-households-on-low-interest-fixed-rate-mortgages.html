<p>More than 350,000 households who locked in to low-interest fixed-rate mortgages five years ago are expected to see their costs jump this winter as they reach the end of their deals.</p> <p>Analysis by the bill management app Nous found almost half of mortgages taken out between October 2020 – as the housing market <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/nov/30/uk-mortgage-covid-crisis-stamp-duty-cut-credit-card-debt">revived after an initial Covid shock</a> – and February 2023 were five-year fixed-rate deals.</p> <p>The length of the deals meant that those consumers avoided rolling off loans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/jul/11/uk-two-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-moneyfacts">when mortgage rates peaked two years ago</a>, but they still face a payment shock as they shop around for a new deal.</p> <p>Nous said the average rate on a five-year fixed-rate deal was 1.88% in 2020 and 5% now, meaning those on a typical £200,000 mortgage could see payments jump by £333 a month to £1,169 – an increase of £3,996 a year.</p> <p>Those with larger loans face bigger jumps: on a £500,000 home loan, the new rate would mean paying an extra £833 a month.</p> <p>Lenders have recently nudged up interest rates after months of cuts.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/08/uk-bank-sam-mortgages-barclays-bank-of-scotland">UK banks face lawsuits over mortgages that left people with huge debts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Greg Marsh, the chief executive of Nous, said: “Hundreds of thousands of homeowners are in for an unpleasant shock this winter. The era of ultra-cheap mortgages is over. For these households, it’s leaving them thousands of pounds a year worse off.”</p> <p>Marsh said the increases were coming at time when other household bills were going up. Water and council tax bills have increased this year, and in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/aug/27/higher-energy-bills-price-cap-rises">October energy prices are set to go up</a>.</p> <p>Last week, big lenders including Nationwide building society and Halifax increased the cost of some of their deals, and on Monday HSBC announced it would be doing the same.</p> <p>The increases have typically been small – Nationwide added 0.2 percentage points to some of its fixed rates – but they will be unwelcome for those currently shopping around for a new deal.</p> <p>Hina Bhudia, a partner at mortgage broker Knight Frank Finance, said that since the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/07/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-quarter-point-4">Bank of England cut the base rate to 4% in August</a>, economic data has been released that makes further cuts look less certain.</p> <p>While there had been forecasts of a November cut, the Bank is now not expected to reduce rates until next spring.</p> <p>She said: “That’s feeding through into mortgage pricing: what started as isolated increases from a handful of lenders has, over the past week, become a wider round of rate hikes.</p> <p>“These changes may only be a few tenths of a percentage point at a time, but they still translate into noticeably higher monthly payments for borrowers. Confidence was already fragile due to the looming budget, and this won’t help.”</p> <p>Bhudia said the increases could be short-lived, and anyone applying for a mortgage could watch rates and switch deals if prices fall before they complete on it.</p>
