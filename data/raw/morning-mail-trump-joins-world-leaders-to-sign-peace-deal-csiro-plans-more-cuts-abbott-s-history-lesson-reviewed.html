<p>Morning everyone. Donald Trump has flown from Israel to Egypt for a summit with more than 20 world leaders where they signed a peace agreement for a “new era” in the Middle East, following the release of all remaining hostages that Hamas had held in Gaza. We have reports and analysis coming up.</p> 
<p>At home the CSIRO is planning more cuts to cope with a decline in funding, sports professionals are meeting about how to protect international events from predatory gambling, and we assess Tony Abbott’s new book, a history of Australia.</p> 
<h2>Australia</h2>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>Former prime minister Paul Keating welcomed Jim Chalmers’ announcement of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/13/superannuation-tax-rules-albanese-treasurer-chalmers-labor-announces-surprise-backdown">watered-down plans</a> to tax super balances above $3m, and praised tweaks to the system as a “huge policy achievement”. But the government faces tougher battles if it wants to create a fairer Australia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/14/keating-praises-super-backdown-but-with-such-a-feeble-opposition-labor-should-spend-more-political-capital">writes Tom McIlroy</a>.

<h2>Not the news</h2> 
<p>Tony Abbott’s new book, Australia: A History is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/14/australia-history-tony-abbott-book-review">reviewed by Frank Bongiorno</a>, who warns that the former prime minister’s upbeat assessment of the convict era might give the impression that it was like a “holiday camp”. The book is a mostly celebratory account of a land “built by heroes”, and it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/oct/14/australia-history-tony-abbott-book-review">“very good in places”</a>. But Abbott also savages old enemies and concludes that we have to take more pride in our British heritage and drop climate and identity politics.</p>
