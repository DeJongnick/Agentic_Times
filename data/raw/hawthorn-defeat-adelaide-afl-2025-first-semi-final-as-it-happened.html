Walking off with the crowd going nuts and the Hawthorn faithful that travelled over. It’s awesome. Good vibe, I love it.</p> <p>We had the belief. We knew we had the talent. It’s a matter of putting it all together. Last year it’s good we were able to play some finals. We didn’t get the result we wanted at this ground about 12 months ago. It’s good experience and the boys have learnt a lot from it. It’s good to be back.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c411308f084b3c85a4d6b7" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-12T12:32:30.347Z">1.32pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Hawthorn is within one win of a place in the grand final</strong> while Adelaide are left to lick their wounds after becoming the first minor premiers to be bundled out in straight sets for 42 years. The Hawks booted the opening three goals within four minutes of the first bounce while Jai Newcombe set the tone with the first four centre clearances of the game. The Crows fought back to level terms through the first term but were largely outplayed from there.</p> <p>The evergreen Jack Gunston booted five goals, while Nick Watson lit a spark with a couple of early goals and Sam Butler added two to seal the win. Newcombe finished with 28 disposals and eight clearances as Josh Ward (31) and James Worpel (22) helped the Hawks win the onball battle. But it was their ball movement and efficiency in the forward half that will give the Hawks hope of testing the Cats in a preliminary final next Friday night.</p> <p>The Crows were out to respond to their disappointing showing against the Magpies in the qualifying final but are now the first minor premiers to be beaten by an eighth-place side in the finals. They lacked punch through the midfield and when running out of defence in both finals. And while they might take positives from reaching the top eight for the first time since 2017, the Crows season has petered out in the worst possible way without even winning a quarter across two games in September.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-12T12:51:43.197Z">at 1.51pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68c40e968f084b3c85a4d6a4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-12T12:19:22.226Z">1.19pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Full-time: Adelaide 10.7.67 lose to Hawthorn 14.17.101</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Hawthorn are through to a preliminary final against Geelong after a commanding 34-point victory over Adelaide.

The winner of this clash will meet Geelong in a preliminary final at the MCG next Friday night. No small task. But you gotta be in it, to win it.</p> <p>Adelaide need to bounce back from a disappointing return to finals after an eight-year absence but as minor premiers have the luxury of taking their second shot back on their home deck. The pressure has quickly mounted on the Crows as they seek to avoid a straight-sets finals exit as well as a couple of unwanted slices of history. They will not want to become the first team in the AFL-era to finish on top of the ladder then be bundled out in two finals, or to be the first minor premiers to lose to an eighth-place side in a final. </p> <p>Hawthorn would be undermined by too much focus on their eighth-place finish, especially as they were playing off for a top-four spot in the last round of the home and away season. They then showed how narrow the margins are between the top sides this year, when they were too good for GWS Giants last week. The Hawks have the benefit of being to this same stage before as they played a semi-final at Adelaide Oval last year. That was against the Power, rather than the Crows, and ended in chaos as a James Sicily shot at goal at the death crashed into the post and sparked wild scenes after the siren that temporarily overshadowed the gut-wrenching defeat. But it should give the Hawks a hint of motivation that it is a scenario they will not want to repeat. </p> <p><strong>First bounce will be at 7.10pm local time in Adelaide / 7.40pm AEST</strong>. I’ll drop in the team news shortly.
