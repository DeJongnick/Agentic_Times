<p>The run-up to this year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars-2024">Oscars</a> has been smoother than in recent years: no major turmoil to report other than the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/jan/31/margot-robbie-oscar-snub-response-barbie-nominations">“snub” for Barbie</a> – 2023’s biggest hit arrives with eight nominations, bu<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/greta-gerwig">t Greta Gerwig</a> was passed over entirely in the directing category. Well, this is a democracy, and the votes don’t just go with money. (No one is getting in a huff about The Super Mario Bros Movie, last year’s number two, not coming to the big show.)</p> <p>The Oscars are fully aware that the bigger the movies they reward, the better the audience figures are for the TV broadcast (their main money-spinner), so they plan to rinse Barbie for everything they can. They will be giving 65 Kens to frug alongside <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/ryan-gosling">Ryan Gosling</a> as he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/feb/27/ryan-gosling-sing-ken-oscars-barbie">warbles I’m Just Ken</a> (nominated for best song), while Billie Eilish (also nominated, a much more likely winner) will sing her hit song What Was I Made For?</p> <p>Another element of Oscar “news” is the nudge to the start time: the ceremony is getting underway an hour earlier and is aiming for a snappy three and a half hour running time. Host <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> – the universally acknowledged safe pair of hands – will have to do a lot of shooing, but unless they give the playoff orchestra leader an electric cattle prod, the chances of keeping things that trim are slim to bupkis.</p> <p>What not many people are talking about, though, is the likelihood of significant political protest, given the activity at the Grammys, the Independent Spirit awards and elsewhere. Security around the venue has been “beefed up”, but the Oscars have said they won’t interfere with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/mar/03/the-slap-protests-and-tears-what-makes-a-memorable-oscar-speech">winners’ speeches</a> – though, unless Mark Ruffalo manages to get past Robert Downey Jr for best supporting actor, it’s hard to see where an incendiary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAcOsK9gRLk&amp;ab_channel=Oscars">Vanessa Redgrave-type speech</a> is going to come from. James Wilson, producer of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/feb/04/the-zone-of-interest-jonathan-glazer-brutal-auschwitz-drama-sandra-huller-christian-friedel-martin-amis">The Zone of Interest</a>, has a bit of form in the area though.</p> <h2>How to watch</h2> <p><strong>In the US</strong>: The E! channel gets things under way with Brunch at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars">Oscars</a> at 12:00 PT/15:00 ET, then moves to Live from the Red Carpet show at 14:00 PT/17:00 ET. ABC starts its coverage with The Oscars Red Carpet Show at 15:30 PT/18:30 ET, before the ceremony begins at 16:00 PT/19:00 ET. It is due to finish at 19:30 PT/22:30 ET.</p> <p><strong>In the UK</strong>: ITV has nabbed the rights this year, with its streaming platform ITVX starting up at 21:30 GMT and its broadcast channel ITV1 stepping in with Oscars Live at 22:15 GMT.</p> <p><strong>In Australia</strong>: 7Bravo is carrying E!’s red carpet coverage from 08:00 AEDT.
