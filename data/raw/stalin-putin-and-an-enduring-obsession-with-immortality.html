<p>Like Vladimir Putin, Joseph Stalin was interested in immortality (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/28/how-the-rich-and-powerful-plan-to-live-for-ever">‘To them, ageing is a technical problem that can, and will, be fixed’: how the rich and powerful plan to live for ever, 28 September</a>). In 1939 he read Prolonging Life, a pamphlet promising a lifespan of 150 years, by Aleksandr Bogomolets, a haematologist famous for his rapid-healing serums and blood transfusion methods.</p> <p>Bogomolets promised to prolong life with cytotoxic proteins, herbs and transfusions of young blood. Stalin made him a Hero of Socialist Labour and gave him generous research funding, but was dismayed when he died aged 64 in 1946 (this was hardly Bogomolets’s fault – as a boy in Tsarist times, he visited his mother, a revolutionary serving a sentence of hard labour in a Siberian prison, and caught tuberculosis).<br><strong>Donald Rayfield</strong><br><em>Emeritus professor</em><em>, Queen Mary University of London</em></p> <p>• Aleks Krotoski says dictators and US techno-billionaires are striving for immortality. They should read After Many a Summer by Aldous Huxley, a novel about a Hollywood millionaire who tries to achieve immortality, but regresses to an ape‑like creature in the process.</p> <p>The book is partly seen as reflecting science showing that embryo development takes a foetus through stages resembling a worm, a fish, a tailed rodent-like creature etc. Hence returning an adult human body to a younger stage might reverse this evolutionary process. But the book has also been seen as reflecting the narcissistic obsession with eternal youth in the US that Huxley had moved to.</p> <p>So has anything changed in the intervening century? Certainly not the obsession, which if anything has become stronger. Perhaps Vladimir Putin is already undergoing transfusions with “rejuvenating” blood, sucking, vampire-like, the blood of young Russians? <br><strong>Joseph Ulanowski</strong><br><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
