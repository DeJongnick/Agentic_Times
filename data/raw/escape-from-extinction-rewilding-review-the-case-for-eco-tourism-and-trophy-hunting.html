<p>In 2020, producer-director Matthew Brady, in collaboration with the animal welfare charity American Humane, made a well-meaning but oddly hectoring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/sep/15/escape-from-extinction-review-eco-plea-bordering-on-pro-zoo-propaganda">documentary called Escape from Extinction</a>, narrated by Helen Mirren, which took the pragmatic view that zoos were vital in preserving animal species in danger of dying out. The larger causes of environmental calamity were evidently beyond its remit. But now we have a bland and anodyne sequel narrated by Meryl Streep, which says that rewilding is vital for preserving and reviving endangered species.</p> <p>But by “rewilding” the film basically means, in the first instance, investing in national parks as semi-managed habitats – so in effect, very big zoos. In its opening section, the film actually questions whether there is anywhere purely “wild” on Earth any more. Like an educational video to be shown to parties of schoolchildren, the film gives us brightly feelgood upbeat examples of conservationists working in tandem with politicians, businesses and communities, to rescue various species in the ocean or on land.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB2nS5tShOY"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rB2nS5tShOY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Of course there is nothing wrong with this. But every so often, the film insists that the point of these victories is that they are sustained economically through improved eco-tourism. Even the horrible business of “trophy hunting” or “canned hunting” – defenceless lions and tigers shot by wealthy hunters – is given a free pass by this film on the grounds that it brings in money which can be invested in conservation. But what about eco-rescues which aren’t economically viable in this way? What, moreover, about the miners and the loggers and the drill-baby-drill fossil fuel enthusiasts who are causing problems? This film mentions them in passing but doesn’t come anywhere near addressing their activities. It’s a frustrating and naive experience.</p> <p>• Escape from Extinction: Rewilding is in UK cinemas from 22 April.</p>
