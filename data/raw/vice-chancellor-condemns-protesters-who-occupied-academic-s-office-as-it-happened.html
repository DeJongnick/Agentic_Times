And I just wanted to steal a tiny bit of space to thank each and every one of you for the past six years. It has been the honour of my professional life to helm this blog and serve you, our audience. You have been front of mind in everything we do and I hope you know how much we appreciate you.</p> <p>There would be too many people to thank, but I also hope you know that the Politics Live project is more than just one person. It works because of the passion of the entire Guardian Australia team. From the editors to the subs, the production staff, the moderators and the journalists around the country – there are a lot of people who never get thanked for the long tireless hours they put in to make sure you are as up to date as possible and that you get the context and facts you need to help you make your own decisions about the world you live in. I am indebted to them beyond measure.</p> <p>The Guardian Canberra team of <strong>Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Daniel Hurst, Sarah Basford Canales</strong> and <strong>Josh Butler</strong> are some of the greatest humans you will ever encounter. They take their journalism seriously, but more than that, they take you seriously. I am a better journalist and person for having being able to learn from them.</p> <p><strong>Gareth Hutchens, Sarah Martin, Gabby Chan </strong>and<strong> Katharine Murphy </strong>all know the mark they have left. It truly says something about the culture of the bureau that the staff turnover has been so small.</p> <p><strong>Lenore Taylor</strong> is not only a fearless leader, she is also one of the fiercest in terms of standing behind her team. She sets the standard we all try to follow.</p> <p>And of course, the heart and soul of the blog – and the team – photographer <strong>Mike Bowers</strong>. I don’t think people realise just how much he contributes to what we all do. He is not only a legend, he also has the biggest heart in the building. We would all be lost without him.</p> <p>But truly, my final thanks and gratitude, as ever, goes to you, our readers. You are the reason for everything we do. Your compassion, thought provoking comments and messages, disagreements and passion help drive us. You are at the heart of Guardian Australia and we do not take you from granted.</p> <p>For the final time from me, please, take care of yourself and those around you. The world can be a tough place at times, but in my experience, you usually find more people to stand with you than you know. Firm, fair and kind can usually guide you through most of life’s tricky spots. Add in some humour and empathy and you’ve got a winning combination for anything.</p> <p>Make sure you keep tuning in.

continent”.</p> <p>If you went to the ARC decision page and actually looked at the research grants, you found: “Australia is often defined as an isolated island-continent, ‘girt by sea’. <strong>This project aims to challenge this protectionist myth by analysing literary and historical connections between different geographical sites that have been represented as enclosed in Australian history.”</strong></p> <p>“It expects to offer new interpretations of interconnected narratives of Aboriginal Australian, South Sea Islander and migrant enclosure in Australian literature.</p> <p>“The project will provide significant benefits, a more inclusive and situated understanding of Australia’s connections to the Pacific region, the intersections between colonisation, enslavement, and border protection, and Aboriginal, South Sea Islander, and migrant literatures.”</p> <p>Well, he is asking about it again.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time
