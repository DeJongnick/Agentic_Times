affairs reporter for the Guardian</em></p> <p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> first announced he would host a “Russia-Arab world” summit, the Kremlin imagined the region’s leaders flying to Moscow to discuss regional security and energy relations, with the Russian leader presiding.</p> <p>Announced in April and prepared for months, the summit had been scheduled for Wednesday, intended as a showcase of Moscow’s enduring influence in the Middle East and proof it remains far from isolated despite western sanctions.</p> <p>But Putin was forced to shelve the gathering after only a handful of leaders, including Syria’s president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, and the head of the Arab League, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, confirmed their attendance.</p> <p>Instead, on Monday, global attention turned to Egypt, where world leaders gathered for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/donald-trump-egypt-peace-summit-abdel-fattah-al-sisi">Gaza “peace

play a major role in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> peace process, its absence in Egypt underscored a reality the Kremlin is reluctant to admit: as the war in Ukraine grinds on, its influence in the Middle East – long touted as a counterweight to that of the west – is waning.</p> <p>You can read the full piece by Pjotr Sauer here: <strong><a

adequate response for far too long.</em></p> <p><em>All effective decisions will be made.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>The move comes after Zelenskyy on Tuesday revoked the citizenship of Odesa’s mayor on the grounds that he also had a Russian passport, acting to end the tenure of a divisive figure who has run the Black Sea port city for 11 years.</p> <p><strong>Hennadiy Trukhanov,</strong> 60, an elected official, said he would take his case to court, denying having a Russian passport and insisting that he remained mayor.
