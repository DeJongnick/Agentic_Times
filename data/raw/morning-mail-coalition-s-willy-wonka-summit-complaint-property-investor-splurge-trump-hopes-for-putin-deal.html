<p>Morning everyone. Jim Chalmers has given us the big buildup for his economic summit next week but the Coalition is now comparing him to Willy Wonka<strong> </strong>giving away golden tickets for a “privileged talk-fest” (with economic reform, presumably, as the chocolate).</p> 
<p>Back in the real economy, new figures show property investors are borrowing more than ever and edging first-time buyers out of contention. Donald Trump thinks Vladimir Putin is ready to make a deal in Alaska, while the AFLW season is up and running with a win for Carlton over Collingwood.</p>
