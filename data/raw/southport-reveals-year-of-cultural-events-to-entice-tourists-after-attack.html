<p>Southport has unveiled an “elegantly eccentric” year-long cultural programme as it seeks to lure back tourists after the fatal attack on young girls last summer.</p> <p>The Merseyside town will transform into an “open air ballroom” as part of an outdoor spectacular by the acclaimed French street theatre company Transe Express in the spring.</p> <p>Other events include a specially designed immersive light and sound installation in February, a big top circus festival in May, the British Musical Fireworks Championship, and a literary festival in October.</p> <p>The year-round extravaganza has been planned to draw back visitors and boost the town’s economy after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/nov/05/southport-inquiry-killers-father-sorry-for-failing-to-deal-with-sons-violent-behaviour">murder of three young girls</a> at a Taylor Swift dance workshop on 29 July 2024.</p> <p>Marion Atkinson, the Labour leader of Sefton council, said those affected by the attack wanted to ensure that Southport – a town heavily reliant on summer tourism – did not suffer as a result.</p> <p>“There’s always going to be a memory of what happened but we can’t let this define us,” she said earlier this year.</p> <p>The Southport 2026: Elegantly Eccentric programme is being launched alongside a modern recreation of the 1936 painting Southport for a Holiday in Wintertime by Fortunino Matania featuring local business owners.</p> <p>Patrick Hurley, the Southport MP, said: “Across the north of England, Southport has always stood out for its refined charm and character. The Elegantly Eccentric vision captures that spirit perfectly, and updates it for the 2020s.</p> <p>“Having had a downturn in the last couple of decades, Southport is now resolutely on the up again. The cultural vision for 2026 and beyond will be about celebrating creativity, promise, and the pride we all share in our town’s unique identity.</p> <p>“I’m proud to support Southport 2026 and the people who are making this bold, beautiful idea a reality and I’m determined to ensure that Southport’s brightest days lie ahead of it.”</p> <p>Formore than two centuries, Southport has entertained visitors as varied as Napoleon III, Judy Garland and regular day-trippers. Victorians enjoyed camel races on the beach and elephants parading down the town’s main drag, Lord Street, and street entertainers diving from the now-closed pier.</p> <p>Claire McColgan CBE, the associate director of culture for Liverpool city region, said next year’s cultural programme would be rooted in the “rich history” of the town”. “It was an epicentre for entertainment and fun for generations and now we want visitors from near and far to come and rediscover what this jewel on the coast has to offer,” she said.</p> <p>The events will begin in February with an immersive light and sound installation from international artists Lucid Creates that will “turn the town into a walk-through rainbow of colour and creativity,” according to Sefton council.</p> <p>In April, Transe Express will launch its open-air spectacular, Cristal Palace, with a 15-metre-wide flying chandelier, live music, aerial performance and dance.</p> <p>The following month will see the town host circus acts, including Circa and Gandini Juggling,before a summer of food and drink festivals, flower shows, air displays and the British Musical Fireworks Championship.</p> <p>Then in October the programme will turn to reading with a “reimagined literature festival” for families and young readers. Southport will be filled with storytelling installations, live performances and author-led workshops for the half-term holidays.</p>
