<p>A former Illinois state senator running for governor in 2026 is mourning the deaths of four family members killed when their helicopter crashed in Montana on Wednesday.</p> <p>Darren Bailey’s son Zachary, daughter-in-law Kelsey, and grandchildren Vada Rose, 12, and Samuel, seven, all perished in the incident, according to an announcement from his campaign on Thursday. The couple is survived by their 10-year-old son Finn, who was not on the aircraft.</p> <p>“On Wednesday evening, Darren and his wife, Cindy, received the heartbreaking news no parent ever wants to hear,” the campaign statement said. “Their son, Zachary, his wife, Kelsey, and their two young children, Vada Rose, age 12, and Samuel, age 7, tragically lost their lives in a helicopter accident in Montana.”</p> <p>The statement, <a href="https://x.com/DarrenBaileyIL/status/1981244713899315256">posted to X</a>, added that “Darren and Cindy are heartbroken by this unimaginable loss” and said the couple were “finding comfort in their faith, their family, and the prayers of so many who love and care for them”.</p> <p>The Baileys thanked supporters for their kindness and requested privacy “as they grieve and hold their loved ones close during this difficult time”.</p> <p>Authorities have not yet released information about what caused the helicopter to crash or where in Montana the incident took place. The type of helicopter involved has also not been disclosed.</p> <p>Bailey, 59, is mounting his second campaign for Illinois governor, having been defeated by the Democratic incumbent, JB Pritzker, in the 2022 race in one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/26/us/politics/illinois-governor-bailey-irvin-pritzker.html">most expensive</a> non-presidential races in American history. He secured the Republican nomination that year but lost by a wide margin in the general election.</p> <p>The southern Illinois politician was previously an elected state senator and earlier was a lawmaker in the state’s House of Representatives.</p> <p>He is again seeking the Republican nomination for the 2026 gubernatorial election on a conservative line, and is staunchly opposed to abortion, strongly supports gun rights and law enforcement, and is critical of criminal justice reforms, in what would be his second attempt to challenge for the state’s top office.</p>
