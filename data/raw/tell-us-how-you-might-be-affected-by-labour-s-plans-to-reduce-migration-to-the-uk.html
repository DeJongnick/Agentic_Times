<p>The government published its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/12/whats-in-uk-immigration-white-paper-visa-rules-deportations-fees">immigration white paper</a> on Monday which aims to reduce the number of people arriving in the UK “significantly” by introducing restriction across all forms of visas.</p> <p>Changes include skilled work visa applicants requiring degree-level qualifications rather than those that are roughly equivalent to A-levels. Social care visas specifically will be affected as the government promises to end all overseas recruitment for social care work – though there will be a “transition period” until 2028.</p> <p>Language requirements are to become more strict, with all adult dependants who come with arriving workers or students needing to show at least basic English skills, and to show progression over time. People will also have to wait at least 10 years to see settlement, rather than the current five.</p> <p>We’d like to know how you or your business might be affected by Labour’s plans. What effect might it have? Do you have concerns?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="491953e6-d199-49a7-a5e6-5c5ce13f1cdb" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>
