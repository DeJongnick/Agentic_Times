<p>Afternoon. Peter Dutton has outlined <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jun/19/coalition-nuclear-plan-peter-dutton-power-station-sites-australia">the Coalition’s nuclear policy</a> without disclosing its cost. The federal opposition is proposing to build seven nuclear power plants and two small modular reactors, mostly in Coalition-held electorates.</p>    <p>The plan has been panned as more expensive than firming up renewable energy and guaranteed to increase emissions due to increased reliance on fossil fuels until nuclear power is ready, which the Coalition claims could be as soon as 2035 in contrast to expert advice.</p> <h2>Top news</h2>    <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Justin Stein found guilty of murdering schoolgirl Charlise Mutten | </strong></em>Stein murdered his partner’s nine-year-old daughter before dumping her body in a barrel by a river and trying to pin the killing on Charlise’s mother, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/19/charlise-mutten-murder-trial-verdict-justin-kallista-ntwnfb">a jury has found</a>.
