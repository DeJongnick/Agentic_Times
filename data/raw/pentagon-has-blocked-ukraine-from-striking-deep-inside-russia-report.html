<p>US defense officials have blocked Ukraine from using US-supplied long-range missiles to strike targets inside Russia since late spring as part of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> effort to get <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> to engage in peace talks , according to a report on Saturday.</p> 
<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-has-quietly-blocked-ukraines-long-range-missile-strikes-on-russia-432a12e1?st=oRhn7y">reports</a> that the Pentagon has blocked Ukraine from using US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems, or Atacms.</p> 
<p>Two US officials told the outlet that on at least one occasion, Ukraine had sought to use Atacms against a target but was denied under a “review mechanism” developed by Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon’s undersecretary for policy, that governs how US long-range weapons or those provided by European allies that rely on American intelligence and components can be used.</p> 
<p>The review process also applies to Britain’s Storm Shadow cruise missile because it depends on US targeting data, according to two US officials and a British official, the Journal said.</p> 
<p>The review system reportedly gives the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, approval over the use of the Atacms, which have a range of nearly 190 miles (305km). Ukraine was previously given authority by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration">Biden administration</a> to use the missile system against targets inside Russia in November after North Korean troops entered the war.</p> 
<p>Before the inauguration in January, Trump <a href="https://time.com/7201565/person-of-the-year-2024-donald-trump-transcript/">told Time magazine</a> that the decision to allow Ukraine to use US weapons systems to attack targets inside Russia had been a mistake.</p> 
<p>“I disagree very vehemently with sending missiles hundreds of miles into Russia. Why are we doing that? We’re just escalating this war and making it worse. That should not have been allowed to be done,” he said.</p> 
<p>It is unclear whether the US defense department’s review process amounts to a formal policy change. But it comes alongside increasing control of munitions to Ukraine as US stocks are themselves depleted.</p>

<p>In a statement to the Journal, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Trump “has been very clear that the war in Ukraine needs to end. There has been no change in military posture in Russia-Ukraine at this time.”</p> 
<p>But last week, amid efforts to broker talks between the Russian president and Voldomyr Zelenskyy, Trump said that Ukraine could not defeat Russia unless it could “play offense” in the war.</p> 
<p>“It is very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invader’s country,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115067017601499775">Trump wrote</a> on Thursday. “It’s like a great team in sports that has a fantastic defense, but is not allowed to play offense. There is no chance of winning.”</p> 
<p>Last month, the US agreed to supply Ukraine with new weapons systems but only if European nations paid for them. While Trump has said that the US is “not looking” to provide longer-range weapons that could reach Moscow, US officials told the Journal that the administration had approved the sale of 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munition air-launched missiles, or Erams, which have a range of 280 miles (400km).</p>
