<p>New Zealand plans to start charging international tourists fees to enter its famous natural sites and will make it easier for businesses to operate on conservation land as part of a controversial proposal to “unleash” growth on ecologically and culturally protected areas.</p> <p>The government plans to start charging foreign visitors NZ$20-40 ($12-24) per person to access some sites. Initially, those would probably include Cathedral Cove/Te Whanganui-a-Hei, Tongariro Crossing, Milford Sound and Aoraki Mount Cook. The fees are likely to be imposed from 2027.</p> <p>The conservation minister, Tama Potaka, said those fees could generate NZ$62m a year “so we can keep investing in the sites that underpin so much of our tourism sector”.</p> <p>The government’s announcements form part of a wider shake-up of conservation law that will also make selling or exchanging conservation land easier and allow more activities to go ahead on conservation without needing a permit. </p> <p>“In the spirit of saying yes to more jobs, more growth and higher wages”, the government would “unleash a fresh wave of concessions” including in tourism, agriculture and infrastructure at some locations, the prime minister, Christopher Luxon, said on Saturday.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/27/fast-track-to-where-the-new-law-opening-up-new-zealand-to-a-mining-boom">Fast-track to where?

It covers areas with biodiversity, historic or cultural value.</p> <p>Some businesses such as ski fields and grazing already operated on conservation land but many other businesses struggled to gain the same permission, Luxon said.</p> <p>It is the latest policy that seeks to loosen regulation on natural sites and species to enable economic growth. In 2024, the government passed a law that could see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/27/fast-track-to-where-the-new-law-opening-up-new-zealand-to-a-mining-boom">contentious mining </a>and infrastructure projects fast-tracked for approval. It has also proposed a law change to make it easier for companies to kill protected wildlife in order to pursue certain infrastructure projects. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/30/rightwing-nz-government-accused-of-war-on-nature-as-it-takes-axe-to-climate-policies">Conservation and climate initiatives</a> have also faced budget cuts.</p> <p>But critics say the changes risk harming the environment and vulnerable species. New Zealand has high rates of endemic biodiversity but some species are in worrying decline, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/08/new-zealand-our-environment-2025-report-native-species-face-extinction-threat">a high proportion threatened or at risk of extinction</a>.</p> <p>Green party co-leader Chlöe Swarbrick said Luxon was putting profit above the protection of nature.</p> <p>“That tells us everything we need to know about who he thinks he works for. It’s not regular people, future generations or a healthy environment,” she said in a statement to the Guardian.</p> <p>Nicola Toki, the chief executive of New Zealand’s largest conservation organisation, Forest &amp; Bird, said the latest reforms “represent the most significant weakening of conservation law in a generation” and would increase pressure on vulnerable species.</p> <p>“They shift the focus from protection to exploitation, dismantling the very purpose of our national parks and conservation lands.”</p> <p>• This story was amended on 5 August 2025 to reflect new information provided by the government that fees will apply to Milford Sound, not Milford Track.</p>
