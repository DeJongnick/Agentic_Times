  <p>Some of the other key lines from his speech so far were on Europe “being relegated to the periphery of the global competition,” and his warning to people about “falling into the temptation of delusion,” while raging against “rampant nationalism and neonazism” in Ukraine and “globalist expansionist” policy of the west.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">EU's chief prosecutor warns Greek constitution impedes fight against corruption</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Athens</em></p> 
  <p>Over in Greece, <strong>the European Union’s chief prosecutor, Laura Kovesi, has had some choice words today for the resistance the country has shown in battling corruption.</strong></p> 
  <p>Addressing the media towards the end of a much-anticipated trip to Athens, <strong>Kovesi insisted that while “there is corruption everywhere” any inquiry into it in the Mediterranean nation was obstructed by the Greek constitution.</strong></p> 
  <p>She <strong>cited Article 86 and the immunity it offered in protecting “serving or former members of the cabinet” from prosecution as being a key impediment to headway being made</strong> in exposing the scourge. </p> 
  <p>“The only solution is to change it,” the Romanian-born official told reporters. “There is corruption everywhere. <strong>The question is how we confront it, not whether we hide it under the carpet.</strong>”</p> 
  <p>Kovesi, who heads the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) based in Luxembourg, referred to Article 86 particularly obstructing investigations into how millions of euro in “European funds that should have supported honest farmers …. and not gone into villas and expensive cars” ended up being allegedly stolen in a massive fraud case that has shaken the centre-right government.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mismanagement of funds had</strong>, she added, <strong>literally left people dead in the case of the head-on collision of a passenger and freight train in Greece’s vale of Tempe</strong> in 2023 but, again, any inquiry into the tragedy had been stymied by the constitution.</p> 
  <p>‘The bad news, as in the Tempe case, is that <strong>the investigation could not go as far as it should have because of the constitution,</strong>” said Kovesi who has blamed the failure of Greek authorities to install a state-of-the art signalling system on the rail network as playing a major role in the crash. </p> 
  <p>More than 40 million euro had been earmarked for the project known as Contract 717. “The good news is that parliament can amend Article 86,” she said.</p>

  <p>Putin is now <strong>talking about the failure of all sanctions against Russia,</strong> claiming the country “has demonstrated the highest degree of resilience and ability to withstand intensive global pressure.”</p>

  <p>So far, <strong>Putin attacks western countries for not being “ready to rid themselves of the captivity of geopolitical and historical stereotypes,”</strong> as he says Russia repeatedly wanted to engage with the west in 1990s and 2000s and was twice blocked from joining Nato.</p> 
  <p>He also <strong>talks about the rise of “multipolarity,” which he says is a rejection of “attempts to impose and maintain the global hegemony” by the west.</strong></p> 
  <p>Unsurprisingly, Russia is not to be blamed for anything in his view.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Russia says it's locked in 'fiery' conflict with the West, rejects comparisons to cold war</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Meanwhile over in Moscow, <strong>Russia said that there was no cold war with the West because it was now a “fiery” conflict</strong>, and that the European Union and the Nato military alliance were lying about alleged Moscow’s sabotage operations to justify vast military spending, Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p>“<strong>I would disagree with the comparison with the cold war,</strong>” Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman <strong>Maria Zakharova</strong> told reporters when asked if there was now a new cold war with an “iron curtain“-like drone wall being built in Europe.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We are already in another form of conflict. <strong>There has been no cold here for a long time; there is already fire here.</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Zakharova, when asked about European accusations that Russia has intruded into Nato airspace, carried out sabotage operations and hacked key installations, said that <strong>the unfounded accusations showed that the EU and Nato were preparing “provocations” against Moscow.</strong></p> 
  <p>“All their statements indicate – first, that they are preparing a chain of provocations. Second, that they need to justify their military budgets,” Zakharova claimed without offering any evidence to back her comments.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Hungary's Orbán says talks showed 'confrontation' of ideas on Russia; rules out Hungary's involvement in use of frozen Russian assets</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hungary’s <strong>Viktor Orbán </strong>has just briefered the journalists after the summit.</p> 
  <p>Ever the entertainer on the doorstep, <strong>Orbán said the meeting was “interesting; even more, it was exciting,” as it “had some intellectual content,” which he rushed to add “it’s not always the case.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He said the leaders particularly clashed on their idea of dealing with Russia. Asked if he managed to convince them of his arguments, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Not really, … they are convinced that they are right. … They have a war plan. <strong>They have a plan how to beat the Russians.</strong> Many of these countries were never occupied by the Russians, so they don’t have physical personal experience [of] what does it mean to have a war with Russia. …</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>We know what is at the stake, but those guys who were never under the supervision of the Russians has an appetite to beat the Russians on the frontline.</strong> We know what the war machine of Russia looks like. We don’t like the idea.</em></p> 
   <p><em>So we have a peace plan, but the others have [more of] a war plan, and <strong>that confrontation happened.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>So <strong>the views are very far away from each other.</strong>”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Orbán was also <strong>very critical of the idea of using frozen Russian assets to finance further aid for Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p>He said <strong>the leaders were given “a very educational presentation” by the Belgian prime minister,</strong> which showed the idea was “not very promising,” as Belgium would first need to be given assurances that other countries would share their legal responsibility for such a move. </p> 
  <p>“No way,” he exclaimed.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>The question is, whose money is that?</strong> So if it is money of somebody else, Hungary will never touch it. We are not stealers, you know. This money is not ours.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He later added that <strong>Hungary would “never be part of the deal” if it involves taking Russian frozen assets.</strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">US to give Ukraine intelligence on long-range energy targets in Russia, say reports</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Defence and security editor</em></p> 
  <p><strong>The US will provide Ukraine with intelligence on long-range energy infrastructure targets deep inside Russia,</strong> according to overnight reports, a move that would signal a significant shift in White House support for Kyiv.</p> 
  <p>The decision would be <strong>the first example of a change in policy by Donald Trump</strong> since his comments on social media towards the end of September that Ukraine could win back all of the territories occupied by Russia.</p> 
  <p>Reports in the Wall Street Journal and Reuters, citing unnamed US sources, said the policy had quietly changed ahead of that statement and that <strong>the White House wanted Nato allies to follow suit.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>No decision, however, had been made on whether the US would supply Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.</strong> Earlier this week the US vice-president, JD Vance, said Trump was considering a request from Kyiv for the missiles that have a range of 1,500 miles.</p> 
  <p>Western, and particularly US, intelligence in the form of satellite imagery and other monitoring data is considered <strong>a significant help in permitting the accurate targeting of Russian facilities deep inside its borders.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>A focus on energy targets, such as oil refineries, would allow Ukraine to extend an already successful campaign</strong> that has hit 21 out of 38 refineries with long-range drone strikes. That has led to fuel shortages in parts of Russia, and on some days it has been estimated that daily production is down by fifth.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Russia accused of sabotaging last power line into Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Defence and security editor</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Russia has been accused of deliberately sabotaging the last remaining power line into the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant,</strong> after satellite imagery of the damaged area showed no sign of Ukrainian shelling that Moscow says is preventing a repair.</p> 
  <p><strong>Outside power, normally used for cooling, has now been down for a record eight days,</strong> forcing the Russian operators of the plant in occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> to rely on back-up diesel generators to avoid a meltdown of its six reactor cores.</p> 
  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/ukraine_power-lines/giv-32554HKWcacSufpHn/" data-alt="Surroundings of the Zaporizhzhia power plant"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/ukraine_power-lines/giv-32554HKWcacSufpHn/">Interactive</a> 
  </figure> 
  <p>The photography was commissioned by Greenpeace and it was examined by experts at McKenzie Intelligence, in an effort to assess the damage at the Zaporizhzhia plant, which lies on the frontline of the war.</p> 
  <p>McKenzie Intelligence concluded <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L32Ppj7qdnE1JO-XqkIyxvrUT4sguYF3/view">in a short report</a> that there is <strong>“no evidence of any crater, either fresh or historic” around the damaged pylon</strong> and that it is still standing “and therefore should be a relatively simple task to repair”.</p> 
  <p>That contrasts with comments made last week by the Russian operators of the plant. The site’s communications director said on 25 September that “restoration efforts [were] currently being complicated by ongoing shelling by the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the area of the plant and in the immediate vicinity of the damaged line”.</p> 
  <p>The plant’s final external power line was cut at 4.56pm on Tuesday last week, creating a set of circumstances described by <strong>Rafael Grossi</strong>, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as “clearly not a sustainable situation in terms of nuclear safety”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Eight back-up generators are currently powering the cooling systems,</strong> with a further nine in reserve, said the IAEA in an update released on Tuesday. There is enough power to fuel the generators for 10 days, with further deliveries expected to maintain this level, the watchdog added.</p> 
  <p>Though the imagery of a pylon over a field in Russian held territory about 1.5km from the power plant is faint, the absence of dark pock marks on the ground, characteristic of areas that have been shelled, is obvious. Both legs of the pylon and a horizontal connecting structure are visible.</p> 
  <p><strong>Shaun Burnie,</strong> a nuclear specialist with Greenpeace, said the imagery showed that “Russia has deliberately sabotaged the external power line”.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Poland’s <strong>Tusk </strong>is up next, and he begins with congratulations for Moldova for a “spectacular” win of pro-European forces.</p> 
  <p>But he then strikes a very sombre tone, as <strong>he warns leaders that Europe is no longer in a pre-war period, but it faces a war.</strong></p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“It’s absolutely obvious that <strong>we have to stop all … kinds of illusions.</strong> The first illusion was and is that there is no war. It’s in some of us, we like these [softer] definitions, like full scale aggression or incidents or provocation.</em></p> 
   <p><em>No, it’s, <strong>it’s a war – a new type of war, very complex, but it’s a war.</strong>”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He then discloses that Poland has experienced more security incidents in recent days, with the last one near Szczecin port just a few days ago.</p> 
  <p>“<strong>We [see] new incidents in our region, in the Baltic Sea, every single week.</strong> It’s almost every day,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He says that <strong>for Poland, this war is “not an abstract,” with multiple attempts to illegally cross the Polish border with Belarus “every day,”</strong> with some attacks on its soldiers, including casualties. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em><strong>It is our war, and if Ukraine loses, it means our failure.</strong></em></p>

  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>The only [advantage of] Russia is here: they are ready to fight.</strong> They are ready to sacrifice something, they are ready to suffer, and this psychological advantage, this is why we are so sometimes we are … not decisive enough and not determined enough.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He ends with a stark warning:</p> 
  <p><em>“Not only because of our history, because of geography, … <strong>we know something about the Russian intentions and plans.</strong> </em></p> 
  <p><em>We know that <strong>if they win against Ukraine, it is then, in the future, the end of my country and of Europe, I have no doubt.</strong></em></p>

  <p>France’s <strong>Emmanuel Macron </strong>says “we are at a moment when Russia is clearly not getting its main objective,” as it’s “special operation” failed to get to Kyiv or change the regime in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>“I think <strong>the situation is much better today than it was at the beginning of the year</strong> … [when] our fear was to have a sort of very rapid peace, and we had some doubts about the level of support of the United States,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He <strong>credits the work of the Coalition of the Willing for that</strong>, and <strong>stresses the success in “re-engaging with the United States”</strong> as he notes that Trump’s recent comments show “a huge change.”</p> 
  <p>“It’s very important, because for me, <strong>it’s a concrete case of countering the misinformation spread by Russia.</strong> No, Russia is not winning. No, Ukraine is not losing this war, and the situation is very different,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He says it’s now clear that Putin’s comments on engaging with a peace process were “not totally a sincere commitment.”</p> 
  <p>He adds that <strong>the next steps need to focus on Ukraine’s air defence systems, drones, and long-range missiles.</strong> </p> 
  <p>Macron also <strong>calls for swift adoption of the 19th package of sanctions on Russia</strong>, and calls to “step up” pressure on Russia’s shadow fleet.</p> 
  <p>“It’s extremely important to <strong>increase the pressure on this shadow fleet</strong> because it will clearly reduce the capacity to finance this [war],” he says, urging Europeans to “kill the business model” by “detaining, even for days or weeks, these vessels and forcing them to organise themselves differently.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Russia 'still feels bold enough to escalate this war' with drone incidents, Zelenskyy warns</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Ukraine’s <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> is speaking next.</p> 
  <p>He immediately tells leaders that “<strong>we are all now in a new reality</strong>, and everyone, I think, understands it, even those who may not want to admit it.”</p> 
  <p>He warns that “the recent drone incidents across Europe are <strong>a clear sign that Russia still feels bold enough to escalate this war</strong>,” and <strong>wants to “divide Europe,</strong> to ignite arguments, to prevent us from finding common ground.”</p> 
  <p>“If the Russians dare to launch drones against Poland or violate the airspace of northern European countries, <strong>it means this can happen anywhere – in western Europe, in the south – and we need fast and effective response,</strong>” he says.</p> 
  <p>He urges leaders to fast-track adoption of the 19th package of sanctions against Russia, and asks them to “support President Trump’s call to stop buying Russian oil here, here in Europe.”</p> 
  <p>In a direct swipe at Hungary’s <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong>, he adds, “and the guys from Hungary need to hear this,” as he adds that he is confident that “energy from the US and other partners can fill the gap in the European market.”</p> 
  <p>He also congratulates <strong>Moldova</strong>, and pushes the leaders to open formal chapter one talks about Moldova and Ukraine’s accession to the EU.</p>

  <p>And he then goes back to Ukraine, <strong>stressing the importance of supporting Kyiv</strong>, as he says that what is at stake there “is not only Ukraine’s right to be a free and sovereign country, but it is in fact international law,” including the fundamental postwar belief that borders must not be changed by force.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'This war was never just about Ukraine,' Danish PM warns, as she urges leaders to 'no longer be naive'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Frederiksen </strong>also praises Ukraine’s Zelenskyy, praising Ukraine for “defending Ukraine against a merciless, full scale Russian aggression.”</p> 
  <p>“You have done what no one thought possible, and you have our steadfast support,” she says.</p> 
  <p>But then Frederiksen turns to other leaders, as she warns:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“I know that for some of you, the threat from Russia is very clear and very present. For others, it still seems further away, but <strong>none of us can no longer be naive.</strong> </em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>The war was never just about Ukraine.</strong> It is about Europe, all our nations, all our citizens, our values and our freedom.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She goes on:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Please just take one look at the history of our continent, from the expansion of the Russian Empire to Soviet tanks rolling across several borders during the cold war, shattering hopes of freedom. </em></p> 
   <p><em>Recent history tells us the exact same story. <strong>So why shouldn’t it happen again?</strong> </em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>Russia is now converting into a war economy, using every mean, every opportunity, to intimidate, to threaten and to divide us</strong>, unfortunately, enabled by China, with soldiers from North Korea and drones from Iran, and <strong>I see no signs that Putin and Russia’s imperial fever dream stops with Ukraine.”</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She stresses that “<strong>it’s not charity, what we’re doing in Ukraine</strong>, it is a direct defence of our continent.”</p> 
  <p>She says that <strong>Europe has begun moving in the right direction, but “we have to move much faster</strong> – we have to learn from Ukraine, your sense of urgency, building an incredible defence industry in just a couple of years.”</p> 
  <p>Drawing from Denmark’s experiences over the past two weeks, she adds a warning about the growing hybrid threats, posed by drones, misinformation, attacks on critical infrastructure, and “uncontrolled” migration.</p>

  <p>Flanked by the European Council president, <strong>António Costa</strong>, and Ukraine’s president, <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy,</strong> she says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“For the last few months, <strong>there has been much talk about peace in Ukraine</strong>, with meetings, pre-meetings and briefings about the meetings, <strong>and meanwhile, Russia continues its brutal attacks.</strong></em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Belgian PM repeats legal questions about using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Last night’s discussions on Russia and Ukraine largely focused on the question of using frozen Russian assets to finance loans to Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p>But Belgium’s prime minister <strong>Bart de Wever</strong> is leading a group of countries that <strong>remain sceptical about the move as they are concerned about legal consequences</strong>. </p> 
  <p>Belgium is particularly exposed here, as more than a half of the funds are held at a Brussels-based clearing firm, <strong>Euroclear</strong>.</p> 
  <p>In his comments this morning, <strong>he said he had asked other leaders to give strong guarantees they would share the risks if frozen Russian assets were used</strong> to finance loans to Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>He suggested that <strong>Belgium would be ready to go forward with the plan only if its questions get answered satisfactorily,</strong> and that’s not the case so far.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Ohh, that’s interesting.</em></p> 
  <p>As Poland’s <strong>Donald Tusk</strong> was chatting with a group of Polish journalists, one of them decided to shout a question in English to Hungary’s <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong>, who was talking to some Hungarian reporters nearby.</p> 
  <p>With a bit of encouragement from Tusk, <strong>Orbán </strong>walked across to the Polish group, where he was challenged with a simple question:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Who [poses] the main threat for Europe?</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>(Tusk quickly realised what’s going on, warning him: “It’s a provocation.”)</p> 
  <p>But Orbán<strong> </strong>kept his cool and replied:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>– <em>The real danger? Economic stagnation and losing competitiveness.</em></p> 
   <p>– <em>Not Russia?</em></p> 
   <p>– <em><strong>We are stronger than Russia.</strong> Make some comparisons and base your opinion on the facts. We have more than 400 million people, Russia is 130 something. Look at the European GDP is [big] like that. Russia is [small] like that. We spend all together, the 27, more on military spending than the Russians. <strong>So why we are afraid? We are stronger than they are.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>The question is whether we have, whether we have leadership to come together and to defend our interests together.</strong> That’s what we should do anyway.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Degree of naivety' in Ireland over 'existential' Russia threat, Irish PM warns</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Irish prime minister <strong>Micheál Martin </strong>focused on the security situation facing Europe in his comments, as he talked about “a pattern” of Russian behaviour in eastern Europe and warned about a “degree of naivety back in Ireland in respect of that.”</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“We had <strong>a very serious discussion in terms of the threat that Russia is now posing to the European Union and to European Union member states,</strong> and particularly in terms of the violation of the airspace of quite a number of European member states. …</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>A clear pattern is emerging</strong>, if you take everything that has happened over the last number of weeks and months, in terms of drone incursions, in terms of maritime activity around cables, and that in terms of the undermining of political and politics in various member states …</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>And it seems to me that there’s a degree of naivety back in Ireland in respect of that.</strong> Certainly <strong>the member states</strong> and the eastern European side, the Baltic States in particular, <strong>feel this threat and feel it’s existential.”</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He later added:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>Putin is showing no signs that he wants to end that war</strong>, despite all the entreaties and despite the Alaska meeting and so on. <strong>So the situation is very serious for Europe and the Russian threat is very serious.</strong>”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Separately, Martin also spoke about the Gaza flotilla intercepted by Israel, stressing that he was receiving up-to-date briefings on the situation, and that Ireland would offer consular help to all affected.</p> 
  <p>He stressed:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>It’s a humanitarian mission</strong>, no threat to anybody other than to highlight and also to bring humanitarian aid into the people of Gaza, and it underlines the absolute imperative of getting humanitarian aid into Gaza as quickly as possible under the auspices of the United Nations and the Red Crescent.”</em> </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">European Political Community format brings leaders together for talks but some question its value - snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>After the EU summit in Copenhagen… comes another European summit in the Danish capital.</strong> More than <strong>45 leaders from across the continent are expected to meet</strong> as the European Political Community to discuss security, migration and the economy.</p> 
  <p>The EPC was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/macron-calls-for-new-european-body-and-warns-ukraine-of-eu-wait">proposed by French president </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/macron-calls-for-new-european-body-and-warns-ukraine-of-eu-wait">Emmanuel Macron</a>,</strong> after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. It <strong>brings together almost every European country, barring Russia and Belarus</strong>, with the aim of promoting cooperation between EU and non-EU countries, especially on security and defence. Since its first gathering in October 2022, it has been hard to pin down results. </p> 
  <p>The one-day summits, with invites extended to 45+ leaders from Iceland to Azerbaijan, Finland to Portugal, are <strong>not intended to take decisions</strong>. Some diplomats have questioned the value of the frequency of the twice-yearly gatherings; others say <strong>the usefulness lies in the informal bilaterals and ad-hoc meetings on the side.</strong> </p> 
  <p>The first meeting was in <strong>Prague</strong> in October 2022, where EU leaders thought they had made progress in resolving the long-running conflict between <strong>Azerbaijan</strong> and <strong>Armenia</strong>. But it fell apart the following year when Azerbaijan’s leader <strong>Ilham Aliyev</strong> <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2023/10/05/blow-to-european-leaders-summit-as-azerbaijan-turkey-are-no-shows">skipped a follow-up EPC in Granada</a>, missing further talks with his Armenian counterpart, <strong>Nikol Pashinyan.</strong> </p> 
  <p>The first EPC summit in the Czech capital was notable because <strong>Liz Truss</strong>, the UK’s shortest-lived prime minister, decided that Macron was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/06/liz-truss-european-political-community-meeting-prague">“a friend”</a> after all.</p> 
  <p>The next <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/eu-steps-up-support-moldova-leaders-due-attend-summit">EPC in </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/eu-steps-up-support-moldova-leaders-due-attend-summit">Moldova</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/may/28/eu-steps-up-support-moldova-leaders-due-attend-summit"> in 2023</a> was seen as highly symbolic, soon after the former Soviet republic of 2.4m made a decisive bid to integrate with the west, while facing intense Russian pressure. </p> 
  <p>A gathering in the UK in 2024 was a moment for the then newly minted prime minister Keir Starmer to proclaim that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/18/starmer-promises-eu-leaders-at-epc-he-will-repair-ties-with-their-countries">Britain wanted to reset ties with Europe</a>, after the muddle and turmoil of the Brexit years. Some EU insiders questioned the value of the meeting, which came soon after a Nato summit brought together most of the same cast.</p> 
  <p><strong>Luuk Van Middelaar</strong>, a former adviser to a European Council president, thinks the EPC is proving its value. He makes the case for the organisation in <a href="https://big-europe.eu/publications/big006-continental-diplomacy-for-a-new-era-the-european-political-community-from-prague-to-copenhagen">a paper </a>co-authored with <strong>Antoine Michon</strong>, a diplomat and visiting scholar at the Brussels Institute for Geopolitics.</p> 
  <p>They write:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“As demonstrated by the sustained high attendance at each summit, <strong>the EPC has become an essential piece of the political and diplomatic conversation in a war-facing continent</strong>, a fitting and timely response to the demise of Europe’s post-cold war order.</em></p> 
   <p><em>In and through the European Political Community, Europe has unearthed an older incarnation of itself, taking on the ancient diplomatic mantle of a polity of sovereign states.”</em></p>
