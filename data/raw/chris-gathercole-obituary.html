<p>My father, Chris Gathercole, who has died aged 87, was a pioneering clinical psychologist. He was an advocate for people with learning disabilities being involved in decisions about themselves and for them to be independent.</p> <p>He worked at large hospitals in Glasgow, Liverpool, North Wales and Lancashire, where he introduced innovative American concepts such as “social role valorisation”. The idea behind it was to improve the lives of those with disabilities, emphasising the importance of people having a place in society, their wellbeing and making sure they had access to the “good things of life”, such as relationships and employment.</p> <p>Chris was senior psychologist at Bryn-y-Neuadd hospital, Llanfairfechan, in the 1970s. The harpist Elinor Bennett (Lady Wigley), whose sons came under his care, recalled: “He was a very kind, caring and hard-working member of the team who helped our family with the care and education of our two disabled sons, Alun and Geraint. He worked to raise the quality of life and to establish more compassionate care and access to education for disabled children and their families within the community.”</p> <p>Born in Smethwick, West Midlands, Chris was raised in Sheffield, and attended the naval training school HMS Conway on Anglesey. His father, Ernest, was a head teacher, and a Methodist lay preacher, and his mother, Frances (nee Reading), a Labour party activist and Sheffield city councillor. They instilled in him a belief in public service.</p> <p>After graduating from University College London with a degree in psychology, and completing a diploma in clinical psychology at Glasgow University, Chris went on to work for the NHS for the next 38 years, after being inspired by a lecture by Aneurin Bevan. In 1966, his book, Assessment in Clinical Psychology, was published by Penguin.</p> <p>Chris retired in 1996, but continued to contribute to the community near his home in Whalley, Lancashire, starting a local Freecycle group, helping set up Transition Town Clitheroe and spearheading Ribble Valley Against Racism.</p> <p>Farouk Hussain, of Clitheroe mosque, said: “Chris was a principled and passionate human whom we, the Muslim community, were proud to have as our friend. He showed immense bravery, standing up to lead the fight against the British National party.”</p> <p>He was a founder member of Whalley Hydro Scheme, creating green energy for the local community, and was instrumental in establishing a community forest garden.</p> <p>Chris met Dorrie Gordon at dancing lessons at HMS Conway, and they were married in 1958, going on to have two daughters, Gill and me, while living in Glasgow.</p> <p>In 2019, they returned to North Wales, where they planted a wildflower meadow and small woodland, and Chris was active in the climate action movement, GwyrddNi, in the Llanberis area. Despite accomplishing so much, he resolutely avoided the limelight, citing his belief in the importance of collective action.</p> <p>Chris is survived by Dorrie, Gill and me, and his older brother John.</p>
