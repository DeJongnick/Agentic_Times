<p>For Ukrainians, the UK’s unwavering support – from its governments to its people and cultural institutions like the Royal Ballet and Opera – has been a vital source of strength and hope amid Russia’s brutal war of aggression.</p> <p>It is, therefore, with great pain that we witness the Royal Opera House inviting Anna Netrebko – a longtime symbol of cultural propaganda for a regime that is responsible for serious war crimes – to return to its stage in title roles.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/aug/14/royal-ballet-and-opera-house-urged-to-drop-anna-netrebko-russian-soprano-putin-links">Royal Ballet and Opera house urged to drop Russian soprano with Putin links</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even more troubling is the statement by the chief executive of the Royal Ballet and Opera suggesting that its earlier support for Ukraine “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/04/uk-royal-ballet-and-opera-withdraw-tosca-tel-aviv-israel-gaza">was aligned with the global consensus at the time</a>” and that its position has since changed due to “complex geopolitics”.</p> <p>We must ask: do Russia’s recent escalated attacks on peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilians and its intentional and systematic attempts to erase Ukrainian culture fall into this category of complexity, somehow justifying Netrebko’s return? Can the Royal Opera credibly claim neutrality and integrity while offering its stage to someone who, in 2014, publicly waved the flag of “Novorossiya”, the Kremlin’s separatist project in Ukraine’s Donetsk region, parts of which remain under Russian military occupation?</p> <p>The Royal Opera now faces a defining choice: between status and responsibility, between profit and values, between silence and conscience. We urge you to remain, as you consistently have, on the ethical side of art – and of history.</p> <p><strong>Sergiy Kyslytsya</strong> <em>First deputy foreign minister of Ukraine</em><br><strong>Andriy Kurkov</strong> <em>Author, PEN Ukraine</em><br><strong>Helen Clark</strong> <em>Former prime minister of New Zealand</em><br><strong>Alex Sobel</strong> <strong>MP</strong> <em>Labour (Co-op), Leeds Central and Headingley, and chair, all-party parliamentary group on Ukraine</em><br><strong>John Whittingdale</strong> <strong>MP</strong><em> Vice-chair, all-party parliamentary group on Ukraine;
