<p>A little bit like Woody Allen, or an episode of Seinfeld minus the stream of gags, this talky Spanish comedy tells the story of a couple planning a break-up party. It follows film director Ale (Itsaso Arana) and her soon to be ex, actor Alex (Vito Sanz), as they call it quits after 14 years together. The decision is mutual, and as reasonable people who still like each other, they think they can split without the pain and heartache. “We’ve separated, but we’re OK!” says Alex, so many times it starts to sound hollow.</p> <p>So, alongside the breakup admin (deciding who gets to stay in their amazingly cheap rented flat in Madrid and dividing the DVDs), they organise a party to mark their uncoupling. The idea originally comes from Ale’s dad (played by director Jonás Trueba’s father, veteran film-maker Fernando), who has a theory that people should celebrate separations. Her brother says the idea is corny and American. The pair’s friends are shocked: “You’re the perfect couple!” says one with that panicky look people get when a solid-seeming couple splits, like it might be contagious.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-IyW4HU8Yc"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j-IyW4HU8Yc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Right at the beginning, the pair lie in bed, mulling over the party idea. Ale isn’t convinced. “It’s a good idea for a film, but in real life…?” And here The Other Way Around gets meta; Ale is busy editing her new film, which turns out to be the film we’re watching. It is a clever touch, a bit over-tricksy perhaps, and I wasn’t entirely convinced it added much. That said, it gives the film one of its most excruciating scenes when Ale organises a preview screening to show the cast and crew an early edit of the film. Afterwards, everyone smiles reassuringly – then one man pipes up: “Don’t take this the wrong way, but …” and a begins a pretentious intellectual takedown. Like the film it’s a funny-smart moment, witty and grownup.</p> <p>• The Other Way Around is in UK and Irish cinemas from 11 July.</p>
