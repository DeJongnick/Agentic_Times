<p>Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation into an attack on three prison officers by the brother of the Manchester Arena bomber.</p> <p>Hashem Abedi, who ploted the 2017 bombing, attacked three prison officers with hot cooking oil at a high-security prison, the Prison Officers’ Association (POA) said.</p> <p>The Prison Service confirmed Abedi carried out the “unprovoked” and “vicious” assault on Saturday at HMP Frankland in County Durham.</p> <p>He is reported to have thrown boiling oil at the officers before stabbing them with “homemade weapons”.</p> <p>The POA said they had sustained life-threatening injuries including burns, scalds and stab wounds. All three officers were treated in hospital, with one female officer discharged by 4pm on Saturday.</p> <p>Abedi was jailed for life in August 2020 for assisting his brother, Salman Abedi, in carrying out the suicide bombing at Manchester Arena in 2017. The attack killed 22 people and injured hundreds more.</p> <p>Responding to the assault, the secretary of state for justice, Shabana Mahmood, wrote on X: “I am appalled by the attack of three brave officers at HMP Frankland today. My thoughts are with them and their families.</p> <p>“The police are now investigating. I will be pushing for the strongest possible punishment. Violence against our staff will never be tolerated.”</p> <p>HMP Frankland is a category A prison, the highest level of security. It is understood the incident took place inside a separation centre – a special facility that aims to isolate prisoners with extreme views.</p> <p>Mark Fairhurst, national chair of the POA, said: “Separation centres hold the most dangerous terrorist offenders who simply do not wish to alter their ideology, and, as this event confirms, are determined to inflict violence on those who hold them securely.”</p> <p>He called for an urgent review of the privileges available to terrorist offenders in custody: “We must now review the freedoms we allow separation centre prisoners to have.”</p> <p>“I am of the opinion that allowing access to cooking facilities and items that can threaten the lives of staff should be removed immediately.</p> <p>“These prisoners need only receive their basic entitlements and we should concentrate on control and containment instead of attempting to appease them. Things have to change.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: “Three prison officers have been treated in hospital after an attack by a prisoner at HMP Frankland. Police are now investigating so it would be inappropriate to comment further.</p> <p>“Violence in prison will not be tolerated, and we will always push for the strongest punishment for attacks on our hard-working staff.”</p>
