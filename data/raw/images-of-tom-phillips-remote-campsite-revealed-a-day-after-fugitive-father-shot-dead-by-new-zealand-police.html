<p>Police in New Zealand have released images and given details of the campsite where two of fugitive Tom Phillips’ children were found, after their father was shot and killed by police on Monday.</p> <p>Phillips had spent nearly four years hiding in the wilderness with his children. He was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/08/tom-phillips-new-zealand-fugitive-father-shot-dead-nz-police">killed</a> in an exchange of fire with police after reports of a burglary in the remote town of Piopio. A police officer is recovering in hospital after being shot in the head by Phillips with a high-powered rifle in the standoff. About 11 hours after Phillips was killed, two of his children were found safe and well at the campsite in Waitomo. It is understood the third child was with Phillips at the time of the shooting.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/08/fugitive-father-tom-phillips-how-saga-unfolded-new-zealand">Hidden for nearly four years: how the saga of fugitive father Tom Phillips unfolded in New Zealand</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a press conference on Tuesday, police commissioner Richard Chambers said authorities found at least one firearm and ammunition at the campsite, which was about 2km from where Phillips had been killed.</p> <p>He said authorities were able to “get the support of one of the children … to locate the remaining children in dense bush”. The image released showed quad bikes, tyres and cans of soft drink in the thick bushland.</p> <p> Chambers said the campsite was in “deep bush … not an easily found location for anyone”.</p>    <p>Chambers also said they were looking for potential accomplices who may have helped Phillips and an investigation would continue for “months”. It would examine how Phillips was able to access firearms and quad bikes and “who else may be involved”.</p> <p>“[There is] a lot of work to determine whether there is anyone else involved.”</p> <p>In Piopio on Tuesday, residents showed a mix of sadness and relief over the dramatic end to the four-year saga.</p> <p>Many expressed support for Phillips and his children, echoing a sentiment that has been prevalent online. The overwhelming feeling was relief that the children were safe, along with a sense that violent confrontation should have been avoided.</p> <p> “His death was probably inevitable, the cops were just doing their job, but it was sad they did that in front of the child,” local roadworker Patrick said.</p>    <p>His niece Matewehe said she was “relieved” for the children, and worried about their health after the death of their father.</p> <p>The children are now in child protective custody. An urgent suppression order was granted in the high court in relation to aspects of the case on Tuesday evening after an application by a lawyer acting on behalf of the Phillips family.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Warwick Morehu from Oranga Tamariki told reporters the children were settled and “doing well under the circumstances”. He described the situation as “unprecedented” and appealed to the public to give the family privacy.</p> <p>Phillips took his children Ember, now 9, Maverick, 10, and Jayda, 12, into the Waikato wilderness in December 2021 following a dispute with their mother. Phillips did not have legal custody of his children. He was facing a raft of charges, including aggravated robbery, aggravated wounding and unlawful possession of a firearm. Experts have <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360817153/incredibly-complex-process-tom-phillips-children-integrate-back-community-and-family">expressed concern</a> about the children’s reintegration into society.</p> <p>In the press conference, Chambers reiterated that Phillips should not be considered a hero. “No one who does this to children, who unleashes high-powered rifles on my staff, is a hero,” he said.</p> <p>The police minister, Mark Mitchell, said Phillips had continuously put his children in harm’s way.</p>    <p>“You had a father in Mr Phillips who had no regard for the safety of those children, a suspect who had taken his family into violent and dangerous offending on previous occasions.”</p> <p>Chambers provided an update on the injured officer, who he met on Tuesday, and said it would be “a long road to recovery”.</p> <p>“He was able to speak to us a little bit … His eyes are not open … it’s very confronting,” the commissioner said.</p> <p>As the community grappled with the tragedy, some in Piopio were reluctant to talk. “We’re over it, to be honest,” one local said in response to a question from the Guardian. Staff at the farm goods store had been advised not to talk.</p> <p>Kerry Voyle, a local council worker on the main street of Piopio, said on Tuesday morning that Phillips’ death was “really traumatic”, and he felt for his friends and family in the tight-knit, rural community.</p> <p>This sentiment was echoed by farm worker Nicos Pizimolas, outside the store broken into by Phillips.</p> <p>“At the end of the day the kids did end up losing their father, so it’s sad for them. At least everyone knows they’re safe now.”</p>
