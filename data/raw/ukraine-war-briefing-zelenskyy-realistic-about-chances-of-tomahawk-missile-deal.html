<ul> <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said Ukraine needs American long-range missiles for an offensive against Russian targets but that he was “realistic” about his chances of getting them</strong>. The Ukrainian president was speaking after talks with Donald Trump at the White House on Friday during which the US president appeared cool on the prospect of supplying Kyiv with Tomahawk missiles. However, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press,” Zelenskyy suggested the door was not entirely closed. “It’s good that President Trump didn’t say ‘no,’ but for today, didn’t say ‘yes,’” he said. <strong>Zelenskyy</strong> added that Ukraine needed Tomahawks because “it’s very difficult just to operate only with Ukrainian drones.”</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>After the meeting, Trump implored the combatants to “stop the war immediately”</strong>, even if it means Ukraine conceding territory. “Stop the killing. And that should be it,” he told journalists after arriving in Florida. On social media he suggested freezing the conflict, saying: “They should stop where they are. Let both claim Victory, let History decide!” When asked about the social media post, which he had not seen, Zelenskyy said: “The president is right we have to stop where we are, and then to speak.”</p></li> </ul> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/17/what-are-tomahawk-missiles-and-why-does-ukraine-want-them">What are Tomahawk missiles and why does Ukraine want them?</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy had what British prime minister Sir Keir Starmer described as a “productive” call with European leaders</strong> on Friday, hours after Zelenskyy met Trump at the White House. “I shared details of my conversation with US president Donald Trump. We discussed many important issues,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X. “The main priority now is to protect as many lives as possible, guarantee security for Ukraine, and strengthen all of us in Europe. That is exactly what we are working for. Our national security advisers will discuss the next steps. We are coordinating our positions. I am grateful for the conversation, for all the support, and for the readiness to stand with Ukraine.” Starmer <strong>reiterated the UK’s “unwavering commitment to Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression</strong>”, and said it would “continue to send humanitarian aid and military support” to Kyiv. Leaders from Germany, Finland, Italy, Norway, and Poland were on the call, along with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Nato Secretary Gen Mark Rutte and European council president Antonio Costa.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia and the US should build a “Putin-Trump” rail tunnel under the Bering Strait to link their countries</strong>, unlock joint exploration of natural resources and “symbolise unity“, a Kremlin envoy has suggested. The proposal by Kirill Dmitriev, President Vladimir Putin’s investment envoy and head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, envisages a construction project costing US$8bn (£6bn), funded by Moscow and “international partners”, to build a 70-mile (112-km) rail and cargo link in under eight years. Dmitriev floated the idea late on Thursday after Putin spoke to Donald Trump by phone and agreed to meet in Budapest to discuss stopping the war against Ukraine.</p></li> <li><p>The <strong>Russian Defence Ministry said on Friday its forces had taken control of three more villages in eastern Ukraine</strong>, one in the Dnipropetrovsk region and two in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, closer to the Russian border. Ukraine has acknowledged fighting around at least two of the settlements but has not said that any of the areas have changed hands. According to the Russian ministry, Moscow’s troops took control of Pryvillia in the Dnipropetrovsk region, and captured the villages of Pishchane and Tykhe.</p></li> </ul>
