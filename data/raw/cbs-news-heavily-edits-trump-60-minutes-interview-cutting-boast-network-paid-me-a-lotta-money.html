<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/cbs">CBS</a> News program 60 Minutes heavily edited down an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> that aired on Sunday night, his first sit-down with the show in five years.</p> <p>Trump sat down with correspondent Norah O’Donnell for 90 minutes, but only about 28 minutes were broadcast. A <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/read-full-transcript-norah-odonnell-60-minutes-interview-with-president-trump/">full transcript of the interview</a> was later published, along with a 73-minute-long <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/president-trumps-extended-60-minutes-interview/">extended version online</a>.</p> <p>While 60 Minutes traditionally cuts down interviews, these edits are particularly notable because, exactly one year before Trump was interviewed by O’Donnell at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Friday he had sued CBS over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, then the vice-president, which he alleged had been deceptively edited to help her chances in the presidential election.</p> <p>Many legal experts widely dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless” and unlikely to hold up under the first amendment, but CBS settled with Trump for $16m in July. As part of the settlement, the network had agreed that it would release transcripts of future interviews of presidential candidates.</p> <p>At the beginning of Sunday’s show, O’Donnell reminded viewers that Paramount <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/03/dan-rather-cbs-paramount-settlement-trump">settled Trump’s lawsuit</a>, but noted that “the settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing”.</p> <p>During the interview, in a clip that did not air on the broadcast, Trump needled CBS over the settlement and repeated his claims against the network.</p> <p>“Actually, 60 Minutes paid me a lotta money. And you don’t have to put this on, because I don’t wanna embarrass you, and I’m sure you’re not,” Trump said. “But 60 Minutes was forced to pay me a lot of money because they took her answer out that was so bad, it was election-changing, two nights before the election. And they put a new answer in. And they paid me a lot of money for that. You can’t have fake news. You’ve gotta have legit news. And I think that it’s happening.”</p> <p>During another un-aired portion of the interview, Trump praised the sale of CBS to the Ellison family and said the network’s new editor-in-chief, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/06/who-is-bari-weiss-cbs-news">Bari Weiss</a>, was a “great new leader”.</p> <p>The US president said he didn’t know Weiss, but told O’Donnell: “I hear she’s a great person.</p> <p>“I think you have a great new leader, frankly, who’s the young woman that’s leading your whole enterprise, is a great – from what I know,” he said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/31/bari-weiss-host-cbs-evening-news">Who will Bari Weiss pick as the next anchor of CBS Evening News?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump was particularly effusive in praising David Ellison and his father, Larry, the new owner of CBS News’s parent company, Paramount, through their company Skydance Media.</p> <p>“I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership,” Trump said. “I think it’s the greatest thing that’s happened in a long time to a free and open and good press.”</p> <p>O’Donnell did not directly respond to the president’s comments about Weiss and the Ellisons.</p> <p>Among Trump’s many answers that were edited out were several comments questioning the integrity of the 2020 presidential election, which he said “was rigged and stolen”.</p> <p>At one point in the interview, in a segment that was not aired on the broadcast, Trump tried to get O’Donnell to acknowledge that crime was down in Washington DC, where she lives.</p> <p>“You live here. You know that too,” Trump said, asking O’Donnell: “Do you see a difference?”</p> <p>“I think I’ve been working too hard,” O’Donnell responded. “I haven’t been out and about that much … I get in my car and go to work and I go home.”</p> <p>Trump said “that’s not a fair answer” and insisted that O’Donnell noticed a difference.</p> <p>The president then seemed to suggest that the back-and-forth didn’t need to be aired on the show.</p> <p>“You don’t have to use that one,” he said. “Don’t worry, don’t worry, I don’t want to embarrass her.”</p>
