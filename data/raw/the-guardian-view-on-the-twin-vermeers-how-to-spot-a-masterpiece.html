<p>“How do you know how much to pay if you don’t know what it is worth?” So ends <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/27/hayfestival2006.hayfestival#:~:text=For%20let%20me%20be%20entirely,belligerently%20profane%20work%20of%20art">Theft: A Love Story</a> by the Australian novelist Peter Carey. This scabrous riff on the slipperiness of cultural value in the international art scene asks: is a copy so good that even experts mistake it for the original painting still a fake?</p> <p>Questions of authenticity and attribution are behind <a href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about/search-news/250901-double-vision-vermeer-at-kenwood/">a new display by English Heritage at Kenwood House</a> in London to mark the 350th anniversary of the death of Johannes Vermeer. For the first time in 300 years, two nearly identical paintings of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/01/vermeer-or-not-new-display-lets-visitors-decide-who-painted-almost-identical-artworks">the Guitar Player</a>, one signed by the Dutch master, the other on loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and until recently believed to be a 17th- or 18th-century copy, will hang side by side. Experts have puzzled over the relationship between the two paintings for 100 years. Now visitors are being&nbsp;invited take part in a game of spot the difference&nbsp;(there are five, apparently), comparing a&nbsp;recognised masterpiece and its “twin”.</p> <p>A 2022 exhibition at Washington DC’s National Gallery of Art similarly set out to examine “<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/art/article/vermeer-exhibition-to-settle-debate-over-paintings-dismissed-as-fakes-kshbm6vvl">what makes&nbsp;a Vermeer a Vermeer</a>”. The long-contested Girl With a Flute was subsequently <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/national-gallery-of-art-vermeers-secrets-2188777#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%20Vermeer%E2%80%99s%20Secrets%E2%80%9D%20is%20on%20view%20at,NW%2C%20Washington%2C%20D.C.%2C%20October%208%E2%80%93January%208%2C%202022.">downgraded</a> to the&nbsp;work of an associate, because “<a href="https://www.nga.gov/artworks/1237-girl-flute#:~:text=Once%20cautiously%20attributed%20to%20Johannes%20Vermeer%2C%20Girl,the%20quality%20falls%20short%20of%20Vermeer%E2%80%99s%20standards">the quality falls short of Vermeer’s standards</a>”.</p> <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/15/claim-casts-doubt-on-origin-of-national-gallery-rubnes">a rumbling dispute</a> about the authenticity of Rubens’ Samson and Delilah,<strong> </strong>bought for a record sum by the National Gallery in London in 1980, was reignited, with a <a href="https://www.inrubensname.org/">petition launched</a> calling for a public debate to resolve the issue. The National has been accused of covering up a duff acquisition by applying a modern blockboard to the painting’s back – claims the gallery has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/20/research-confirms-that-samson-and-delilah-is-a-rubens">rigorously refuted</a>.</p> <p>Art-world controversies are often the stuff of detective fiction. The Kenwood masterpiece has fingerprints on its surface, presumably those of the artist himself; the Philadelphia painting still has the wax seal of a long-ago owner on the back. No wonder such stories appeal to writers.</p> <p>Along with Carey’s Theft, other fictional art capers include Michael Frayn’s 1999 Booker-prize shortlisted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/03/fiction.reviews4">Headlong,</a> about an art historian who believes he has uncovered a lost Bruegel; Donna Tartt’s 2013 Pulitzer prize-winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/19/goldfinch-donna-tartt-review">The Goldfinch</a>, which takes its title from a 17th-century painting by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/oct/21/the-goldfinch-carel-fabritius-scottish-national-gallery">Dutch artist Carel Fabritius</a>; and most recently Nell Stevens’ tale of Victorian love and fakery, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/25/the-original-by-nell-stevens-review-queering-the-victorians">The&nbsp;Original</a>. There’s even a Simpsons episode, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3181612/">The&nbsp;War of Art</a>, in which Homer and Marge think they have discovered a valuable Dutch painting in a&nbsp;yard sale. Doh! “You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous,” the forger tells a disappointed Lisa.</p> <p>He has a point. But the provenance of a painting is vital, not just to scholars. In a world of fake news, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/apr/12/28-fake-images-that-fooled-the-world">manipulated images</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/mar/12/non-fungible-tokens-revolutionising-art-world-theft">digital art theft</a>, authenticity matters more than ever. Artists are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/the-guardian-view-on-ai-and-copyright-law-big-tech-must-pay">campaigning</a> to protect their intellectual property from AI crawling because authorship is the hallmark&nbsp;of human creativity.</p> <p>English Heritage hopes to have a final verdict on the two paintings at Kenwood House by year’s end. The display encourages visitors to really study them, to become amateur art historians. This is part of a growing trend in museums and galleries, such as the new<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/may/28/v-and-a-east-storehouse-review-picasso-victoria-albert"> V&amp;A East Storehouse</a>, to involve the public as co-curators. The real winner of this contest is the viewer, who gets to bask in the quiet luminosity of Vermeer while taking part in an important moment in art history.</p>
