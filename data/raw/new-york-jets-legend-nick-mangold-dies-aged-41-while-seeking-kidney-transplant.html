<p>Nick Mangold, a hugely popular player during his 11-season career with the New York Jets, has died at the age of 41.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Mangold said he had been undergoing dialysis and needed a kidney transplant. He sought help from fans of the Jets and Ohio State, where he was a star in college.</p> <p>“In 2006, I was diagnosed with a genetic defect that has led to chronic kidney disease. After a rough summer, I’m undergoing dialysis as we look for a kidney transplant,” he wrote at the time. “I always knew this day would come, but I thought I would have had more time.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, I do not have any family able to donate at this time, so this is why I’m reaching out to you, our NY Jets and Ohio State communities. I am in need of a kidney donor with type O blood.”</p> <p>Mangold was a first-round pick out of Ohio State for the Jets in 2006. He spent his entire NFL career with team, earning seven trips to the Pro Bowl and was an All-Pro twice before he retired in 2016. During that time, the center anchored an offensive line alongside D’Brickashaw Ferguson that helped the Jets reach two AFC championship games. He is currently a nominee for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Mangold’s toughness was widely admired and he missed only four games in his first 10 seasons in the NFL.</p> <p>“Nick was more than a legendary center,” Jets owner Woody Johnson said in a statement. “He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick’s wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.”</p> <p>Mangold was a huge favorite with fans, known for his long hair, beard, charitable work and outgoing personality. He was active on social media and was rarely seen without his backwards baseball cap. He was a regular visitor to Jets game after his retirement – he chugged a beer while being inducted into the team’s Ring of Honor in 2022 – and stayed in the area when his playing days were over, becoming an assistant coach for Delbarton High School in Morristown, New Jersey.</p> <p>“You get to mold boys into men and teach the game of football, but also teach them a little bit about life as you go along,” Mangold told the New York Post in 2024.</p> <p>Rex Ryan, who coached Mangold at the Jets, was in tears as he remembered his former player on ESPN’s Sunday NFL Countdown. “It’s brutal,” Ryan said. “Such a great young man. I had the pleasure of coaching him for all six years with the Jets [from 2009 to 2014]. I remember it was obvious I was getting fired, my last game, Mangold’s injured – like, injured – and he comes to me and says, ‘I’m playing this game.’ And he wanted to play for me.”</p> <p>Hall of fame cornerback Darrelle Revis, who was Mangold’s teammate for eight years, paid tribute on X. “I was fortunate to have the opportunity to lace them up with you every Sunday,” Revis wrote. “I will miss you and forever cherish our moments in the locker room. Love you buddy.”</p> <p>Mangold was married to his childhood sweetheart, Jenny, with whom he had four children, Matthew, Eloise, Thomas, and Charlotte. His sister, Holley, represented USA at the 2012 Olympics in weightlifting.</p> <p>When he announced his illness he paid tribute to his family, saying they had “been my rock every step of the way. This situation has reminded me how lucky I am to have such an amazing family, friends, and community behind me.”</p>
