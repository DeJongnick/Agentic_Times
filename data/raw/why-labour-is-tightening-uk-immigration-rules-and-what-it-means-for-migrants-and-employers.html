<p>After months of mounting pressure in the UK amid record net migration figures and anxiety over the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform party, the Labour government is setting out its plan to overhaul Britain’s immigration system.</p> <p>The long-anticipated draft policy package lays the groundwork for a significant shift: not only curbing irregular migration but tightening legal routes into the UK too.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/11/labours-immigration-shake-up-challenges-decades-of-party-policy">Labour’s immigration shake-up challenges decades of party policy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Framed as a “clean break” from a system seen as over-reliant on low-paid overseas labour, the plan includes longer settlement timelines, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/11/english-test-among-range-of-labour-measures-to-control-immigration">higher English-language</a> thresholds, and a direct challenge to employers who depend on migration to fill lower-paid jobs.</p> <p>There are no high-drama stunts like the previous Conservative government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/22/failed-rwanda-deportation-scheme-cost-700m-says-yvette-cooper">Rwanda scheme</a> – but the proposals mark a departure from the more open migration model some Labour MPs still defend as fair and economically necessary.</p> <p>The prime minister, Keir Starmer, has called the package a move towards a “controlled, selective and fair” system. But with Reform UK ascendant, the Conservatives struggling to reassert themselves in opposition, and Labour MPs divided, the question remains: will it work – and for whom?</p>  <h2>What exactly is Labour doing and why now?</h2>  <p>The message from Downing Street is that immigration must “reward contribution” – economically, through work and skills, and socially, through integration and language.</p> <p>Key measures include:</p> <ul> <li><p>A new 10-year settlement route, replacing the five-year norm – with fast-track options for workers in sectors like health, AI, and engineering.</p></li> <li><p>A contributions-based model rewarding economic value and civic participation.</p></li> <li><p>Stricter English requirements, extended to all adult dependants – including spouses.</p></li> <li><p>Cuts to legal migration routes, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/11/labour-axing-care-worker-visa-will-put-services-at-risk-say-unions-and-care-leaders">visas for overseas care workers</a>, student dependents and lower-paid roles not deemed “strategic”.</p></li> <li><p>A digital immigration status system to monitor overstaying and support enforcement.</p></li> </ul> <p>Officials say the changes will reduce migration “further and faster” than past efforts, though internal forecasts suggest annual falls of 50,000-70,000.</p> <h2>A new migration model – or just a new message?</h2>  <p>Labour says it is ending the “free-market migration model” that let employers drive overseas recruitment. Visas will be tied to domestic workforce plans, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/11/uk-to-time-limit-visas-for-roles-below-graduate-level-under-new-migration-plan">firms must show investment in UK workers before hiring abroad</a>.</p> <p>Deportation of foreign offenders has already increased, with ministers now seeking to remove those convicted of any offence, not just serious crimes.</p> <p>The English-language rules go further than expected. For the first time, adult dependants – including spouses – must meet basic language standards before arrival, which ministers say will support integration and reduce exploitation.</p> <p>But the government’s policy paper includes no plans for new safe routes or refugee protections. Ministers argue the UK already offers multiple legal pathways and that further routes are not needed. That position has drawn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/09/labour-asylum-seekers-policy-reform-voters-refugees-government">criticism from refugee advocates</a> and some Labour MPs concerned about fairness and international obligations.</p> <h2>Inside Labour: divided over tone, not just policy</h2>  <p>The strategy has sharpened Labour’s longstanding divide between control and compassion. Starmer and the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, have taken a data-led, enforcement-focused approach. But some MPs – particularly in diverse urban seats – are uneasy about the political and social costs.</p> <p>There are concerns that reducing family and student visas may alienate core Labour voters and strain sectors like care – with the trade union Unison and charity Care England warning that cutting off overseas recruitment risks deepening the staffing crisis.</p> <p>Meanwhile, MPs in marginal and post-industrial seats have urged the leadership to go further. With Reform UK rising in the polls, some believe Labour must deliver results – not just rhetoric – to hold public confidence.</p> <h2>The Tory counter-strategy and Farage’s triumph</h2>  <p>Labour’s plan comes days after the Conservatives launched their own immigration bill. The proposals include powers to disapply the Human Rights Act in asylum cases, impose an annual visa cap and introduce scientific age testing for claimants.</p> <p>They have been met with scepticism – even from Tory-aligned voices. One former adviser called the bill “a grab-bag of recycled slogans”. Another said: “It makes no difference if you can’t deport anyone.”</p> <p>Despite its tone, the Conservative package lacks a workable solution for removals or asylum backlogs – problems that damaged the party in government and persist today.</p> <p>Nigel Farage, whose Reform UK party now outpolls the Conservatives, was quick to take credit. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: “We’ve seen the Home Office admit they think net migration will still be running at over half a million by 2028. This Tory announcement merely tinkers around the edges. It’s not just about what numbers come in, but who comes in and whether they can assimilate.”</p> <h2>A reset or a political risk?</h2>  <p>Labour is betting this plan will rebuild public trust – not through theatrics, but results. Ministers hope to show that immigration can be controlled fairly, and that high-skilled migration can be welcomed without depressing wages or undermining cohesion.</p> <p>But the risks are real. Public services still rely on migration. The shift to a 10-year settlement model could unsettle families already in the UK. And the refusal to expand refugee pathways may test Labour’s promise to match control with compassion.</p> <p>After years of failed pledges and political spectacle, Starmer is offering something slower and more serious. But with Reform rising, the Tories regrouping, and public expectations high, the real test of Labour’s immigration agenda starts now.</p>
