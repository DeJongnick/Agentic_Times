<h1>The Guardian view on Scottish politics: Labour wins the seat but not – yet – the argument</h1>

<p>Labour’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/06/next-scottish-elections-will-be-between-snp-and-labour-says-anas-sarwar">victory</a> in the Holyrood byelection offers the UK government a rare political comfort but not, perhaps, the strategic breakthrough it might like to imagine. A late flurry of welfare signalling, a dogged ground campaign and a carefully staged visit to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/02/keir-starmer-defence-review-launch-comment">Govan shipyard</a> by Sir Keir Starmer helped shore up Labour’s appeal to its traditional voters in Scotland’s industrial belt. Yet as Prof John Curtice has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/john-curtice-hamilton-by-election-labour-bs3z30tjb">noted</a>, Labour’s share of the vote actually declined&nbsp;compared&nbsp;with the last time voters cast ballots here in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Larkhall_and_Stonehouse_(Scottish_Parliament_constituency)">2021</a> – a year in which the party was placed a distant third and was polling at the same dismal level of&nbsp;public support, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_Scottish_Parliament_election">20%</a>, it has today.</p> <p>The prime minister will gladly pocket Davy&nbsp;Russell’s&nbsp;win in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/06/scottish-labour-win-pivotal-holyrood-byelection-beating-incumbent-snp-and-surging-reform-uk">Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse</a>. But it is a foothold. There is still a steep climb to the summit. More telling is who lost. The Scottish National&nbsp;party’s poor showing reflects dissatisfaction with its record of governance and the diminishing appeal&nbsp;of <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/john-swinney-says-scottish-independence-114730108.html">independence</a> in areas where Labour has deep roots. The real surprise was Reform UK, taking over a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/scottish-labour-win-hamilton-larkhall-and-stonehouse-by-election-13379805">quarter</a> of the vote and leapfrogging the Conservatives into third place. It drew from both main&nbsp;parties, fuelled by protest and unionist anger that&nbsp;flattened the Tories.</p> <p>If these trends continue, the Holyrood elections, scheduled for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Scottish_Parliament_election">next year</a>, will not be good news for anyone but Reform despite the party losing its chair&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/05/the-departure-of-reform-chair-zia-yusuf-is-the-latest-in-a-long-line-of-farage-fallings-out">Zia Yusuf</a> this week. Labour is not yet credible&nbsp;as a government-in-waiting at Holyrood. But for the SNP the crisis is more acute. If its vote remains around 30% and opposition is split at the next election, the SNP would probably remain the&nbsp;largest party, but would be unlikely to bestride&nbsp;the Scottish parliament. The pro‑independence movement would be institutionally endangered, not by Westminster suppression, but by electoral mathematics.</p> <p>Scottish politicians have long held the belief that Nigel Farage has less sway in a <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/scotland/2025/05/scotland-has-not-turned-against-immigration">pro-EU, pro‑immigration</a> nation. That is now harder to sustain. On the campaign trail, Mr Farage defended&nbsp;a race‑baiting Reform advert that twisted&nbsp;Scottish Labour leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/29/nigel-farage-anas-sarwar-obsessed-race-hamilton-byelection">Anas Sarwar’s words</a> to suggest he had divided loyalties – a textbook use of identity politics to inflame division and resentment. It was a toxic, racist and dishonest dog‑whistle but that did not stop Reform’s rise.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.holyrood.com/news/view,snp-only-party-russell-findlay-rules-out-of-postelection-deal">Tories</a> face an existential crisis. In 2021 they became the official opposition as the strongest <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-57028315">anti‑SNP, pro-unionist</a> option, a strategy that paid off on the regional list. But if <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj42gver2glo">Reform</a> keeps eating into that base, Thursday’s result suggests the Conservatives could ignominiously fall behind not just Reform, but also the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly1gdn1gg7o">Lib Dems</a> and <a href="https://bright-green.org/2025/05/14/who-are-the-candidates-in-the-next-scottish-green-party-leadership-election-be/">Greens</a>. With&nbsp;the constitutional question fading and Holyrood designed to favour horse-trading, 2026 looks like yielding a more divided chamber. Coalitions –&nbsp;Labour with the Lib Dems, or even across the divide – could yet emerge to focus on bread-and-butter issues and govern without Reform. Labour won the seat, not the argument. The SNP may still top the poll in 2026 – but as a weaker force in a far less predictable landscape.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
