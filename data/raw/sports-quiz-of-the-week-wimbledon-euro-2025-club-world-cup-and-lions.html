    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:C - Four hours and 39 minutes after kick-off. Chelsea were 1-0 up when the game was stopped in the 85th minute after a lightning strike in the area. The teams were ordered off the pitch and could not return for nearly two hours., 2:B - "It’s very difficult," said the 18-year-old. "I’m trying to focus as much as possible, and leave well, through the front door, knowing that I gave my best for Palmeiras.", 3:B - The stadium, which will also host the World Cup final next year, is based in New Jersey but is home to two teams from New York., 4:B - The 21-year-old, who started the tournament as the world No 733, studies at the University of San Diego so can only claim $10,000 per year in prize money. He can spend the rest on expenses, so his team will be expecting a few upgrades and big nights out before the end of the year. , 5:C - The Frenchman broke the previous record by 5mph. He lost the match though. , 6:B - Gemma Grainger, a 42-year-old from Middlesbrough, took over as Norway’s manager 18 months ago. Her team started the tournament well, beating hosts Switzerland 2-1 in their first group match., 7:A - Norway (twice), Sweden, Netherlands and England have also lifted the trophy., 8:D - England beat Germany 2-1 after extra time. Ella Toone scoored England's other goal in the match., 9:B - Cameroon were six points up with less than a minute to play when Amadou Seini received the ball from a teammate. Rather than dribble or pass to a teammate, he dunked it into his own basket. His team went on to lose the game., 10:D - The race will hit the road again in 2026 (Spain) and 2027 (Scotland)., 11:D - Tadej Pogacar in 2020, 2021 and 2024, and Jonas Vingegaard in 2022 and 2023. , 12:A - Dom Sibley made a career-best 305 against Durham, thumping 29 fours and two sixes in a marathon 475-ball innings. The match finished as a draw., 13:C - Steve Bruce is the manager; Steve Agnew is his assistant; Stephen Dobbie and Stephen Clemence coach the first team; and Steve Banks is the goalkeeping coach. , 14:A - The squad has more players born in New Zealand, Australia and South Africa than born in Wales., 15:D - The two teams were refused visas to the other's countries in the 1960s due to the cold war so they had to call off the game. However, 65 years later, they are making amends. Glenavon expect to welcome 1,000 fans from Germany on Saturday, including 300 members of the Erzgebirge Aue motorbike supporters’ club., 16:B - The British Grand Prix in 1950 was the first race of the first F1 season. Three venues have hosted the event over the years: Silverstone, Aintree and Brands Hatch. </p>
