<p>Keir Starmer has appointed the outspoken founder of Octopus Energy as an adviser, with a remit to challenge government thinking.</p> <p>Greg Jackson has joined the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/cabinet-office/about/our-governance">Cabinet Office board</a>, an influential core of government advisers, as a non-executive member. </p> <p>The announcement comes weeks after ministers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jul/10/uk-government-abandons-energy-zonal-pricing-plan#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20abandoned%20plans,affordable%2C%20secure%20and%20efficient%E2%80%9D.">ruled out his plan</a> to split the national energy market into regional zones, which would have meant users in different areas would pay different rates for their electricity.</p> <p>The tech entrepreneur, who has long had links to the Labour party, responded to that decision by saying he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jul/10/uk-government-abandons-energy-zonal-pricing-plan#:~:text=The%20government%20has%20abandoned%20plans,affordable%2C%20secure%20and%20efficient%E2%80%9D.">“respectfully disagree”</a>.</p> <p>Jackson failed to win over ministers after a long and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/oct/07/ive-fallen-out-with-people-the-bruising-debate-over-uk-zonal-energy-pricing">controversial campaign</a>, in part because zonal pricing would have meant higher energy prices in the south-east of England and lower prices in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland">Scotland</a>.</p> <p>He claimed that electricity prices that reflected local supply and demand dynamics would encourage heavy electricity users to relocate to areas that have more renewable energy generation such as Scotland and encourage renewables developers to base their projects closer to where their energy was needed.</p> <p>Jackson is now expected to play an influential role in shaping how future government policies are implemented. His non-executive role is one of a number that are understood to have been introduced to bring in expertise from outside government to help civil servants gain a strategic perspective on policy decisions.</p> <p>Jackson is expected to use his three-year term on the Cabinet Office board to push the government to modernise. The tech founder, who set up Octopus in 2015, has won respect in Westminster after building the energy supplier’s global reach to secure a valuation of £9bn for the company in less than a decade.</p> <p>He has maintained strong links in the government after previously serving as head of the pressure group Labour List. He met the new Labour government alongside Octopus colleagues 10 times in the 12 weeks after the election, according to official records first reported by Politico.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: “Having been brought up with a sense of civic duty, I’m really proud to have the chance to contribute to public service. Finding ways to improve services without spending more is key to public services, the economy and our society, and if through business I’ve learned lessons on technology, delivery and organisation that can be useful to government, it’s an honour to share those.”</p>
