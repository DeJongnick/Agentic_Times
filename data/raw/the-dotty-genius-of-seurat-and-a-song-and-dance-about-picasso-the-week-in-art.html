There is nothing more solid than a rock. Yet Seurat reveals that when we look at the world, the colours we mix in our minds have no fixed form at all. He divides perception into many little dots of colour. This “pointillist” method is so all-embracing, you realise you are gazing at an infinitely fractured, molten galaxy of light. Look at the inner face of the cliff, made up of many colours that together we see as violet. The flecks of emerald grass are just as packed with complexity. This painting returns you to life with a new sense of wonder.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/georges-seurat-le-bec-du-hoc-grandcamp">National Gallery, London</a> (on long term loan from Tate), and currently in the exhibition <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/10/radical-harmony-review-georges-seurat-national-gallery">Radical Harmony</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in Touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
