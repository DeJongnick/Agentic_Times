But developing countries have warned that they cannot afford Belem’s accommodation prices, which have soared amid a shortage of rooms.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/03/amazon-love-motels-cop30-summit">Brazil’s Amazon love motels ditch erotic decor to host Cop30 climate summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Media organisations and civil society groups have also said they will have to reduce or abandon their coverage of the conference due to the costs of accommodation.</p> <p>Organisers have been <a href="https://theclimatewatch.com/cop30-host-city-faces-housing-crisis-threatening-inclusivity/">warned they risk hosting “the least inclusive Cop ever”</a> if solutions to the accommodation crisis are not found.</p> <p>At a meeting of countries’ representatives and UN officials last month, the UN asked Brazil to subsidise hotel prices to ensure rooms for $100 a day for delegates from the world’s poorest countries and $400-$500 a day for other countries, according to an official summary of that meeting.</p> <p>Miriam Belchior, executive secretary to Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva’s chief of staff, told journalists after the meeting that Brazil was already bearing significant costs for hosting Cop30 and could not provide further subsidies. </p> <p>Countries’ representatives and UN officials are due to meet again this week to discuss the accommodation situation for Cop30.</p>
