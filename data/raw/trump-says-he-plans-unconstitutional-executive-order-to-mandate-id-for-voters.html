<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has said he will issue an executive order to mandate identification for all US elections, a move likely to be challenged in court as unconstitutional.</p> <p>“Voter I.D. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!!,” the US president said on Truth Social late on Saturday.</p> <p>Trump also claimed he wants to ban all voting by mail except for those who are very ill or in military service.</p> <p>The US constitution <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-says-he-plans-to-issue-unconstitutional-order-requiring-voter-id-and-banning-mail-ballots/">grants</a> primary authority to regulate elections to the US states, while empowering Congress to enact election laws or regulations. It gives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/08/31/us/trump-news">no explicit authority</a> to the president to regulate voting.</p> <p>The voting reform push by Trump stems from baseless claims that the 2020 election he lost was stolen from him. Earlier this month, Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-mail-in-ballots-voting-machines-2016-midterms">falsely claimed</a> only the US uses mail-in voting. Dozens of countries <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-trumps-claim-the-u-s-is-the-only-country-that-uses-mail-in-voting">permit</a> at least some form of mail-in voting.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/trump-congress-midterm-elections">‘He’s trying to rig the midterms’: Trump intervenes to protect his allies in Congress</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/19/903886567/trump-while-attacking-mail-voting-casts-mail-ballot-again">himself has cast</a> election ballots by mail. In the 2024 elections, 14 states and Washington DC had voter turnout by mail exceeding 30%, with Trump winning half of those states, including Utah, which had <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hurdle-banning-mail-voting-republican-party-rcna227256">91.5% vote</a> by mail turnout and whose elections are overseen by Republicans.</p> <p>Some <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id">36 US states</a> have laws requesting or requiring voters to show identification at the polls, with the remaining states and DC using other forms of identity verification. Voter fraud is incredibly rare and voter ID laws have been <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21565503.2020.1773280">shown</a> to disproportionately impact minorities, low-income individuals and disabled voters.</p> <p>“As many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have the kind of ID that is required by states with strict ID requirements, and that percentage is even higher among seniors, minorities, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students,” the Brennan Center for Justice <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/voter-id">states</a>.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/24/trump-proof-citizenship-vote-blocked">previous attempt</a> by Trump to require proof of citizenship to vote was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/trump-citizenship-executive-order-voting">blocked</a> by a federal judge in June 2025, as the law risked disenfranchising millions of Americans who don’t have passports, may not have easy access to birth certificates, and millions of married women with name changes may not have citizenship documents with their current legal name.</p> <p>Enforcement would likely <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-executive-order-on-elections-aims-to-dictate-how-states-run-elections-and-handpicks-which-citizens-can-vote/">affect</a> tens of millions of Americans every election cycle who vote for the first time or update their voter registration information. Some <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/trumps-executive-order-on-elections-aims-to-dictate-how-states-run-elections-and-handpicks-which-citizens-can-vote/">146 million</a> American citizens do not have a US passport.</p>
