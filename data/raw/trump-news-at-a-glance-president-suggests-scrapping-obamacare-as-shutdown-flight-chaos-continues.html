<p>Donald Trump on Saturday urged Republican senators to redirect federal money used to subsidize health insurance costs under the Affordable Care Act toward direct payments to individuals, in an effort to overcome an issue at the heart of the US government shutdown.</p> <p>“I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,” Trump wrote in a social media post.</p> <p>His comments came as US senators met on the 39th day of the shutdown and seemed to begin negotiating in earnest. As Saturday’s session got under way, senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Rick Scott of Florida and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana welcomed the proposal from Trump – but the Republicans seemed unable to grapple with the fact that consumers would still need to buy plans from the same insurance companies, or that Republican lawmakers need the support of eight Democrats to reopen the government, and the idea of repealing and replacing Obamacare with savings accounts is unlikely to earn a single Democratic vote.</p>  <h2>Nearly 1,500 flights canceled on second day of cuts tied to government shutdown</h2>  <p>US airlines canceled 1,460 flights on day 2 of the government-mandated flight cuts.</p> <p>So far, the slowdown at many of the nation’s busiest airports hasn’t caused widespread disruptions. But it has deepened the impact felt by what is now the US’s longest federal shutdown.</p> <p>Analysts warn that the upheaval will intensify and be felt far beyond air travel if the cancellations pick up and move closer to the Thanksgiving holiday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/flight-cancellations-government-shutdown"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Senate Republicans embrace Trump’s call – from his Florida golf course – to replace Obamacare</h2>  <p>US senators are working through the weekend for the first time since the government shutdown began more than a month ago, but hopes for a bipartisan agreement on how to end the standoff, and keep healthcare affordable for millions of Americans, appeared to recede as Republican senators floated a proposal toxic to Democrats: scrapping the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/senate-republicans-trump-obamacare"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump reportedly wants new NFL stadium in Washington named after him</h2>  <p>Donald Trump is pressing the NFL’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/washington-commanders">Washington Commanders</a> to name their planned $3.7bn stadium after him, a bid he is pursuing through back-channel conversations with ownership and by leaning on the government bodies that must approve the project, according to several sources familiar with the discussions.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/08/trump-name-washington-commanders-stadium"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Businesses worldwide brace for extra Trump tariffs on steel imports</h2>  <p>Businesses around the world are steeling themselves for another round of Donald Trump’s tariffs, this time on goods ranging from bicycles to baking trays, as US industry embraces a call for more products to tax on import.</p> <p>Small, medium and large American companies have asked the US Department of Commerce to add about 700 more items to an August list of 407 products already facing extra tariffs because of their steel content, which hit items such as Ikea tables with metal nuts and bolts and German combine harvesters.</p> <p>The demands are ringing alarm bells across Europe where industry leaders are fearful of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/28/eu-industry-fears-ever-expanding-list-of-derivative-goods-subject-to-steel-tariffs">rolling and growing list of “steel derivatives”</a> that will now face levies because they contain the metal.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/businesses-worldwide-brace-extra-trump-tariffs-steel-imports"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>What else happened today:</h2>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Olivia Rodrigo has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/nov/08/olivia-rodrigo-trump-video">criticized the Trump administration</a> after one of her songs was featured in a clip</strong> posted on the official Department of Homeland Security and White House Instagram accounts, encouraging undocumented immigrants to voluntarily leave the US.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The secretary of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Kristi Noem, reportedly authorized the purchase of Spirit Airlines jets</strong> before discovering the airline didn’t actually own the planes – and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/08/kristi-noem-spirit-airlines-planes">that the aircraft lacked engines</a>.</p></li> </ul>  <p>Catching up?<em> Here’s what happened <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/07/trump-administration-news-updates-today">7 November 2025</a></strong>.</em></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="alt">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
