  <p>This is what PA Media has filed from the Covid inquiry hearing this afternoon.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>England’s hospitals were within “hours” of running out of some items of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the early months of Covid, Matt <em>Hancock</em> has said.</p> 
   <p>The former health secretary told the Covid inquiry some PPE was in very short supply during the first wave of the pandemic.</p> 
   <p>He also said he believes vaccines should be mandatory for NHS and social care staff in any future pandemic, while masks should be worn in hospitals from day one.</p> 
   <p>Lead counsel to the inquiry, <strong>Jacqueline Carey KC</strong>, asked <em>Hancock</em>: “Do you accept that entering the coronavirus pandemic as we did, without a single gown, severely hampered the ability to provide safe and appropriate PPE for healthcare workers?”</p> 
   <p><em><strong>Hancock</strong></em> replied: “The stockpile that we had was not as good as it needs to be in the future, absolutely.”</p> 
   <p>Asked if England ever ran out of PPE, he said: “As a whole? No, but individual locations did.</p> 
   <p>“We came extremely close. We came within small numbers of items on a regular basis during April and May 2020 – by the second wave, we were in better shape.”</p> 
   <p>Asked about no more stock of gowns in April 2020, he said: “Gowns I think at one point we got to within six or seven hours of running out.</p> 
   <p>“We were working incredibly hard to make sure that we didn’t (run out). We nearly did.”</p> 
   <p>On the question of whether facemasks should be worn by hospital staff, visitors and workers in a future pandemic, he said: “It should be brought in immediately, and supplies need to be ready, preferably in each hospital, to make that possible.”</p> 
   <p>Furthermore, <em>Hancock</em> said, ensuring health and social care workers are fully vaccinated is a “reasonable step that should be expected” and should be brought in to the NHS and social care at the same time.</p> 
   <p>Vaccination as a condition of deployment came into effect in November 2021 and required Care Quality Commission-registered care home staff to be fully vaccinated in order to be deployed in care homes unless medically exempt from April 2022.</p> 
   <p><em>Hancock</em> said he regretted that decision as social care and the NHS should have had the rule at the same time, adding: “If you are employed to care for others, then you should take reasonable steps to ensure you are not harming those in your care.</p> 
   <p>“A clinically proven vaccine is a reasonable step that should be expected.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>King Charles</strong> has paid tribute to John Prescott. It is unusual for the monarch to issue a statement after the death of a politician, and this is a sign quite what an impact Prescott made during his long career. The king said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I am deeply saddened to learn of the death of Lord Prescott. I remember with great fondness his unique and indomitable character, as well as his infectious sense of humour.</p> 
   <p>My thoughts and greatest sympathy are with Lord Prescott’s wife, family and loved ones at such a difficult time, and I am sure that very many people will recognise and greatly appreciate Lord Prescott’s decades of public service in front line politics, not least as the United Kingdom’s longest serving deputy prime minister.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Swinney says he does not want Stephen Flynn 'double jobbing' row to become distraction for SNP</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The ongoing row about the prospect of SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn “double jobbing” risks becoming a distraction for the party, first minister <strong>John Swinney</strong> has warned.</p> 
  <p>Flynn has faced a furious backlash amongst MSPs after he announced that he was planning to stand for the Holyrood seat of Aberdeen South and North Kincardine, currently held by his SNP colleague Audrey Nicoll, in the 2026 Holyrood elections. Flynn also confirmed he would aim to hold his Westminster seat until the next general election, due in 2029, but would not accept two salaries.</p> 
  <p>The SNP has previously been highly critical of previous Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross for holding seats in both parliaments, and Flynn’s colleagues are privately angry at the implication that a Holyrood position does not amount to a full-time job, as well as what many see as the high-handed way he’s attempting to oust a respected female colleague.</p> 
  <p>Asked about the escalating conflict after FMQs, Swinney said that Flynn was a “great star” but added: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What I want to make sure is that the SNP is in no way distracted by internal issues. It’s been a mantra of mine that I want us to look outwards not inwards.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>At the last Scottish parliament election, the SNP’s national executive committee made a ruling that any MP standing for Holyrood would have to resign their Westminster seat. The NEC has until next spring to decide its candidates’ rules, so this row could go on and on. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Pluralism campaigner Neal Lawson avoids expulson from Labour after 17-month probe into tweet backing tactical voting</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Neal Lawson</strong>, a prominent Labour activist, has been told that he won’t be expelled from the party over a tweet that backed tactical voting.</p> 
  <p>Lawson is director of Compass, a leftwing group that campaigns for more pluralism in progressive politics. He has been cleared by Labour after a 17-month investigation into something he retweeted in May 2021, from the Lib Dem MP Layla Moran <a href="https://www.compassonline.org.uk/a-letter-to-compass-members-and-supporters-from-our-board/">urging people to vote Green</a> in a council ward where the Lib Dems weren’t standing. Moran said pointed out that she had only won her parliamentary seat in 2017 as a result of the Greens standing aside.</p> 
  <p>In a comment Lawson described this as “proper grown up progressive politics” from both Moran and the Greens. But Labour launched an investigation on the basis that he may have broken rules saying members should not support rival parties.</p> 
  <p>The decision to launch disciplinary action against Lawson was seen by many in the party as an example of excessive control freakery. Even Keir Starmer was said to be surprised by the move. Under Starmer many leftwing Corbynites have been ruthlessly thrown out of the party, or blocked from standing as candidates, but Lawson is not part of that faction.</p> 
  <p>At the time Lawson wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/30/labour-expelling-mp-activist-neal-lawson">an article for the Guardian</a> saying he hoped “Labour’s persecutors and witchfinders” would fail and that “pluralism, that ugly but powerful word, is the force that will shape anything that is progressive”.</p> 
  <p>Today, in a news release, <strong>Compass</strong> said Lawson has been told he did not break party rules. The organisation said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Compass has long argued for tactical voting, closer cooperation between progressive parties and for a voting system that better reflects the latent progressive majority in this country. </p> 
   <p>At the last election, Labour showed it also recognised the importance of tactical campaigning by ruthlessly targeting its resources in seats it could win and actively discouraging campaigning elsewhere. Thus they were inviting voters to do exactly what Mr Lawson was advocating - supporting the best placed progressive to win. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>A Compass spokesperson said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We welcome this decision and hope Labour can begin to recognise what Compass has been arguing for years: that no single faction or party can navigate the chaos of the 21st century alone.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Labour must be an open tribe if it has any chance of tackling the turbulent challenges of the 21st century - if it fails, the far right is waiting in the wings.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Supporters of assisted dying should abandon vote next week, and push for government review instead, Ed Balls suggests</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Supporters of assisted dying should give up trying to get Kim Leadbeater’s private member’s bill through the Commons, and instead get the government to commission a proper review into how legislation should work, <strong>Ed Balls</strong>, the former Labour cabinet minister has suggested.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on his <a href="https://linktr.ee/politicalcurrency">Political Currency podcast</a>, Balls said legislation this significant should be introduced by the government, following proper consultation.</p> 
  <p>MPs are due to vote on the bill at second reading a week tomorrow. Increasingly it looks as if the Commons will vote against. Even if it passes,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/18/keir-starmer-china-xi-jinping-g20-ukraine-latest-live-news?page=with:block-673b21df8f087f677a134945#block-673b21df8f087f677a134945"> experts say</a> it will never become law unless ministers allocate extra time for it – which so far they have declined to promise.</p> 
  <p>Explaining his stance, Balls said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I would vote against this bill if I was in parliament now at the second reading, but not because I’m opposed to action on assisted dying at all. </p> 
   <p>But I don’t think parliament can cross the massive threshold of conceding the principle that it is acceptable for doctors and the courts to cooperate in the taking of somebody’s life – unless you are absolutely sure you know how it will work in practice, legally, and in terms of resources and in terms of the difficult cases. And I just don’t feel that that’s where we are. There isn’t yet enough solidity, and the government has to kind of engage in this more. </p> 
   <p>What should happen is after the opening speeches, there should be a statement in the house or publicly or from Downing Street to say ‘We think Kim Leadbeater has done a brilliant job of raising this issue, we don’t think yet we’ve got to a place where we can see a way forward. What the government is now going to do is start some kind of review process.’ </p> 
   <p>Could be a Royal Commission, could be judge-led, it could be a small panel expert-led to report with a fixed date, next year. </p> 
   <p>At that point, Kim Leadbeater says, ‘Look, you know, I’ve got as far as I can with this bill.’ She withdraws, the bill drops, the private members bill. We have that process, and then we come back, if it can be made to work with government legislation next year. That is the best way, and I think it may be the only way. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>George Osborne</strong>, who co-hosts the podcast with Balls, said that he was now in favour of assisted dying, having been opposed in the past, but that he also did not think Leadbeater bill would become law.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Minister says leasehold reform will take longer than expected because 'serious flaws' in Michael Gove's bill need to be fixed</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The government has indicated that its proposed new law “to bring the feudal leasehold system to an end” will take longer than expected.</p> 
  <p>The last government proposed leasehold reform, but it was accused of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/mar/24/tories-ditching-manifesto-pledge-remove-ground-rents">watering down its original plans</a> and, by the time the election was called, its leasehold and freehold reform bill had not cleared parliament. A very basic version was rushed through parliament just before the dissolution.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6697f5c10808eaf43b50d18e/The_King_s_Speech_2024_background_briefing_notes.pdf">the king’s speech</a> the government promised to publish a new, more extensive draft leasehold and commonhold reform bill that would implement Law Commission reform proposals that had been dropped by the Tories. The government said it wanted “to bring the feudal leasehold system to an end, reinvigorating commonhold through a comprehensive new legal framework and banning the sale of new leasehold flats so commonhold becomes the default tenure.”</p> 
  <p>But today, in <a href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-statements/detail/2024-11-21/hcws244">a written ministerial statement</a>, <strong>Matthew Pennycook</strong>, the housing minister said the draft bill is not expected to be published until the second half of 2025.</p> 
  <p>He said the process was more complicated than expected because he had been told that the Tory act, which was pushed through parliament by Michael Gove, contained “a small number of specific but serious flaws” that would have to be fixed by primary legislation.</p> 
  <p>Pennycook went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>These serious flaws include a loophole which mean the act goes far beyond the intended reforms to valuation and that undermines the integrity of the amended scheme. In addition we must correct an omission that would deny tens of thousands of shared ownership leaseholders the right to extend their lease with their direct landlord given that the providers in question do not have sufficiently long leases to grant 990-year extensions.</p> 
   <p>This government will not make the same mistakes as the last when it comes to reforming what is, without question, an incredibly complicated area of property law. While we intend to continue to work at pace, we will take the time necessary to ensure the reforms we pass are fit for purpose.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Pennycook also said a white paper on commonhold reform would be published early next year.</p>

  <p>In Birmingham, MP <strong>Jess Phillips</strong> and former West Midlands mayor <strong>Andy Street</strong> are among those who have gathered to pay tribute to the victims of the 1974 pub bombings in the city, on the 50th anniversary of the atrocity in which 21 were killed and 220 injured.</p> 
  <p>Survivors and families of the victims have today <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/nov/21/pm-must-prioritise-birmingham-pub-bombings-inquiry-say-victims-families">renewed their calls for a public inquiry</a> into why no one has been brought to justice for the attacks, with Street saying he “deeply regrets that the previous government didn’t get to award it”. He told the BBC:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Twenty-one people lost their lives and we still to this day do not know exactly what happened and who the perpetrators were.

  <p>Following a one-minute silence at the memorial service outside New Street station, <strong>Phillips</strong> read out the names of the deceased and the Duchess of Edinburgh read out a message on behalf of King Charles.</p>

   <p>My wife and I would like to take this opportunity to say that you and all those affected by this dreadful attack remain very much in our thoughts.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>During evidence this morning Hancock was challenged when he claimed that the NHS was not overwhelmed during the pandemic.</p> 
  <p><strong>Jacqueline Carey KC</strong> , counsel for the inquiry, put it to Hancock: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The fact that the nurses are being stretched to the ratios that we’ve looked at and the potential adverse consequences for those who are in ICU does not in fact demonstrate the NHS was, in fact, overwhelmed.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>And <strong>Hancock</strong> replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>No, because people could get treatment. The treatment was not as good as in the same way that the waiting times for a knee operation was not as good as pre-pandemic.</p> 
   <p>I’m not saying that the NHS was perfect in the pandemic, and I’m not saying that it wasn’t severely pressured in many areas and that that pressure had consequences. The point of saying that it would be overwhelmed is that the system as a whole, withstood the pressure.</p>

  <p>As <strong>Martin Bagot</strong> reports in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/matt-hancock-makes-bombshell-claim-34158030">a story for the Mirror,</a> Carey pushed back at this point, saying that if people were not getting the treatment they would normally get, they would think the system was overwhelmed.

 <h2 class="block-title">Overseas territories continue to delay setting up public registers of beneficial ownership</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>David Lammy’s announcement of sanctions against kleptocrats (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/21/john-prescott-dies-labour-deputy-prime-minister-tony-blair-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-673f31888f08bad5f6053b77#block-673f31888f08bad5f6053b77">1.19pm</a>) came as crown dependencies and overseas territories (OTs) wrapped up a joint ministerial council in London at which resistance to the decade-old UK demand to set up public registers of beneficial ownership was once again raised. Public registers, by ending the secrecy surrounding the transfer of assets to tax havens, make it easier for campaigners to expose money laundering, as well as deter it taking place in the first place. The last missed deadline was for the end of 2023.</p> 
  <p>The key OTs have found a series of reasons not to implement the measure including citing a 2022 European Court of Justice ruling saying the registers breach European privacy laws. None of the OTs are inside the EU but they argue they cannot afford to have stricter declaration laws than other countries or else funds will leave their jurisdiction.. As prime minister ahead of the G8 in Northern Ireland in 2016 David Cameron first set out the UK goal of setting up registers, but a succession of deadlines have been allowed to be missed with no action taken by the government to impose registers.</p> 
  <p>The lack of the registers, as well as the presence in London of money laundering enablers, is the Achilles heel of the UK’s efforts to become an international leader in the fight against corruption.</p> 
  <p>Stephen Doughty the Foreign Office minister, has written to the OTs setting out his expectation that the registers will be set up, and has visited some of the territories to seek their cooperation.</p> 
  <p>A spokesperson for the Cayman Islands government said it was continuing to work towards an “enhanced beneficial ownership framework” by the end of 2024,.</p> 
  <p>A cross-party coalition of 40 MPs in a letter earlier this week called for ugent action against the overseas territories.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Lammy claims 'golden age of money laundering' in UK coming to end as sanctions announced against kleptocrats</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>David Lammy, the foreign secretary, claimed he was bringing the golden age of money laundering to an end when he announced <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-cracks-down-on-dirty-money-with-fresh-sanctions">sanctions against three high-profile kleptocrats and their key enablers. </a></p> 
  <p>Lammy said the tide was being turned on corruption after a long period when the previous government allowed the role of London as a money laundering capital to continue.</p> 
  <p>When Labour was in opposition Lammy stressed how much damage Britain’s role in laundering corrupt money was causing the country’s reputation in the global south, as well as the damage done to the international financial system,.</p> 
  <p>The three main designations announced today cover: Dmitry Firtash who is known to have extracted hundreds of millions of pounds from Ukraine, hiding millions in the UK property market; Isabel Dos Santos, the daughter of Angola’s former president who is accused abused her positions at state-run companies to embezzle at least £350m; and Aivars Lembergs, one of Latvia’s richest people, who abused his political position to commit bribery and launder money.</p> 
  <p>Firtash has already been sanctioned in other jurisdictions. The UK also sanctioned his wife, Lada Firtash, who has profited from his corruption and holds UK assets on his behalf, including the site of the old Brompton Road tube station, as well as Denis Gorbunenko, a UK-based financial ‘fixer’ who enabled and facilitated Firtash’s corruption. </p> 
  <p>Dos Santos was once dubbed ‘Africa’s richest woman’. She has been subject to an Interpol Red Notice since November 2022 and just last month lost a case at the court of appeal regarding her worldwide asset freeze. The UK also said it was sanctioning her business partner Paula Oliveira, and her chief financial officer Sarju Raikundalia. The Foreign Office said both had helped Dos Santos funnel Angola’s national wealth for her own benefit. It is not known how many assets they still have in the UK.</p> 
  <p>Lammy said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>These unscrupulous individuals selfishly deprive their fellow citizens of much-needed funding for education, healthcare and infrastructure - for their own enrichment. </p> 
   <p>I committed to taking on kleptocrats and the dirty money that empowers them when I became Foreign Secretary and these sanctions mark the first step in delivering this ambition. The tide is turning. The golden age of money laundering is over. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Scottish government's budget will involve 'honest conversation' with voters, says John Swinney</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>At FMQs today the Scottish Conservative leader <strong>Russell Findlay</strong> attacked John Swinney over today’s <a href="https://audit.scot/news/transparency-needed-on-spending-risks-and-plans-for-public-services">Audit Scotland report</a> which was damning in its criticism of the Scottish government’s lack of long-term strategy over public finances. </p> 
  <p>The report also criticised the SNP’s short-term fixes, lack of transparency and warned that fundamental changes were needed to keep public services affordable.</p> 
  <p><strong>Swinney</strong> insisted that financial constraints on his budget were the result of UK Tory austerity, trotting out his favourite jibe about Findlay’s future previous support for Liz Truss, and said next month’s budget would involve “an honest conversation with the people of Scotland”. </p> 
  <p>Meanwhile the Scottish Greens’ co-leader <strong>Lorna Slater</strong> pressed Swinney on whether the budget would introduce a public health levy on alcohol and tobacco, as health campaigners lobby his government to introduce one.</p> 
  <p><strong>Swinney</strong> said he couldn’t pre-empt budget decisions, arguing the finance secretary was facing pressure from all sides with a budget under severe constraints thanks to inflation and hefty public sector pay deals.</p>

  <p><strong>John Healey</strong>, the defence secretary, has been giving evidence to the Commons defence committee this morning. But he wouldn’t confirm that Ukraine has started firing Storm Shadow missiles provided by Britain at Russia. Asked to confirm these reports, Healey said:</p>

   <p>I won’t be drawn on the operational details of the conflict. It risks both operational security and in the end the only one that benefits from such a public debate is President Putin.</p>

   <p>This is a serious moment that I come before the committee. Defence intelligence will reveal today that the front line is now less stable than at any time since the early days of the full scale Russian invasion in 2022.</p> 
   <p>We have seen in recent weeks a very clear escalation from Putin and his forces. They have stepped up attacks on the energy system in Ukraine ahead of winter, they have stepped up attacks on civilian centres killing children, they have deployed at least 10,000 North Korean troops to the battle front line.</p> 
   <p>And there are unconfirmed but media reports today of Russia firing a new ballistic missile into Ukraine which we know they have been preparing for months.</p>

  <p>The Guardian columnist <strong>Martin Kettle</strong> has sent me this anecdote, which he describes as his favourite memory of the late John Prescott. Martin says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I was at a Labour conference in Blackpool in the 90s and I bumped into him back stage in the press room and he said: “Is your fella Steve Bell here?” I said, yes, Steve was. “Well can you introduce me? He always draws me as Tony’s dog, and I’m not a fuckin’ dog.” Steve was sitting quite nearby, so I nervously made the introductions as the two big guys met up. Within a few seconds, Prescott’s threatening manner vanished and he and Steve were in stitches about some joke or other. Then, as Prescott was leaving he turned and squared up to Steve and said. “No dogs, OK?” </p> 
   <p>Of course it made absolutely no difference whatever, and Steve kept on drawing him as a dog.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Matt Hancock</strong> has told how he “ruffled some feathers” protecting the NHS from political “interference” during the Covid pandemic, PA Media reports.</p> 
  <p>Giving evidence to the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary said part of his role was to “shield” the NHS from “people being difficult in Number 10”. He said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Within the running of the NHS, we were protected in a way because of the independence of the NHS.</p> 
   <p>And therefore the people being difficult for Number 10, part of my job was to provide a shield from that.</p> 
   <p>And I know that I ruffled some feathers in doing so, but my job was, ironically, also to protect the NHS from some of that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Hancock told the inquiry that interference from Number 10 caused “incredible difficulties” with regards to testing people for Covid.</p> 
  <p>Hancock is giving evidence as part of the inquiry’s third module investigation, focusing on the impact of the pandemic on the NHS.</p> 
  <p>As PA reports, Hancock was asked by inquiry counsel Jacqueline Carey about his witness statements which suggested “inappropriate political interference from Number 10”, and whether that interference applied to the scope of these hearings. He replied: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Well, of course some of it did. For instance, the biggest interference that caused difficulties was within testing, where some of the political appointees in Number 10 caused incredible difficulties.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Hancock was almost certainly referring to Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser at the times. Earlier hearings have proviced copious evidence showing that relations between Hancock and Cummings were dire.</p> 
  <p>Earlier today Hancock also claimed that former first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, caused “all sorts of difficulties” as the pandemic unfolded.

  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> said that he condemned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/19/international-outrage-sentencing-pro-democracy-activists-hong-kong">the jailing of 45 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong</a> by the Chinese authorities during his statement in the Commons.</p> 
  <p>He was challenged to use the word condemn after Conservative MPs suggested that he was reluctant to sound too critical of China on this issue.</p> 
  <p>In her response to Starmer’s opening statement, <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> said that the activists were sentenced the day after Starmer held talks with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at the G20 summit. She said she had not heard him condemn the sentences at the time, and she challenged him so do so “unequivocally”.</p> 
  <p>In response, <strong>Starmer</strong> said “Minister West” (Catherine West, the minister for the Indo-Pacific” made a statement on this and he said he was happy “to repeat and affirm her position”.</p> 
  <p>Later <strong>Iain Duncan-Smith</strong>, one of the most China-criticial Tories and a former party leader, asked Starmer to be more explicit. <strong>Starmer</strong> replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I said I condemned it a moment ago, and I’m happy to say so. I just did and I will say it again.</p>

  <p>Here are two more tribute to John Prescott.</p> 
  <p>From the former Labour leader <strong>Neil Kinnock</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>John Prescott was an intriguing mixture of ferocity and charm who attracted affection, respect and, sometimes, outrage.</p> 
   <p>He was truly a political innovator in policies ranging from integrated transport to combating climate change and regional democratic and economic development to European co-operation.</p> 
   <p>Vitally, he was also a very practical MP and minister who continually sought the best way to ‘get things done’ whether that meant bringing divergent people together or insisting on details of implementation. This central invaluable quality made him an essential figure in 10 years as deputy prime minister.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>From <strong>John Major,</strong> the former Conservative prime minister</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>[Prescott] was an essential part of Labour’s electoral success in the 1990s and – as deputy prime minister – continued to say what he thought in unmistakable terms. He never lost sight of the causes that first motivated him into politics, and remained a passionate advocate for all he believed – even if that meant the odd tussle with colleagues along the way.</p> 
   <p>Although a political opponent, I much admired him as a man who never betrayed his core instincts. He was, in essence, a deep down genuine politician. The public saw that – and respected him for it.</p>

  <p>In his response to <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> in the Commons (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/21/john-prescott-dies-labour-deputy-prime-minister-tony-blair-uk-politics-live?page=with:block-673f138c8f083ae557dd204d#block-673f138c8f083ae557dd204d">11.27am</a>), <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> also criticised her suggestion that he should not have attended the G20 in Brazil. <strong>Badenoch</strong> did not quite say he should have stayed at home, but she said being at the G20 was probably “a lot easier” than being in London when '“hard-working farmers were protesting outside the Downing Street gates at his cruel family farm tax”. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer condemns Badenoch for abandoning cross-party consensus on climate crisis policy</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong>’s statement to MPs about the G20 and Cop29 summits largely summarised announcments made while he was at those events. <strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong>, the new Conservative leader, responded. Normally exchanges like this are relatively tame, because the main parties often broadly agree on foreign policy issues, but Badenoch was very critical of Starmer’s foreign policy positions, particularly on climate, and Starmer condemned her for breaking what had been a cross-party consensus on reducing emissions.</p> 
  <p>Referring to Cop29, Badenoch said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Cop has not yet concluded, so we do not know what the final impact on the UK will be. But we do know the prime minister’s rush to a further cut in our emissions [a reference to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/11/keir-starmer-to-unveil-ambitious-new-uk-climate-goal-cop29-ndc">this announcement</a>] is yet another example of politicians putting short term publicity above long term planning.</p> 
   <p>When will he publish the plans to achieve this new target?</p> 
   <p>Where this government does the right thing, we will back it. Yet, where it puts politics before people and press releases before practicality, we will hold them to account.</p> 
   <p>It is time for politicians to tell the truth, and it is time the prime minister provided some substance to back this costly rhetoric.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Badenoch pointed out that, by attending the G20 summit in Brazil, Starmer was out of London for the farmers’ protests. And she ended:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The prime minister’s foreign policy is a pick and mix of empty platitudes, unilateral commitments that he could have announced at home, and dangerous precedents – rushing to give away the Chagos islands and paying for the privilege, an ill-judged suspension of export licences to Israel, damaging our defence and security industry and failing to set out a roadmap for spending 2.5% GDP on defence in a world that is becoming yet more dangerous.</p> 
   <p>I hope the prime minister is up to the very real and serious challenges posed to our security and prosperity.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In response, <strong>Starmer</strong> said that Badenoch’s decision to abandon the cross-party consensus on reducing carbon emissions and the drive to net zero “shows just how far the party opposite has fallen”. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>On Cop … I have to say, it is a shame that what used to be a cross-party issue not so many years ago … when Cop was in Scotland, there was a real unity across the house about the importance of tackling one of those central issues of our time.</p> 
   <p>I think the fact that she has now taken the position she has of attacking the very idea of setting targets shows just how far the party opposite has fallen.</p> 
   <p>On an issue like this, I was proud that under some of her predecessors we had that unity. It’s a shame it’s now been lost because of the position adopted by the opposition.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Badenoch describes herself as a “net zero sceptic” and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/oct/23/labour-keir-starmer-donald-trump-us-election-uk-politics-latest-news?page=with:block-67190df48f08509e45b96642#block-67190df48f08509e45b96642">in a recent interview</a> she suggested that an adaption strategy might be a better solution to the climate crisis than just focusing on cutting carbon emissions.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Steve Reed says government wants to make farming 'more profitable'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Steve Reed</strong>, the environment secretary, has announced a plan which he said would make farming more profitable.</p> 
  <p>In his first speech since the thousands of farmers held a mass rally in Westminster on Tuesday to protest about the government’s plans to extend inheritance tax to farms, he announced a new, farmer-led 25-year roadmap for the sector.</p> 
  <p>He also said that, instead of reversing the inheritance tax changes in the budget, he would make changes to the supply chain to ensure farmers get a fair price for their produce.</p> 
  <p>Recent research has shown that farmers get about 1p from the price of a block of cheese or a loaf of bread in the supermarket, and farmers make about a 0.5% return on their investments.</p> 
  <p>Speaking at the Country Land and Business Association (CLA) conference, Reed said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m not prepared to let so many farmers keep working so hard for so little. We need to work together to agree what we want British farming to look like in 25 years time. That means a plan to transition farming to new models that are more environmentally but also more financially sustainable for the long term.</p> 
   <p>We will do this by developing a 25-year farming roadmap. This will be the most forward looking plan for farming in our country’s history, with a focus on making farming and food production more profitable in the decades to come.</p> 
   <p>It will not tell farmers what to do. It will be farmer led so they can tell the government what they need to make the success of this vital transition.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Referring to the inheritance tax row, Reed went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>One of the things farmers were telling me last Tuesday is how little profit they make. How little money for all the hard work they put into producing the food for the rest of us to enjoy.</p> 
   <p>The answer to that isn’t to tell farmers they’re not in it for the money, as I’ve heard just last week.</p> 
   <p>The answer is to make farming more profitable. The government will do precisely that. We will make the supply chain fairer so food producers and growers are not forced to accept unfair contracts.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Reed concluded:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I heard the anguish of the countryside on the streets of London earlier this week. We may not agree over the inheritance tax changes, but this government is determined to listen to rural Britain and end its long decline.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The CLA conference is the where Reed told farmers last year, when he as shadow environment secretary, that Labour was not going to extend inheritance tax to farms.</p> 
  <p><strong>Victoria Vyvyan</strong>, president of the CLA, has accused the government of “taxing us out of existence” and “embroiling” rural people in a “stupid row about numbers”.</p> 
  <p>Today, addressing Reed before he gave his speech, she said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Secretary of state, you need to act. Last year, I asked you, were you to be elected, could we in this room count on you to go into bat for us at cabinet? And you said yes, and that’s what I want to see from you.</p> 
   <p>This isn’t about party politics. It’s not about personal party alignment. This is about the fact that you are the one who’s sitting there at the cabinet, representing us, and you have to forget any differences that we might have, and you have to remember that you are our voice at the heart of government.</p>

  <p><strong>Jacqueline Carey KC</strong>, lead counsel for the inquiry, asks about a minute of a meeting he had with health ministers from the devolved governments. She shows an extract on screen.</p> 
  <p>The minutes refer to Jeane Freeman (JF), health minister in the Scottish government, asking for a reset in the relationship between the English and Scottish administrations.</p> 
  <p>Carey asks if that related to anything related to the theme of module 3 – the impact of Covid on the NHS.</p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says that was a reference to Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, “causing all sorts of difficulties”. He says that is not relevant to this module.</p>

  <p><strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the former health secretary, has now started his evidence to the Covid inquiry.</p> 
  <p>Asked if he thought the “Stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives” messaging struck the right balance, Hancock says he thinks it did.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: Do you think everything possible was done to keep healthcare workers safe?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It was obviously extremely difficult to keep healthcare workers as safe as possible, because effectively the wards of the NHS became the front line in this deadly battle.</p>

  <p><em>Q: Do you think visiting restrictions, and restrictions on people being with loved ones when they were dying, were too strict?</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We were balancing incredibly difficult considerations on both sides. I think, on balance, we got those broadly right across the pandemic. But I entirely understand and feel very, very strong arguments on both sides.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But <strong>Hancock</strong> says he thinks the guidance for funerals was applied in a stricter way than had been intended.</p> 
  <p><em>Q: Do you accept that going into the pandemic with a low number of intensive care beds and high bed occupancy put the system under more strain?</em></p> 
  <p>Of course, says <strong>Hancock.</strong></p> 
  <p><em>Q: Do you think now that the decision to suspend all non urgent elective care was the right one?</em> </p> 
  <p>Yes, says <strong>Hancock.</strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Peter Mandelson says Prescott was 'the cement that kept New Labour together'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Peter Mandelson</strong> was one of many people in the Labour party who feuded with John Prescott at various times when they were in government, and at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/news/08/0819/crab.shtml">one memorable photocall</a> in the summer of 1997 Prescott compared him to a crab. Today, speaking on Sky News, Mandelson played down the extend of their disagreements, and pointed out that Prescott had supported his application to become Labour’s communications director in 1985 – the job that turned out to be the launchpad for Mandelson’s career.</p> 
  <p>Mandelson said it was wrong to say Prescott was not New Labour.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Some people say sometimes that he wasn’t New Labour. But that’s not true. He was New Labour. He was one very essential part of New Labour. He basically kept us anchored in our working class roots, our trade union history. And he was the bridge, essentially, between that and the modernisers in the Labour party, Tony, Gordon, me and the others. And he always wanted that project to work. It’s not as if he was standing outside it and peering in. He was on the inside and making it work. He was, in many respects, the cement that kept New Labour together.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Asked what he was like to work with, Mandelson replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>He was absolutely impossible. When I say he was sort of courageous, he was. When I say he was loyal, he was. When I say he was determined, he was. He was always determined to get his own way on any particular issue at any given moment. Right up until the point he’d say, ‘OK, I’ll do this for you. You do this for me. As long as you cover this off I’ll happily go along with it.’ </p> 
   <p>So he was a negotiator. He was a trade union negotiator. He was a broker. But at the end of the day he wanted it to work and the way in which he made it work was by being incredibly difficult for days on end and then finally sealing it, making work, agreeing it and off we went.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Mandelson also recalled a surprise conversation earlier this year he had with Prescott. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I was at home on a Sunday morning and the phone went and then suddenly I put it on and it was the face of John Prescott on my phone FaceTiming me from Hull. I mean, no advanced warning. No how do you do. It was, ‘Hello, is that you?’ ‘Yes John it is me. What do you want?’</p> 
   <p>He said ‘I just want to say that I know it was difficult and we were bloody awful to you at times and I was, but actually you did good and I want to forgive you.’ What am I being forgiven for here? It was just, ‘I want to forgive you because you did good. And I know it wasn’t easy at times and I know it was rough and I know I didn’t help but now I understand.’ And I said, ‘John that’s very kind of you. How do you suddenly understand this?’ He said, ‘Oh well somebody gave me this book of yours. I didn’t read it before. It looked very boring. But I’ve looked at it, I’ve dipped into it and I’ve seen what you went through … I feel rather sorry for you actually. And anyway, thanks very much.’</p> 
   <p>It was a few minutes more … but that was it. That was the last time I spoke to him.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Here is the full statement from John Prescott’s family announcing his death. Prescott was living with Alzheimer’s in his final years and his family have asked wellwishers minded to send flowers to donate to Alzheimer’s Research UK instead.</p> 
  <p>They say:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are deeply saddened to inform you that our beloved husband, father and grandfather, John <em>Prescott</em>, passed away peacefully yesterday at the age of 86.</p> 
   <p>He did so surrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery.</p> 
   <p>John spent his life trying to improve the lives of others, fighting for social justice and protecting the environment, doing so from his time as a waiter on the cruise liners to becoming Britain’s longest serving deputy prime minister.</p> 
   <p>John dearly loved his home of Hull and representing its people in parliament for 40 years was his greatest honour. We would like to thank the amazing NHS doctors and nurses who cared for him after his stroke in 2019 and the dedicated staff at the care home where he passed away after latterly living with Alzheimer’s.</p> 
   <p>In lieu of flowers and if you wish to do so, you can donate to Alzheimer’s Research UK.</p> 
   <p>As you can imagine, our family needs to process our grief so we respectfully request time and space to mourn in private. Thank you.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Gordon Brown pays tribute to Prescott</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Caroline Davies.</p> 
  <p>The former prime minister <strong>Gordon Brown</strong> has just been on the Today programme paying tribute to John Prescott. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>John was a friend of mine, he was a colleague, but when you think of him, he was a colossus, he was a titan of the Labour movement.</p> 
   <p>John Lennon talked about working class hero. It’s difficult to fit that term, but I think John would like that. </p> 
   <p>You’ve got to look at his achievements. He was probably the first government minister to see the importance of the environment. Kyoto, that environmental treaty in 1997, you’ve got to attribute that to John’s hard work with Al Gore.</p> 
   <p>Then he saw the importance, and he was a pioneer of regional policy. So the fact we have devolution and mayors owes a great deal to what John was thinking right throughout the 1980s and 90s when I was working with him.</p> 
   <p>And then we mustn’t forget that one of the great achievements of John as environment secretary was the repair and improvement of housing, 1.5m houses which would not have been repaired without John’s determination that the social housing stock had to be remodernised.</p> 
   <p>So you’ve got to look at the practical achievements of someone who possibly surprised himself by the way that he managed to become deputy prime minister, but actually made a huge difference.</p>

  <p>A long debate ensued, Blair said, adding: “Finally, at the press conference, when I was asked about that, I just said, well, John, is John. And so was that supposed to be an answer? I said, Yeah, that’s an answer, that’s as much as you can say.”</p>

It was a point of pride for both of us that we hailed from Rotherham; although it shaped us in different ways, we shared a certain bluntness in our exchanges—though in true Yorkshire fashion, John usually got straight to the point faster than I did!

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Labour former prime minister <strong>Sir Tony Blair</strong> said he was “devastated” by the death of Lord Prescott, and described his deputy as “one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics”.</p> 
  <p>Blair said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Although we all knew that the end was approaching and was inevitable, I am devastated by John’s passing. He was one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics; one of the most committed and loyal; and definitely the most unusual.</p> 
   <p>There was nothing about John which fitted conventional wisdom. He was from proud traditional working class stock yet understood instinctively and completely the aspirations of that class and their desire to better themselves.</p> 
   <p>He was liberal and tolerant, yet instantly intolerant of any overly liberal middle class dismissal of the misery suffered by poor inner city communities from crime and drug abuse. He could talk in the bluntest and sometimes bluest language, but it concealed a first rate intellect which meant he thought as deeply about issues as much as he cared about them.</p> 
   <p>It is no exaggeration to say the Labour Party could never have won three consecutive full terms without John. He was a commanding presence. He represented the wing of the party which was not New Labour, but he did it in a way which never reduced the effectiveness of our appeal and indeed extended it, broadening the base of our support.</p> 
   <p>He had extraordinary accomplishments: he revived many of Britain’s inner cities, was responsible for the refurbishment of thousands of council homes, the revival of British shipping, completed the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, established the Coalfield Communities Trust to breathe life back into villages and towns affected by the closure of mines; and was Britain’s lead negotiator for the Kyoto climate treaty, the world’s first attempt to agree a global response to climate change.</p>
