<p>A new cross-party group of MPs and peers is demanding more rights for Britain’s growing army of online content creators, amid concerns they face obstacles in securing everything from basic equipment to mortgages.</p> <p>The rise of content creators on YouTube and TikTok has transformed the media world, with individual streamers each attracting millions of subscribers to their channels. New research has suggested they are worth £2.2bn to the economy.</p> <p>Yet a consultation of thousands of creators, undertaken by YouTube, found a lack of recognition was causing a dearth of support around increasing their skills, training, funding, finding studio space and securing filming permits.</p> <p>The Guardian also heard from successful content creators who have been questioned by banks over their jobs when applying for loans and mortgages.</p> <p>Two former digital ministers, Labour’s Feryal Clark and the Conservative Ed Vaizey, will co-chair a new parliamentary group championing creators.</p> <p>“Digital creators are the trailblazers of a new creative revolution, rewriting the rules of culture, building empires from their bedrooms, driving billions into our economy,” said Clark, who left the government earlier this month.</p> <p>“For too long, their genius has been undervalued in Westminster. This new cross-party forum will put that right: tearing down the barriers that stifle talent, championing creators as pioneers of our time and making sure Britain leads the world as the ultimate home of creativity, innovation and ambition.”</p> <p>It comes with increasing political attention on the role of YouTube, which has become a dominant force across the media world. The Google-owned platform generated more than $36bn in revenue last year. It typically takes a 45% share of advertising revenue from a channel.</p> <p>The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has backed the regulator Ofcom in saying the platform should give <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/sep/18/uks-public-sector-broadcasters-demand-more-prominence-on-youtube-to-combat-misinformation">more prominence to traditional, trusted broadcasters</a>, as well as giving them a fairer deal over the revenue that flows from their content.</p>
