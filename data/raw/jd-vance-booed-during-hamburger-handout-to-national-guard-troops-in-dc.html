<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a> was booed and heckled with chants of “Free DC!” during a photo op with national guard troops at Union Station in Washington on Wednesday afternoon.</p> 
<p>Handing out burgers to troops deployed last week by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, at the station’s Shake Shack alongside the defense secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, and White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, Vance told soldiers “we appreciate everything you’re doing” and asserted: “We brought some law and order back.” Meanwhile, a crowd of demonstrators protested outside.</p> 
<p>The crowd shouted slogans such as “Free DC!” and “From DC to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories">Palestine</a>, occupation is a crime.” Some also shouted expletives as the three men walked into Union Station and gathered at the restaurant, and continued as they tried to speak to reporters and eventually left.</p> 
<p>Asked why the troops were at the station instead of parts of the city where crime rates were statistically higher, Vance claimed it was being overrun with “vagrants, drug addicts, the chronically homeless and the mentally ill” and that visitors didn’t feel safe. “This should be a monument to American greatness,” he said, later adding: “We do not have to live like this.”</p> 
<p>Addressing the protests, Vance said: “It’s kind of bizarre that we have a bunch of old, primarily white people who are out there protesting the policies that keep people safe when they’ve never felt danger in their entire lives.”</p>

<p>Appropriating the protesters’ chants, he added: “Let’s free Washington DC, so that young families can walk around and feel safe and secure. That’s what we’re trying to free DC from.”</p> 
<p>His sentiments were echoed by Miller, who belittled those who had gathered in protest as “crazy communists”. “We’re going to ignore these stupid white hippies that all need to go home and take a nap because they’re all over 90 years old, and we’re going to get back to the business of protecting the American people and the citizens of Washington DC,” he said.</p> 
<p>Last week, the president federalized the city’s Metropolitan police department and directed Hegseth to mobilize national guard troops, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/11/trump-washington-dc-crime">claiming he was cracking down</a> on “crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor” in the nation’s “lawless” capital, despite a sharply falling crime rate with violent crime <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/violent-crime-dc-hits-30-year-low#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%2D%20Total%20violent%20crime%20for,Graves.">at a 30-year low</a>.</p> 
<p>An estimated 1,900 troops are being deployed in DC. More than half are coming from Republican-led states including Louisiana and South Carolina. Besides Union Station, troops have mostly been spotted in downtown areas, including the National Mall and metro stops.</p>
