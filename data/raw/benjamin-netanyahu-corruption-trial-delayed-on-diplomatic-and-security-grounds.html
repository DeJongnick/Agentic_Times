<p>An Israeli court has cancelled this week’s hearings in Benjamin Netanyahu’s long-running corruption trial, accepting a request made by the prime minister on classified diplomatic and security grounds.</p> <p>“Following the explanations given … we partially accept the request and cancel at this stage Mr Netanyahu’s hearings scheduled” for this week, the Jerusalem district court said in its ruling, published online by Netanyahu’s Likud party.</p> <p>The ruling said that new reasons provided by Netanyahu, the head of Israel’s spy agency the Mossad and the military intelligence chief justified cancelling the hearings.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/29/iran-israel-ceasefire-netanyahu-forever-war">Don’t count on the Iran-Israel ceasefire lasting.

The prime minister has requested multiple postponements to the trial since it began in May 2020.</p> <p>Netanyahu’s lawyers had asked the court to excuse him from testifying over the next two weeks so he could focus on security issues after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/24/chaotic-24-hours-in-israel-iran-war">a ceasefire with Iran</a> and amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/29/medical-staff-struggle-gangs-fight-aid-supplies-gaza">ongoing fighting in Gaza</a> where Israeli hostages are held.</p> <p>They submitted the prime minister’s schedule to the court to demonstrate “the national need for the prime minister to devote all his time and energy to the political, national and security issues at hand”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/28/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-polling-iran-war">‘Everything is opportunistic’: Can Netanyahu expect more years in power after Israel’s war with Iran?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The court initially rejected the lawyers’ request, but said in its ruling on Sunday that it had changed its judgment after hearing arguments from the prime minister and other senior officials.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Israeli prosecution declined to comment on Trump’s post.</p> <p>Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said last week that Trump “should not interfere in a judicial trial in an independent country”.</p> <p>Trump said Netanyahu was “right now” negotiating a deal with Hamas, though neither leader provided details, and officials from both sides have voiced scepticism over prospects for a ceasefire soon.</p> <p>On Friday, the Republican president told reporters he believed a ceasefire was close.</p> <p><em>With Reuters and Agence France-Presse</em></p>
