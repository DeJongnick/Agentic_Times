<p>Britain’s leading AI institute has announced a new mission to help protect the nation from cyber-attacks on infrastructure, including energy, transport and utilities, after it was embroiled in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/10/staff-alan-turing-institute-ai-complain-watchdog">allegations</a> of toxic work culture and the chief executive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/head-of-alan-turing-institute-jean-innes-resigns">resigned</a> amid ministerial pressure.</p> <p>The Alan Turing Institute will “carry out a programme of science and innovation designed to protect the UK from hostile threats”, it announced on Tuesday as part of changes following the resignation last month of Jean Innes, its chief executive, after a staff revolt and government calls for a strategic overhaul of the state-funded body.</p> <p>The mission comes amid growing concern over Britain’s vulnerability to internet outages and cyber-attacks after this month’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/20/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-hits-dozens-websites-apps">incident</a> affecting Amazon’s cloud computing globally and recent cyber-attacks crippling production at Jaguar Land Rover factories, and supply chains at Marks &amp; Spencer and the Co-op.</p> <p>Blythe Crawford, the former commander of the UK’s air and space warfare centre , will report back next month on how the government-funded institute “can best support the scale of government AI ambitions in defence, national security and intelligence”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/26/internet-infrastructure-fragile-system-holding-modern-world-together">Could the internet go offline?

He also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/09/what-is-the-alan-turing-test">invented the eponymous test</a> to determine if a computer can show human intelligence.</p> <p>It will also focus on deploying AI for the environment and health. The institute will develop ways to use the fast-advancing technology to more rapidly and accurately forecast changes in weather, oceans and sea ice, in part to better inform UK government emergency planners. It will also target “tangible emissions reductions in transportation networks, manufacturing processes and critical infrastructure”.</p> <p>On health, it will focus on creating digital twins of human hearts, a frontline of personalised AI-enabled medicine, which could improve medical interventions and patient outcomes for critically ill cardiac patients.</p>
