<p>Fifteen international human rights organisations have called on the Israel- and US-backed Gaza food delivery group, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), and other private groups running humanitarian aid delivery in Gaza to cease their operations or face legal consequences.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/sites/default/files/attach/2025/06/GHF-Letter-Sign-on_ww.pdf">letter</a> sent on Monday to GHF and the affiliated Safe Reach Solutions and UG Solutions, the rights advocates warned that private contractors operating in Gaza in collaboration with the Israeli government risk “aiding and abetting or otherwise being complicit in crimes under international law, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide”. They also noted that the contractors may be liable under US law and in other jurisdictions.</p> <p>The letter marks the latest warning against GHF, which has been mired in controversy since replacing most UN-run relief operations in Gaza. Major aid groups have boycotted it and accused it of violating the principles of neutrality and independence that are bedrocks of humanitarian work. GHF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The rollout of GHF operations over the last three weeks – after a two-month blockade on most aid entering Gaza that has pushed the territory’s 2.1 million residents to the verge of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/collapse-of-gazas-water-systems-may-cause-devastating-drought-and-hunger">famine</a> – has been deadly.

We delivered aid at scale during the ceasefire, and we can do it again. We just need to be allowed to do our jobs.”</p>
