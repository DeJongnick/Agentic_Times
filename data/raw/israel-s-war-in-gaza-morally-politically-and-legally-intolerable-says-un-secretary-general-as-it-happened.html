  <p><strong>The new 72-page legal analysis from the United Nations’ commission of inquiry on the occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories">Palestinian territories</a> and Israel is the strongest finding by part of the UN on Gaza to date.</strong></p> 
  <p>It accuses <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> of committing genocide in Gaza, saying that that its offensive there has been waged “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group”.</p> 
  <p>Created four years ago by the UN’s Human Rights Council and staffed by three independent experts, the commission does not officially speak for the UN, which has not yet used the term “genocide” itself but is under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/29/un-human-rights-staff-urge-leadership-to-declare-israels-war-in-gaza-a-genocide">increasing pressure</a> to do so.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Daniel Meron, called <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session60/advance-version/a-hrc-60-crp-3.pdf">the report</a> “scandalous” and “fake”, saying it had been authored by “Hamas proxies”.

  <p><strong>The bombardment of Gaza City has been growing louder and more deadly for weeks, but in the early hours of Tuesday it felt like an earthquake that would never stop.</strong></p> 
  <p>“Even when the bombings are not right next to us, we can clearly hear them, and the ground shakes beneath us with the intensity of the explosions,” said Fatima al-Zahra Sahweil, 40.</p> 
  <p>Sahweil, a media researcher, said the dead and wounded from the night’s barrage had been taken to al-Shifa medical complex, where she heard the situation was “catastrophic”.</p> 
  <p>She had lost track of the latest news, however, as she tried to make the near-impossible decision of what to do to best protect her four children.</p> 
  <p>The Rashid coast road, the Israeli-designated “escape” route to the south, was jammed with the exhausted and desperate. Anyway, the cost of a ride was too high.</p> 
  <p>“On top of that, I don’t own a tent to give us shelter, and they are too expensive to buy. I would not be able to take all of the belongings and supplies I have already bought several times before,” Sahweil said. “Then there is the suffering we would face in searching for water and the lack of empty spaces to stay in. So if I leave, I would simply be going into the unknown.”</p> 
  <p>Like more than 90% of people in Gaza, the family has been displaced by the war. An overwhelming majority have been forced to move numerous times. Sahweil and her family have already been displaced 19 times.</p> 
  <p>Now, with the launch of a ground offensive, the Israeli army is calling on the estimated 1 million people sheltering in Gaza City to move south once more. But the Sahweils, and many others have been to the south before and are aware it is no haven from violence.</p>

  <p>Last week, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said she will seek approval from EU nations for new sanctions against far-right Israeli extremists and a partial suspension of a trade agreement with Israel.</p> 
  <p>She also said she will freeze millions of euros given by the EU’s executive branch to Israel, which would not require the approval of all member countries.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israeli military says it will strike Yemen's Red Sea port of Hodeidah</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Israeli military said it had issued an evacuation order on Tuesday for Yemen’s <strong>port of Hodeidah</strong>, which is the main entry point for food and other humanitarian aid for millions of Yemenis, and will attack the area in the coming hours.</p> 
  <p>Since Israel’s war in Gaza began in October 2023, the Iran-aligned Houthis have attacked vessels in the Red Sea in what they describe as acts of solidarity with the Palestinians.</p> 
  <p>They have also frequently fired missiles towards Israel, most of which have been intercepted. Israel has responded with airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, including the vital Hodeidah port.</p> 
  <p>In May, the Trump administration announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/us-to-halt-bombing-campaign-against-houthis-in-yemen-trump-says">a deal with the Houthis</a> to end the airstrikes in return for an end to attacks on shipping. The rebels, however, said the agreement did not include halting attacks on targets it believed were aligned with Israel.</p> 
  <p>At least 35 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen last Wednesday, according to the health ministry<strong>. </strong>The Israeli military said it struck military targets in the capital Sana’a and the al-Jawf province during the attack.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The UN human rights chief <strong>Volker Türk</strong> has been reacting to Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza City, which has already been devasted by famine and relentless bombardments.</p> 
  <p>Türk says it is “absolutely clear that this carnage must stop” as he condemned the expanded assault as “totally and utterly unacceptable”.</p> 
  <p>“We see the piling up of war crime after war crime after war crime, of crime against humanity, and potentially even more,” Volker Turk told AFP and Reuters, adding: “It’s for the court to decide whether it’s genocide or not, and we see the evidence mounting.”</p> 
  <p>Türk has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/29/un-human-rights-staff-urge-leadership-to-declare-israels-war-in-gaza-a-genocide">been under pressure</a> from employees at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the agency he leads, to go further and declare Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide. </p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Recognition is a symbolic step but one that would infuriate the Israeli government, which argues that it would encourage Hamas and reward terrorism.</em></p>

   <p><em>It also allows the establishment of full diplomatic relations that would result in a Palestinian ambassador (rather than a head of mission) being stationed in London and a British ambassador in Palestine. Advocates say it is a way of kickstarting a political process towards an eventual two-state solution.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Out of the 193 UN member states, nearly 150 already recognise Palestine as a state. These include China, India and Russia, as well as a majority of European countries such as Cyprus, Ireland, Norway, Spain and Sweden.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Luxembourg</strong> said it will join a number of countries in recognising the state of Palestine at a UN summit in New York next week, adding to international pressure on Israel after similar moves by Australia, Britain, Canada and France.</p> 
  <p>“A movement is now emerging in Europe and around the world to demonstrate that the two-state solution is still relevant,” the country’s prime minister, Luc Frieden, was quoted by Al Jazeera as having told reporters.</p> 
  <p>“That is why the Luxembourg government intends to join those who recognise the State of Palestine at next week’s conference on the two-state solution.”</p> 
  <p>The Israeli government says that recognition rewards Hamas’ terrorism. The State of Palestine is currently recognised by 147 of the UN’s 193 member states.</p> 
  <p>Israel has become increasingly isolated on the international stage as it faces credible accusations of genocide, ethnic cleansing, war crimes and the collective punishment of the civilian population of Gaza.</p> 
  <p>The UN special rapporteur for the occupied territories, Francesca Albanese, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/13/palestinian-statehood-israel-gaza-francesca-albanese">told the Guardian last month</a> that the renewed push for Palestinian statehood, although welcomed, should not “distract the attention from where it should be: the genocide”.</p>

  <p><a href="https://x.com/pmofa/status/1967897766337634595">In an update on X</a>, the foreign ministry, part of the Palestinian Authority, which is based in the occupied West Bank, wrote:</p>

   <p><em>The latest of these was the installation of an iron gate at the entrance to the towns of Al-Eizariya and Ar-Ram, among others, bringing the number of gates that sever the West Bank to nearly a thousand.</em></p>

   <p><em>The ministry considers the occupation’s checkpoints, iron gates, and military towers as an extension of settlement activity and outposts, falling within the framework of dividing the occupied West Bank into fragmented, disconnected parts and turning Palestinian communities into veritable closed prisons, where entry or exit is prohibited without permission from the occupation.</em></p> 
   <p><em>The ministry warns the international community and all countries of the repercussions of installing these gates, viewing them as a prelude to imposing further colonial and settlement control over the West Bank. They are part of the crime of gradual, both overt and covert, annexation of the West Bank, in flagrant violation of international law.</em></p>

  <p>Some – the elderly, very sick, very young, injured or handicapped – simply cannot move while many are reluctant to move to areas that they believe are unsafe, overcrowded and have little in the way of any services.</p> 
  <p>Unicef’s staff in Gaza City described a “very difficult night” with an “ever increasing pace of bombardment” but said Israeli tanks remained on the outskirts and had not advanced yet.</p>

  <p>The US secretary of state, <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, is visiting Qatar today to lobby the Gulf state to continue its mediation between Israel and Hamas after the Israeli attack on Doha targeting the Hamas leadership last week seriously strained relations between the US and Qatar.</p> 
  <p>Hamas said six people were killed in the attack but that its leaders survived. Despite pressure to rebuke Israel, Rubio offered the US’s unwavering support to Benjamin Netanyahu when he met the Israeli prime minister in Jerusalem yesterday.</p> 
  <p>He told reporters as he left Israel: “We think we have a very short window of time in which a deal can happen. We don’t have months anymore, and we probably have days and maybe a few weeks to go.”</p> 
  <p>Rubio said a diplomatic solution in which Hamas demilitarises remained the US preference, although he added: “Sometimes when you’re dealing with a group of savages like Hamas, that’s not possible, but we hope it can happen.”</p> 
  <p>Now visiting Doha just as Israel launched its ground offensive into Gaza City, Rubio was pessimistic about a ceasefire deal but said Qatar was in a unique position to help.</p>

  <p>Two officials said the ground invasion was in its early stages, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/09/16/world/gaza-israel?campaign_id=190&amp;emc=edit_ufn_20250916&amp;instance_id=162631&amp;nl=from-the-times&amp;regi_id=162122330&amp;segment_id=205989&amp;user_id=8fa2a55899ee4747f6429a80473b1571">according to the New York Times</a>. Israel is justifying its assault by saying Gaza City is one of the last remaining Hamas strongholds.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Netanyahu condemned for saying Muslim immigration in Europe is contributing to Israel's increasing isolation on world stage</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Julian Borger is the Guardian’s senior international correspondent</em></p> 
  <p>Israel’s prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>, is being widely criticised in Israel this morning for remarks admitting Israel’s increasing isolation but blaming it on Muslim immigration in Europe, as well as social media influence backed by Qatar and China.</p> 
  <p>In a speech which led to a dip on the Tel Aviv stock market on Monday, Netanyahu warned that the country would have to become a “super Sparta” with “some signs of an autarky”, conjuring up the prospect of a militarised, self-reliant future, with less trade with the rest of the world.</p> 
  <p>A United Nations commission of inquiry concluded on Tuesday that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza and that top Israeli officials including prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu had incited these acts. More than 64,000 Palestinians, the overwhelmingly majority civilians, have been killed so far.</p> 
  <p>Netanyahu’s government has denied the genocide charge which is also being weighed by the International Court of Justice. Netanyahu has escalated the conflict further by ordering an offensive on Gaza City. After a night of intense bombardment, there were reports of a ground attack on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>Netanyahu, however, blamed foreigners for Israel’s increasing diplomatic isolation, which he referred to as “a siege that is organised by a few states”.</p> 
  <p>“One is China, and the other is Qatar. And they are organising an attack on Israel, legitimacy, in the social media of the western world and the United States,” Netanyahu said. </p> 
  <p>“The second thing is something that they can do uniquely in western Europe. Western Europe has large Islamist minorities. They’re vocal. Many of them are politically motivated. They align with Hamas, they align with Iran,” the prime minister said. </p> 
  <p>“They pressure the governments of western Europe, many of whom are kindly disposed to Israel, but they see that they are being overtaken, really, by campaigns of violent protest and constant intimidation.”</p> 
  <p>His remarks seemed to be a reference to UK, France and Belgium who are set to recognise Palestine at the UN general assembly and have been increasingly critical of Israel over the Gaza war.</p> 
  <p>Netanyahu’s rhetoric about isolation was denounced in the Israeli press on Tuesday as a potentially self-fulfilling prophecy. Writing in the Ma’ariv newspaper, the veteran commentator, Ben Caspit, said: “Even in Netanyahu’s terms, a man who has already said all of the most reckless things imaginable, this statement was exceptional in its recklessness, absurdity and madness.”</p> 
  <p>“The man has completely lost his checks, balances and connection to reality,” Caspit wrote.</p>

  <p>The UN investigators cited examples of the scale of the Israeli killings, aid blockages, forced displacement and the destruction of a fertility clinic to back up its genocide finding.</p> 
  <p>The 1948 UN Genocide Convention defines genocide as crimes committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such”. To count as genocide, at least one of five acts must have occurred.</p> 
  <p>The UN commission found that Israel had committed four of them: killing; causing serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the Palestinians in whole or in part; and imposing measures intended to prevent births.</p> 
  <p>It cited as evidence interviews with victims, witnesses, doctors, verified open-source documents and satellite imagery analysis compiled since the war began two years ago.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>UN investigators have determined that Israel has committed “genocide” in Gaza since October 2023, with the “intent to destroy the Palestinians” in the territory.</p> 
  <p>“We came to the conclusion that genocide is occurring in Gaza and is continuing to occur, and the responsibility lies with the State of Israel,” Navi Pillay, head of the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territories, told AFP. </p> 
  <p>The report concluded that Israel’s prime minister, as well as its president, Isaac Herzog, and the former defence minister Yoav Gallant, had “incited the commission of genocide” and that Israeli authorities had “failed to take action against them to punish this incitement”.</p>

  <p>As well as facing relentless bombardments, Gaza City, the biggest built-up area of the territory, is being gripped by a famine caused by Israel’s restrictions on aid.</p> 
  <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a globally recognised organisation that classifies the severity of food insecurity and malnutrition, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/22/ipc-declares-famine-gaza-city">declared last month</a> that an “entirely man-made” famine was taking place in Gaza City and its surrounding area.</p> 
  <p>“If a ceasefire is not implemented to allow humanitarian aid to reach everyone in the Gaza Strip, and if essential food supplies and basic health, nutrition and [sanitation and water] services are not restored immediately, avoidable deaths will increase exponentially,” the IPC report said.</p> 
  <p>The UN and other organisations face massive logistical obstacles including widespread looting, ongoing Israeli bombardments, Israel’s administrative restrictions and bureaucracy and damaged infrastructure within Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Charities have warned tha Palestinian residents in Gaza City face an impossible choice: either stay and risk being killed by Israeli forces (or die from starvation) or flee and risk death while travelling on road to overcrowded displacement areas in the south which have also been targets of Israeli attacks.</p> 
  <p>Most people in Gaza City have already been displaced several times over the course of the war and may be too weak, old, or sick to flee this time around.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>US secretary of state <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> said as he headed to Qatar on Tuesday that he would ask it to stay on as a mediator in Israel’s war on Gaza, a week after Israeli airstrikes against Hamas leaders in Doha.</p> 
  <p>Rubio expressed pessimism about a ceasefire deal as he flew out from Tel Aviv amid the IDF’s intensified bombardment of Gaza but told reporters that Qatar uniquely could help, Agence France-Presse reports.</p> 
  <p>“We’re going to ask Qatar to continue to do what they’ve done, and we appreciate very much, and that is, play a constructive role in trying to bring this to an end,” Rubio told reporters at Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport.</p> 
  <p>“Obviously they have to decide if they want to do that after last week or not, but we want them to know that if there’s any country in the world that could help end this through a negotiation, it’s Qatar.”</p> 
  <p>Rubio said the US would work with Qatar to finalise a defence agreement soon despite the Israeli military action last week.</p> 
  <p>“If any country in the world can help mediate it, Qatar is the one. They’re the ones that can do it,” Rubio said while departing Tel Aviv for Doha.</p> 
  <p>“We have a close partnership with the Qataris. In fact, we have an enhanced defence cooperation agreement, which we’ve been working on, we’re on the verge of finalising,” Rubio said, without elaborating.</p> 
  <p>President <strong>Donald Trump</strong> told reporters in Washington that prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> “won’t be hitting” Qatar again.</p> 
  <p>Rubio made no such comments in <strong>Israel</strong>. Speaking next to Netanyahu, Rubio was reticent on praising Qatar, saying only that it was important to look forward after the strike.</p>

  <p>But the Israeli mission to the UN rejected her remarks, blaming Hamas for the destruction, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julianborger">Julian Borger</a> has reported, while <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> defended Israel’s tactics. “We’re not bringing down those towers [in Gaza City] to intimidate people,” the Israeli prime minister said. “Those towers are serving as Hamas strongholds.” </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Opening summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>After a night of reports of intense bombardment of Gaza City, Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, appears to have declared a new phase in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) offensive against the already devastated urban sprawl where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p> 
  <p>“Gaza is burning,” Katz said on Tuesday morning. He added “the IDF is striking terror infrastructure with an iron fist”.</p> 
  <p>“IDF soldiers are fighting heroically to create the conditions for the release of the hostages and the defeat of Hamas,” Katz said. “We will not relent or turn back until the mission is complete.”</p> 
  <p>The escalation in the Israeli bombardment of Gaza City came immediately in the wake of a visit by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who declared the Trump administration’s “unwavering support” for Israel.</p> 
  <p>As he left the country, heading for Qatar on Tuesday morning, Rubio told journalists: “The Israelis have begun to take operations there. So we think we have a very short window of time in which a deal can happen. We don’t have months anymore, and we probably have days and maybe a few weeks to go.”</p> 
  <p>A Hamas statement issued in the early hours of Tuesday said the Trump administration “bears direct responsibility” for the conflict’s escalation through its “blatant bias” and it warned the offensive would “threaten the lives of the captured Israeli soldiers”.</p> 
  <p>There are still 48 hostages in Gaza, abducted by Hamas and allied militants in their attack on 7 October 2023, who have not been returned. Only 20 are thought to be still alive.</p> 
  <p>Hostage families have called for a protest later on Tuesday morning outside the Jerusalem residence of the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to demonstrate against the offensive, and police have closed off the street.</p>
