Much of the damage was in Hebei, which neighbours the capital. The authorities were criticised for building a “moat” around the capital, which intensified the flooding in Hebei.</p> <p>The central government said in a statement it had sent 50m yuan (about $7m) to Hebei and dispatched a high-level team of emergency responders to help the affected areas.</p> <p>Human-caused climate breakdown is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/aug/04/climate-breakdown-supercharging-extreme-weather">supercharging extreme weather</a> across the world, driving more frequent and more deadly disasters from heatwaves to floods to wildfires.
