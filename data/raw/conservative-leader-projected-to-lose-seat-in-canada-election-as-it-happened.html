 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary...</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It has just gone 10.25am in Ottawa, Canada. Here is a roundup of the momentous results in Canada’s consequential federal election:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Canadian Prime Minister <strong>Mark Carney</strong>’s Liberals have staged a major political comeback to retain power in the parliamentary elections.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The polls are still being counted. But as things stand the Liberals are leading with 168 seats. They need 172 for a majority. If the party falls short of the magic number it would need the support of political rivals to govern as a minority government.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The Conservatives will likely remain in opposition as the second-largest party. The party have currently secured 144 seats, with 99% of polls having reported results.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Conservative leader <strong>Pierre Poilievre</strong> lost in Carleton, Ontario, a seat he had held for two decades, to a Liberal candidate. “Conservatives will work with the prime minister and all parties with the common goal of defending Canada’s interests and getting a new trade deal that puts these tariffs behind us while protecting our sovereignty,” Poilievre told his supporters in a concession speech in Ottawa.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Even though he has lost his seat in the House of Commons, Poilievre remains the de facto Conservative leader for now.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The two main parties – Liberals and the Conservatives - saw a rise in their share of the national vote compared with four years ago as the smaller parties (Bloc Québécois, the New Democratic Party, the Green party and the People’s Party) got squeezed out.</p></li> 
   <li><p>In his victory speech, Carney said <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is “trying to break us so that America can own us” and vowed that his new government would not let that happen.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Carney, the former Bank of England governor who replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister just last month, convinced voters that his experience managing economic crises made him the ideal candidate to defy Trump.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The left-leaning New Democratic party saw many of its supporters defect to Carney, and fell from 24 seats to fewer than 10; its leader, <strong>Jagmeet Singh</strong>, announced his resignation after being pushed into third place in his own seat. The separatist Bloc Québécois also saw its support collapse, falling from 32 seats to a projected 23 (you can read more in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/29/triumph-mark-carney-what-happened-canada-election-and-what-will-it-mean">this summary of the election’s results</a>).</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ontario Premier wants cooperation with federal government to deal with 'economic uncertainty' caused by Trump's tariffs</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Ontario Premier <strong>Doug Ford</strong>, the Progressive Conservative party leader who has been the province’s premier since 2018, has congratulated Mark Carney on his victory in the federal elections.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/statement/1005851/premier-ford-issues-statement-on-federal-election-results">In a statement</a>, Ford, a vocal critic of Donald Trump, said:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>The federal election comes at a “crucial time” for Canadians who are living with “economic uncertainty” caused by Trump’s punitive tariffs.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Ontario is standing ready to work with the federal government to cut “red tape” and thereby allow the country’s businesses to become more competitive and withstand the impacts of higher levies.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Carney should make good on his promise to speed up approvals for critical mineral and other resource development projects and support Ontario as it looks to <strong>“</strong>build the future of nuclear” including “the first small modular reactors in the G7”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The federal government should commit to “meaningful bail reform” to increase public safety.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Carney should meet national defence commitments by “using Canadian-made equipment wherever possible” and meeting and exceeding Canada’s 2% of GDP Nato spending target.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Ford, who has won three consecutive majority governments in Ontario for his provincial party, emerged as a strong voice against US tariffs at a time when former prime minister Justin Trudeau was trailing in the polls before his resignation.</p>

  <p><strong>At the beginning of the year, Canada’s Conservatives had a 25-point lead over the Liberal government, and their leader, Pierre Poilievre, looked certain to be the country’s next prime minister.</strong> </p> 
  <p>But as the votes cast in Monday’s election have been counted, the story of the campaign has been confirmed: victory for the Liberals and their new leader, Mark Carney, who have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/29/canada-election-result-liberal-win-mark-carney-anti-trump">extended their decade of rule by as much as another five years</a>.</p> 
  <p>With almost all polls counted, it appears likely that the Liberals will fall just short of a majority, and instead be the leading party in a minority government, as in the last two elections. </p> 
  <p>Regardless, it represents a remarkable turnaround, and vindication for Carney’s efforts to present himself as the prime ministerial candidate who would most effectively stand up to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>. As for Poilievre: the CBC projects he has lost his seat.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Conservative leader <strong>Pierre Poilievre</strong> has lost his seat in <strong>Carleton</strong>, Ontario, according to projections by CBC/Radio-Canada, after his party lost the general election.</p> 
  <p>Poilievre had held this seat for 20 years, and first won when he was 25, making him one of the youngest elected Conservatives at the time.</p> 
  <p>Under the leadership of Poilievre, the Conservatives had for the past two years seemed likely to form the next government.</p> 
  <p>But within weeks of Donald Trump’s erratic trade threats and the emergence of Mark Carney – the former Bank of England governor - as the new Liberal leader, their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/18/canada-liberals-polls-mark-carney">25-point poll lead evaporated</a>.</p>

  <p>Mark Carney’s Liberal party is projected to win more of parliament’s 343 seats than the Conservatives. But, as we have been reporting, it remains unclear whether the Liberals will win the 172 needed to secure a majority, and based on CBC’s vote tally, it’s projected to win 168 seats overall. </p> 
  <p>The Liberal party is due to win the most seats in the provinces of <strong>Ontario</strong> and <strong>Quebec</strong>, while the Conservatives are ahead in <strong>Alberta</strong>. The race between these two parties is close in <strong>British Columbia</strong>. </p> 
  <p>It is 04.50am in Ottawa. Elections Canada is still counting ballots, and it will likely be a couple of more hours before confirmation of whether the Liberals have done enough to obtain a majority government. If it falls short it would need the support of political rivals to govern.</p>

  <p>While the conventional wisdom for years has been that such figures are no longer viable political leaders, the specific circumstances in Canada this year have turned that analysis on its head. As he said himself in March: “I’m most useful in a crisis. I’m not that good in peacetime.”</p> 
  <p>Carney has promised to negotiate a new trade deal with the US, and said he hopes to meet Trump in person soon – but adds that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/carney-says-canada-has-leverage-to-wait-for-a-us-trade-deal">Canada has the leverage</a> to wait until the time is right to do so. In the meantime, he wants to focus on lowering internal trade barriers and bolstering major investment projects, such as housing construction, to spur the economy.</p> 
  <p>He has also said that the old relationship with the United States is over, and emphasised closer ties with the UK and Europe in his brief tenure as prime minister since he replaced Justin Trudeau. In his victory speech less than an hour ago, Carney said: “This is Canada, and we decide what happens here.” And he added: “We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we must never forget the lessons.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>If you’re just joining us, here’s a summary of the latest developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Prime minister Mark Carney has warned that “[US President Donald] Trump is trying to break us” after winning a narrow victory in Canada’s national election</strong>. The Liberal leader said “America wants our land, our resources, our water” and said he would protect the country from what he said were not “idle threats”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Liberals were projected to win more of Parliament’s 343 seats than the opposition Conservatives.</strong> However, it wasn’t immediately clear if they would win an outright majority – at least 172 – or would need to rely on one of the smaller parties to form a government and pass legislation.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The result capped a notable comeback for the Liberals, who had been 20 percentage points behind in the polls in January. </strong>That was before then prime minister Justin Trudeau announced he was quitting and Trump started threatening tariffs and annexation.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre conceded defeat but appeared to rule out stepping down</strong>. “We gained well over 20 seats, we got the highest vote share our party has received since 1988,” he told supporters.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The leader of the centre-left</strong> <strong>New Democratic party (NDP), Jagmeet Singh, said he would step down. </strong>Singh lost his own seat and led his party to a catastrophic result expected to see it lose its status as an official party in the House of Commons.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>On election day itself, Trump had resumed his provocations with a social media post.</strong> He suggested he was on the ballot and repeated that Canada should become the 51st state. “It makes no sense unless Canada is a State!” Trump posted.</p></li>

  <p>Canada’s Liberal party has won a fourth term, capping a miraculous political resurrection for the party – and marking a landmark victory for former central banker and political novice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/mark-carney">Mark Carney</a> as he prepares to face off against US president Donald Trump.</p> 
  <p>Late on Monday, the Liberals had won or were leading in enough seats to prevent any other party from forming government, according to the national broadcaster CBC. As results from Canada’s Atlantic provinces and vote-rich Quebec and Ontario came in late on Monday, supporters at the Liberals’ election night party erupted in cheers.</p> 
  <p>It was not immediately clear if the Liberals will have enough seats for a majority government. A minority government would means Carney’s party will need the support of political opponents to govern. After a narrow victory at the previous federal election, the Liberals relied on the leftwing New Democratic party to help it pass legislation.</p> 
  <p>For the Liberals, the win marks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/canada-liberal-party-trump">a remarkable recovery for a party that was, until recently, on track for electoral devastation</a>. Carney’s predecessor Justin Trudeau served as prime minister for nearly 10 years, but the twilight of his leadership was marked by repeated threats of mutiny, bitter feuding and a fed-up electorate.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In case you need a refresher on Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada who only recently became prime minister without ever having held a seat in parliament, here’s an extract from our recent profile of him:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Carney’s credentials as a political outsider would in normal times have killed his candidacy in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/canada">Canada</a> but his distance from unpopular incumbent Justin Trudeau and a high-profile banking career played to his advantage, and Carney argues he is the only person prepared to handle Trump.</p> 
   <p>“I know how to manage crises … in a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills,” Carney said during a leadership debate last month.</p> 
   <p>He said in an interview last month: “President Trump probably thinks Canada will cave in. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/01/carney-vows-canada-will-stand-up-to-bully-as-trump-imposes-trade-tariffs">we are going to stand up to a bully</a>, we’re not going to back down. We’re united and we will retaliate.”</p> 
   <p>Carney has called the threats posed by Trump “the most serious crisis of our lifetime” and said on Sunday that the US wants “our resources, our water, our land, our country”.</p> 
   <p>Daniel Béland, the director of the Institute for the Study of Canada at McGill University, described Carney as a “technocrat”. “He’s a boring guy who in general doesn’t have a lot of charisma,” Béland said. However, he noted that Carney’s rigorous competence with no flash may be appealing, given Canada is rattled by Trump’s trade chaos and attacks on its sovereignty.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Mark Carney’s Liberal party is projected to win the 2025 federal election, but results in a number of key electoral districts are too close to determine if the party will have a majority government, or be held to a minority for the third consecutive election.</p> 
  <p>While the full results aren’t yet in, the Liberals are leading or elected in enough seats to prevent any other party from forming government.</p> 
  <p>Supporters at the Liberal election night party erupted in cheers when multiple networks called the election for the party. The path to victory for the party, left for dead as recently as February, relied heavily on the collapse of the New Democratic party and the Bloc Québécois.</p>

   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump threatened Canada’s independent sovereignty on the eve of the election, </strong>describing the border between the two nations as an “artificially drawn line from many years ago”. In a Truth Social post, the US president urged Canada to become the 51st state of the US, claiming it would bring tax cuts, and increased military power.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre responded to Trump’s threat by urging him to “stay out of our election”. </strong>“Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state,” the Conservative leader posted on X.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Liberal leader Mark Carney, also in an apparent reference to Trump, said “this is Canada – and we decide what happens here.” </strong>In a video posted on X, the Liberal leader referred to a “crisis” in the US and reminded voters of the threat to Canada’s economy posed by Trump’s tariffs.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">How Trump dampened Quebec separatist movement – for now</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It was the middle of the night when the <strong>Bloc Québécois</strong> realized they had achieved the improbable. For weeks, the separatist party in Canada’s Francophone province had been campaigning hard to steal an electoral district in Montreal long held by the Liberals.</p> 
  <p>When the trickle of votes finally stopped on that September evening, the Bloc’s <strong>Louis-Philippe Sauvé</strong> had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/17/justin-trudeau-future-liberal-party-loses-montreal-election">emerged victorious by a narrow margin of 200 votes.</a></p> 
  <p>Chastened by the loss, the then prime minister, <strong>Justin Trudeau,</strong> admitted his Liberals had “a lot of work to do”. The defeat reflected a governing party in tatters and a leader losing his grip on power. And to party faithful, the Bloc’s win reflected an excitement that the separatist movement was once again in ascendance.</p> 
  <p>Six months later, the heady days of the Bloc’s growing popularity are over. <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s effort to trash his country’s relationship with Canada has led to a dramatic realigning of allegiances, with a swell in Canadian pride washing over regional differences.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Until February, the Conservatives enjoyed a 25 point lead over the Liberals. </p> 
  <p>Pollsters gave the Tories a 99% chance of winning if an election were called at the time with one of the largest parliamentary majorities in decades. </p>

  <p>Canada’s former prime minister <strong>Jean Chrétien</strong> has predicted the Liberals will win a majority government after polls close tonight.</p> 
  <p>Chrétien, 91, said he expects “to celebrate the majority government of the Liberal party” during a rally for Ottawa Centre Liberal incumbent Yasir Naqvi, the Canadian Press reported.</p> 
  <p>“Monday is going to be a Liberal sunshine,” he said, drawing cheers.</p> 
  <p>Chrétien led three majority Liberal governments between 1993 and 2003 and has campaigned for the party in dozens of 30 electoral districts across the country as the party seeks to match – or even eclipse – his 1993 landslide victory.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ottawa voters head to polling stations after months of political turbulence</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The nation’s capital has braved more political turbulence than most can recall in decades with internecine feuds, threats to Canadian sovereignty and political resurrections.</p> 
  <p>But perhaps more devastating for residents of Ottawa has been the cruelty of a drawn out winter, with spring snow squalls and persistently grey skies.</p> 
  <p>And so even on the day of what party leaders have billed as the most important election in a generation, many voters in Ottawa seemed more excited by the weather.</p> 
  <p>On a disconcertingly pleasant spring day that has many celebrating the return of the sun, Liberal leader <strong>Mark Carney</strong> cast his ballot in the Ottawa neighbourhood where he’s lived for the last 10 years, walking past sprouting daffodils and cautiously flowering trees to a nearby polling station with his family.</p> 
  <p><strong>Pierre Poilievre,</strong> the Conservative leader, also cast his ballot in Ottawa with his family, where he looks to defend the electoral district he’s held for the last seven terms.</p> 
  <p>But, in protest of the country’s “first past the post” electoral system, activists have added 90 names to the ballot- making the ballot more than a metre long and creating headaches for Elections Canada and the scrutineers.</p> 
  <p>Vote-rich Ontario and neighbouring Quebec promise to be battlegrounds where both parties are looking to either confirm – or rebut – polling that has the Liberals favoured to emerge victorious.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">What have the key players promised?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>There is little daylight between Liberal leader <strong>Mark Carney</strong> and Conservative leader <strong>Pierre Poilievre</strong> on issues of Canada’s relationship with the United States. </p> 
  <p>Both have rejected the idea Canada would ever cede its sovereignty. But while both acknowledge a cost of living crisis and housing unaffordability have left Canadians feeling worse off, they have divergent solutions.</p> 
  <p>Poilievre has promised to cut regulations, diminish the role and size of government in order to facilitate homebuilding. Carney, in contrast, is leaning government as a key figure in any wide-scale building effort.</p> 
  <p>Poilievre, a brash populist and seasoned parliamentary “attack dog”, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/16/canada-conservatives-polls-election">inspired a fervent response from his supporters</a>, who say he has given a voice to those who feel ignored and mocked by political elites. </p> 
  <p>The Tory leader has told supporters he will crack down on crime, toughening sentences for the worst offenders in a move that he admits would breach the country’s charter of rights and freedoms – but promising to use <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/20/notwithstanding-clause-canada-charter-rights">an arcane constitutional mechanism</a> that permits him to do so anyway.</p> 
  <p>Carney has largely run a campaign on his economic and business credentials, tacking the party towards the political centre in an attempt to lure in disaffected voters from both sides of the political aisle. </p> 
  <p>Conservatives have used his CV in their attacks, alleging he used tax loopholes when chair of the investment firm Brookfield. Carney has also faced criticism from the Conservatives for adopting their own policy proposals, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/05/canadas-carbon-tax-is-popular-innovative-and-helps-save-the-planet-but-now-it-faces-the-axe">including removing a controversial carbon tax</a>.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Who are the main candidates?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Five political parties were represented in parliament before the election was called:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Liberal </strong>party, led by <strong>Mark Carney</strong></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Conservative</strong> party, led by <strong>Pierre Poilievre</strong></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Bloc Québécois</strong>, led by<strong> Yves-François Blanchet</strong></p></li>

   <li><p><strong>Green party</strong>,<strong> </strong>led by <strong>Elizabeth May</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>But this election is essentially a two-man race between Carney, the current prime minister, and Pollievre.</p> 
  <p>Carney, 60, is the former governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England. He became prime minister, replacing <strong>Justin Trudeau,</strong> after winning the race to lead the country’s federal Liberal party last month.</p> 
  <p>Poilievre, 45, has taken his Conservative party from the conventional right to the populist flank. He has been compared to <strong>Donald Trump,</strong> promising to put Canada first by rebuilding the military and by taking back control of Canada’s borders.</p>

   <li><p><strong>Trump once again threatened Canada’s independent sovereignty on the eve of the election, </strong>describing the border between the two nations as an “artificially drawn line from many years ago”. In a Truth Social post, the US president urged Canada to become the 51st state of the US, claiming it would bring tax cuts, and increased military power.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Poilievre responded to Trump’s threat by urging him to “stay out of our election”. </strong>“Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state,” the Conservative leader posted on X.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Carney, also in an apparent reference to Trump, said “this is Canada – and we decide what happens here.” </strong>In a video posted on X, the Liberal leader referred to a “crisis” in the US and reminded voters of the threat to Canada’s economy posed by Trump’s tariffs.</p></li>

  <p>Conservative <strong>Pierre Poilievre</strong> <a href="https://x.com/PierrePoilievre/status/1916854056183644583">posted on X</a>: “President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box.</p> 
  <p>“Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state.</p> 
  <p>“Today Canadians can vote for change so we can strengthen our country, stand on our own two feet and stand up to America from a position of strength.”</p> 
  <p>This post appears to be a response to Trump’s earlier post on <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114415618596069518">Truth Social</a>, where he urged Canadians to make their country the 51st US state. Canada’s sovereignty is considered to be on the ballot thanks to Trump, and Poilievre is likely seeking to distance himself from the controversial US president whom he has praised in the past.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump urges Canadians to make their country the 51st state of the US in election intervention</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> issued a statement overnight on the eve of Canada’s election, again threatening the country’s independent sovereignty, and describing the border between the two nations as an “artificially drawn line from many years ago”, in another awkward intervention for Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114415618596069518">Using the Truth Social platform</a>, the US president started by wishing “Good luck to the great people of Canada,” on the eve of the election, and then urged them to become the 51st state of the US, claiming it would bring tax cuts, and increased military power. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Good luck to the great people of Canada. Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the world, have your car, steel, aluminum, lumber, energy, and all other businesses, quadruple in size, with zero tariffs or taxes, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st state of the US. No more artificially drawn line from many years ago. Look how beautiful this land mass would be. Free access with no border. All positives with no negatives. It was meant to be! America can no longer subsidize Canada with the hundreds of billions of dollars a year that we have been spending in the past. It makes no sense unless Canada is a state!</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Poilievre’s party had seemed all set for a significant victory at the Canadian federal election according to polling earlier this year, until Trump began issuing a series of statements threatening Canada’s independence and beginning a trade war between the neighbours, which appeared to revive the fortunes of the Liberal party under recently appointed prime minister Mark Carney.</p>

  <p>Until February, the <strong>Conservatives</strong> enjoyed a 25 point lead over the <strong>Liberals</strong>. Pollsters gave the Tories a 99% chance of winning if an election were called at the time with one of the largest parliamentary majorities in decades. But Donald Trump’s aggressive posture towards Canada has seemingly changed all that: the Conservatives’ dominant lead has disappeared and they found themselves trailing during the twilight of the campaign.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Canadians head to polls in election upturned by Trump</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Canadians are heading to the polls in a federal election overshadowed by fury at Donald Trump’s threats to the country’s sovereignty and fears over his escalating trade war.</strong></p> 
  <p>In the final days of a month-long campaign – described by all party leaders as the most consequential general election in a lifetime – the US president yet again re-inserted himself into the national discussion, with fresh threats to annex the country.</p> 
  <p>Also overshadowing the final day of electioneering was a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/27/several-people-killed-as-car-ploughs-into-vancouver-festival-crowd">deadly attack at a bustling street festival in Vancouver</a> that left the country reeling and forced the prime minister, Mark Carney, to briefly suspend his campaign.</p> 
  <p>As recently as January, Canadian pollsters and political pundits struggled to find fresh ways to describe the bleak prospects for the then prime minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal party, which seemed on track for a catastrophic blowout. The party trailed the rival Conservatives by as many as 27 points in some polls. The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, was poised for the largest and most resounding electoral victory in more than half a century. That strength was the result of a laser-focused, years-long campaign to weaken the governing Liberals and the parties that supported their minority government.</p> 
  <p>But Trump’s detonation of the US’s closest diplomatic and economic relationship has fundamentally reshaped how many feel about their southern neighbour and heavily influenced how Carney, the former central banker who inherited control of the Liberal party in mid March, has shaped his electoral bid. That framing has the possibility of producing a result that would have been unfathomable three months ago.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome and opening summary …</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of today’s crucial election in Canada, as polls open to determine who leads the country, with Liberal leader Mark Carney facing off against the Conservatives’ Pierre Poilievre to see who will emerge as prime minister …</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Carney, prime minister since March, has largely run a campaign on his economic and business credentials, tacking the party towards the political centre in an attempt to lure in disaffected voters</p></li> 
   <li><p>Poilievre is seen as a brash populist and seasoned parliamentary “attack dog”, whose supporters say has given a voice to those who feel ignored and mocked by political elites</p></li> 
   <li><p>After the resignation of Justin Trudeau earlier in the year, and with the Conservative party riding high in the polls, all the signs were that the Liberals’ near-decade in power would come to an end. However, the dramatic interventions of US president Donald Trump into Canadian politics has upended the election</p></li> 
   <li><p>Canada’s federal election consists of 343 separate elections across the country held simultaneously. If either the Liberals or the Conservatives win 172 or more seats, they will have a majority government. Anything less than that and they will be required to work with other parties to pass legislation</p></li> 
   <li><p>A record 7.3 million people have already cast their ballots over four days of advanced voting. Canada has 28.9 million eligible voters</p></li>
