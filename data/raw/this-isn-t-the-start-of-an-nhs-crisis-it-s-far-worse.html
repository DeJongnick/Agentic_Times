<h1>This isn’t the start of an NHS crisis – it’s far worse</h1>

<p>Saying the NHS was already in crisis, as I – and a few other Jeremiahs – did two years ago, meant going out on a limb. Today, hardly anyone says anything else, not least because virtually all our dire predictions have become realities. Even public officials responsible for running and inspecting the NHS, who couldn’t be seen for dust then (the heads of NHS England, NHS Improvement and the Care Quality Commission), are going public on the gravity of the situation and begging the chancellor to do something in this week’s budget.</p> <p>Indeed, how could anyone say things are OK when, in response to an increase in the past seven years of at most 15% in A&amp;E attendances and admissions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/11/nhs-trolley-waits-a-and-e-increased-557-per-cent" title="">waits in A&amp;E</a> have gone up by 350% and waits for admission by 550%? Increasing waiting times are the canary in the mine.</p> <p>However, the Department of Health, whenever challenged with a another example of increasingly poor performance, excessive waits or other pressures, retorts not that this is incorrect but (without irony) that other things in the NHS are fine.</p> <p>In reality, all is not well. Once again, I am afraid, those who have just started to complain are saying too little and too late. The NHS isn’t getting into crisis, as they cautiously say. It is way beyond that and already failing, despite its internationally accepted efficiency.</p> <p>The shortfalls between what is demanded and what can be supplied are chronic, widespread and large, and growing inexorably. They also harm that much-prized efficiency, because you can’t manage efficiently when you are constantly running out of capacity. As a result, we have largely undone the benefits of nearly 30 years of growth and improvement in the NHS.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/09/government-lucky-nhs-wolf-at-door-serious-epidemic-underfunding">The NHS is still standing. But underfunding will soon bring it down | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I spent several years researching why failure happens while also working as an NHS chief executive, much of that time turning around failing NHS trusts. What I found was that if a crisis is unacknowledged, and therefore not dealt with, the organisation in question is unable to honestly confront and then tackle the difficult but treatable problems it faces, and instead minimises or even ignores or denies them. Because of this inaction, things get worse very fast and only bottom out when the true nature of the problems is accepted. Today, it is not individual hospitals or GP practices but the NHS as a whole that is in the incredibly dangerous descent phase. We should be not so much worried as massively alarmed.</p> <p>Whether the chancellor will give the NHS any relief remains to be seen. What is virtually certain is that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/nov/20/budget-boost-for-nhs-to-fall-well-short-of-management-demands" title="">it won’t be enough</a>, or as sustained as it needs to be. A small one-off increase will simply reduce the rate of decline and not be part of a coherent long-term plan to put things right.</p> <p>To fix this failure of the whole “system” requires the equivalent of a Marshall plan for the NHS. That means a commitment at the outset to substantial funding increases year in and year out, in a planned, systematic way; it means increasing the NHS workforce as well as extending and renewing infrastructure so the NHS can deal with the demand already there and into the future. It won’t be cheap. But the alternative is to watch the NHS crumble around us, ultimately with a bill that will be a lot larger in terms of cash and, more importantly, of avoidable pain, suffering and mortality. Surely we don’t want that.</p> <p>• Jan Filochowski spent 20 years as an NHS chief executive, and is the author of Too Good To Fail?</p>
