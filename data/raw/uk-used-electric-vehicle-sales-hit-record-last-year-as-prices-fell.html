<p>A record number of used electric vehicles (EVs) were sold in the UK last year, as prices eased and the choice of cars widened, according to industry data.</p> <p>Total sales of used cars rose by 5.5% in 2024, as 7.6m vehicles changed hands, according to the <a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/2025/02/demand-for-used-evs-rises-to-record-levels-as-second-hand-car-market-grows-in-2024/">Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT)</a>. Sales rose in every month last year, as they did in 2023.</p> <p>Secondhand EVs were more in demand than ever, as consumers and businesses acquired 188,382 cars – 57.4% more than the year before. They made up 2.5% of the overall used car market.</p> <p>Some popular models of used electric car, including the Tesla Model 3 and Kia e-Niro, have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/24/spectacular-bargains-why-now-is-a-great-time-to-buy-an-electric-car-in-the-uk">fallen significantly in price in recent years</a>, and in some cases reached near parity with petrol cars.</p> <p>Colin Walker, the head of transport at the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit, said: “It is no coincidence that such strong sales growth comes on the back of EVs largely reaching price parity with petrols on the secondhand market. It demonstrates that once prices come down, the demand for electric driving is very much there.”</p> <p>Black remains the top colour choice among buyers of secondhand cars and superminis are the most popular car type, the SMMT said.</p> <p>James Hosking, the managing director of AA Cars, said:<strong> </strong>“The used car market is on a roll … With more electric and hybrid vehicles entering the secondhand market, buyers now have a wider selection than ever, helping to drive demand.</p> <p>“This surge underscores a key consumer trend – affordability is king. With household budgets under strain, many are opting for nearly new models over splashing out on a brand-new car.”</p> <p>Carmakers also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/04/record-number-of-electric-cars-were-sold-in-uk-during-2024">sold a record number of new electric cars</a> in the UK last year. Almost a fifth of the 1.95m vehicles sold were electric, up from 16.5% in 2023. Among new cars, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/05/monsters-of-the-road-what-should-the-uk-do-about-suvs">sports utility vehicles were dominant</a>, outselling other popular types of car such as the supermini for the first time. SUV sales were helped by the shift to electric, as bulkier cars have more space for a battery.</p> <p>EV sales have soared in Britain in recent years because of rules forcing manufacturers to sell more every year in an effort to cut the carbon dioxide emissions of transport, which accounted for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/transport-and-environment-statistics-2024/greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-transport-in-2022">28% of all domestic UK carbon pollution</a> in 2022.</p> <p>Under the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, 80% of new cars and 70% of new vans sold in the UK will be zero emission by 2030, increasing to 100% by 2035.</p> <p>However, the government is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/22/electric-shock-carmakers-battle-strict-uk-electric-car-rules-as-big-fines-loom?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other">preparing to relax the ZEV mandate</a> amid falling demand for EVs across the global new car market.</p> <p>Walker said: “With 80% of car sales taking place on the secondhand market, it has a vital role to play if millions of UK households are to access the £1,600 in annual savings that can come from owning an EV. <br><br>“But its growth is dependent on supply, which is why the government’s ZEV mandate has such an important role to play in ensuring that everyone is able to make the move to EVs. The more new EVs are sold today, the quicker the secondhand market will grow.”</p>
