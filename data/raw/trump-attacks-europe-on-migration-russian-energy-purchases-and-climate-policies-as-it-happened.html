 <h2 class="block-title">EU parliament rejects Hungary's request to remove immunity from two MEPs</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Brussels</em></p> 
  <p>In other news, <strong>a European parliament committee has voted to preserve the immunity of the Italian anti-fascist campaigning MEP Ilaria Salis, rejecting a request from the Hungarian government.</strong></p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail">

  </aside> 
  <p>The European parliament’s legal affairs committee was reported by Salis and her allies to have rejected the immunity request, which was put to a secret vote on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>European parliament sources said t<strong>he committee also voted down a separate request from the Hungarian government to lift the immunity of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/07/hungary-politics-peter-magyar-orban-judit-varga-rally-budapest">Hungarian centre-right MEP Péter Magyar</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/18/viktor-orban-hungary-peter-magyar">main challenger</a> to prime minister Viktor Orbán</strong> in next year’s parliamentary elections.</p> 
  <p>Magyar, who founded the Tisza party, is accused by Hungarian authorities of defamation and throwing a man’s phone into the Danube river, in <strong>charges that are widely seen as politically motivated.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>MEPs will have the final say on the fate of the two MEPs next month</strong>, when their cases, alongside several others, will be voted on in the European parliament plenary chamber on 6 October. </p> 
  <p><strong>In most cases, the parliament follows the decision of the lead committee.</strong> Parliamentary immunity is intended to ensure MEPs can carry out their work “without exposure to arbitrary political persecution”, meaning they cannot be subject to any form of legal proceedings or detention because of opinions expressed or their work as MEPs.</p> 
  <p><strong>Salis had been<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/orban-italian-mep-hungary-effort-jail-again-ilaria-salis"> held in pre-trial detention in Hungary for nearly one year</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/30/orban-italian-mep-hungary-effort-jail-again-ilaria-salis"> </a>on charges of assault and membership of an extreme left-wing organisation, related to her participation in a counter demonstration against a neo-Nazi rally in Budapest in February 2023. She denies the charges, which she says could result in a 24-year old jail sentence in Hungary. She was released after being elected as an MEP in June 2024, but has said she is ready to stand trial in Italy, but does not believe she would get a fair trial in Hungary.</p> 
  <p>In a statement on Tuesday Salis said <strong>the vote by the European parliament’s legal affairs committee had been “an important and positive signal”</strong> and she expected all MEPs to uphold this decision when the issue goes to the full parliament in October. </p> 
  <p>She said:<em> </em></p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“I reiterate: defending my immunity does not mean evading justice, but protecting myself from the political persecution of Orbán’s regime. This is why its protection is essential.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Italian authorities remain free to open judicial proceedings against me, as I myself both hope for and strongly call for.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Márton Hajdu</strong>, the head of cabinet for the Tisza delegation in the European parliament, declined to comment on Tuesday’s secret vote, noting the report on Magyar’s immunity was not public. “The accusations and cases are obviously politically fabricated” and Magyar would “fully respect the parliament’s decision” Hajdu said.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in New York</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump took the stage at the United Nations general assembly hall for the first time in six years to launch a full-on assault on the experiment in world government</strong>, which he described as a feckless, corrupt and pernicious global force that should be replaced by his own leadership instead.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, <strong>Trump called for countries to close their borders and expel foreigners,</strong> acccused the UN of leading a “globalist migration agenda”, and told national leaders that the world body was “funding an assault on your countries.”</p> 
  <p>“It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders,” he said in a headline speech to world leaders and visiting delegations in the grand general assembly hall in midtown Manhattan. “You have to end it now… Your countries are going to hell.”</p> 
  <p>Directly addressing European leaders, he accused them of “destroying your heritage” and of allowing international migration because of misplaced “political correctness”.</p> 
  <p>“Your countries are being ruined,” he also said, pointing to UN programs that he said provide food, shelter and debit cards to fund migrant journeys to the United States. “The UN is funding an assault on Western countries”.</p> 
  <p>He repeated an offer to levy heavy tariffs on Russia in order to end its invasion of Ukraine, but said that European countries would first have to cease buying Russian energy products.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump attacks Europe on migration, Russian energy purchases, climate policies - summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>So, <strong>here is a summary of Donald Trump’s blistering UN general assembly speech</strong> in which he attacked European nations telling them “your countries are going to hell” because of migration and green policies and told allies to drop Russian energy imports immediately or otherwise “we are all wasting a lot of time.”</p> 
  <p>Here are some of the key moments from his speech:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Trump<strong> appeared to taunt Russia for being unable to make progress in its war against Ukraine,</strong> saying it was “supposed to be just a quick little skirmish,” but “it’s making them look bad” as “they have been fighting for three years” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/23/copenhagen-oslo-airport-drones-denmark-norway-russia-nato-estonia-europe-live-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d2aea58f088949e62b25d3#block-68d2aea58f088949e62b25d3">16:30</a>).</p></li> 
   <li><p>He <strong>urged European leaders to “immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia”</strong> as he said otherwise “we are all wasting a lot of time,” as they were “funding the war against themselves” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/23/copenhagen-oslo-airport-drones-denmark-norway-russia-nato-estonia-europe-live-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d2af188f08be9448627e6a#block-68d2af188f08be9448627e6a">16:35</a>).</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Repeatedly attacking European approach to migration,</strong> Trump said the continent was in “serious trouble” as he perpetuated a far-right line that it was being “invaded by a force of illegal aliens.” “It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders,” he declared as he warned leaders “your countries are going to hell,” particularly picking up on London with a completely false claim about sharia law<strong> </strong>(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/23/copenhagen-oslo-airport-drones-denmark-norway-russia-nato-estonia-europe-live-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d2b0308f08be9448627e81#block-68d2b0308f08be9448627e81">16:38</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/23/copenhagen-oslo-airport-drones-denmark-norway-russia-nato-estonia-europe-live-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d2b0e48f08be9448627e94#block-68d2b0e48f08be9448627e94">16:42</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/23/copenhagen-oslo-airport-drones-denmark-norway-russia-nato-estonia-europe-live-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d2b1de8f086dd264c976da#block-68d2b1de8f086dd264c976da">16:45</a>).</p></li> 
   <li><p>He also <strong>criticised Europe’s green policies</strong>, calling climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetuated on the world” and a “green scam”, <strong>warning Europeans that “this double-tailed monster” of climate change policies and immigration “destroys everything in its wake” </strong>(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/23/copenhagen-oslo-airport-drones-denmark-norway-russia-nato-estonia-europe-live-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d2b3238f088949e62b2628#block-68d2b3238f088949e62b2628">16:52</a>).</p></li> 
   <li><p>He further <strong>attributed the rise of heat deaths in Europe, caused by human-made global warming, to high electricity prices</strong>, blaming “the global warming hoax” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/23/copenhagen-oslo-airport-drones-denmark-norway-russia-nato-estonia-europe-live-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68d2b5ad8f08be9448627ef7#block-68d2b5ad8f08be9448627ef7">17:02</a>).</p></li>

  <p>In case you missed that earlier, <strong>Trump</strong> repeats his key point once again as he says:</p> 
  <p>“In closing, I just want to repeat that <strong>immigration and the high cost of so called green renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet.</strong>”</p> 
  <p>He then pays tribute to previous generations of leaders who “defined our national identities, their visions forged our magnificent destiny.”</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>Now the righteous task of protecting the nations that they built belongs to each and every one of us.</strong> </em></p> 
   <p><em>So together, let us uphold our sacred duty to our people and to our citizens. Let us protect their borders, ensure their safety, preserve their cultures, treasure and traditions and <strong>fight, fight, fight for their precious dreams</strong> and their cherished freedoms and in friendship and really a beautiful vision.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Let us all work together to build a bright, beautiful planet, a planet that we all share, a planet of peace, in a world that is richer, better and more beautiful than ever before.</em> </p> 
   <p><em>That can happen. It will happen. It will happen. And <strong>I hope it can happen and start right now right at this moment, we’ll turn it around</strong>, we’re going to make our countries, better, safer, more beautiful, we’re going to take care of our people. </em></p> 
   <p><em>Thank you very much.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Trump</strong> once again turns on Europe as he rages about electricity costs in Europe as it’s “so expensive you can’t turn on an air conditioner” which he says leads to excessive deaths caused by heat.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Talking about energy, <strong>Trump</strong> <strong>also mentions the North Sea</strong>, a “tremendous asset for the United Kingdom,” as he says “they have tremendous oil left” there and <strong>urges the UK to drop green policies</strong> to stop “ruining that beautiful Scottish and English countryside with windmills and massive solar panels that go seven miles by seven miles, taking away farmland.”</p> 
  <p><strong>“We are not letting this happen in America,”</strong> he says.</p> 
  <p>He then says <strong>that climate change is “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“<strong>If you</strong> <strong>don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,</strong>” he says.</p> 
  <p>He then returns to migration, as he adds:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“And if you don’t stop people that you’ve never seen before, that you have nothing in common with your country is going to fail.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Trump says he “loves Europe,” but warns <strong>that “this double-tailed monster” of climate change and immigration “destroys everything in its wake.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“You’re doing it because you want to be nice, you want to be politically correct, and you’re destroying your heritage, they must take control strongly,” he says.</p>

  <p>Oh, he’s back to <strong>Europe</strong> and <strong>Germany </strong>in particular.</p> 
  <p>He now praises <strong>Germany</strong>, but in a way that I’m not sure is going to be seen that way over in Berlin, as he says the country was “led down a very sick path, both on immigration, by the way, and on energy” and says this:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“The new leadership and they went back to where they were with fossil fuel and with nuclear, which is good, it’s now safe and you can do it properly.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Trump </strong>is also <em>r<strong>eally</strong></em><strong> angry about European countries buying oil and gas from Russia,</strong> <strong>calling it “embarrassing” and demanding that European countries “immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia” or “otherwise we are all wasting a lot of time.”</strong></p> 
  <p>He says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“But inexcusably, <strong>even Nato countries have not cut off much Russian energy and Russian energy products</strong>, which, as you know, I found out about two weeks ago, and I wasn’t happy. Think of it, <strong>they’re funding the war against themselves.”</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He warns that the US is <strong>“fully prepared to impose a very strong round of powerful tariffs, which would stop the bloodshed, I believe, very quickly”</strong> if Russia doesn’t engage with talks.</p> 
  <p>But adds:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“But <strong>for those tariffs to be effective, European nations, all of you are gathered here right now, would have to join us in adopting the exact same measures.</strong> … </em></p> 
   <p><em>You’re right there, and <strong>Europe has to step it up.</strong> They can’t be doing that, they’re buying from Russia, while they are fighting Russia.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It’s embarrasing to them, and it was very embarrassing to them when I found out about it. I can tell you that <strong>they have to immediately cease all energy purchases from Russia, otherwise, we’re all wasting a lot of time.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em> We’re going to discuss it today with the European nations all gathered here.”</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Most of Trump’s speech is just <strong>him bragging about his track record in the government</strong> as he repeats his claim that he ended seven wars since coming to the office.</p> 
  <p>He directly criticises the UN, as he says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>It’s too bad that I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them</strong>, and sadly, in all cases, <strong>the United Nations did not even try to help in any of them.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>I ended seven wars, dealt with the leaders of each and every one of these countries, and <strong>never even received a phone call from the United Nations offering to help in finalising the deal.</strong>”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He then mocks the UN for a non-functioning escalator and its prompter that doesn’t work.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“This is these are the two things I got from the United Nations: a bad escalator and a bad teleprompter.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He asks <strong>“what is the purpose of the United Nations,”</strong> as he lauds its “tremendous, tremendous potential,” but warns that <strong>“it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up. <strong>It’s empty words, and empty words don’t solve war,</strong>” he says.</p> 
  <p>He then <strong>talks about his historic plans to renovate this building,</strong> but laments that we wasn’t picked for the project, which he calls “corrupt.”</p> 
  <p>When he finally gets to substance, he starts with turning on Iran, which he says “can never be allowed to possess the most dangerous weapon.”</p> 
  <p>Let’s see if he gets to discuss <strong>Russia</strong> or <strong>Ukraine</strong> at some point.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Catch up: Danish PM says airport drone incursion was a ‘serious attack’ on critical infrastructure</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>If you’re only joining us now, here’s our write up on what happened last night as Copenhagen airport had to close for several hours after reported drone sightings, by our Nordic correspondent <strong>Miranda Bryant</strong>.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em><strong>The Danish prime minister has said the country was subjected to the “most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date”</strong> after a drone incursion shut <strong>Copenhagen</strong> airport for several hours.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>Mette Frederiksen</strong> said authorities were still investigating who was behind the suspected hybrid attack, but she said she could not rule out Russia.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Danish police said <strong>two or three large drones that were seen on Monday night close to the airport,</strong> which is also the main airport for southern Sweden, appeared to have been flown by a “capable operator” who was looking to show that they had particular capabilities. No suspects have so far been identified.</em></p> 
   <p><em>The drones in Denmark <strong>came from multiple directions</strong>, turning their lights on and off for several hours before disappearing.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>Oslo airport, Norway’s main aviation hub, was also forced to close</strong> for three hours after two drones were observed there.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>Tens of thousands of passengers were left stranded in the Nordic region by the two incidents and flights had to be diverted.</strong> Authorities in Denmark and Norway are investigating whether the two sightings were related.</em></p>

  <p>“<strong>The incidents in Norway are smaller in scope than the violations against Estonia, Poland and Romania</strong>, in terms of both location and duration. They are nevertheless incidents that we view very seriously,” Norwegian prime minister <strong>Jonas Gahr Støre</strong> said.</p> 
  <p>He added that two incidents occurred over the sea northeast of Vardø in April and August, and the third over an uninhabited area along the land border in East Finnmark in July. </p> 
  <p><strong>The border violations</strong> – involving fighter jets SU-24, SU-33 and L410 Turbolet aircraft – <strong>lasted between one and four minutes</strong>, he said, noting that Norway could not determine if they were deliberate or “due to navigation errors.”</p> 
  <p>“Regardless of the reason, <strong>this is not acceptable</strong> and we have made that clear to the Russian authorities,” Støre said.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Nato’s North Atlantic Council</strong>, which brings together all the allies, <strong>said it “strongly condemns” Russia’s “dangerous” violation of Estonian airspace last week.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a strongly worded statement, it said <strong>the incursion was “part of a wider pattern of increasingly irresponsible Russian behaviour.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“This is the second time in two weeks that the North Atlantic Council has met under Article 4,” it said, with the first meeting called after the large-scale violation of Polish airspace by Russian drones.</p> 
  <p>It added that “several other Allies – including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Romania – have also recently experienced airspace violations by Russia.”</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop.</strong>”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The alliance stressed that it would “reinforce our capabilities and strengthen our deterrence and defence posture, including through effective air defence.”</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Russia should be in no doubt: <strong>Nato and Allies will employ,</strong> in accordance with international law, <strong>all necessary military and non-military tools to defend ourselves and deter all threats from all directions.</strong> We will continue to respond in the manner, timing, and domain of our choosing. <strong>Our commitment to Article 5 is ironclad.”</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The statement stressed that “<strong>allies will not be deterred by these and other irresponsible acts by Russia from their enduring commitments to support Ukraine</strong>, whose security contributes to ours, in the exercise of its inherent right to self-defence against Russia’s brutal and unprovoked war of aggression.”</p>

   <p><em>What <strong>we have seen in terms of Russia is</strong> that they have not ‘accidentally’ violated the airspaces of EU member states, but <strong>this was an intentional violation of the European airspace</strong> and here we see a clear pattern.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Russia is testing the European borders also probing, our resolve and undermining our security.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She later added:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“We still need to wait for the final outcome of investigation, so we will not prejudge this, but when we are putting the things in into context, while again, not prejudging the results of this investigation of the authorities, <strong>we have seen a clear pattern when it comes to launching drones violating our airspace, and this points out to Russia.”</strong></em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: Drones paralyse Nordic airports</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The airports in <strong>Copenhagen</strong> and <strong>Oslo</strong>, the two busiest in the Nordic region, <strong>were shut for hours last night after drones were observed in their airspace late on Monday</strong>, leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded as flights were diverted, delayed and cancelled.</p> 
  <p>The Danish and Norwegian authorities are understood to be in contact in case the two incidents were linked, NRK <a href="https://www.nrk.no/stor-oslo/oslo-lufthavn-stengt-grunnet-droneobservasjoner-1.17581396">reported</a>.</p> 
  <p>Danish prime minister <strong>Mette Frederiksen </strong><a href="https://nyheder.tv2.dk/live/krimi/2025-09-22-droner-forstyrrer-luftrummet-over-koebenhavns-lufthavn">told</a> broadcaster TV2 in a written comment that the disruption at Copenhagen was <strong>“the most serious attack on Danish critical infrastructure to date.”</strong></p> 
  <p>“It says something about the times we live in and what we as a society must be prepared to deal with,’ she said, adding <strong>the authorities were “not ruling out any options in relation who is behind this.”</strong></p> 
  <p>She added:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“And <strong>it is clear that this fits in with the developments we have seen recently with other drone attacks, airspace violations and hacker attacks</strong> on European airports.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Who could she <em>possibly</em> be thinking of?</p> 
  <p>Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> appeared to believe that Russia was behind the incident, raising it during a meeting with IMF managing director, <strong>Kristalina Georgieva.</strong></p> 
  <p>The official readout <a href="https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/volodimir-zelenskij-i-kristalina-georgiyeva-obgovorili-progr-100269">on the president’s website</a> said the pair “discussed Russia’s violations of the airspace of Nato member states, including … in Copenhagen.”</p> 
  <p>“The President emphasised that <strong>if there is no resolute response from the allies</strong> – both states and institutions – to these provocations, <strong>Russia will continue its aggressive actions,</strong> testing the societies of European and Nato countries,” it said.</p> 
  <p>We should hear from the Danish police shortly and get more updates throughout the day.</p> 
  <p>I will bring you all the key updates here.</p> 
  <p>It’s <strong>Tuesday, 23 September 2025,</strong> it’s <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> here, and this is <strong>Europe Live.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Good morning.</strong></p>
