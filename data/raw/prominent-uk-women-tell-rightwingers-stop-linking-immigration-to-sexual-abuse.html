<p>Prominent women including cultural figures, politicians and campaigners have signed a letter criticising rightwing attempts to link sexual violence in Britain to asylum seekers.</p> <p>Signatories include the musicians Paloma Faith, Charlotte Church and Anoushka Shankar as well as Labour, Green and independent MPs including Kim Johnson, Ellie Chowns, Diane Abbott and Zarah Sultana.</p> <p>“We reject the far right’s racist lies about ‘protecting’ women and girls. They are not defenders of women – they exploit violence against women to fuel hate and division,” the letter says.</p> <p>The open letter, titled Women Against the Far Right, follows a surge in protests outside accommodation housing asylum seekers and far-right attempts to exploit a number of cases of alleged sexual crimes involving asylum seekers.</p> <p>Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, has <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage-attacked-jess-phillips-35789937">sought to link government immigration policies</a> to a rise in sexual offences. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, who joined protesters outside asylum accommodation in Epping, Essex, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14986271/Top-Tory-fears-daughters-boat-migrants-asylum-seeker-crimes.html">said last month </a>that asylum seekers with “medieval attitudes” coming to Britain meant he was afraid for the safety of his three young daughters.</p> <p>The letter, which has been coordinated by Stand up to Racism, adds: “Violence against women and girls is a serious and urgent issue. But it will never be solved by the likes of Nigel Farage and Robert Jenrick targeting refugees, Muslims and migrants.</p> <p>“There is no evidence that people seeking refuge are more likely to commit acts of sexual violence. Many are themselves survivors of violence, war, and persecution. Blaming them distracts from tackling the deep-rooted causes of abuse and from holding those truly responsible to account.”</p> <p>The letter accuses the far right of seizing on lies and spreading misinformation to mobilise protests outside hotels housing refugees – including women and children – in a move which, the letter says, does nothing to make women safer.</p>    <p>It references a Guardian report that found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/26/two-in-five-arrested-for-last-summers-uk-riots-had-been-reported-for-domestic-abuse">two in five of those arrested in last year’s far-right riots</a> had been reported to the police for domestic abuse.</p> <p>“The truth is that sexual violence is endemic across society and far too often ignored by those in power,” the letter adds. “Public services for women, children, victims and survivors have been cut to the bone, and too many cases are left without justice.”</p> <p>Signatories to the letter also include the Labour MPs Nadia Whittome, Bell Ribeiro-Addy and Mary Kelly Foy, the Labour peer Shami Chakrabarti, and the general secretaries of unions including the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union, the Public and Commercial Services Union and the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association.</p> <p>Others include Sarah Kilpatrick, president of the National Education Union, the broadcaster and DJ Annie Macmanus and groups including Abortion Rights UK.</p> <p>The signatories say they are backing a gathering later this month to oppose a major demonstration being organised in London by the far-right activist known as Tommy Robinson.</p> <p>The protests outside hotels and accommodation housing asylum seekers have been accompanied by online claims aimed at creating a narrative that the residents present a threat to women and girls.</p> <p>Local people have often been centrally involved in the protests, which have included so-called pink protests with women and young girls at the forefront, but far-right activists have also been prominent.</p> <p>A number of protests have followed cases such as that of an asylum seeker in Epping who is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/27/man-whose-arrest-sparked-asylum-hotel-protests-tells-court-he-did-not-touch-girls">accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl</a>. The case of Hadush Kebatu, from Ethiopia, who denies the charges against him, has been adjourned until 4 September.</p> <p>Claims such as one by Jenrick that 40% of sexual crimes in London last year were committed by foreign nationals appear to have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/05/disputed-or-debunked-claims-about-migration-and-crime-uk">based on muddled statistics</a>.</p> <p>Claims by Farage linking sexual offences and immigration <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/fact-checking-farage-are-foreigners-more-likely-than-britons-to-commit-sexual-offences-13407029">are also strongly</a> disputed, while the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/06/police-deny-reform-claim-cover-up-immigration-warwickshire">police have hit back</a> at Reform UK’s allegation of a “cover-up” over the immigration status of two Afghan men being prosecuted in connection with the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/apr/22/home-office-foreign-criminals-nationalities-uk">Migrant charities and MPs this year accused</a> the government of pandering to racism and stoking the possibility of riots after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office">Home Office</a> said it would publish the nationalities of foreign criminals in the UK for the first time. Home Office sources have said the government wanted the public to be “better informed” about foreign criminals, including where they came from.</p>
