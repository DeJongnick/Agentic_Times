<p>Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/trump-tariffs-pause-china">surprise decision</a> to pause the hefty tariffs he had just imposed on dozens of countries brought relief for battered global stock markets, even as he ratcheted up a trade war with China.</p> <p>Markets across Asia rose sharply on Thursday on signs that the US president’s trade war may not prove as damaging to the global economy as feared.</p> <p>European markets, which had closed when Trump announced the 90-day pause on Wednesday, jumped at the start of Thursday’s session. The FTSE 100 was up 352 points, or 4.6%, at 8,031 points, continuing the relief rally. Germany’s Dax rose 5.8% while France’s Cac 40 was up 5.8%, and Spain’s Ibex 35 climbed 3.4%.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/04/stock_markets_europe_thur/giv-32554SUxD8DiWjpAm/" data-alt="."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/04/stock_markets_europe_thur/giv-32554SUxD8DiWjpAm/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The market moves were further supported by concessions from the EU. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, confirmed on Thursday that the EU will put its own tariff countermeasures against the US – which were due to kick in on 15 April – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/apr/10/trump-tariffs-us-china-eu-trade-war-markets-latest-news-updates">on hold for 90 days</a>.</p> <p>The decision triggered a rally in the euro, pushing the single currency up more than a cent against the US dollar to $1.108, up 1.1% on Thursday. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/10/us-china-trade-war-intensifies-as-beijings-tariffs-come-into-effect-after-trump-pause">US-China trade war intensifies as Beijing’s tariffs come into effect after Trump pause</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump’s U-turn, which came less than 24 hours after steep new tariffs kicked in on most trading partners, followed the most intense episode of financial market volatility since the early days of the Covid pandemic.</p> <p>The upheaval erased trillions of dollars from stock markets and led to an unsettling rise in US government bond yields that appeared to catch Trump’s attention.</p> <p>“I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/10/us-china-trade-war-intensifies-as-beijings-tariffs-come-into-effect-after-trump-pause">Trump told reporters after the announcement</a>.</p> <p>US stock indexes <a href="reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL3N3QN1UR">shot higher</a> on the news, with the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index closing 9.5% higher, and the relief continued into Asian trading.</p> <p>Taiwan stocks soared 9.2% in early trading on Thursday.

The Democratic senator Adam Schiff called for an investigation, saying: “These constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading.</p> <p>“Who in the administration knew about Trump’s latest tariff flip-flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell stocks, and profit at the public’s expense? I’m writing to the White House – the public has a right to know.”</p> <p>European futures also pointed to big gains but there were already signs the rally might be short-lived, with US stock futures trading lower. <a href="reuters://REALTIME/verb=NewsStory/ric=nL3N3QO02U">Oil prices</a> also fell about 1%, extending a grim spell fuelled by fears that the trade tensions could push the global economy towards recession.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/B9G8s/2/" data-alt="Graph showing the falls in global markets after Trump’s tariff announcement"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/B9G8s/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has repeatedly threatened an array of punitive measures on trading partners, only to revoke some of them at the last minute. The on-again, off-again approach has baffled world leaders and spooked business executives.</p> <p>The US Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, asserted that the pullback had been part of the plan to bring countries to the bargaining table. Trump, though, later indicated that the near panic in markets that had unfolded since his 2 April announcements had factored into his thinking.</p> <p>Despite insisting for days that his policies would never change, he told reporters on Wednesday: “You have to be flexible.”</p> <p>But he kept the pressure on China, the world’s second-largest economy and the second-biggest provider of US imports. Trump immediately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/apr/10/trump-tariffs-us-china-eu-trade-war-markets-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-67f7e1c98f0861692b423e20#block-67f7e1c98f0861692b423e20">increased the tariff on Chinese imports to 145%</a> from the 104% level that kicked in on Wednesday.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eWVHM/5/" data-alt="."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/eWVHM/5/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Beijing may again respond in kind after slapping 84% tariffs on US imports on Wednesday to match Trump’s earlier salvo. It has repeatedly said it will “fight to the end” in the escalating trade war between the world’s top two economies.</p> <p>“We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down,” China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning posted on X on Thursday.</p> <p>Trump said a resolution with China on trade was also possible. However, officials have said they will prioritise talks with other countries, with Vietnam, Japan and South Korea among those lining up to try to strike a bargain.</p> <p>“China wants to make a deal,” Trump said. “They just don’t know how quite to go about it.”</p> <p><em>Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>
