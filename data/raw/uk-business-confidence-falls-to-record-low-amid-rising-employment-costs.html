<p>Business confidence fell to its lowest level on record in September, driven by concerns over soaring costs, according to a survey of bosses.</p> <p>Topping the unease were labour costs, with energy prices also weighing on the outlook.</p> <p>Anna Leach, the chief economist at the Institute of Directors (IoD), said: “Business confidence has plumbed new depths in September, following a fleeting improvement at the tag-end of summer.</p> <p>“Conditions worsened across the board, with cost expectations hitting a record high, driven notably by employment costs.”</p> <p>“The chancellor’s conference speech rightly reiterated the role that fiscal credibility has in providing the platform for growth.”</p> <p>She urged Rachel Reeves to deliver a budget in November that is growth-focused and “has business at its heart”.</p> <p>It came after two Bank of England policymakers said UK inflation may not fall as fast as expected next year, as a recent spike in food prices could persist into 2026.</p> <p>Clare Lombardelli, a deputy governor at the Bank, said central bankers should be careful about assuming inflation shocks are temporary.</p> <p>Catherine Mann, who also sits on the Bank’s nine-person rate-setting monetary policy committee (MPC), said she thought Britain’s inflation rate had become persistently high – although that did not mean further interest rate cuts were completely off the table.</p> <p>“I believe that [an] inflation persistence scenario is playing out,” she said.</p> <p>Mann, who was speaking at a Financial Times event, and Lombardelli, who was attending a conference in Finland, voted against the BoE’s most recent interest rate cut in August. They were outvoted by a majority of MPC members who said a slowdown in economic growth would support a fall in inflation over the next year to 2% from a likely peak of 4% in September.</p> <p>Reeves said at the Labour conference that the economic stability provided by the government meant ministers could take some credit for five cuts to interest rates over the last year.</p> <p>However, predictions by leading economists that inflation will prove to be sticky, preventing further cuts by the central bank, would limit interest rate cuts, denting the chancellor’s budget plans.</p> <p>The MPC member Sarah Breeden, speaking at Cardiff Business School, adopted a more dovish stance than her fellow rate-setters. She said on Tuesday it was unlikely that the strength of inflation this year would persist into 2026.</p> <p>She said: “The good news is that this ‘hump’ reflects external shocks, and in the current environment it is unlikely, in my judgment, to lead to additional inflationary pressures.</p> <p>“Moreover, I have not seen any evidence yet to suggest that the underlying disinflationary process from past shocks is veering off track. So far so good.”</p>
