New business intakes fell, extending a period of falling sales that began in June.</p> <p><strong>Cyrus de la Rubia</strong>, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The eurozone economy has grown for the fifth month in a row, but this interpretation requires a certain amount of goodwill, as the overall index of 50.2 is only marginally above the expansion threshold and the pace of growth also slowed slightly in May. This development is due to a slight decline in activity in the service sector, while manufacturing output showed the same moderate growth as in the previous month. For the rest of the year, we are confident that further key interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank and fiscal stimulus, particularly from Germany, will be sufficient to offset the negative effects of higher tariffs and increased uncertainty.</p> <p>The European Central Bank will not be entirely satisfied with the PMI price data. In the services sector, which is closely watched for inflation, the rate of increase in sales prices fell again. However, the situation has worsened somewhat with regard to cost increases, which are already relatively high. This will probably not prevent the ECB from lowering key interest rates again at its meeting on June 5, partly because goods prices have fallen slightly and at an accelerated pace.</p> <p><strong>Southern Europe is ensuring that the service sector as a whole is spared a slump.</strong> Solid growth in this sector in Italy and the weaker but still positive expansion rate in Spain are helping to offset the mild decline in activity in France and the relatively sharp drop in Germany. If the southern European countries can maintain their momentum to some extent, while German service providers begin to benefit from expansionary fiscal policy, a recovery in this sector is quite possible this year. Confidence that this will happen has increased slightly, but is still not particularly strong by historical standards.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-04T10:42:59.002Z">at 11.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-684012128f083ea789b9229c" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/lisaocarroll"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-04T09:32:51.476Z">10.32am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">EU trade commissioner: Talks with US 'moving in right direction'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>News just in from my colleague Lisa O’Carroll in Brussels.</p> <p>Talks between the EU and the US to strike a tariff deal are moving swiftly, with EU trade commissioner <strong>Maroš Šefčovič</strong> saying they are “moving in the right direction” following a meeting with US trade representative <strong>Jamieson Greer</strong> in Paris.</p> <p>Both sides had previously agreed to intensify talks with a view to finding a breakthrough and path to settle differences by Sunday.</p> <p>Šefčovič said in a social media post:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We are advancing in the right direction at pace – and staying in close contact to maintain the momentum.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also described the meeting as “productive and constructive” – this hints at an EU exemption from <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s latest tariff decision to double import duties to 50% on steel and aluminium.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/MarosSefcovic/status/1930191214655012894">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Had a productive and constructive discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/USTradeRep?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@USTradeRep</a> Ambassador Greer on the margins of the <a href="https://twitter.com/OECD?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OECD</a> Trade Ministerial.<br><br>We&#39;re advancing in the right direction at pace - and staying in close contact to maintain the momentum. <a href="https://t.co/Epmb7kejFZ">pic.twitter.com/Epmb7kejFZ</a></p>&mdash; Maroš Šefčovič🇪🇺 (@MarosSefcovic) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarosSefcovic/status/1930191214655012894?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2025</a></blockquote>   </figure> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-04T09:42:07.429Z">at 10.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-684010648f083ea789b92281" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-04T09:29:23.337Z">10.29am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK PMI survey points to steady growth</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>A monthly snapshot has painted a picture of steady, if unspectacular, growth in the UK.</p> <p>The composite purchasing managers’ index from S&amp;P Global, which combines the monthly manufacturing and services surveys, rose to 50.3 in May, from 48.5 in April, above the first estimate of 49.4.
