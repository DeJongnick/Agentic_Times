<p>Hiking shoes and outdoor gear are probably a significant source of microplastic pollution in the wilderness, <a href="https://adkh2h.org/wp-content/uploads/Return-to-Lake-Tear-Expedition-Report-September-2025.pdf">new research</a> that checked for the pernicious material in several Adirondack mountain lakes in upstate New York suggests.</p> <p>Researchers measured microplastic levels in two lakes that are the among highest sources of water for the Hudson River – one that sees heavy foot traffic from hikers, and another lake that is far away from a path and rarely touched by human activity.</p> <p>The samples from the lake that sees heavier foot traffic showed levels that were about 23 times higher.</p> <p>Soft-soled trail shoes and synthetic clothing “appear to be significant contributors to microplastics finding their way into these remote, otherwise pristine waters”, said Tim Keyes, a Sacred Heart University data scientist, who independently worked on the project with his company, Evergreen Business Analytics, and the Adirondack Hamlet to Huts non-profit.</p> <p>Microplastics are tiny bits of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/plastic">plastic</a> either intentionally added to consumer goods, or which are products of larger plastics breaking down. The particles may contain any number of 16,000 plastic chemicals, of which many, such as BPA, phthalates and Pfas, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/toxic-chemicals-substances/how-plastic-can-harm-your-health-a2854312421/">present serious health risks</a>.</p> <p>The substance has been found throughout the human body, and can cross the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/27/microplastics-found-every-human-placenta-tested-study-health-impact#:~:text=The%20research%2C%20published%20in%20the,common%20plastics%20detected%2C%20after%20polyethylene.">placental</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/aug/21/microplastics-brain-pollution-health">brain</a> barriers. Among other issues, microplastics are linked to chronic pulmonary inflammation, which can lead to lung cancer.</p> <p>Previous <a href="https://noc.ac.uk/news/70-ocean-microplastics-are-type-found-clothes-textiles-fishing-gear-europe-hotspot">research found</a> that as much as 70% of microplastics in ocean samples were from apparel. Meanwhile, the substance has been found in clouds and in precipitation samples.</p> <p>Keyes in 2023 sampled for microplastics in Lake Tear of the Clouds, which sits at about 4,300ft (1,300 meters). It sees heavy hiker traffic because it is adjacent to a trail segment that is part of several larger trails.</p> <p>Keyes sent the sample to an independent lab that found 9.45 particles per milliliter (mL). Because the area only had hiker traffic, “it was surmised that microplastic pollution was being brought to the area largely by airborne deposition”, the authors wrote, meaning primarily via precipitation.</p> <p>Now they suspect they were wrong. The authors returned two years later in early 2025 to sample Lake Tear, as well as Moss Pond, which the paper describes as “a remote, trailless body of water” at a similar elevation.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/03/california-governor-gavin-newsom-pfas-cookware-bill">California governor under pressure over bill to ban cookware made with Pfas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The independent lab detected about 0.73 particles per mL in Moss Pond, and about 16.54 particles per mL in Lake Tear – a roughly 23-fold difference that suggests the hiker traffic is playing a major role. Lightweight trail shoes can shed microplastics similar to tires, which are another source of pollution, Keyes said.</p> <p>“It’s a pretty clear indication given the stark difference in microplastic levels between the sister body of water that’s a bushwack away compared to Lake Tear, which is on this thoroughfare for hikers that sees tens of thousands of people annually,” Keyes said.</p> <p>Sami Romanick, a microplastics researcher with the Environmental Working Group non-profit who was not involved with the study, said the research’s methodology and design were sound. She agreed with the conclusion that the contamination was probably caused by hiking gear.</p> <p>“It’s a reasonable explanation that’s supported by the data,” Romanick said.</p> <p>The authors say the findings are meant to generate awareness and underscore why industry should produce clothing and shoes that will shed fewer microplastics. Hikers should consider wearing hard-rubber-sole shoes that release less plastic compared with soft soles, and wear synthetic fiber clothing underneath those made with natural fibers.</p>
