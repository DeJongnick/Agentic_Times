<p>Ukraine says it has conducted a long-range drone attack on a supply ship that it claims was carrying drone components from Iran, striking it at a port north of the Caspian Sea, in a show of force hours before Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/15/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-meeting-anchorage-alaska-ukraine-war-europe-live-latest-updates-news">meet for a summit in Alaska</a>.</p> <p>Photographs showed a partially sunken cargo vessel at Olya, near Astrakhan, more than 500 miles from the frontline. Ukraine’s military claimed credit for the attack and the overnight bombing of an oil refinery at Samara on the Volga River, deep inside Russia.</p> <p>Ukraine’s general staff said the ship hit, the Port Olya-4, was “loaded with components” for Shahed-type drones “and ammunition from Iran”. The port, it added, was an “important logistics hub for the supply of military goods”.</p> <p>Kyiv’s forces have repeatedly shown they can strike military logistics and energy targets hundreds of miles inside Russia, although the attacks only appear to have a dampening impact on the Kremlin’s long-term war effort.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/14/keir-starmer-to-meet-volodymyr-zelenskyy-in-downing-street">Putin ready to make Ukraine deal, Trump says before Alaska summit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the US president prepares to meet his Russian counterpart in Alaska to discuss ending the Ukraine war and other bilateral issues, Ukraine remains under pressure in the battle on land, as demonstrated by a breach in its defences in the eastern Donbas last weekend.</p> <p>Several Russian saboteur groups pierced the Ukrainian frontlines by about 6 miles in a strategically important part of the front in Donetsk province near the road junction of Dobropillya, where supply routes had passed east to Kramatorsk.</p> <p>On Friday troops from Kyiv’s elite Azov Corps were leading efforts alongside the 79th and 82nd brigades to mop up the infiltration, but the breach, while apparently contained, has not been eliminated.</p> <p>On Friday Ukraine’s president, Voldoymyr Zelenskyy, said Ukraine was succeeding in “countering the attempts of Russian forces to gain a foothold” – and said a decision had been made to further reinforce the sector and the regional frontline.</p> <p>Troop shortages and the sheer length of the active frontline, at more than 600 miles long, mean the point of contact is not continuously held.

The plant, the general staff said, “produces a wide range of fuels, including aviation kerosene” and supplied the country’s military.</p> <p>The Russian governor of Samara said a drone attack caused a fire at an unspecified “industrial enterprise” but that it had been put out quickly.</p> <p>The Shahed drones that bomb Ukraine’s cities nightly were designed in Iran, and earlier in the war Russia was dependent on supply from Tehran, with shipments travelling over the Caspian Sea between the two countries.</p> <p>However, Russia now makes Shahed drones in two factories of its own after the technology was shared – meaning Iran, also weakened after its own war with Israel, is a less significant military support.</p>
