He could not afford a proper camera, so he filmed and photographed with his phone.</p> <p>Over the last five months, as Gaza’s humanitarian crisis worsened and hunger began to spread throughout the strip, his family said Abu Taha began to work as a humanitarian. He focused on specific cases through his video reports, sending urgent appeals for sick children and the wounded who needed aid.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2FMoaz_loop_still.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2FMoazLoop.mp4" data-alt="Moaz Abu Taha with colleagues while reporting in Gaza "> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2FMoaz_loop_still.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F26%2FMoazLoop.mp4">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Moaz Abu Taha with colleagues while reporting in Gaza</figcaption> </figure>  <p>He had been preparing for his engagement when he was killed.</p> <p>“Moaz was the youngest in our family, the spoiled one. He loved his work deeply, even though it hadn’t been his original career. He was very social and enjoyed making new friends everywhere,” said Adly Abu Taha, Moaz’s older brother.</p> <h2>Hussam al-Masri</h2>    <p>Hussam al-Masri was a 48-year-old cameraman who worked with Reuters and was the father of two sons and two daughters.</p> <p>Al-Masri started his career at a young age, helping his father, a journalist, set up his a camera.</p> <p>“He held his first camera in 1993 and from that year until now, almost 32 years, there was never a day without a camera by his side,” said Ezz al-Din al-Masri, Hussam’s father.</p> <p>He was known for his bravery in the field and his commitment to the story. His father recounted how he was the last journalist to remain in Nasser hospital during Israel’s first invasion of Khan Younis in southern Gaza.</p> <p>“To my surprise, he called me, saying he was still broadcasting from inside the hospital as the army surrounded them. I fought with him, demanding he leave immediately,” Ezz al-Din said.</p> <p>Al-Masri continued his coverage throughout the war, despite his wife’s deteriorating health as she struggled to get treatment for cancer. In the days before his death, he had been seeking her evacuation from Gaza. His friends and fellow journalists have kept up his appeal, advocating for her medical evacuation.</p> <p>“Hussam, even though he was nearing 49 years old, always carried the spirit of a child and an innocent, tender heart. I never felt that he could grow old or become an elder. I always treated him as my mischievous little boy,” Ezz al-Din said.</p> <p>“But now, after his death, I was struck by the fact that he had aged without me realising it.”</p> <h2>Ahmed Abu Aziz</h2>    <p>Ahmed Abu Aziz was a 29-year-old freelance journalist who worked for various outlets, such as Middle East Eye and Quds Feed.</p> <p>He was described as “the journalist who never stopped” by his colleagues at Middle East Eye, and was known for his bravery. He travelled across the Gaza Strip to get his story, despite the danger it posed. He based himself in Nasser hospital, where he covered the impact of Israel’s attacks on people across Gaza.</p> <p>Abu Aziz was acutely aware of the danger he was in as a journalist in Gaza. He lost two colleagues dear to him early on in the war, driving home how fragile his own safety was. Writing a first-person piece for Middle East Eye last year, he said his work often made him feel lonely, but he would persist.</p> <p>“It felt like I was all alone and the only one left on the ground as so many more of my colleagues were being killed,” Abu Aziz wrote.</p> <p>Abu Aziz married in July 2024. His wife, Lurzan Abu Aziz, who found his body after the strike, described how much he supported and encouraged her to further her education. She was studying for her PhD in law, and he a PhD in media.</p> <p>“His dream was for us to earn our doctorates together. He always urged me to defend my dissertation no matter what, and he encouraged me endlessly. We were supposed to defend our theses together this year, but he left and I am alone, grieving his loss,” said Lurzan, 28. </p> <h2>Mohammad Salama</h2>    <p>Mohammad Salama was a 24-year old photojournalist and cameraman who worked with Al Jazeera.</p> <p>He grew up just east of Khan Younis and knew he wanted to be a photojournalist from a young age, earning a diploma in photography and shadowing more established journalists.

The main image on an earlier version said that Hussam al-Masri was Ahmed Abu Aziz and vice versa, and an image of Hussam was used lower down when it should have been of Ahmed. Also, Ezz al-Din al-Masri is Hussam al-Masri’s father, not his mother as was said earlier.</p>
