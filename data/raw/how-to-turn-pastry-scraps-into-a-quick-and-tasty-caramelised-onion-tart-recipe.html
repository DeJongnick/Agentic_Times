<p>This is my quick version of pissaladière, and it transforms a small amount of leftover pastry scraps into a spontaneous treat. Keep and combine any trimmings into a ball and re-roll as and when required. Pastry keeps well in the freezer, and by skipping two time-consuming steps in the traditional recipe – that is, making the pastry and caramelising the onions – this one comes together about an hour faster. Instead, the onions are cooked upside down, steaming and caramelising beneath a blanket of pastry with anchovies and black olives for a fast, fun twist on a French classic. And if you have less pastry, you can always halve the recipe.</p> <h2>Quick upside-down pissaladière tarts</h2> <p>The current wave of upside-down tarts, which went viral on TikTok and Instagram a couple of years ago, may have begun with Lily Ghodrati’s delicious and simple <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lilyghodrati/video/7220865716440943877">peach and honey puff pastry</a> or Dominic Franks’ <a href="https://www.dominthekitchen.com/2023/05/upside-down-puff-pastry-onion-tart-the-one-that-went-viral.html">inspirational onion tart</a>, which even led to a whole book on upside-down cooking. I’ve also been having a lot of fun cooking upside down lately, from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/share/_eufYVuDq">my extra-long leek tart</a> to these speedy pissaladière tartlets. It’s a simple, playful way to create something that feels extra-special.</p> <p>Makes <strong>4 individual tarts</strong></p> <p><strong>1 red onion</strong><strong><br>2 tbsp olive oil<br>1 tbsp honey<br>Salt and black pepper<br></strong><strong>8 anchovies</strong> (or 4, for a milder taste)<br><strong>Pitted black olives</strong>, to taste<br><strong>120g pastry</strong> – I used puff but shortcrust works, too</p> <p>Heat the oven to 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas 6½. Peel and trim the onion, then cut into four thick, round slices (cross-sections of onion). Line a hob-appropriate oven sheet with baking paper, then imagine where you will put each piece of onion. Drizzle those areas with olive oil and honey, then season. Lay two anchovies on top of each seasoned patch and cover them with a piece of onion. Nestle a few black olives in and around the onions, then season with a little more olive oil, honey, salt and pepper.</p> <p>Turn on two adjacent hob rings to a medium heat, put the tray on top of the rings and leave the onions to cook undisturbed for five minutes.</p>  <!-- Recipe element -->  <p>Meanwhile, on a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry and cut it into four rectangles just large enough to cover each piece of onion. Carefully lay one pastry rectangle on top of each piece of onion, press down around the edges with the back of a fork, then bake for 20 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Lay a board on top of the pastry tray, then flip to invert the tarts on to the board. Carefully peel away the paper and serve.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 30 October 2025, to correct the spelling of Dominic Franks’ first name.</p>
