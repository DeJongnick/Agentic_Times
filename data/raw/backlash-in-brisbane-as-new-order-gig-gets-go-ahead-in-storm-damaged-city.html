<p>Live music promoters TEG Group and British band New Order are facing a public backlash after announcing they would go ahead with a scheduled concert in Brisbane as the city grapples with major flooding in the wake of ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred.</p> 
<p>The concert, part of the Manchester synth-pop pioneers’ Australian tour, is set to take place Tuesday night at Riverstage, a 9,500-capacity outdoor venue located on Brisbane river, within the city’s Botanic Gardens.</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon, TEG Live announced the scheduled concert would go ahead. Their announcement on Facebook had received more than 60 comments at time of publication, mostly from ticket-holders complaining about the decision.</p> 
<p>Commenters wrote that many roads were still cut, that people were still cleaning up, and queried the safety of the show going ahead on waterlogged grounds.</p> 
<p>“We’d love to see you, but not like this … it’s also tone deaf,” one commenter wrote.</p> 
<p>“At the very least they should be offering refunds to those unable to make it,” wrote another.</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon, as rainfall eased and flood waters receded in Brisbane, more than 100,000 homes and businesses remained without power, and public transport services were still restricted. Many roads in and around the city remain closed due to flooding.</p> 
<p>“I think it’s disgusting you are going ahead with this only a day after the rain has stopped and caused devastation around here. Most of the car parks are closed and [there is] hardly any public transport so how do we get there anyway?” questioned one commenter.</p> 
<p>In an email to Guardian Australia, a spokesperson for TEG Live confirmed the concert would go ahead, without responding to specific questions.</p>

<p>The TEG Live spokesperson claimed that Brisbane city council, which manages the Riverstage, had confirmed that the state of the grounds was “fine to proceed”. The council declined to respond to specific questions, saying they were best put to TEG Live or the ticket provider, Ticketek.</p> 
<p>A council spokesperson said that the council’s King George Square and Wickham Terrace car parks remained open, and that the latest information on public transport was available via the Translink site.</p> 
<p>The Translink site advises that while some services have resumed, there are ongoing disruptions and cancellations, with a disclaimer that real-time information <a href="https://jp.translink.com.au/plan-your-journey/journey-planner">may not be accurate</a>.</p> 
<p>The Ticketek website includes <a href="https://help.ticketek.com.au/hc/en-us/requests/new">a portal via which refunds can be requested</a>.</p> 
<p>Last week, US pop-punk band Green Day cancelled a concert scheduled for 5 March at Cbus Stadium on the Gold Coast, ahead of the cyclone’s arrival. Refunds were provided, with the show unable to be rescheduled.</p> 
<p>Canadian post-hardcore group Alexisonfire rescheduled their 8 March Riverstage gig to two indoor shows at Fortitude Music Hall on 15 and 16 March.</p> 
<p>The clean-up is continuing in south-east Queensland in Alfred’s wake, with nearly 120,000 properties still without power. Many people forced to evacuate their homes are only just returning to inspect the damage.</p> 
<p>Intermittent showers are forecast in Brisbane tonight.</p>
