<p>Transgender advocates have criticised the panel assembled to conduct the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/10/queensland-government-held-21-minute-consultation-on-puberty-blocker-ban-at-same-time-it-announced-decision">Queensland government’s review of puberty blockers</a> for lacking experts in gender affirming care and people with lived experience of trans healthcare.</p> <p>The state government opened its <a href="https://www.health.qld.gov.au/research-reports/reports/review-investigation/hormone-therapies-review">independent review of stage 1 and stage 2 hormone therapies in Queensland’s public paediatric gender services</a> to public submissions last week, but kept the panel conducting the review secret.</p> <p>The seven members were made public on Wednesday.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The panel includes three medical specialists; psychiatrists Ruth Vine and Beth Kotze, and endocrinologist Bruce Robinson. It also includes academics Eleanor Milligan, Lisa Brophy, Malcolm Smith and a former judge, Kerry O’Brien.</p> <p>The Australian Professional Association for Trans Health chief executive, Eloise Brook, criticised the panel’s composition, saying: “Imagine this was a review of cardiac services and there were no cardiologists on the review panel.”</p> <p>Brook said that even though the health professionals were distinguished in their fields, none were experts in providing healthcare for trans children.</p> <p>Without such expertise, she said, the panel wasn’t “credible”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/09/queenslands-ban-on-puberty-blockers-and-hormones-left-liam-devastated-a-victorian-doctor-stepped-in">Queensland’s ban on puberty blockers and hormones left Liam devastated.
