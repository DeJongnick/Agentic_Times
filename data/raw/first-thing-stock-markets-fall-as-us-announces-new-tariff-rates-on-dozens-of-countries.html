<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Donald Trump has signed an executive order <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/31/trump-extends-deadline-tariff-deal-mexico">imposing tariffs ranging from 10% to 41%</a> on imports from dozens of trade partners, in his latest attempt to reshape the global economy. </p> <p>However, in a minor reprieve that opens the door to further negotiations, the White House said these measures would take effect in a week, not Friday, the deadline previously set by Trump.</p> <p>The new rates, which Trump sees as benefiting US exporters, unleash a fresh round of uncertainty for dozens of countries, including longtime US allies. It has also raised fears of inflation in the US.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Which countries have higher rates?</strong> Rates were set at 25% for India’s US-bound exports, 20% for Taiwan and 30% for South Africa. Switzerland faces a rate of 39%. The deadline for a tariff deal with Mexico was extended by another 90 days.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>The mathematics of starvation: how Israel caused a famine in Gaza</strong></h2>    <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/the-mathematics-of-starvation-how-israel-caused-a-famine-in-gaza">mathematics of famine are simple in Gaza</a>. Palestinians cannot leave, war has ended farming and Israel has banned fishing, so practically every calorie its population eats must be brought in from outside.</p> <p>Israel knows how much food is needed. It has been calibrating hunger in Gaza for decades, initially calculating shipments to exert pressure while avoiding starvation.</p> <p>“The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger,” a senior adviser to the then prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said in 2006. An Israeli court ordered the release of documents showing the details of those macabre sums two years later.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What has Israel said?</strong> As Gaza has slid into famine this summer, Israeli officials have variously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/25/israel-deflect-blame-starvation-gaza-hunger">denied</a> the existence of mass starvation, claimed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/usaid-analysis-found-no-evidence-massive-hamas-theft-gaza-aid-2025-07-25/">without evidence</a> that Hamas steals and hoards aid, or blamed hunger on UN distribution failures, sharing pictures of aid pallets awaiting collection inside the border.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Virginia Giuffre wanted Epstein documents made public, siblings say</strong></h2>    <p>The siblings of Virginia Giuffre, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s most prominent accusers, who died this year, said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/31/virginia-giuffre-epstein-documents-family">their sister had wanted the so-called Epstein files to be released</a>, and urged Trump not to pardon Epstein’s longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/epstein-abuse-survivor-virginia-giuffre-wanted-files-released-death-fa-rcna222375?cid=eml_nbn_20250731&amp;user_email=4e4def49059d7d8bd6118ebe3a0d9f60dc0c107c8c84f9923a1dd78f8deef8ab&amp;utm_campaign=breakingnews">In an interview with NBC News on Thursday</a>, Giuffre’s family said she would have wanted the documents – a trove of materials related to the investigation into the late sex offender – made public.</p> <p>“She had a little bit of hope in her because it was said that the files were going to be released,” Amanda Roberts, Giuffre’s sister-in-law, told the network in an interview, saying Giuffre would have wanted “transparency and justice” for his victims.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What did they say about Trump’s comments this week that Epstein ‘stole’ Giuffre and others from Mar-a-Lago?</strong> “She’s not an object, she’s a person,” Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother, said through tears. “She’s a mom. She’s a sister. And she was recruited by Maxwell. She wasn’t stolen.”</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In other news …</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>Joe Biden has sa</strong><strong>id the US </strong><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/joe-biden-national-bar-association-awards-speech">is facing an “existential” fight</a> and marginalized groups </strong><strong>are “dramatically under attack”. </strong>The former president said some politicians watched deportations of legal immigrants with “glee”, in a speech to the National Bar Association gala.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Justin Timberlake has said he is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jul/31/justin-timberlake-lyme-disease">suffering from Lyme disease</a></strong>,<strong> </strong>a serious illness usually contracted after being bitten by a tick.
