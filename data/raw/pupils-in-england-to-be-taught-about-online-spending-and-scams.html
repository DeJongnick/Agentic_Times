They can learn about credit and debit cards, the tactics advertisers use, and how to keep money safe from scammers.</p> <p>Resources for secondary schools are designed to help pupils understand inflation, personal risk, cryptocurrency and investing. There are also lessons on how to understand bank statements and payslips, and how to scrutinise data and claims made by campaigners, advertisers and online influencers.</p> <p>Parents and financial experts have campaigned for years for better financial education for children to prepare them for the everyday challenges of adult life. </p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/mar/18/fewer-gcse-exams-proposed-in-labours-curriculum-review-but-sats-to-stay">The recent interim report on the government’s independent curriculum and assessment review</a> noted that parents and children want an increased focus on applied knowledge and skills in the curriculum, including finance and budgeting.</p> <p>John Roberts, Oak’s interim CEO, said: “By giving teachers the tools to provide well-sequenced, engaging financial learning, we can make sure it resonates with children to support them through adulthood.”</p> <p>Pepe Di’Iasio, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “There’s a strong case for more financial education on the curriculum in general but we must be mindful of not further overloading an already packed school day.”</p> <p>Sarah Hannafin, head of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, added: “Online platforms also need to step up to the plate, however, by strengthening age verification procedures, improving monitoring, providing clearer functions for reporting concerns and introducing more transparent codes of conduct setting out the implications of misuse.”</p>
