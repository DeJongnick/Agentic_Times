<p>Children in cities across England face barriers to playing outside because urban planners are prioritising housebuilding over parks, a study has found.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23748834.2025.2539612">research</a>, published in the peer-reviewed journal Cities and Health, found that planners were prioritising the approval of new homes ahead of outdoor play spaces due to a combination of policy misalignment, financial constraints and pressures stemming from a lack of housing.</p> <p>Emily Ranken, from the University College London Institute for Education and corresponding author of the research, said: “Our study offers a deep analysis of the challenges in embedding play into urban policy and our recommendations offer a blueprint for councils, developers, and public health leaders to make play a priority.”</p> <p>She added: “Well-designed play space has so many positive knock-on effects. For children, it takes them outside, away from screens and develops their cognitive and physical skills. And for parents it helps build community ties and vital social networks.”</p> <p>The study’s participants, from the London borough of Tower Hamlets and Bradford, who influence urban planning in their respective local authorities, told researchers that developers saw play space as a “nice to have”, which led to a “constant kind of challenge between building up housing and keeping enough green and open space and amenity space and play space”.</p> <p>The difficulties of recruiting and retaining good local authority staff, the effects of austerity, the pandemic and Brexit were also cited as barriers to effective urban planning.</p> <p>Furthermore, “well-intentioned but fragmented” urban planning policy within these local authorities was deemed to be problematic, with “play” and “physical activity” being used interchangeably.</p> <p>For example, Tower Hamlets council’s “play charter” was described by participants as a “collection of catchphrases” that lacked a meaningful action plan.</p> <p>Greater regulation, such as national statutory guidance requiring developers to prioritise provision of playable space over quantity of homes, could help mitigate these competing interests, said the study.</p> <p>A recent study revealed that<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/29/children-uk-outdoors-play-society-school-research"> a third of children across the UK do not play outdoors after school</a>, with children living in less deprived communities benefiting more from outdoor play than those in more deprived communities.</p> <p>Dr Amanda Seims, from the Bradford Institute for Health Research and Lancaster University, and co-author of the latest study, said: “Compared to their parents’ generation, the amount of time today’s children play outside has declined by 50%. But this downward trend doesn’t have to be inevitable.</p> <p>“Thoughtful planning, which listens to the voices of children and young people, can produce accessible, enriching environments where children can develop.”</p> <p>Tower Hamlets council and Bradford council have been contacted for comment.</p>
