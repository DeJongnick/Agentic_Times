 <h2 class="block-title">What we learned: Wednesday 18 December</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>That’s where we’ll leave the blog for today. Have a great evening.</p> 
  <p>Here were today’s major developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>The Albanese Labor government released its midyear economic update (Myefo) showing Australia’s federal budget is headed for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/18/myefo-australian-federal-budget-forecast-release">deficit of $26.9bn this financial year and is not projected to return to balance until 2034-35</a>. The update breaks Labor’s streak of two full-year budget surpluses with a deficit in its third year.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The gambling industry’s lobby group criticised the federal government’s “moral judgment” after the Myefo confirmed gambling companies would be stripped of their access to the tax concessions. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/28/chalmers-says-its-problematic-gambling-companies-claimed-90m-worth-of-research-tax-credits-in-one-year">Australian Tax Office figures showed they had claimed almost $90m in a single year</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The federal government says it has sent an initial $2m humanitarian assistance package for Vanuatu that includes a 64-person disaster response team to support recovery efforts following yesterday’s devastating 7.3-magnitude earthquake.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Veteran broadcaster Alan Jones has appeared in court in Sydney for the first time since he was arrested. His lawyer confirmed Jones will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/dec/18/alan-jones-new-sexual-assault-charges-to-plead-not-guilty-ntwnfb">plead not guilty to 34 historical sexual assault charges</a>. He will face a jury trial.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The Victorian government has responded to a review of the CFMEU it commissioned in the wake of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/sep/06/cfmeu-official-arrest-john-setka-building-sites-victoria-police-ntwnfb">corruption allegations that engulfed the powerful union</a>. The government has accepted all of the report’s eight recommendations in full or in principle.</p></li> 
   <li><p>And New South Wales police say they have dismantled the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2024/dec/18/australia-news-live-vanuatu-assistance-earthquake-hsc-results-atar-nsw-tasmania-jim-chalmers-economic-update-budget-?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67621e6e8f085c17263b894d#block-67621e6e8f085c17263b894d">largest alleged magic mushroom lab</a> they have ever found in an apartment, and charged four people.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Universities applaud Labor’s $2.5bn pledge</strong></p> 
  <p>University bodies have welcomed the federal government’s additional $2.5bn commitment in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/18/labor-myefo-mid-year-economic-update-budget-deficit-what-you-need-to-know">the Myefo</a> to establish a new managed growth funding system and introduce needs-based funding for universities.</p> 
  <p>Universities Australia’s chief executive, <strong>Luke Sheehy</strong>, said the commitments recognised the “vital role” the sector played to “drive prosperity and tackle workforce shortages”.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>From helping more Australians from disadvantaged backgrounds access higher education to creating a funding framework that supports long-term sustainability, these investments will strengthen our universities across cities and regions, benefiting the entire nation.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Sheehy also welcomed the establishment of the Australian Tertiary Education Commission to provide independent advice and sector reform, announced in a release by the education minister today. The body will operate permanently from 2026.</p> 
  <p>The release also hinted at the removal of Ministerial Direction 107, which has been operating as an effective international student cap. Sheehy said certainty and stability were now “urgently needed” to ensure the continued global competitiveness of Australia’s international student sector and stabilise numbers.</p> 
  <p>The Australian Technology of Universities executive director, <strong>Dr Ant Bagshaw</strong>, said the body could now see a “path forward” which could support growth ambitions of the sector.</p>

  <p><strong>Budget update a ‘missed opportunity’ to better fund public schools – union</strong></p> 
  <p>The Australian Education Union has labelled the federal government’s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo) as a “missed opportunity” to fully fund public schools.</p> 
  <p>The Myefo confirmed there would be no additional funding or agreed school reforms for public schools in Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/09/australias-biggest-states-hold-out-for-greater-public-school-funding-as-deadline-passes">remained in a standoff</a> over who would front a 5% gap in school funding.</p> 
  <p>Data from the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority shows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2023/jul/17/gonski-review-government-funding-private-public-schools">98% of public schools are underfunded</a> and the majority of private schools are overfunded.</p> 
  <p>Union head<strong> Correna Haythorpe</strong> said the gap would “deeply impact” public schools’ resources and leave them underfunded until at least the end of 2025.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is money the federal government is quite literally leaving on the table.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The opposition’s education spokesperson, <strong>Sarah Henderson</strong>, said Labor had failed to deliver “full and fair funding” as the education minister, <strong>Jason Clare</strong>, had promised. The Coalition, when it was in power, capped commonwealth funding for public schools at 20%, leaving a shortfall of 5%.</p> 
  <p>Henderson said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>After nearly three years, Jason Clare has shown he is not up to the job of supporting Australian schools including delivering explicit instruction, the Year 1 phonics and numeracy test, performance targets and other evidence-based teaching reforms to ensure every child can reach his or her best potential.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Clare said the government had reached agreements to increase funding to public schools in Western Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory and the ACT.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Our offer to the remaining states remains on the table.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Gambling lobby hits at Labor’s ‘moral judgment’ after $90m tax breaks for research abolished</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The gambling industry’s lobby group has criticised the federal government’s “moral judgment” after confirming bookmakers would no longer receive tax breaks for research on wagering.</p> 
  <p>The federal government’s mid-year economic update (Myefo) confirmed gambling companies would be stripped of their access to the tax concessions, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/28/chalmers-says-its-problematic-gambling-companies-claimed-90m-worth-of-research-tax-credits-in-one-year">Australian Tax Office figures showed they had claimed almost $90m in a single year</a>.</p> 
  <p>The treasurer, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, described the use of the tax breaks by bookies as “problematic” in October.</p> 
  <p>Today’s Myefo papers said research and development for gambling could “exacerbate addiction and associated harms, while activities related to tobacco can increase health risks”.</p> 
  <p>The Myefo said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Excluding these activities will ensure that the government is not subsidising this type of research and development.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Kai Cantwell</strong>, the chief executive of <strong>Responsible Wagering Australia,</strong> attacked the decision and said it “opens the door to tax policies becoming a tool of moral judgment rather than a driver of economic growth”.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Our industry was not consulted by the government on this decision – this is not how governments should engage with industry and it’s not the way to achieve effective policy outcomes.</p> 
   <p>The government’s announcement sets a dangerous precedent for how tax policy could be misused in the future – today it’s gambling companies being targeted, but any industry could be next if it’s used as a bargaining chip or horse-traded in future political deals.</p> 
   <p>If I represented fast food, alcohol, fossil fuels or any other industry that face similar criticisms, I’d be worried. This cherry-picking approach undermines the neutrality of the tax system and leaves businesses guessing who will be targeted next.</p>

  <p><strong>Australia sends $2m aid package to Vanuatu</strong></p> 
  <p>The federal government says it has sent an initial $2m humanitarian assistance package for Vanuatu to support recovery efforts which will arrive in the Pacific island nation this afternoon.</p> 
  <p>Fourteen people have reportedly been confirmed dead after Vanuatu was struck by a 7.3-magnitude earthquake yesterday, which prompted a tsunami warning and was followed by a second earthquake today.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, the government said there had been extensive damage to buildings in and around the capital, Port Vila, and hospitals were under “significant pressure” treating the injured.</p> 
  <p>It said that in response to requests from the Vanuatuan government, Australia had sent a 64-person disaster assistance response team (Dart) and two dogs to look for people trapped under the rubble and to begin the clean up.</p> 
  <p>An Australian medical assistance team has been deployed to help local health authorities, which will be followed by a five-person department of foreign affairs and trade (Dfat) crisis response team and a liaison officer from the national emergency management agency.</p> 
  <p>The government has said nine additional Australian Federal Police members will arrive in Port Vila today, joining the six AFP members already posted there, to assist local police including with setting up emergency communications and identifying victims.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Budget update a missed opportunity to address key issues: Saul Eslake</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Investors don’t appear to have been very moved by the federal government’s mid-year economic and fiscal outlook (Myefo).</p> 
  <p>Stocks will probably end the day little changed and the Australian dollar was pretty flat (although it has lately extended its retreat against the US dollar at least).</p> 
  <p>Bond yields were also little moved, implying little joy in a smaller than expected budget deficit this fiscal year nor little extra concern that the budget deficit will be $23bn-plus worse in the subsequent three years.</p> 
  <p><strong>Saul Eslake</strong>, a seasoned commentator on the economy, isn’t convinced about the government’s claims of additional “unavoidable” spending.</p> 
  <p>Eslake said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m not saying they are bad decisions – but they aren’t ones that absolutely had to be taken.</p> 
   <p>Unavoidable isn’t a synonym for politically difficult. What the government has avoided is making any decisions as to how this additional spending should be paid for.</p> 
   <p>It has been clear for some years now – since before this government came to office in May 2022 – that government spending is permanently on a higher plane of about 26.5% of GDP, which is about 1.75 percentage points of GDP higher than the average between the mid-1970s and the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Eslake has said the public wants more spending on health, the NDIS and childcare, but it will get more spending on defence (“whether the public ‘wants’ that or not”), and there’s the increase of $500bn in federal government net debt since the global financial crisis (circa 2008), which brings a big interest cost.</p> 
  <p>Eslake said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Neither side of Australian politics has been willing to have an adult<br>conversation with the Australian people about how all this additional<br>spending should be paid for.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Pesutto</strong> was also asked about the upcoming vote on <strong>Moira Deeming’s</strong> return to the Liberal party room, which will take place on Friday.</p> 
  <p>On Monday night, Liberal MPs <strong>Chris Crewther</strong>, <strong>Renee Heath</strong>, <strong>Joe McCracken</strong>, <strong>Richard Riordan</strong> and <strong>Bill Tilley</strong> revealed they had signed a petition to hold a special party room meeting to reinstate Deeming.</p> 
  <p>Deeming was expelled from the party in 2023 after she attended a rally that was gatecrashed by neo-Nazis.<br><br>A federal court judge last week found Pesutto defamed Deeming by falsely implying in comments he made after the rally that she knowingly associated and sympathised with neo-Nazis. The judge ordered Pesutto pay Deeming $300,000 in damages.<br><br>After the judgment, Deeming said it was her expectation to be let back into the party room.</p> 
  <p>Asked whether he would welcome Deeming back, Pesutto said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They’re matters for the party room, and they’ll discuss those on Friday morning.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On his leadership, Pesutto said he was getting “positive feedback” from his colleagues but admitted “we’re a broad party room, so not everybody’s going to agree on every issue”.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I work every day to earn the trust and confidence of my colleagues, and I’ll continue to work every day. I never take my roles and responsibilities for granted.</p> 
   <p>I know that every day, I get up and I do the very best I can for the people I’m here to serve, and that’s ultimately the Victorian people. But I also need to show my colleagues every single day that I’m worthy of their trust.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW’s midterm budget points to short-term deficit increase variance</strong></p> 
  <p>Apart from the Commonwealth’s mid-year update (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/18/myefo-australian-federal-budget-forecast-release">here</a> and also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/18/myefo-australia-budget-downgrade-defecit-forecast-albanese-government">my takeaways here</a>), <strong>New South Wales</strong> has also taken today as a good time to release its half-yearly review.</p> 
  <p>While the Albanese government is claiming this year’s deficit will be $1.3bn better than projected in its May budget, the Minns NSW counterparts are projecting a $1.35bn negative “variance” from the 2024-25 year compared <a href="https://www.budget.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-09/Budget-Paper-No.1_Budget-Statement-Budget-2024-25.pdf">with its budget.</a></p> 
  <p>That seems to imply NSW will post a deficit this year of about $5bn since the previous shortfall was an estimated $3.6bn.</p> 
  <p>Unlike the federal budget, though, treasurer <strong>Daniel Mookhey</strong> and finance minister <strong>Courtney Houssos</strong> are predicting improvements in the subsequent three years to the tune of about $1.1bn. The fourth of the forward estimate years, though, has a $240m worsening – although the further into the future, the lighter the “pencilling in”.</p> 
  <p>Anyway, the decline for the current year is blamed on extra insurance expanse, and more costly debt repayments. There’s also a drop in state tax and a curious $440.8m reduction in revenue from Sydney Water “due to a reporting error”. (Surprising that didn’t leak, I guess.)</p> 
  <p>Perhaps a bit of a surprise too that the $6.6bn “public sector wages investment” (AKA higher salaries) can be “accounted for by offsets and productivity gains, creating no additional debt”, or so the government says.</p> 
  <p>Unlike the federal government, though, the Minns Labor government doesn’t have to go to the polls soon, with the elections not scheduled until March 2027.</p>

  <p><strong>Universities to receive $2.5bn government funding boost</strong></p> 
  <p>The government has committed an additional $2.5bn in the 2024-25 MYEFO to establish a new managed growth funding system and introduce needs-based funding for universities, according to a statement from the minister for education’s office.</p> 
  <p>The managed growth funding system is expected to deliver an additional 82,000 fully funded university places in 2035. Universities will receive additional “demand driven” Needs-based Funding according to the number of students they enrol from under-represented backgrounds. This will be provided for academic and other supports including scholarships, bursaries, mentoring, and peer learning, as outlined in the statement. Full implementation is expected by January 2027.</p> 
  <p>The government has also committed $54m to establish the Australian Tertiary Education Commission (Atec) “to drive reform of Australia’s tertiary education sector”. This will provide independent advice to government on “higher education pricing matters, tertiary sector harmonisation and sector performance”. It will also “implement enhanced mission-based compacts, new Managed Growth Funding and Needs-based Funding”. The ATEC will operate in an interim capacity from July 2025, and permanently from January 2026, subject to the passage of legislation.</p> 
  <p>The structural reform aims to “help more Australians get a university qualification, as recommended by the Australian Universities Accord”.</p> 
  <p>The minister for education, <strong>Jason Clare,</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have set a target that by 2050, 80% of the workforce will have a Tafe qualification or a university degree.</p> 
   <p>This will give us the economic firepower we will need in the years ahead.</p> 
   <p>To hit that target, we need to break down that invisible barrier that stops a lot of Australians from disadvantaged backgrounds, from the regions and the outer suburbs from getting a crack at uni and succeeding when they get there.</p>

  <p><strong>Continued …</strong></p> 
  <p>Benbrika’s barrister, <strong>Dan Star</strong> KC, said the month-long extension was not opposed, although they would contest the making of a more permanent order in 2025, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Justice <strong>James Elliott</strong> found there were reasonable grounds to extend the supervision order for a further 28 days, noting it was necessary to protect the community.</p> 
  <p>The order will expire at 3pm on 16 January but Star indicated he would not oppose a further month-long extension at that time.</p> 
  <p>The parties will return to the supreme court on 14 January to formally extend the order again.</p> 
  <p>Benbrika, now aged in his 60s, was convicted over plots to attack the MCG during the 2005 AFL grand final and Melbourne’s Crown casino.</p> 
  <p>In 2009, he was sentenced to 15 years behind bars for directing a terrorist organisation.</p> 
  <p>His sentence expired in November 2020 but a further three-year detention order was made and he was not released back into the community until December 2023.</p> 
  <p>Benbrika was immediately placed under the government supervision order with more than 30 strict conditions.</p>

  <p><strong>Abdul Nacer Benbrika to remain under government supervision for at least another month</strong></p> 
  <p>Convicted terrorist <strong>Abdul Nacer Benbrika</strong> will remain under government supervision for at least another month but with fewer restrictions, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Benbrika was released from prison in December 2023 after serving close to 20 years behind bars for plotting terror attacks in Melbourne.</p> 
  <p>He was immediately placed under a government supervision order, where he was subject to more than 30 strict conditions including police surveillance and a curfew.</p> 
  <p>The order was due to expire at 3pm on Thursday but the federal attorney general, <strong>Mark Dreyfus</strong>, applied in the Victorian supreme court to extend the order.</p> 
  <p><strong>Zoe Maud</strong> SC, representing the attorney general, told the court on Wednesday the extension was necessary to protect the safety of the public.</p> 
  <p>She referred to a recent psychiatric assessment of Benbrika, which found he still held some extremist views and it would take time for the deradicalisation program to change his core beliefs. He also had problematic personality traits that would make him susceptible to being influenced or influencing others, Maud said.</p> 
  <p>“Presently, the potential for violence is well contained but in the context where he benefits from many interventions,” the barrister told the court.</p> 
  <p>Maud outlined the conditions of Benbrika’s current order, including that he was subject to a curfew, restrictions on his employment, and police monitoring of his devices and internet use.</p> 
  <p>On the proposed extended order, Benbrika would have to follow conditions ensuring he participated in psychological and psychiatric treatment, as well as the deradicalisation program he was already undergoing.</p>

  <p><strong>Taylor</strong> has emphatically claimed the opposition’s nuclear policy will bring down power bills by 44% even though the Coalition’s own modelling does not show this.</p> 
  <p>Responding to a question from a reporter as to whether the opposition leader, <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, was correct to claim power bills would be 44% less than under the planned renewables transition, Taylor said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is no doubt about that.</p> 
   <p>Over time what you see, basic economics, as long as you have good competition policy in place, and we absolutely intend to do that, prices paid reflect cost underlying cost.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Coalition released its nuclear modelling last Friday based on costings it commissioned from Frontier Economics, which claimed the policy would cost $263 billion or 44% less than the planned transition to renewables.</p> 
  <p>The report did not say individual power bills would cost 44% less.</p> 
  <p>Furthermore, the detail in the Frontier Economics report shows this 44% cost reduction comes as a result of comparing two different scenarios for the future of the electricity grid.</p> 
  <p>The Coalition’s preferred scenario also assumes Australia will have far less major industry and would use roughly one-third less electricity in 2050 than under Labor.</p> 
  <p>At his press conference, Taylor was asked twice to clarify what he meant, after which he then said the 44% figure was the difference in cost between the Coalition and Labor’s plans.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The cost of electricity to Australians is 44% lower under this plan than Labor’s, the underlying cost.</p> 
   <p>And as long as there are strong competition policies in place and there will be under us, that should be reflected in power bills.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Angus Taylor says Labor’s budget update shows ‘red ink as far as the eye can see’</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The opposition’s Treasury spokesperson, <strong>Angus Taylor</strong>, says the midyear economic update (Myefo) shows “red ink as far as the eye can see”.</p> 
  <p>Taylor held a press conference in Canberra a short time ago, where he criticised the Albanese Labor government for the results of the midyear economic update (Myefo).</p> 
  <p>Released today, the Myefo shows Australia’s federal budget is on-track for a deficit of $26.9bn this financial year and is not projected to return to balance until 2034-35.</p> 
  <p>The update breaks Labor’s streak of two full-year budget surpluses with a deficit in its third year, albeit one that is $1.3bn smaller than projected in May.</p> 
  <p>Responding to the update, Taylor said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is not free money. This is the biggest-spending government we have seen outside of wartime or crisis, the biggest-spending government outside of wartime or crisis.</p> 
   <p>And there is absolutely no pathway in this update to a restoration of Australians’ standard of living.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Taylor said that in the past 2.5 years, Australia had for the first time experienced seven consecutive quarters of household recession, with GDP per capita going backwards.</p>

  <p><strong>Flood warnings in south-east, west and central Queensland</strong></p> 
  <p>Flood warnings remain for more than a dozen rivers and creeks in south-east, west and central Queensland.</p> 
  <p>The Bureau of Meteorology’s <strong>Angus Hines</strong> told AAP many of the minor flood warnings could possibly escalate to moderate with heavy rainfall.</p> 
  <p>Water has been released from the south-east’s Wivenhoe dam for the first time in two years after reaching 90% capacity.</p> 
  <p>It led to the closure of Savages Crossing, Colleges Crossing and Twins Bridges roads, escalating the risk of flooding in the waterways around the region’s major dam.</p> 
  <p>“There’s certainly a distinct possibility that we will see significant rises given the stormy forecast for the rest of the days,” Hines said.</p> 
  <p>The last time the dam released water was during 2022 floods which caused destruction across Queensland’s south-east and northern NSW, resulting in 24 deaths.</p> 
  <p>Somerset and North Pine dams are also releasing flood waters.</p> 
  <p>The storms and rainfall in the south-east are set to ease from Thursday afternoon, providing a welcome dry spell into Christmas week.</p> 
  <p>However, north Queensland is next in the firing line for wet weather and storms beginning on Thursday from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Townsville.</p> 
  <p>“It’s a split forecast across the state with it continuing to be wet and stormy in the north but much drier and sunny in the south,” Hines said.</p>

  <p><strong>Women rescued from flood waters as deluge continues</strong></p> 
  <p>Two people have been rescued from flood waters after a rain-hit state was again struck by storms ahead of the festive season.</p> 
  <p>The women were found in the tray of a ute after a swift water rescue team was called to Euthulla, about 450km north-west of Brisbane, on Tuesday night.</p> 
  <p>The SES has responded to almost 200 callouts across Queensland since Tuesday morning, mostly for leaking roofs, sandbagging and fallen trees after the latest round of wet weather.</p> 
  <p>“The ground is really quite wet at the moment, so it doesn’t take too much for some of those trees to decide that they’d rather lay down than stand up,” SES operations director <strong>Glenn Alderton</strong> told ABC Radio.</p> 
  <p>More than 300 properties are without power on Wednesday, with thousands at one stage affected mostly across the Gladstone and Sunshine Coast region north of Brisbane.</p> 
  <p>Central and eastern Queensland copped the brunt of the heavy rain on Tuesday, with Mapleton, north of the Sunshine Coast, hit with 102mm while nearby Cooloolabin Dam received 103mm.</p> 
  <p>Up north, Townsville had about 65mm, while in the south-east Brisbane was a drier than recent days with 10mm of rain in 24 hours, but enough to cause major delays for players in the cricket Test between Australia and India at the Gabba.</p> 
  <p>More wet weather is expected, with storms forecast from Brisbane to Townsville on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The largest alleged magic mushroom lab ever found in an apartment by NSW police has been dismantled.</p> 
  <p>Detectives have charged four people and conducted seven search warrants after an investigation into an alleged criminal syndicate manufacturing and supplying prohibited drugs across Sydney, NSW police said.</p> 
  <p>At 8:30am yesterday, police stopped a vehicle in Sydney Olympic Park and arrested two men, aged 45 and 30.</p> 
  <p>The older man was charged with 10 offences relating to “the supply of large commercial quantities of drugs”. The younger man was charged with four offences relating to “the supply of large commercial quantities of drugs”.</p> 
  <p>At 9.30am, detectives arrested a 28-year-old man at a cafe in West Ryde. He was charged with supplying a prohibited drug in an indictable and commercial quantity.</p> 
  <p>All three men were refused bail to appear in Burwood local court today.</p> 
  <p>At 9.50am, detectives searched a Pyrmont property and discovered a “clandestine laboratory” producing psilocybin (also known as magic mushrooms).</p> 
  <p>The laboratory “is the largest magic mushroom lab found by NSW police in a residential apartment”, police alleged.</p> 
  <p>A 45-year-old woman was arrested at the scene and charged with five offences relating to “the supply of large commercial quantities of drugs”. She was refused bail to appear in Downing Centre local court today.</p> 
  <p>Search warrants were also executed at Oatlands, Campsie, Epping, Rydalmere, West Ryde and Pyrmont. Police seized “a large amount of prohibited drugs” including 100 bags of magic mushrooms.</p>

  <p>Other major Victorian AFL clubs have divested from poker machines, citing gambling harm inflicted on their community. </p> 
  <p>The motion required support from 75% of members to succeed, as involved amending the club’s constitution. It only received 32.6% of votes. </p> 
  <p>The Essendon board encouraged members to oppose the motion, arguing it would reduce money that could be spent on football and community programs. </p> 
  <p>It told members the motion was not in the best interests of the club:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The club being forced to exit gaming in an unplanned manner would affect the club’s ability to invest in areas that are important to our members, such as our football department and community programs.

  <p>The Queensland water authority <strong>Seqwater</strong> is closely monitoring dam levels in response to current and forecast rainfall in the state’s south-east.</p> 
  <p>The water authority said it was releasing water from Somerset dam into Wivenhoe dam, which can hold 2m megalitres on top of its water supply storage capacity during periods of heavy rain.</p> 
  <p>Seqwater is also releasing water from North Pine and Wivenhoe dams, with several ungated dams also spilling excess water. A spokesperson said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As at 8:30am on Wednesday 18 December, <strong>the SEQ water grid is currently sitting at approximately 87.7%.</strong> Due to recent rainfall and inflows, 19 ungated dams are also spilling excess water and outflows may increase due to continuing rain.</p> 
   <p>These are ungated dams, meaning that once they reach 100% capacity, water spills over the spillway and safely out of the dam as it is designed to do.</p> 
   <p>Spilling is a normal part of operations at Seqwater. At our ungated dams, excess water naturally flows over the spillway and safely out of the dam into the creek or river system the dam is built on.</p>

  <p><strong>Jacinta Allan denies ‘antisemitism’ crackdown being used as smokescreen to target climate protesters</strong></p> 
  <p>Victoria premier <strong>Jacinta Allan </strong>was asked about the reaction to her crackdown on protests announced yesterday and whether they would have a “chilling effect on democracy” as warned by the Greens. She responds:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Last Friday, I attended the Adass Israel synagogue. It was my second visit … a private visit, and I was shown inside the synagogue, and I saw the blackened charred remains of what was a beautiful place of worship in ruins … prayer books blackened, the synagogue destroyed, and I was shown where a man had been sitting praying quietly in the early hours of that Friday morning, and he had to flee for his life as a consequence of that horrific attack ... Where’s the thoughts for that individual? For that community’s rights and protections? Well, I’m thinking of their rights and protections.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It’s worth noting the firebombing at the synagogue was not a result of a protest. Rather it was a targeted terror attack. Asked why she was using it to justify the protest crackdown, Allan responds:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We cannot separate the attack on the Adass Israel synagogue from the broader context, from the broader challenges we are seeing in our communities, here in Melbourne, in Sydney, in cities around the world, as a consequence of the conflict in the Middle East … It is also being used by some as a cloak, to be hateful, to be vile, to be antisemitic. There is no place for that behaviour. And yes, we do need to strengthen the support for Victoria police, which is what we announced yesterday.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Allan denied the antisemitism crackdown was being used a smokescreen to target climate protesters, as suggested by the <strong>Human Rights Law Centre.</strong></p> 
  <p>Allan says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>No. I can’t be any clearer to you.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Back to <strong>Jacinta Allan</strong>, who was speaking about the government’s response to the CFMEU review a short while ago. She says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I established this review because I was absolutely disgusted at the at the allegations of criminal, unlawful behaviour that was reported on Victorian and indeed, Australian construction sites.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She says the main recommendations she will be accepting include:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Introducing a complaints referral body, a “single point of entry”, which will provide anonymity and protection for those who come forward with allegations of wrongdoing.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Strengthening the state’s labour hire regulatory powers, including broadening the “fit and proper persons test”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Making it mandatory for contractors to report and address suspected criminal and unlawful conduct on construction sites in Victoria.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Enhancing information sharing arrangements between state government organisations departments and the commonwealth.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Allan says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Workers deserve strong, good unions because strong good unions protect workers rights, protect their safety conditions and provide good and fair outcomes on work sites. That’s what good unionism looks like. That’s not what we’ve seen from some elements of the construction division of the CFMEU.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Aside from the unexpected sprinkler interruption, <strong>Ley</strong> on Sky News went on to criticise the government’s handling of the economy, ahead of the midyear economic update expected this morning.</p> 
  <p>Ley challenged the treasurer, <strong>Jim Chalmers,</strong> to “please just address the issue that all Australians want, which is, how is this budget going to improve my standard of living and make my life better, just like you promised … ?”</p> 
  <p>Asked about the government’s spin on the MYEFO figures today – that the budget is $200bn better off than when Labor took office – Ley said ordinary Australians and small businesses weren’t feeling such benefits.</p> 
  <p>“If you’re an Australian running a small business, looking at your bills leading up to Christmas, that figure means nothing to you at all, and this is the problem. Jim Chalmers is a commentator, and everything he says has a political spin designed to get him out of trouble,” she said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That is not the question that he should be answering today, or the proposition he should be making. He should be telling Australians what he is actually going to do to lock in a higher standard of living, because since Labor came to government, people’s standard of living has gone backwards.</p>

  <p><strong>Sussan Ley cops a spray on live TV</strong></p> 
  <p>Most politicians are accustomed to being on the receiving end of a spray every now and then, but deputy Liberal leader <strong>Sussan Ley</strong> was still caught by surprise when the sprinklers went off during a live TV cross this morning.</p> 
  <p>The Member for Farrer was coming to Sky News live from Leeton, in the NSW Riverina region, earlier today when she had to duck out of frame quickly. Sky host <strong>Peter Stefanovic</strong> looked entirely puzzled as his guest quickly dashed off screen – before the water mist became more visible.</p> 
  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Sussan Ley sprayed by water during live TV interview after sprinklers automatically activate"> <iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?height=314&amp;href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSkyNewsAustralia%2Fvideos%2F984964593451338%2F&amp;show_text=false&amp;width=560&amp;t=0" width="560" height="314" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe> 
  </figure> 
  <p>Ley, perhaps used to anticipating potential challenges and threats as a longtime politician, had been glancing at something out of the corner of her eye – which we imagine was a sprinkler jet starting to whir into life.</p> 
  <p>The Sky camera panned to where Ley had fled, as she said: “sorry Pete, we’ve just got the sprinkler starting.”</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When the sprinkler starts, you probably have to move.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Ley went on to make light of the unexpected interlude.</p> 
  <p>“I’m here, Pete, the sprinklers on the amazing lawn in front of the War Memorial in Leeton in the Riverina just turned on and I got soaked,” she said.</p> 
  <p>Host Stefanovic joked: “Yeah, has anyone checked on [Labor treasurer] <strong>Jim Chalmers,</strong> did he turn the tap on? Maybe?”</p>

  <p><strong>Victorian government to introduce slew of construction site reforms after CFMEU investigation</strong></p> 
  <p>Builders on Victorian government construction sites will be contractually required to report criminal behaviour, while labour hire workers will need to pass a “fit and proper persons” test, under changes to be introduced following an inquiry commissioned by <strong>Jacinta Allan</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The premier on Wednesday released a report by <strong>Greg Wilson</strong> into the government agency’s engagement with construction companies and unions, after allegations of criminal infiltration of the CFMEU were reported by Nine newspapers earlier this year.</p> 
  <p>The report makes eight recommendations, which the government has accepted either in full or in principle, including setting up a new complaints body to handle allegations of wrongdoing on state-run construction sites.</p> 
  <p>Principle builders will also be required under their contract to “report any suspected criminal or other unlawful conduct” to the new complaints body, and ensure where possible to address the behaviour.</p> 
  <p>The report also recommends labour hire laws be changed to expand the “fit and proper persons test” so anyone with a convicted of an indictable offence in the past 10 years, anyone who led a company that was made insolvent or had a labour hire licence cancelled, suspended or revoked in five years and any members of an organised crime group cannot work on government sites.</p> 
  <p>Allan will be holding a press conference at 9.15am on the report.</p>

  <p><strong>Eyewitness accounts of Vanuata’s earthquake</strong></p> 
  <p>Some context on the Vanuatu earthquake, courtesy of <strong>Australian Associated Press</strong>:</p> 
  <p>A magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck just off the east coast of Vanuatu’s major island of <strong>Efate</strong> at 12.47pm on Tuesday. Locals reported on social media feeling violent shaking for around 30 seconds.</p> 
  <p>The La Casa D’Andrea E Luciano building, which houses the US, UK, French and New Zealand embassies and high commissions, has been seriously damaged, with footage posted to social media showing a section of building collapsed on to the first floor.</p> 
  <p><strong>Dan McGarry</strong>, a Vanuatu-based journalist, posted drone footage of major landslides near Vanuatu’s international shipping terminal. He told AAP there was no doubt there had been casualties from the tremor.</p> 
  <p>“There are buildings down here so I’m expecting the casualty figure to rise,” he said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I know of one fatality according to police stationed at Port Vila central hospital, and I saw with my own eyes three others on gurneys, several others walking around, walking wounded.</p> 
   <p>I think it will probably be in the dozens, altogether dead and wounded.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Attempts to confirm fatalities or injuries with Vanuatu authorities have been unsuccessful, owing to communications issues.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Emergency aid will be sent to Vanuatu: Wong</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Vanuatu’s caretaker prime minister, <strong>Charlot Salwai</strong>, declared a state of emergency last night and said a curfew would be imposed for seven days in the worst-affected areas.</p> 
  <p>It was a “sad and devastating time” in Port Vila, he said, expressing sympathy to families who had lost loved ones.</p> 
  <p>Australia was among the first to answer his call for emergency assistance. <strong>Penny Wong</strong>, Australia’s foreign minister, said the government was preparing to deploy immediate assistance to Vanuatu today.</p> 
  <p>Speaking in London, she said Australia would be sending emergency medical teams and urban search and rescue units to the island. A helpline has been set up to help Australians who could be caught up in the disaster.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>On behalf of our country, on behalf of Australians, I want to extend our solidarity and our condolences to the people of Vanuatu.</p> 
   <p>We’ve seen a dreadful tragedy at Port Vila. I want to say that we have reached out to my counterparts by message to offer any supports that Vanuatu needs.</p> 
   <p>We will provide whatever assistance is required. I say to the people of Vanuatu, you are family and Australia is here to help. In relation to any Australians who are caught up in this, we are available to assist you, if required. I say, please contact the Emergency Centre. It’s a 24-hour Consular Emergency Centre. From outside Australia you dial +61 2 6261 3305 and you will be assisted, if you contact us, to the best of our capacity.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The earthquake caused damage to an embassy building used by several countries, including Australia, but Wong said all its staff were safe.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to our rolling news coverage. I’m <strong>Martin Farrer</strong> bringing you the top overnight stories.</p> 
  <p>Australian is sending immediate assistance to <strong>Vanuatu</strong> today after <strong>a state of emergency was declared following a powerful earthquake yesterday</strong>. <strong>Penny Wong</strong> said rescue and medical teams would be dispatched to help in the aftermath of the quake that caused extensive damage to buildings and infrastructure such as reservoirs and communications. The situation is still unclear after the quake knocked out communications infrastructure, but hospital officials told local TV that at least six people had been killed and 50 injured. More coming up.</p> 
  <p>The big political event of the day will come when <strong>Jim Chalmers presents his midyear economic update</strong> in Canberra later today. It is expected to show a $200bn improvement to the federal bottom line over the six years to 2027-28, but that there has also been some “slippage” caused by a decline in revenue from mining exports. More coming up.</p> 
  <p>Year 12 students in New South Wales and Tasmania will be celebrating or otherwise today as <strong>the HSC results come out</strong>. We’ll be hearing some of their stories, but we already have a few overall snapshots – including a continued dividde between the sexes when it comes to the top marks. Of the 51 students that received a perfect Atar of 99.95, 42 were male and just nine were female. More coming up.</p>
