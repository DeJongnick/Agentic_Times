<p>After days of clashes between federal officers and protesters at an immigration jail in his home state of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/illinois">Illinois</a>, Democratic US senator Dick Durbin on Sunday renewed demands to meet with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> immigration officials.</p> <p>Durbin <a href="https://x.com/SenatorDurbin/status/1972297075493851476">wrote on X</a> that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ice-us-immigration-and-customs-enforcement">Ice</a>) must be “accountable for its actions” amid the administration’s “cruel immigration crackdown”. The post on Sunday morning came after Saturday night protests and arrests at an immigration detention center in Broadview, Illinois.</p> <p>For the preceding few days, federal officials have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/19/ice-protest-chicago-police">arrested protesters</a> at the Broadview facility as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/chicago-trump-crime-military">Ice operations</a> have escalated in Illinois.</p> <p>Durbin, along with Illinois representative Delia Ramirez and other Democrats, has been pressing for a congressional oversight visit to the Broadview facility for weeks in connection with reports of poor conditions.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/15/chicago-trump-crime-military"> Chicago organizers say city needs support, not politicalization by Trump: ‘This is not a serious solution’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to a letter written by Durbin and Ramirez on Friday, Democratic members of Congress have been unable to access the Broadview facility nor meet with immigration officials, as they have requested.</p> <p>Durbin and Ramirez informed Ice earlier in September of an upcoming oversight visit to the facility, which members of congress are allowed to do. But Ice in Chicago told Durbin and Ramirez they were “unable to support a visit”, according to the letter, and instead offered a meeting to the Democratic delegation. Ice on Friday <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/immigration/2025/09/26/illinois-dems-press-chicago-ice-director-for-broadview-oversight-details-on-chicago-deportation-operations">postponed that meeting</a> “to an unconfirmed date in October”, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.</p> <p>The Democratic pressure on Ice comes as protesters have clashed with officials at the Broadview site in recent days. On Saturday night, officials deployed pepper spray and rubber bullets and arrested a number of protesters outside the controversial immigration jail.</p> <p>In one <a href="https://x.com/noturtlesoup17/status/1972115761985724493">video posted online</a> on Saturday night, US border patrol officials, who have been dispatched to the area to assist in the Ice operations, can be seen deploying what is colloquially referred to as teargas on protesters standing outside the facility.</p> <p>On Sunday afternoon, a CBS Chicago reporter posted on Instagram that an Ice official “took a direct shot” at her car, saying that the official deployed gas into her open window. “Been puking for two hours,” the reporter said, adding that there were no protesters at the time and that she was just driving by the facility to check out the scene.</p> <p>Another local reporter in Chicago <a href="https://x.com/paschutz/status/1972385025967767819">posted on X</a> that the village of Broadview has opened a criminal investigation into that matter.</p>    <p>The Trump administration has called the protesters “rioters”, accusing them of inciting violence. On Saturday afternoon, Ice <a href="https://x.com/ICEgov/status/1972004780324032884">posted</a> on X: “Rioters will not deter Ice from its law enforcement mission. All those assaulting or obstructing will be held accountable. Full stop.” In another <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1972297960319832252">post</a> on Sunday morning, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said 11 people were arrested outside the Ice facility – and that officials had confiscated two guns during the arrests.</p> <p>In response, the Illinois governor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/31/jb-pritzker-trump-chicago-illinois">JB Pritzker</a>, decried the force used by federal officials at the site. He also called on protesters and bystanders to “document what you see with your phones and cameras”.</p> <p>“The suggestion that chemical agents like tear gas or pepper spray could be used indiscriminately against peaceful demonstrators, or even first responders, is unacceptable and not normal,” Pritzker <a href="https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/1972095488733131216">posted</a> <a href="https://x.com/GovPritzker/status/1972095493816963117">on X</a>. “By observing and recording peacefully, we can ensure that any violations of the law are brought to light and those responsible are held accountable.”</p> <p>Tensions in the Chicago area have been escalating in recent weeks after the Trump administration and DHS <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/sep/12/protesters-confront-ice-agents-outside-immigration-facility-near-chicago-video">launched</a> an operation they dubbed Midway Blitz. The operation led to an increase in the number of federal officials in the area targeting immigrants.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/19/ice-protest-chicago-police">Federal agents use teargas and pepper balls to break up Chicago Ice protest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Already, the operation has led to a number of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/ice-agent-chicago-traffic-stop">scandals</a> for Ice and the Trump administration. Earlier in September, Ice <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/ice-agent-shooting-chicago">shot and killed</a> an immigrant they were trying to arrest in the Chicago area. Despite DHS saying an officer was “seriously injured” by the immigrant before the shooting, video <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/ice-agent-chicago-traffic-stop">later released</a> seemed to contradict DHS’s claims.</p> <p>A <a href="https://immigrantjustice.org/press-release/new-federal-court-filing-challenges-trump-administrations-most-recent-violent-and-illegal-arrest-tactics-in-chicago-area/">recent court filing</a> by immigrants rights groups has also claimed that US citizens have been rounded up during the immigration enforcement operations in the area.</p> <p>DHS <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1965082306177122404">says</a> it launched Midway Blitz to target immigrants in the state, alleging that Pritzker and his “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/09/trump-immigration-crackdown-chicago-explainer">sanctuary policies</a>” – a term meant to describe limitations on local police’s cooperating with federal immigration agents – welcomed undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>The Trump administration has made immigration enforcement arrests a top priority since it returned to office in January after Joe Biden’s presidency.</p> <p>Top DHS officials, in fact, instructed Ice to arrest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/29/trump-ice-arrest-quota">at least 3,000 people</a> daily throughout the US. As the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/immigrants-criminal-record-ice-detention">reported</a> on Friday, due to the Trump administration’s intense escalation, immigrants with no criminal record are now the largest group in Ice detention.</p>
