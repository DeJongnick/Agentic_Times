We will be back in the morning, as the next of 1,000-plus days dawn, but in the meantime we leave you with this list of the day’s developments:</p> <ul> <li><p>At <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s rally in Michigan, his supporters reacted to the screening of a long video, set to ominous music, showing the harsh treatment of men he had deported from the United States to a prison in El Salvador without due process by chanting": “USA! USA!”</p></li> <li><p>As Trump defended his broadly unpopular handling of the economy, he criticized Fed chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong>, saying: “I have a Fed person who’s not really doing a good job, but I won’t say that.” The businessman president who used bankruptcy law to rescue his failed enterprises six times added: “I know much more about interest rates than he does”.</p></li> <li><p>Trump mistakenly attacked the Michigan representative <strong>John James</strong>, calling the Republican he had endorsed “a lunatic” for trying to impeach him. That was someone else.</p></li> <li><p>Trump supporters praised by the president at a rally included the former member of a violent cult who founded Blacks for Trump, and a retired autoworker who once told people to read David Duke’s “honest and fair” book about race.</p></li> <li><p>The US Department of Justice has begun the first criminal prosecutions of immigrants for entering a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/military-mission-for-sealing-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states-and-repelling-invasions/">newly declared</a> military buffer zone created along the border with Mexico, according to court filings.</p></li> <li><p>Trump called Amazon executive chair <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong> on Tuesday morning to complain about a <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/tech/amazon-display-tariff-costs/">report</a> that the company planned to display prices that show the impact of tariffs. Trump told reporters later that Bezos “was very nice, he was terrific” during their call, and “he solved the problem very quickly”.</p></li> <li><p>The Trump administration has reached one trade deal already but won’t tell us who with until that country’s prime minister and parliament approve the deal, the commerce secretary <strong>Howard Lutnick</strong> said <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/commerce-secretary-lutnick-trade-deal-unnamed-country-approval.html?taid=6811181fae6d0200017ef1d6&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_content=main&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">told CNBC</a>.</p></li> <li><p>The United States proposed sending up to 500 Venezuelan immigrants with alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador as the two governments sought to reach an agreement on the use of the nation’s notorious mega-prison, according to emails <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/politics/trump-el-savador-prison-negotiations/index.html">seen by CNN</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/amendments-to-adjusting-imports-of-automobiles-and-automobile-parts-into-the-united-states/">a proclamation</a> on Tuesday that offers temporary relief to automakers from the 25% tariffs he imposed in March in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/adjusting-imports-of-automobiles-and-autombile-parts-into-the-united-states/">a previous proclamation</a>. The measure gives automakers a break for two years to give them time to move auto production back to the United States.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Doug Emhoff</strong>, the husband of <strong>Kamala Harris</strong>, accused the Trump administration of turning “one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue”, after he and other <strong>Joe Biden</strong> appointees were removed from the board of the <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/">US Holocaust Memorial Museum</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Pete Hegseth</strong> has abruptly banished the Pentagon’s Women, Peace and Security program as part of his crusade against diversity and equity, dismissing it as a “woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative” despite it being a signature <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> achievement from his first term.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> surprised Michigan’s governor, <strong>Gretchen Whitmer</strong>, by inviting her to speak during his address at Selfridge air national guard base on Tuesday afternoon.</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-30T02:05:52.134Z">at 3.05am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-681177c68f08b6ffd73c1d76" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-30T01:41:48.112Z">2.41am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump supporters praised by president at rally included former member of violent cult and man who hailed David Duke</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>One notable feature of Tuesday’s Trump rally in Michigan is that it featured cameos from supporters of the president who have been fixtures of his campaign rallies for nearly a decade.</p> <p>Early in the speech, as he pointed to familiar faces, Trump recognized the <strong>Front Row Joes</strong>, a group of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/trump-rallies-front-row-joes/2021/07/15/cd842ee6-e589-11eb-8aa5-5662858b696e_story.html">diehard supporters akin to groupies</a> who have traveled the country to attend dozens of his rallies. He also shouted out <strong>Blake Marnell</strong>, a supporter who wears a “brick suit” in homage to Trump’s border wall and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/13/donald-trump-rally-shooting-pennsylvania">witnessed</a> the assassination attempt last year in Butler, Pennsylvania.</p> <p>“There’s my friend, Blacks for Trump. I like that guy. He follows me”, <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1917340009905971682">the president said</a> pointing into the crowd. “We love you, your whoile group has been so supportice over the years, I want to thank you”.</p> <p>“Everyone thinks I pay you a fortune”, Trump added. “I don’t even know who the hell he is, I just like him”.</p> <p>As <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/19/blacks-for-trump-maurice-symonette-cult/">I reported in 2020</a>, the “Blacks for Trump” founder is Maurice Symonette, a.k.a. Michael the Black Man, <a href="https://theintercept.com/liveblogs/trumpdown/man-holding-blacks-trump-sign-rally-former-member-violent-cult/">a former member of a violent cult</a> who posts <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michaelwarns/posts/1676063725845913">anti-Semitic screeds</a> and <a href="https://micahielnicholson.wixsite.com/everlastingfather2/wake-up-article">racist conspiracy theories</a> online, and yet has been a featured member of the audience at Trump campaign events since 2016.</p> <p>Symonette was known as Maurice Woodside <a href="https://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/yahweh-ben-yahweh-is-back-6381303">until 1992</a>, when the black supremacist cult leader he followed, Yahweh ben Yahweh, was jailed for leading <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article230873664.html">a conspiracy to murder</a> 14 white people in initiation rites. Woodside was among the Miami-based Nation of Yahweh cult members charged in two of the murders, but he was acquitted. After the trial, he changed his last name to Symonette, which was his father’s surname, before eventually reinventing himself as <strong>Michael the Black Man</strong>.</p> <p>On <a href="https://www.limitlesstruth.com/">his website</a>, Symonette makes a variety of bizarre claims, including that Omar and other prominent Black Democrats, artists and athletes — including former President Barack Obama, Jesse Jackson, Spike Lee, Colin Kaepernick, and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. — are “DECEVING [sic] FAKE BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY INDIANS!” In a sermon now deleted from YouTube, he claimed that the Senate is controlled by a secret underground of “Cherokee Mormons.”</p> <p>Later in the speech, Trump called to the stage another supporter who has been a figure at rallies <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-david-duke_n_57fe643de4b0e8c198a54ea9">since 2016</a>: <strong>Brian</strong> <strong>Pannebecker</strong>, a retired auto worker who told the crowd, “We have the greatest President, probably not just in our lifetimes, but in the history of this country!”</p> <p>Pannebecker’s brief cameo was <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1917351581021843855">clipped and shared</a> on social media by an official White House account, despite the fact that it was <a href="https://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-shift/2015/06/david-duke-fan-invite-revoked-at-right-to-work-hearing-opponents-to-summon-millions-against-tpa-212543">first reported</a> a decade ago that he had written a glowing review of David Duke’s book, “My Awakening”, in which he called the former Klansman’s work “honest and fair”. After reading the book, Pannebecker wrote in his online review, people “will be able to discuss the issue of race without the fear of being labeled a racist because you will have the facts and the truth on your side”.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-30T01:42:51.661Z">at 2.42am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6811754d8f08f0938cf49100" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-30T01:04:54.106Z">2.04am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>A federal judge in New Jersey ruled on Tuesday that <strong>Mahmoud Khalil</strong>, the recent Columbia graduate and Palestine solidarity activist who was detained on 8 March in his apartment building in New York and moved to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in Louisiana, can move forward with his lawsuit claiming the government is unlawfully detaining him for his political views. </p> <p>“This Court has habeas jurisdiction over this case” Judge <strong>Michael Farbiarz</strong> <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.564334/gov.uscourts.njd.564334.214.0_1.pdf">wrote</a>. “And as set out in this Opinion, that jurisdiction is intact. It has not been removed.”</p> <p>“As I am now caring for our barely week-old son, it is even more urgent that we continue to speak out for Mahmoud’s freedom, and for the freedom of all people being unjustly targeted for advocating against Israel’s genocide in Gaza,” <strong>Noor Abdalla, </strong>Khalil’s wife said in a statement. “I am relieved at the court’s finding that my husband can move forward with his case in federal court. This is an important step towards securing Mahmoud’s freedom. But there is still more work to be done. I will continue to strongly advocate for my husband, so he can come home to our family, and feel the pure joy all parents know of holding your first-born child in your arms.”</p> <p>“The court has affirmed that the federal government does not have the unreviewable authority to trample on our fundamental freedoms,” <strong>Noor Zafar</strong> of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project said in a statment emailed to reporters. “This is a huge step forward for Mahmoud and for the other students and scholars that the Trump administration has unlawfully detained in retaliation for their political speech, and a rebuke of attempts by the executive to use immigration laws to weaken First Amendment protections for political gain.” </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-681168598f0823d712e8bfb3" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-30T00:29:08.275Z">1.29am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">First migrants detained by active-duty US troops in new military zone in New Mexico charged in federal court</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The US Department of Justice has begun the first criminal prosecutions of migrants for entering a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/military-mission-for-sealing-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states-and-repelling-invasions/">newly declared</a> military buffer zone created along the border with Mexico, according to court filings, Reuters reports.</p> <p>At least 28 migrants were charged were charged in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on Monday for crossing into the 170-mile-long, 60-foot-wide militarized buffer zone patrolled by active-duty US troops.</p> <p><strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>, the defense secretary, visited the area last week and said it was the start of a plan to extend the buffer zone along the border.</p> <p>“The reason we are here today, at almost the 100-day mark of President Trump’s administration is because you’re standing on a National Defense Area, this may as well be a military base” Hegseth said in a defense department social media video posted online. “Any illegal attempting to enter that zone is entering a military base.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/113bpfwyyrc"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/113bpfwyyrc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, spoke to reporters last week in the newly declared National Defense Area along the border with Mexico.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>“As New Mexicans, we have deep concerns about the enhanced militarization of our borderlands communities” the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico in <a href="https://www.aclu-nm.org/en/press-releases/aclu-opposes-expanded-military-authority-border-buffer-zone">a statement</a> last week. “The expansion of military detention powers in the ‘New Mexico National Defense Area’ – also known as the ‘border buffer zone’ – represents a dangerous erosion of the constitutional principle that the military should not be policing civilians.”</p> <p>The idea of militarizing the border has long been a dream of far-right politicians, like the failed Arizona senate candidate <strong>Blake Masters</strong>, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/trump-new-mexico-militarized-border">devoted a campaign ad</a> to the idea in 2022.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-30T00:32:10.123Z">at 1.32am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-681163978f08b6ffd73c1d0d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T23:59:31.477Z">12.59am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">In his speech, Trump mistakenly attacked John James, calling Republican he endorsed a 'lunatic' he'd never heard of</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Trump has left the stage, and his supporters are filing out of the venue, which we are told by the pool reporter there has a capacity of 4,000, but was only about half or three-fifths full.</p> <p>One bizarre moment early in the speech that we would have heard a lot more about had the speaker been Joe Biden was when Trump tore into Representative <strong>John James</strong>, telling the crowd the Michigan Republican he had endorsed and campaigned with was “a lunatic”. </p> <p>“Some guy that I never heard of, John James.

While those numbers were markedly better than last summer, when satisfaction was as low as 18% and dissatisfaction reached 80%, the majority still clearly says the country is headed in the wrong direction.</p> <p>It is also not true to say that American have never previously said the country was going in the right direction. Gallup found that 50% of the public said that things were going n the right direction at this point in George W. Bush’s first term in 2001. There was even more optimism in 1999, during the presidency of Bill Clinton, when the right direction number reached 70%.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-29T23:29:36.784Z">at 12.29am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-681158098f0823d712e8bf52" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T22:58:18.605Z">11.58pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump criticizes Fed chairman Jay Powell</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Defending his handling of the economy, which has been severely damaged by his trade war and the prospect of rising inflation, Trump just <a href="https://x.com/atrupar/status/1917347825458782591">told his supporters</a> in Michigan: “Inflation is basically down, and interest rates came down despite the fact that I have a Fed person who’s not really doing a good job, but I won’t say that.

The fact that the men were not given an opportunity to contest the accusation that they are members of either Tren de Aragua or the Salvadoran gang MS-13, seemed not to trouble Trump.</p> <p>Instead, he accused Democrats of “racing to the defense of some of the most violent savages on the face of the Earth”.</p> <p>“They’re racing to the courts to help them”, Trump claimed, ignoring the fact that his own administration has admitted in court that at least one of the man deported, <strong>Kilmar Ábrego García</strong>, was sent there by mistake, in violation of an order issued during hjis previous term in office. The families of other men seen in the video have pointed to multiple errors in the interpretation of their tattoos as proof that they are gang members. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68114d388f08b6ffd73c1c7d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T22:12:07.766Z">11.12pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump hails himself in Michigan speech celebrating 100 days in office</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Trump is speaking now at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/8OEMk-BcrAk?si=fI80wFHdUxUJhgpr">a rally in Warren, Michigan</a> and he has fulsome praise for what he calls “the most successful 100 days of any administration in the history of our country”.</p> <p>A raft of opinion polls <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/26/americans-republicans-trump-ratings-poll">released this week</a> shows that a majority of Americans disagree, strongly, expressing deep disapproval of his performance as president, and particularly his handling of the economy, which has been severely damaged by his chaotic imposition of tariffs against nearly even nation, except Russia.</p> <p>A new <a href="https://www.maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/president-trumps-first-100-days-april-2025/">NPR/PBS News/Marist poll</a> released on Tuesday shows that 45% of those asked to grade Trump’s performance as president gave him an F, 7% a D, 8% a C, 17% a B, and 23% an A.</p> <p>Half of independents said Trump deserves an F, and only a slim majority of Republicans gave him an A.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-04-29T23:07:49.792Z">at 12.07am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6811431e8f08f0938cf48fe9" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T21:34:36.915Z">10.34pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump congratulates Canadian prime minister Mark Carney on election win he helped deliver</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>“Today, the Prime Minister, Mark Carney, spoke with the President of the United States, Donald J Trump”, <a href="https://www.pm.gc.ca/en/news/readouts/2025/04/29/prime-minister-carney-speaks-president-united-states-donald-j-trump">a statement</a> from the Canadian prime minister’s office said.</p> <p>“President Trump congratulated Prime Minister Carney on his recent election.

The White House Press secretary and the Treasury Secretary accused Amazon of a ‘hostile political act’, after Amazon planned to expose the cost of tariffs to its consumers. This comes days before Amazon reports earnings on Thursday, and its stock price fell ahead of the US open and is down more than 2% so far.</em></p> <p><em>The US administration has mostly saved its ire for other countries that it believes gives the US a raw deal in global trade. Now it appears that the US administration is targeting US companies who question the logic of its moves. This is significant. Financial markets have been roiled by political interference in the global economy in recent weeks. Investors do not digest political risks well, so if the Trump administration is now publicly accusing US companies of hostile acts if they disagree with the President’s US economic policy then this could stop the recent recovery rally in risky assets.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Political analyst <strong>Ian Bremmer</strong> has also questioned the White House’s argument, suggesting that telling a customer the cost of tariffs on their goods is no different than flagging the sales tax on a receipt. </p> <p>You can follow all of Graeme’s reporting on our business live blog: </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/apr/29/hsbc-trade-war-bad-debts-trump-automotive-tariffs-stock-markets-business-live-news">US trade deficit surges; Amazon accused of ‘hostile and political’ act for displaying tariff costs – business live</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6810d8088f0871612aaeb6a5" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T13:56:25.161Z">2.56pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Key takeaways from White House press briefing with US treasury secretary Scott Bessent</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <ul> <li><p>Donald Trump will sign an <strong>executive order on auto tariffs</strong> today as he tries to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/29/trump-tariff-us-carmakers">cushion the impact</a> of his tariffs on US carmakers.</p></li> <li><p>The Trump administration wants to <strong>provide companies looking to relocate to the US full expensing of factories and equipment purchases</strong> and make it retroactive to 20 January, treasury secretary Scott Bessent said.</p></li> <li><p>Bessent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/29/donald-trump-100-days-in-office-immigration-tariffs-canada-mark-carney-us-politics-live-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6810cc9a8f0871612aaeb5d7#block-6810cc9a8f0871612aaeb5d7">repeated</a> his assertion that “tariffs are unsustainable for China” and <strong>claimed that China could lose up to 10m </strong><strong>jobs</strong> if the high tariffs remain in place.

He’s reshaped the federal government and brought some of America’s most powerful institutions to heel. He’s threatening to go much further. <em>And we still have 1,361 days to go.</em></p> <p><strong>The speed of change has been </strong><em><strong>breathless</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The Trump 2.0 project hit the ground running on Day 1 and has been utterly ruthless in pursuit of its goals. Never before has the “move fast and break things” edict been applied so successfully to American government. Much of this work will not be quickly undone.</p> <p><strong>Trump is </strong><em><strong>pushing every boundary</strong></em> of what’s possible as a president. He has shown little interest in abiding by constitutional or legal norms. He has successfully shackled one of the three branches of government (the legislature) to his whims, and has the other (the judiciary) under constant attack. His political opponents are in disarray. So how this all ends is anyone’s guess.</p> <p><strong>But Trump’s power has </strong><em><strong>limits</strong></em>. He has backed down - humiliatingly - in the face of the bond markets. He’s been aggressive and obstructionist with the courts but has walked the line on outright defying them. He’s been reduced to sending <strong>Vladimir Putin </strong>pleading messages on social media. And he is term-limited.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6810c5908f0895cc2267e457" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T12:31:36.010Z">1.31pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump broadcast interview with ABC News to go out at 8pm ET</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>To mark his 100 days in office, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> sat down with ABC News’ Terry Moran in the Oval Office for a pre-recorded interview that will go out tonight at 8pm ET.</p> <p>In its <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-giving-abc-news-1st-broadcast-interview-100/story?id=121211341">primer</a> from Sunday, the outlet cited an <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-lowest-100-day-approval-rating-80-years/story?id=121165473">ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll</a> indicating that Trump is under water in a number of areas including <strong>his <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-lowest-100-day-approval-rating-80-years/story?id=121165473">approval rating</a>, which at</strong> <strong>39% is the lowest at this juncture of any president in the past 80 years</strong>.</p> <p>In addition, <strong>53% of Americans believe that the economy has gotten worse since he took offic</strong>e – a key issue that propelled Trump to his historic non-consecutive second term.

DeLauro from Connecticut, Reuters reported.</p> <p>Almost $42bn was frozen or canceled for the state department, including the frozen support for USAID, along with another $62bn-plus in competitive grant funding for the Transportation Department, according to the estimate.</p> <p>The Democrats also detailed $943m frozen for the Head Start early-education program and more than $10bn in frozen and canceled funding for the Natural Resources Conservation Service.</p> <p>“Just 100 days into office, president Trump and Elon Musk are continuing their unprecedented assault on our nation’s spending laws, and it is families, small businesses, and communities in every part of the country who are paying the price,” Murray and DeLauro said in a statement.</p> <p>“No American president has ever so flagrantly ignored our nation’s spending laws or so brazenly denied the American people investments they are owed.”</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-681099f28f08c96900e538ed" class="block

probing whether Harvard University and the Harvard Law Review violated civil rights laws when the journal’s editors fast-tracked consideration of an article written by a member of a racial minority.</strong></p> <p>News of the new probe came hours after a federal judge agreed to expedite Harvard University’s lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from freezing $2.3bn in federal funding that the Ivy League school has warned will threaten vital medical and scientific research, Reuters reported.</p> <p>The announcement of the probe by the US Departments of Education and Health and Human Services said Harvard Law Review editors may have engaged in “race-based discrimination” in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p> <p>“Harvard Law Review’s article selection process appears to pick winners and losers on the basis of race, employing a spoils system in which the race of the legal scholar is as, if not more, important than the merit of the submission,” Craig Trainor, the Education Department’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement.</p> <p>A Harvard University representative said the school is “committed to ensuring that the programs and activities it oversees are in compliance with all applicable laws and to investigating any credibly alleged violations.”</p> </div>   </div> <div

parts, his administration has said.</strong></p> <p>“President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,” the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, said in a statement provided by the White House.</p> <p>“This deal is a major victory for the president’s trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing.”</p> <p>The move means car companies paying tariffs would not be charged other levies, such as those on steel and aluminium,, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the development.</p> <p>Carmakers would be able to secure a partial reimbursement for tariffs on imported auto parts, based on the value of their US car production, under the plans.</p> <p>Cars made outside the US will still be subject to Trump’s tariffs but will be exempt from other levies. The plan is expected to be officially confirmed later on Tuesday.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/29/trump-tariff-us-carmakers">Trump plans to ease tariff impact on US carmakers</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6810923f8f082de087ab9c56" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-04-29T09:42:23.239Z">10.42am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Carney warns 'Trump is trying to break us' as president marks 100 days in office</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Good morning and welcome to our blog covering US politics as Donald Trump prepares to mark the first 100 days of his second presidency and as his northern neighbour Mark Carney celebrates his election win in Canada with a warning that “Trump is trying to break us”.</strong></p> <p>My colleague David Smith offers this critique of the chaotic last 100 days:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In three months Trump has shoved the world’s oldest continuous<em><strong> </strong></em>democracy towards authoritarianism at a pace that tyrants overseas would envy.
