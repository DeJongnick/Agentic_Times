<p>Inspired by a corn curry from Maharashtra, today’s recipe has the perfect umami flavour: a bit of heat from the chillies, some gentle sweetness from the sugar and lots of sourness from the lime juice, along with the creamy coconut milk and juicy corn. The sharpness of a fresh, herby chutney with salty butter, meanwhile, makes the perfect topping for barbecued corn on the cob. I often cook the corn straight on the hob, which is a bit tricky, but it’s how we did it when I was growing up in India. </p> <h2>Corn on the cob curry (pictured top)</h2> <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>45 min</strong><br>Serves <strong>4-6</strong></p> <p>For the curry<br><strong>4 corn</strong><strong> cobs</strong>, cut in half widthways<br><strong>2-3 tbsp peanut oil</strong>, or sunflower oil<strong><br>1 tsp cumin seeds<br>4 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and finely chopped<br><strong>20 curry leaves<br>400ml coconut milk<br>1 tsp salt</strong></p> <p>For the curry paste<br><strong>40g</strong><strong> fresh coriander</strong>, leaves and stalks<br><strong>10g</strong><strong> fresh mint,</strong> leaves only<br><strong>6 garlic cloves</strong>,<strong> </strong>peeled<strong><br></strong><strong>2½cm piece fresh ginger</strong>, peeled<strong><br>4 green chillies</strong>, stalks discarded, flesh roughly<strong> </strong>chopped (remove the pith and seeds if you prefer less heat)<strong><br>1 medium-sized red onion</strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<br><strong>1 tsp cumin seeds<br>1 tsp black pepper</strong><strong><br>2 tsp soft brown sugar<br>½ tsp ground turmeric</strong><strong><br>4 tbsp lime juice</strong></p> <p>Put the corn pieces in a pan, cover with water and bring to a boil.
