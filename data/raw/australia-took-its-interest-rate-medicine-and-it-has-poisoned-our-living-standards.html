<p>I always worry when I hear politicians or economists talk about how the economy needs to be administered some painful medicine. Inevitably it means people suffering for no good reason. Right now the medicine of interest rate rises is poisoning the economy as living standards collapse.</p> <p>If ever there was an example of the disconnect between “the economy” and what people actually experience, it came with the release of the annual gross state product (GSP) figures, which measure state economies much like GDP measures Australia’s economy.</p> <p>The news was announced by the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/economy/national-accounts/australian-national-accounts-state-accounts/2023-24-financial-year">Bureau of Statistics</a>, which told us “gross state product rose in all states and territories”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/19/young-australians-cut-back-in-cost-of-living-crisis-while-older-people-shop-more-data-shows">Young Australians cut back in cost-of-living crisis while older people shop more, data shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To be fair to the ABS, it was not spinning the numbers, just announcing the top line figure that every state and territory economy in 2023-24 was bigger than in 2022-23.</p> <p>This is unsurprising. Unless something drastic occurs – such as a pandemic that shuts down the state – economies are supposed to get bigger each year.</p> <p>The more pertinent fact was that each state economy grew more slowly in 2023-24 than it did in 2022-23: (I’ve excluded NT due to scale – you can see its graph <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/q7Wln/">here</a>.)</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="In 2023-24, state economies grew slower than in 2022-23">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;min-height:400px&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-vis-M7IGM&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; defer src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/M7IGM/embed.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; data-target=&quot;#datawrapper-vis-M7IGM&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/M7IGM/full.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/M7IGM/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>And, overwhelmingly, the growth was due to population growth.</p> <p>Once you take out the increase in population, nearly every state went backwards:</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="In 2023-24 most state economies shrank on a per capita basis">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;min-height:400px&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-vis-3uKSh&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; defer src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3uKSh/embed.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; data-target=&quot;#datawrapper-vis-3uKSh&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/3uKSh/full.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/3uKSh/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>The biggest driver of economic growth across the economy last financial year was Queensland, even though its economy is only the third-biggest:</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Queensland was the biggest driver of Australia’s economy in 2023-24">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;min-height:400px&quot; id=&quot;datawrapper-vis-PtJKN&quot;&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; defer src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PtJKN/embed.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; data-target=&quot;#datawrapper-vis-PtJKN&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/PtJKN/full.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/PtJKN/">If the graph does not display click here</a></p> <p>The reason was Queensland exports – especially coal – grew substantially compared with 2022-23 due to fewer weather disruptions.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>By contrast, WA had a shocker of a year because its exports were disrupted by weather.

It argues we are spending more than the economy can cope with and, as a result, inflation is going up.</p> <p>And so the medicine of interest rates, the RBA argues, is for our own good – we need to stop spending so much so the economy will be back “in balance”.</p> <p>Unfortunately for everyone, they got the diagnosis wrong, and the medicine they are inflicting is a poison.</p> <p>In the decade prior to the pandemic the RBA cut rates in a desperate attempt to keep households spending.
