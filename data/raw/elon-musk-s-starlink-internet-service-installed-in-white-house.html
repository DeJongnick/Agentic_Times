<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>’s Starlink internet service is now available at the White House, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/elon-musk-starlink-white-house.html">reported</a>, exacerbating conflict of interest concerns that are growing with each day the world’s richest person spends at the heart of government.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/democrats-elon-musk-investigation">Democrats demand investigation into Musk over possible criminal corruption</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Karoline Leavitt, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s White House press secretary, said the installation was done to “improve wifi connectivity on the complex”.</p> <p>But it prompted a security alert when a Musk employee accessed the roof of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next door to the White House.</p> <p>The Musk employee, Christopher Stanley, also works for the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, through which the world’s richest person is overseeing aggressive cuts to federal staffing and budgets at Trump’s behest.</p> <p>According to the Times, Stanley’s work was approved by the Secret Service but no time had been agreed upon. On the Eisenhower roof, Stanley tripped an alarm – prompting a uniformed officer to rush to the scene.</p> <p>A Trump administration spokesperson said the White House “was aware of Doge’s intentions to improve internet access on the campus” and “did not consider this matter a security incident or security breach”.</p> <p>A Secret Service spokesperson said it “collaborates closely” with Musk and his team.</p> <p>The Times also cited unnamed White House officials as saying the Starlink installation was a “donation” vetted by the White House counsel.</p> <p>Nonetheless, that has done little to quell concern about Musk’s close alliance with the president.</p> <p>On Monday, prominent Democrats including the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/democrats-elon-musk-investigation">demanded</a> an investigation of possible criminal corruption involving Starlink, citing “the Federal Aviation Administration’s decision to cancel a $2.4bn contract with Verizon to upgrade air traffic control communications, and to pay … Musk’s Starlink to help manage US airspace”.</p> <p>The SpaceX and Tesla billionaire denies conflicts of interest. Trump has said if conflicts are found, they will be addressed.</p> <p>Starlink, the Times said, is typically used by the US government “to provide internet access in emergency situations and remote locations”. Jake Williams of Hunter Strategy, a cybersecurity company, told the paper it was “super rare” for Starlink to be used on existing government infrastructure.</p> <p>The network has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/elon-musk-starlink-growing-footprint-federal-government-rcna195400">already been installed</a> at the General Services Administration. A Secret Service spokesperson said: “Only apps that meet GSA’s security and privacy standards are allowed.”</p> <p>Williams said: “It introduces another attack point. Why introduce that risk?”</p>
