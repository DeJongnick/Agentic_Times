<h1>The luxury gap: Trump builds his palace as Americans face going hungry</h1>

<p>It was a feast fit for a king – and any billionaire willing to be his subject. From gold-rimmed plates on gold-patterned tablecloths decorated with gold candlestick holders, they gorged on heirloom tomato panzanella salad, beef wellington and a dessert of roasted Anjou pears, cinnamon crumble and butterscotch ice-cream.</p> 
<p>On 15 October, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> welcomed nearly 130 deep-pocketed donors, allies and representatives of major companies <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-white-house-ballroom-9c5f582e5c0fbde2bee67f86b22898c5">for a dinner at the White House</a> to reward them for their pledged contributions to a vast new ballroom now expected to cost $300m. That the federal government had shut down two weeks earlier scarcely seemed to matter.</p> 
<p>But two weeks later, the shutdown is starting to bite – and throw Trump’s architectural folly into sharp relief. On Saturday, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">Congress</a> still locked in a legislative stalemate, a potential benefit freeze could leave tens of millions of low-income Americans without food aid. Democrats accuse Trump’s Republican party of “<a href="https://democraticleader.house.gov/media/press-releases/leader-jeffries-republicans-are-now-threatening-weaponize-hunger-against">weaponising hunger</a>” to pursue an extreme rightwing agenda.</p> 
<p>Images of wealthy monarchs or autocrats revelling in excess even as the masses struggle for bread are more commonly associated with the likes of Louis XVI and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/sep/21/marie-antoinette-style-victoria-albert-london-exhibition-fashion">Marie Antoinette</a> of France, who spent lavishly at the court of Versailles, or Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos of the Philippines, who siphoned off billions while citizens endured deepening poverty.</p> 
<p>But now America has a jarring split-screen of its own, between an oligarch president bringing a Midas touch to the White House and families going hungry, workers losing pay and government services on the brink of collapse.</p> 
<p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” exclaimed Kamala Harris, the former vice-president, during <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vp-kamala-harris-on-defeat-democrats-and-the-fight-ahead/id1583132133?i=1000734179154">an interview</a> on Jon Stewart’s Comedy Central podcast The Weekly Show. “This guy wants to create a ballroom for his rich friends while completely turning a blind eye to the fact that babies are going to starve when the Snap benefits end in just hours from now.”</p> 
<p>For years Trump has cultivated the image of a “blue-collar billionaire” and, in last year’s presidential election, he beat Harris <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/06/26/behind-trumps-2024-victory-a-more-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-voter-coalition/">by 14 percentage points</a> among non-college-educated voters – double his margin in 2016.</p> 
<p>Yet he grew up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-president-billionaire-sociopath-star">in an affluent neighbourhood </a>of Queens, New York, and joined the family business as a property developer, receiving a $1m loan from his father for projects in Manhattan. He attached his name to luxury hotels and golf clubs and achieved celebrity through the New York tabloids and as host of the reality TV show The Apprentice.</p> 
<p>As a politician, however, Trump has successfully branded himself as the voice of the left-behinds in towns hollowed out by deindustrialisation. His formula includes tapping into grievance, particularly white grievance, and into “Make America Great Again” nostalgia . His speeches are peppered with aspirational promises that his policies will guarantee his supporters a share of the nation’s wealth.</p> 
<p>This has apparently given him leeway with Trump voters who, despite their own struggles, turned a blind eye to the largesse of his first term and how it might benefit his family. But it was clear from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/president-trump-speech-inauguration">his inauguration in January</a> – when he was surrounded by the tech titans Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai and Mark Zuckerberg – that part two would be different.</p> 
<p>Trump has made a personal profit of more than $1.8bn over the past year, according to <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/feature/trumps-take/">a new financial tracker</a> run by the Center for American Progress thinktank, which says the lion’s share came from launching his own crypto ventures while aggressively deregulating the industry. Other sources of income include gifts, legal settlements and income from a $40m Amazon documentary about the first lady, Melania Trump.</p> 
<p>There have been brazen “let them eat cake” moments. In May, Trump said he would accept a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/trump-accept-luxury-plane-gift-qatar">$400m luxury plane from Qatar</a> and use it as Air Force One despite concerns that it could violate the US constitution’s emoluments clause. In October, it was reported he was demanding the justice department pay him about $230m in compensation over federal investigations he faced that <a href="https://projects.apnews.com/features/2023/trump-investigations-civil-criminal-tracker/index.html">he claims were politically motivated</a>.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hhh.umn.edu/directory/larry-jacobs">Larry Jacobs</a>, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “There is a glaring gap between the life of Donald Trump, which is gold-plated and luxurious, and the life of so many Americans who are now being hit by the government shutdown.</p> 
<p>“You have to go back in history to examples in the 1920s or the Gilded Age in the late 19th century to find this kind of opulence that’s not just going on but being advertised. That goes along with all the other efforts to enrich Donald Trump and his family and his friends. It’s a shocking display of the use of public power for private gain.”</p> 
<p>It is hard to imagine a more resonant symbol than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-reaction">the ballroom</a>. Last month, Trump left presidential historians and former White House staff aghast by demolishing the East Wing without seeking approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, which vets the construction of federal buildings. He also fired all six members of the Commission of Fine Arts, an independent agency that had expected to review the project.</p> 
<p>He claimed the destruction was a necessary step towards building a long-needed ballroom which, at 90,000 sq ft, would be big enough to hold an inauguration and dwarf the executive mansion itself. It will be funded not by the taxpayer but the new <a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/09/30/95212385/tom-wolfe-on-masters-of-the-universe">masters of the universe</a>.</p> 
<p>Among the companies represented at the 15 October dinner were Amazon, Apple, Booz Allen Hamilton, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, Lockheed Martin, Meta Platforms and T-Mobile. The Adelson Family Foundation, founded by the Republican mega-donors Miriam Adelson and her late husband Sheldon, also had a presence.</p> 
<p>The oil billionaire Harold Hamm, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Small Business Administration chief Kelly Loeffler and her husband, Jeff Sprecher, and crypto entrepreneur twins <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2017/dec/04/winklevoss-twins-bitcoin-billionaires-mark-zuckerberg">Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss</a> – who were portrayed by the actor Armie Hammer in the film The Social Network – were all on the guest list.</p> 
<p>Ethics watchdogs condemned the dinner as a blatant case of selling access to the president with the potential for influence peddling and other forms of corruption. <a href="https://x.com/antjuansea?lang=en">Antjuan Seawright</a>, a Democratic strategist, said: “It’s par for the course for Donald Trump. Millionaires and billionaires wine with him and dine with him and everything is fine with him. There’s a cost and there’s consequences.</p> 
<p>“They’re not donating this money because it’s a nice thing to do. Certainly there’s some sort of benefit to them and it could be the largest wealth transfer in American history with the big ugly bill [the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1833">Working Families Tax Cut Act</a>] just a few months ago.”</p> 
<p>That legislation delivers tax cuts for the rich while reducing food assistance and making health insurance more expensive for working families. The mood is only likely to darken as the second-longest government shutdown in history threatens to rip the social safety net away from millions of people. John Thune, the Republican majority leader in the Senate, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/30/thune-government-shutdown-snap-military">warned on Wednesday</a>: “It’s going to get ugly fast.”</p> 
<p>A number of essential public services are approaching the end of their available funds, a situation likely to be felt directly in households, schools and airports from this weekend.</p> 
<p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps, is set to lapse for 42 million people, raising the spectre of long queues at food banks. On Friday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/31/judge-blocks-trump-snap-suspension">two federal judges ruled</a> that the Trump administration must continue to fund the programme with contingency funds. But the decisions are likely to face appeals. It was also unclear how soon the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded.</p> 
<p>Schemes that provide early years’ education for low-income families and subsidised air travel to remote communities are also set to run aground. At the same time, thousands of federal employees will soon miss their first full paychecks since the shutdown began, raising the prospect of staffing shortages in areas such as airport security and air traffic control.</p> 
<p>The timing is awkward because Saturday also marks the start of open enrolment for health insurance plans under the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/about-the-aca/index.html">Affordable Care Act</a>. Premiums are expected to soar, reflecting insurers’ doubts that Congress will renew enhanced tax credits before they lapse at year’s end – one of the key points of contention in the current standoff.</p> 
<p>Trump can often appear immune to political crises. But in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/tablet/2025/10/30/oct-24-28-2025-washington-post-abc-news-ipsos-poll/">Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos opinion poll</a> released on Thursday, only 28% of Americans say they support the ballroom project, compared with 56% who oppose it. The same survey found that 45% blame Trump and Republicans for the government shutdown while 33% hold Democrats responsible. Notably, independents blame Trump and Republicans by a 2-1 margin – handing Democrats an opportunity.</p> 
<p><a href="https://johnzogbystrategies.com/">John Zogby,</a> an author and pollster, said: “For the first time in a while, they have an opening with rural voters. Medicaid and Snap are infrastructural necessities in the poorest counties. Without programmes like this being funded, you’re not just talking about hurting poor people or rural people who are invisible; you’re talking about shutting down hospitals and clinics, and that matters to people. Democrats should be fanning out in rural areas and people should be telling their stories.”</p> 
<p>It is safe to assume that, had Barack Obama or Joe Biden built a ballroom during the crippling austerity of a government shutdown, Republicans and rightwing media would have gone scorched-earth against them. Trump’s ostentatious display of wealth and cronyism comes against a backdrop of widening social and economic inequality. Democrats, however, are often accused of lacking a killer instinct.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/02/republican-joe-walsh-iowa-trump">Joe Walsh</a>, a former Republican representative aligned with the conservative Tea Party who four months ago became a Democrat, said: <em>“</em>Democrats don’t know how to fight and I can see they’re already squirming on this ballroom issue. We’ve got a guy in the White House who every day is taking a blowtorch to this country and most Democrats don’t understand the moment. He ploughs ahead and tears down the East Wing because he knows he can get away with it.”</p> 
<p>Walsh believes that the next Democratic president should commit to demolishing Trump’s ballroom. “This is somebody who’s a tyrant who believes he can ignore all laws, rules, norms and processes,” he added. “You have to draw the line on that. No, he cannot unilaterally demolish the East Wing and build a big old ballroom. This guy has no clue what America is. We don’t have palaces in America.”</p>
