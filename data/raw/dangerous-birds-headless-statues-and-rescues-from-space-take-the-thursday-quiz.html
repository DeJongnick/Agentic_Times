<h1>Dangerous birds, headless statues and rescues from space – take the Thursday quiz</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-03-20T11:00:22Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/mar/13/the-guardian-thursday-quiz-general-knowledge-topical-news-trivia-201">Last week</a>, the Thursday quiz idly speculated as to whether Lady Jane Grey, having been queen for less time than Liz Truss was in Downing Street, went on a similar book promotional tour. Many readers pointed out in the comments that in fact she was imprisoned and executed. May the quiz gently draw your attention to the rules about there being no need to factcheck obvious jokes. It is quite clear that Lady Jane Grey did not embark on such a venture. For a start, unlike Liz Truss, she did not write <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/19/five-year-old-on-acid-liz-truss-ten-years-to-save-the-west-digested-by-john-crace">a hubristic book arguing she had been right all along</a>, or issue legal threats to the powers that be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/09/liz-truss-sends-legal-letter-ordering-starmer-to-stop-saying-she-crashed-economy">insisting they refrain from saying she crashed the economy</a>. Anyhoo, here is this week’s quiz. Enjoy!</p>
