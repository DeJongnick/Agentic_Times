<p>Good afternoon, readers. Poland scrambled its own and Nato air defences to shoot down drones that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/poland-shoots-down-drones-over-its-territory-amid-russian-attack-on-ukraine-says-military">entered its airspace on Wednesday</a> during a Russian attack on Ukraine. Poland’s army has called the incident an “act of aggression” as Warsaw got involved in the war in its neighbouring country for the first time.</p> 
<p>The Polish prime minister, Donald Tusk, said early on Thursday that operations were continuing and that he was in “constant contact” with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte. Tusk called for an emergency meeting of the council of ministers at 8am local time, a government spokesperson said.</p> 
<p>The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/sep/10/poland-pm-condemns-repeated-violation-of-airspace-amid-russian-attack-on-ukraine-follow-live?page=with%3Ablock-68c11a958f0881130a81fc29#block-68c11a958f0881130a81fc29">described the attack</a> as “another step of escalation” and “an extremely dangerous precedent for Europe”.</p>

<h2>Before bed read</h2> 
<p>Homer’s Iliad isn’t just a foundational Hellenic text: it’s the great primal myth of war, sacred and eternal.
