<h2>Notes</h2> 
<p>In the election there will be a total of 150 electorates. This is one fewer than at the 2022 election, as two electorates were <a href="https://www.aec.gov.au/redistributions/">abolished due to redistributions by the AEC</a>, and one new one – Bullwinkel in Western Australia – was created.</p> 
<p>The list of candidates includes only those announced by the major parties and prominent minor parties to date. It will be updated with the full list of confirmed candidates when that becomes available.</p> 
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://www.ridl.com.au/">Griffith University’s Relational Insights Data Lab</a> for providing data and analysis for this interactive feature.</p>

<p>Almost all the demographic, wealth and infrastructure data was extracted from the 2021 census or other Australian Bureau of Statistics datasets such as the survey of income and housing. Census data was adjusted to take into account the redistribution of electorate boundaries since 2021.</p> 
<p>All the data was adjusted to the latest commonwealth electorate boundaries using population-weighted correspondence files.</p> 
<p>• This article was amended on 13 May 2025 to re-calculate the national average and electorate-share of homeowner and renter dwellings. All tenure data now comes from datasets downloaded from ABS Tablebuilder. “Not applicable” has been removed from the total number of dwellings when calculating the share of rental and homeowner dwellings.</p>
