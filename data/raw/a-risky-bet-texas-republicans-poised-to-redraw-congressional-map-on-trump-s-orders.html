<p>At the behest of Donald Trump, Texas Republicans are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/greg-abbott-midterms-republicans">poised to redraw</a> their state’s congressional map to try and gain as many as five congressional seats, a move that is likely to further weaken the influence of the state’s fast-growing non-white population and could wind up backfiring on the party.</p> <p>The effort to redraw the map represents a blunt and undemocratic effort by Republican lawmakers to pick the voters who elect them, and comes at a time when many of the party’s positions are unpopular. The US president and national Republicans are making the push because the GOP holds a 220-212 advantage in the US House (there are three Democratic vacancies) and Trump’s party typically loses seats in the midterm elections, which will happen next year. </p> <p>But it’s a <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/house/redistricting/behind-republicans-risky-bid-draw-themselves-five-more-seats-texas?check_logged_in=1">risky bet</a>. Twenty-five of Texas’s 38 congressional districts are currently represented by Republicans, a result that was carefully engineered when lawmakers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/19/texas-republicans-approve-redrawn-maps-decreasing-representation-minority-voters">redrew the state’s congressional map</a> in 2021. During that process, mapmakers focused on shoring up Republican seats instead of trying to pick up Democratic ones.</p> <p>In order to pick up new seats, Republicans will have to spread their voters from safe Republican ones into Democratic districts. It could allow them to pick up more seats, but also makes the Republican districts more competitive and potentially winnable by Democrats in a strong year.</p> <p>The number of seats Republicans are able to pick up “depends on how much risk Republicans want to take,” said David Wasserman, an analyst at the Cook Political Report who closely follows US House races. “Republicans could probably target three Democratic seats very easily, but once it gets to four or five, that could put additional Republican seats at risk.”</p> <p>When Republicans drew the existing map, they blunted the political influence of non-white voters in the state, who <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/08/12/texas-2020-census/">accounted for 95%</a> of the state’s population growth over the last decade. The new maps could further weaken their ability to elect their preferred candidates.</p> <p>“The current maps are already blatantly racist and discriminate against voters of color, communities of color, all over the state,” said Anthony Gutierrez, the executive director of the Texas chapter of Common Cause, a watchdog group. “There would be absolutely no way you get to five more Republican districts without just completely trampling on minority voting rights.”</p> <p>Two Democratic seats likely to be targeted are the ones in south Texas currently held by representatives Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, Wasserman said. Trump won both districts in 2024 and Republicans could easily tweak their boundaries to make them winnable. Democrats also represent four districts in the Houston area, and Republicans could shift the boundaries to try and pick up one or two districts depending on how aggressive they want to be.</p> <p>The Republican push to redraw the map comes as the state is still reeling from deadly floods that left at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/16/arizona-adelita-grijalva-wins-democratic-primary">134 people dead</a> with more than 100 people still missing. Democrats in the Texas legislature are reportedly considering walking out of the special session in order to deny Republicans a quorum needed to pass the maps. Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, has said he will assist in “hunting down” members <a href="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1945173661704708547">who walk out</a> and compel them back to the capitol.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/15/texas-floods-death-toll">Texas death toll reaches 134 as new flash flood watch issued</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To justify redrawing the maps, Texas governor Greg Abbott pointed to a <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/7-7-2025-DOJ-Letter-re-Unconstitutional-Race-Based-Congressional-Distric.pdf">7 July letter</a> from the justice department claiming lawmakers had impermissibly sorted voters based on their race. Both the letter’s argument, and Abbott’s quick acceptance of it, raised eyebrows because Texas officials have said for years they did not consider race at all when they drew the maps.</p> <p>“My jaw dropped when I saw that letter,” said Mark Gaber, an attorney at the Campaign Legal Center, who is representing some of the plaintiffs suing Texas over the maps already in place. “Either the witnesses were not telling the truth or the entire premise of this special session and the mid-decade redistricting is false.”</p> <p>In its letter, the justice department pointed to four districts where it claimed voters had been unconstitutionally sorted by race. In two of those districts, two different groups of minority voters constitute a majority that can elect their preferred candidates. Another district is majority Hispanic. The final district it raised issue with was drawn after judges found intentional discrimination in a previous district.</p> <p>Several legal experts said those claims were highly questionable.</p> <p>“The DoJ letter is completely concocted and it reflects a complete misunderstanding of the law, but that’s not what they’re interested in,” said Thomas Saenz, president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is representing some of the plaintiffs challenging the current congressional map.</p> <p>“If I were them, I would be consulting legal counsel about the possibility of being found guilty of perjury in what they testified to under oath,” he added.</p> <p>Mapmakers may want to keep communities who share common interests together for reasons that have nothing to do with their race, said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School who worked on voting rights issues at both the justice department and White House said the letter was “nonsense”.</p> <p>“What they appear to articulate in the letters is the notion that any time there happens to be multiple minorities in a district, that’s a constitutional violation. And that’s like seven different versions of wrong,” he said. </p>
