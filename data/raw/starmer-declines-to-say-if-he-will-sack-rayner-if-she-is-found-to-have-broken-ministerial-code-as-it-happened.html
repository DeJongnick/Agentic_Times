In <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/robert-jenrick-asylum-seekers-should-be-detained-in-camps/">his article</a> <strong>Tim Shipman</strong> reports:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><strong>Jenrick</strong> says ‘there’s a lot to welcome’ in Reform UK’s plan. ‘It’s obviously going to be very important that we deport all the illegal migrants in the country and the next government has to make that their priority.’ He does criticise Farage’s suggestion that a Reform government would focus on deporting undocumented males, rather than women and children. ‘The people-smuggling gangs would exploit women and girls and it would encourage even more young men to pose as 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds,’ he says.</p> <p>Jenrick does not stop there. On legal migration, he wants to outflank Farage and throw down the gauntlet to Badenoch. ‘Damaging though illegal migration is, legal migration is even more harmful to the country because of the sheer eye-watering numbers of people who have been coming across in recent years perfectly legally. It’s putting immense pressure on public services.’</p> <p>He calls for a return to the situation in the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s when the UK was a net emigration country. ‘I think the country now needs breathing space after this period of mass migration. The age of being open to the world and his wife, who are low-wage, low-skilled individuals, and their dependents has to come to an end. Reversing recent low-skilled migration will likely mean a sustained period of net emigration. I would support that’ ….</p> <p>[Jenrick] goes further than Farage on the housing of asylum seekers. ‘They should be detained in camps,’ he says. ‘The facilities will need to be rudimentary prisons, not holiday camps. It’s not what Reform have suggested, which is cabins with a fence around them.’</p> </blockquote> <p>According to <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2025/09/04/ab2ab/2?utm_source=daily_question&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=daily%2F2025%2F09%2F04_question_2">new polling </a>by <strong>YouGov</strong>, this is very much a minority view.

The Palestinian flag would now be flown from the government’s headquarters in Edinburgh, he added.</p> <p>Opinion amongst Scottish Jews is not unanimous. Many Jewish academics support calls for economic boycotts of Israel, and for its conduct to be labelled a genocide, as well as derecognising a controversial definition of antisemitism from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance which is seen to conflate criticism of Israel with antisemitism.</p> <p>Timothy Lovat, chair of the <strong>Jewish Council of Scotland</strong>, said he was disappointed Swinney appeared to have ignored the JCS’s fears about rising antisemitism when he met them on Monday, to alert them to his proposed intervention on Wednesday.</p> <p>While it was “indisputable that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire [and] equally beyond debate that both Israel and Hamas bear responsibility for this tragic situation”, it would be “irresponsible” to label it a genocide. That could only be determined by a competent court, Lovat said.</p> <p>Lovat said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>While any position you or the Scottish government might take on the matter is unlikely to have any impact on the situation in Gaza, it is likely to have significant negative implications for our community here in Scotland.</p> <p>In particular, setting out a stance likely to be publicly perceived simply and without qualification as anti-Israel, without drawing any distinction between the state of Israel and its current leadership, or acknowledging the continuing culpability of Hamas, is likely to have a far greater and more immediate impact locally, fuelling ‘antizionist’ – and antisemitic – hatred and discrimination against Scotland’s Jews and our institutions and symbols, than it is on the situation in the Middle East, let alone in Westminster.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lovat said he believed Swinney was a Zionist who supported the right of Jews to establish a state in their ancestral homeland. But “rather than risk increasing fear, anxiety, and trauma in our community, we would respectfully ask you to work with us to promote that vision in a principled, pragmatic, and constructive manner”.</p> <p>Swinney said today he wanted “every community in Scotland to feel safe and supported and welcome and valued”, and he said he was certain Police Scotland did everything it could to protect Jewish people.</p> <p>He admitted that when he met the JCS on Monday he “knew they would be uncomfortable with what I was going to say in parliament but I have to do the right thing and act within the law. [There] is a genocide going on in Gaza that I cannot ignore.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-04T15:49:42.421Z">at 4.49pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b9afb88f08b5e63ea7813a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-04T15:37:45.547Z">4.37pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Starmer says when he defended Rayner on Monday, he did not know about new advice saying she had underpaid tax</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has also rejected the claim that, when he defended Angela Rayner on Monday, he knew that she had been told she underpaid her stamp duty.</p> <p>In his interview with Chris Mason, Starmer said that at the time <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/01/women-children-home-office-refugee-family-reunions-uk-politics-live-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-68b5a4618f08e8bac2726701#block-68b5a4618f08e8bac2726701">he told Radio 5 Live on Monday</a> that people briefing against Rayner were making a “big mistake”, he knew that, when she first paid the stamp duty, she had been told she was paying the right amount.</p> <p>He also knew at that point she was “taking further advice”.

That money also went to the UK Treasury, rather than the Scottish exchequer.</p> <p>Pressed by reporters on Thursday whether that honoured the social contract Sturgeon has argued the wealthy should have to fund public services, Swinney did not engage with the fairness question, but said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think people obviously have got to take forward their own tax arrangements and to make sure their tax arrangements are compliant with the existing legislative arrangements … I just think people have obviously got to fulfil their tax obligations in all circumstances.</p> </blockquote> <p>Her register of interests implies she will earn around £300,000 for her recent biography Frankly; she reported her company had received two £75,000 payments from Pan Macmillan, her publishers, and expects two further instalments.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Sturgeon said: “Nicola will pay all tax due.

Originally the high court said migrants should have to move until until the matter was finally resolved, but the court of appeal said they should be allowed to stay until the full trial settles the matter.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68b957e08f087bf4418b54ca" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-04T09:14:20.934Z">10.14am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>, the chancellor, was also asked in her Sky News interview if the Rayner controversy showed that the stamp duty regime was “way too complicated”.

Quite a lot of the facts are not in the public domain, and may not be known to Starmer himself (mainly – what exactly was the tax advice Rayner had that led her to think she did not need to pay a higher rate of stamp duty, and how much had Rayner disclosed to these advisers?), and although in theory Starmer can ignore a recommendation from Sir Laurie Magnus, the ethics adviser investigating Rayner, there is a chance Magnus could come up with conclusions that make resignation inevitable.</p> <p>Here is our overnight story about Rayner’s plight.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/03/angela-rayner-battling-for-political-survivial-after-referring-herself-to-ethics-adviser">Rayner battling for political survival after referring herself to ethics adviser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Magnus is expected to report soonish – within days, rather than weeks – but until he does the government will be in limbo.</p> <p>There are various new developments in the story this morning, but none that dramatically alter Rayner’s survival prospects. Here are the key lines.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Rayner was told on Monday that her original assumption about how much stamp duty she had to pay on the flat she bought in Hove might be wrong.</strong> In controversies like this, ‘who knew what, when?’ always becomes a key issue and yesterday Downing Street ducked questions about when Keir Starmer first learned there was a problem. <strong>Bridget Phillipson</strong>, the education secretary, was giving interviews this morning, and she was more forthcoming about when Rayner was told there was a problem. She told the Today programme:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>My understanding is that, whilst Angela Rayner had received some advice on Monday, it was definitively given to her on Wednesday that she had made a mistake in terms of the amount of stamp duty that she had paid on the purchase. So that was on Wednesday. But there were limitations in what she could discuss and disclose, including with others and including in public, until that court order [a court order saying she could not discuss details of the trust set up for her disabled son, which affected her stamp duty liability] had been lifted on Tuesday.</p> </blockquote> <p>In another interview, on Sky News, Phillipson said that Rayner received the “original version” of this legal advice on Monday, but that it “wasn’t later clarified until the Wednesday”.</p> <p>Phillipson has not said when Starmer was first told Rayner may have underpaid her stamp duty, but <strong>Jason Groves</strong> from the Daily Mail <a href="https://x.com/JasonGroves1/status/1963504098205913201">thinks</a> the PM would have been alerted to this on Monday. Commenting on the Phillipson inteviews, Groves said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Given this timeline, it seems very likely that Starmer knew Rayner had failed to pay her taxes in full when he defended her in public on Monday afternoon and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/03/farage-starmer-badenoch-pmqs-news-updates-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-68b83a848f08020a75f12a1a#block-68b83a848f08020a75f12a1a">said her critics were making ‘a mistake’</a></p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Rayner consulted three people before she concluded that she only needed to pay the standard rate of stamp duty on her flat purchase, not the higher rate for a second home, broadcasters have been briefed.</strong> In<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqxzj2qq1lno"> their BBC story</a>, <strong>Billy Kenber </strong>and <strong>Damian Grammaticas</strong> report:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is understood the deputy prime minister consulted one individual experienced in conveyancing and two experts on the law around trusts before the purchase.</p> <p>However, it is unclear if any of those people were experts in complex tax law and it is not known if they knew about the full details of the trust, which was set up to help fund care for her son.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Kevin Hollinrake, the Conservative party chair, has written to HM Revenue and Customs asking it to investigate whether Rayner was guilty of tax evasion.</strong> As Sky News <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/politics-latest-starmer-labour-badenoch-small-boats-farage-reform-12593360">reports</a>, Hollinrake said in his letter:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Why did [Rayner], or her representatives, not take the necessary steps to check with HMRC on whether second homes stamp duty was actually payable. This was ‘careless’ at best, and did not meet her requirement to act responsibly.”</p> <p>There are legitimate questions on whether Ms Rayner could have afforded the property if she had been liable for the additional £40,000 in second homes stamp duty, on top of the £30,0000 standard stamp duty and the £150,000 downpayment towards the Hove flat.</p> <p>This then raises the question whether the tax evasion was deliberate, to try to get away with minimising her upfront costs so she could afford her £650,000 Natwest mortgage (which is likely to cost in the region £4,000 a month to service).</p> </blockquote> <p>Hollinrake also says it should have been obvious to Rayner that she did have to pay the higher rate.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/kevinhollinrake/status/1963358870493171963">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The guidance on higher rates of Stamp Duty for a second home in the case of the first being held in a family trust is clear <a href="https://t.co/1wYO84QwQK">pic.twitter.com/1wYO84QwQK</a></p>&mdash; Kevin Hollinrake MP (@kevinhollinrake) <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinhollinrake/status/1963358870493171963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 3, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>There will be more on this as the day goes on.
