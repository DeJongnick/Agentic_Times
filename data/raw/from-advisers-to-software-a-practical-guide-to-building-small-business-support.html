<p>Running a small business no longer means going it alone, according to new research commissioned by accounting software platform Xero. In a survey of 500 Australian small business owners, co-owners and founders, 79% say they have a support network. Many point to fellow business owners, family and friends, online communities and Google as their go-to sources.</p> <p>However, there’s room for improvement. The research, published in Xero’s <a href="https://www.xero.com/au/campaign/its-your-business-report-au/?utm_source=content_comms&amp;utm_medium=guardian&amp;utm_campaign=q3" rel="nofollow">It’s your business report</a>, also found that while business owners generally know where to go for guidance, many (65%) don’t know how to apply the information to their own business.</p> <p>We spoke to Angad Soin, managing director ANZ and global chief strategy officer at Xero, about where to find support and how to make the most of it. His take: spend time building a suite of sources, including a mix of people and technology. “We find small business owners feel more confident and supported when they have several different sources to call on if they have questions or want to bounce ideas around.”</p> <h2>Professional advisers</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Angad Soin, managing director ANZ and global chief strategy officer at Xero.</p></li> </ul> <p>The majority of small businesses (86%) work with some kind of adviser – such as an accountant or bookkeeper – and those who do are more likely to feel confident and report revenue increases, compared to those without that external support.</p> <p>Why? Because professional advisers have more to offer than just checks and balances, Xero’s research finds. For founders, Soin says being open and honest about long-term goals allows for deeper partnerships that go above and beyond simple advice. “When a business is looking for someone to guide and support them in thinking about how they grow their business, that’s when we really see great results,” he says.</p> <h2>Tools and technology</h2> <p>For every small business headache, there’s often a digital cure, with dozens of apps, software and platforms all promising a solution. When it comes to managing finances, you need accounting software, such as Xero, that allows you to send invoices, collect payments and track expenses, giving visibility over your cashflow, Soin says. Working alongside an adviser, he recommends choosing a platform that plugs directly into a bank feed to save time and make it easier to balance the books.</p> <p>“Pick a tool that can scale with you,” he says. “In the early days, you’ll naturally focus on the basics, like invoicing and compliance. But as your business grows, your needs will become more complex. So, it’s important to find a platform that can support you as you grow, with areas like payroll, workflows to manage cashflow, and insights and reporting to help you make more informed decisions.”</p> <h2>Networking groups</h2> <p>Local business meet-ups, industry associations and online forums can be a goldmine of support, Soin says. While advisers provide valuable guidance, peer-to-peer networking helps expand your support base by connecting you with like-minded people who understand the daily realities of running a business.</p>    <p>“The people who attend [these types of groups] have a real level of respect for each other; they know you’re living it, too,” Soin says. “You can get tangible, empathetic advice from those types of forums.”</p> <h2>Accountability buddies</h2> <p>For those considering an accountability partner, the first step is to get clear on what you’re looking for, Soin says.</p> <p>“Some people want to catch up with someone for coffee once a month to test ideas. Others want a mentor who is one stage ahead. Be honest with yourself: is it to keep you accountable now, or to help with future growth?”</p> <p>As long as you’re clear on your intentions and communicate well, Soin says an accountability partnership can span different industries and even countries.</p> <h2>Funding and educational support</h2> <p>When it comes to funding, grants and networking opportunities, Soin says local, state and federal governments have a range of services to support small businesses. Local chambers of commerce are another avenue to explore for founders looking to connect with other local businesses and access training and resources.</p> <p>“There’s something like 580 different grants available for a small business, plus regional development programs for businesses outside the metro areas. Understandably, it can be a real challenge to navigate all of this alone, so lean on your adviser or peer network for help,” he says.</p>    <p>There’s also the <a href="https://www.xero.com/au/events/xero-beautiful-business-fund/" rel="nofollow">Xero Supercharge Your Business Fund</a>, formerly known as the Xero Beautiful Business Fund – an initiative offering funding to support small businesses and not-for-profits with their growth plans and help drive future success. Keep an eye out for the 2026 program, set to open soon.</p> <h2>Need extra support?</h2> <p>Running a small business can be incredibly rewarding, but it can also have its challenges.

This program is a great resource to turn to.”</p> <p><strong><a href="https://xero.com/au/?utm_source=content_comms&amp;utm_medium=guardian&amp;utm_campaign=q2" rel="nofollow">Ready to level up or begin your entrepreneurial journey?
