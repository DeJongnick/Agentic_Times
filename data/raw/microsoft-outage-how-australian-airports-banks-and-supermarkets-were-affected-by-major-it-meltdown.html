<p>The Australian government has warned a global IT outage that threw major businesses including airports, banks, supermarkets and media outlets into chaos on Friday could still take “some time to resolve”.</p> <p>The government activated a National Coordination Mechanism meeting of emergency authorities as well as representatives from the major supermarkets, banks, airlines and other key industries on Friday night to respond after Windows workstations were hit by the “blue screen of death”.</p> <p>The home affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, said on Friday night the problem, which began about 3.30pm, was caused by a software update linked to the cybersecurity provider CrowdStrike. She said the company had attended the meeting and confirmed it had “issued a fix”, but it could still take “some time to resolve”.</p> <p>The incident was not security related or a cyberattack but a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts, the CrowdStrike chief executive, George Kurtz, said a subsequent statement. .</p> <p>The crowd-sourced website Downdetector has listed Telstra, Microsoft, Google, Foxtel, National Australia Bank, ABC, Uber, ANZ, and Bendigo Bank as suffering outages.</p> <p>But Qantas, Virgin Australia, Jetstar, police across much of the country and the federal and NSW governments were hit, as well as point-of-sale machines at shops, including Coles and Woolworths.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/19/microsoft-windows-pcs-outage-blue-screen-of-death">IT outage: banks, airlines and media hit by issues linked to Windows PCs</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Airports</h2> <p>Some flight screens at Sydney airport and other airports across the country went blank on Friday before returning at 5.30pm, with flights cancelled across the country and many passengers experiencing delays. Manual check-in was put in place for some airlines in Perth, with reports that people were struggling to get home from Bali.</p> <p>Melbourne airport said in a post on X on Friday evening that Jetstar was “experiencing a significant outage” while Qantas and Virgin were “slowly processing passengers”. Jetstar’s international arm and the Singaporean carrier Scoot also experienced ongoing issues at Melbourne airport.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/techAU/status/1814194514405552211">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sydney Airport flight displays have all BSOD&#39;d. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/microsoft?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#microsoft</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crowdstrike?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#crowdstrike</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZL9QwGdi1a">pic.twitter.com/ZL9QwGdi1a</a></p>&mdash; techAU (@techAU) <a href="https://twitter.com/techAU/status/1814194514405552211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote>   </figure>  <p>A Virgin spokesperson said the company was aware of a “large-scale IT outage impacting multiple airlines and other businesses which is having an impact on our operations” before the situation became stable several hours later.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <h2>Banks</h2> <p>The Commonwealth Bank confirmed some PayID payment transactions were affected, and ANZ were also having trouble with some transfers.</p> <p>“We know some customers have been unable to make PayID payments,” a Commonwealth Bank spokesperson said. “If you are unable to use PayID, you’re still able to make payments between your accounts or pay someone using their BSB and account number.”</p> <p>At Westpac, there was “no impact to any Westpac customer-facing applications”, a spokesperson said.</p> <h2>Media outlets</h2> <p>Media outlets were also affected, with presenters on the ABC using their phones to read the news after the teleprompters went down and unable to show graphics, such as the weather map. </p> <p>In Melbourne, Nine News journalists were forced to improvise the start of its 4pm bulletin amid problems with their prepared news packages. </p> <p>Sky News had similar problems, with its services reduced at one stage because of the outage.</p> <h2>Supermarkets</h2> <p>Payment systems in stores were impacted, with customers at some Coles and Woolworths stores not able to tap their cards in-store.</p> <p>One Liquorland employee said they were turning customers away because their system was down. “We are shut, we are telling all these people to go away.”</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/GlasseyMolly/status/1814201894522540532">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Local Coles has lowered its doors and with staff telling customers they’re closing. “You’ll hear all about it on the news tonight,” the store manager told a crowd outside.
