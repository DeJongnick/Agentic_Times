<p>Morning everyone. The latest Cop climate summit has kicked off in Brazil with a dire warning from the United Nations about the “triple whammy” impact of 2023, 2024 and 2025 – which are on course to be the three hottest years ever recorded. We have more reports from Belém, and analysis at home about how climate politics has become so toxic for the Coalition.</p> 
<p>After yesterday’s shocking report on Roblox, there are calls today for the platform to be resticted to over-16s, former US House speaker Nancy Pelosi is standing down, and we reveal the “poor door” assigned to affordable housing tenants in a Sydney harbour apartment tower.</p>
