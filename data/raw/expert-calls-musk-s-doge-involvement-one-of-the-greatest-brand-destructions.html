<p>The prominent US marketing professor Scott Galloway said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>’s decision to implement brutal job and spending cuts within the federal government on behalf of the Trump administration was “one of the greatest brand destructions” ever.</p> <p>Speaking on Friday’s episode of the popular Pivot podcast, which he co-hosts, Galloway <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1nhO3w0Gp0">said</a> Trump’s billionaire businessman adviser alienated the customer base of his electrical vehicle manufacturer Tesla – one of his most important holdings – while aligning himself with a president whose allies aren’t interested in the kinds of cars the company makes.</p> <p>Galloway then cited polling that suggested Tesla had fallen from the eighth-most reputable brand in 2021 to 95th.</p> <p>“He’s alienated the wrong people,” Galloway remarked. “Three-quarters of Republicans would never consider buying an EV. So he’s cozied up to the people who aren’t interested in EVs.”</p> <p>Galloway also rattled off figures maintaining that Tesla’s sales were down 59% in France, 81% in Sweden, 74% in the Netherlands, 66% in Denmark, 50% in Switzerland and 33% in Portugal.</p> <p>Musk in recent months had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/25/tesla-sales-europe-elon-musk-donald-trump-afd">sought</a> to intervene in various European political affairs, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/28/elon-musk-germany-afd-party">including Germany’s federal election</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/03/musk-accused-of-politicising-of-young-girls-in-uk-to-attack-starmer">UK’s row over grooming gangs</a> – particularly on X, the social media platform he owns.</p> <p>After his meddling put off many in Europe, a lucrative EV market, Tesla’s Chinese competitor BYD outsold the Austin-based company on the continent for the first time ever in April, according to a report from Jato Dynamics, which supplies automotive industry intelligence.</p> <p>“This has arguably been one of the greatest brand destructions,” Galloway said to his co-host, veteran tech journalist Kara Swisher. “Tesla was a great brand.</p> <p>“He’s alienated his core demographic.”</p> <p>The federal job and spending cuts attributed to Musk stem from his involvement leading the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) during Trump’s second US presidency, which began in January. Musk landed the role after his super political action committee <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/12/elon-musk-america-pac-donald-trump-campaign?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">donated</a> $200m to Trump’s successful run in November to return to the White House after he lost the 2020 election as the incumbent.</p> <p>Opinion polling since has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/19/trump-musk-ai-brand-reputation-survey">suggested</a> strong disapproval of the work Musk has done for Trump, including some research showing a majority of voters dislike the way the businessman and Doge have dealt with federal government employees in particular as the so-called “department” slashed jobs.</p> <p>Toward the end of April, Tesla was reporting a 71% dip in profits – and, on an earnings call with Tesla investors, Musk said he would start pulling back from his role at Doge beginning in May.</p> <p>Musk said his work getting the government’s “financial house in order is mostly done” and therefore his “time allocation to Doge will drop significantly”.</p> <p>One nonpartisan research group, the Partnership for Public Service, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-cuts-cost-135-billion-analysis-elon-musk-department-of-government-efficiency/">estimated</a> in late April that about $160bn in cuts touted by Doge were on track to cost roughly $135bn.</p>
