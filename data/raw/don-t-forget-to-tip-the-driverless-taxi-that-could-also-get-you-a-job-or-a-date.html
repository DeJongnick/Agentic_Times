<p><strong>Name:</strong> Waymo.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> Founded in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car Project.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> A driverless taxi and recruitment service.</p> <p><strong>How futuristic </strong><strong>– and they’ve been working on this since 2009? </strong>Actually, it goes back to 2004 and a prototype autonomous car built by Stanford University. The Google project became known as Waymo in 2016.</p> <p><strong>Any idea how many more years until we see the first self-driving taxis? </strong>They already have them in San Francisco, LA and Phoenix, among other places.</p> <p><strong>You mean they’re testing the technology on actual roads? </strong>No, I mean you can get a Waymo to take you somewhere in San Francisco right now …</p> <p><strong>It’s a miracle!</strong> … and also possibly offer you a job while you’re in there.</p> <p><strong>Now that’s service.</strong> <strong>How does the technology behind the recruitment end of this whole thing work? </strong>It’s surprisingly lo-fi: someone riding in a Waymo left a handwritten note advertising some senior software engineer positions “to work on AI/music project”, along with the company website and an email address for applicants.</p> <p><strong>Presuming that anyone getting into a driverless taxi would be precisely the kind of devil-may-care nerd they were looking for? </strong>Exactly.</p> <p><strong>Did it work? </strong>The person who left the note, the Influur CEO Alessandra Angelini, says she received about 60 CVs as a result.</p> <p><strong>I’m amazed 60 qualified applicants got into the same Waymo that day. </strong>That’s statistically unlikely, but someone who did hire the taxi took a pic of the note and posted it on social media, where it was viewed 300,000 times.</p> <p><strong>So that’s how it works. </strong>Job offers aren’t the only advantage of driverless technology. Another rider left a note in a Waymo looking for a date, listing his age (26), his height (“5ft 10in on a good day”), other particulars (“runs marathons”) and a phone number.</p> <p><strong>Did </strong><em><strong>that </strong></em><strong>work? </strong>He got 200 replies, but again, only because someone else posted a pic on social media.</p> <p><strong>It seems this new recruitment system relies rather heavily on third parties with </strong><strong>X accounts. </strong>Also, the taxis get cleaned pretty regularly, so your ad won’t last long.</p> <p><strong>Will the novelty of this approach wear off once driverless taxis become commonplace? </strong>Probably. I mean, you wouldn’t respond to an ad for a date that somebody left in an Uber.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “Enjoy the ride, and thank you for your application!”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Drivers wanted.”</p>
