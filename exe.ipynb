It was a simple bat-and-ball game, created in 1958 by scientist <a href=\"https://www.aps.org/apsnews/2008/09/first-video-game\">William Higinbotham</a> at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, that is widely the considered the first ever video game created purely for entertainment. Tennis for Two ran on an oscilloscope and was designed as a minor diversion for visitors attending the lab’s annual open day, but when people started playing, a queue developed that eventually extended out of the front door and around the side of the building. It was the first indication that computer games might turn out to be popular.</p> <p>I’ve been unable to find out if Ralph Baer, the inventor of the first mass-produced games console, the <a href=\"https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1580096/magnavox-odyssey-videogames-console-baer-ralph-h/\">Magnavox Odyssey</a>, ever played Tennis for Two. However, when he was developing the idea of a TV that could play games, while working at the defence contractor Sanders Associates in the late 1960s, the rudimentary elements of what his prototype consoles could display on screen were vertical lines and square dots. When Magnavox released the product in 1972, its key games were Table Tennis and Tennis (the same as Table Tennis, except you could place a plastic overlay of a tennis court on your TV screen). These allowed two players to bat a ball to each other, adding a little “spin” by flicking the dial on the side of the primitive joypad. This was an extension of the knob on the Tennis for Two controller that let you alter the height of your return shot, but neither game really allowed much in the way of player skill.</p> <p>From here, of course, we get to Pong, widely considered the first smash hit video arcade game. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell played tennis on the Odyssey and thought he could do better; with programmer Al Alcorn, he divided the onscreen bat into eight areas, each deflecting the ball at a different angle. Here we had the true beginnings of input finesse, a crucial element of all future video games, giving the player room to add skill and timing to their shots. Pong was such a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/nov/25/history-pong-video-game-atari-nolan-bushnell-al-alcorn\">success</a>, Bushnell realised Atari needed a single-player version – hence the 1976 coin-op <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMUv8KvVt08\">Breakout</a>, where you hit the ball not at another human participant but at a wall of disappearing bricks. Breakout was effectively a one-player tennis game, and its brilliance had two major ramifications for the video game industry in Japan: it was the first successful release for legendary manufacturer Namco after its purchase of Atari’s Japanese arm in 1974, effectively propelling the company into the video arcade business; Breakout also inspired a game designer named Tomohiro Nishikado, who would use it as the basis of a certain 1978 arcade game, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/04/space-invaders-at-40-tomohiro-nishikado-interview\">Space Invaders</a>. So you see, tennis is responsible for the entire shoot-em-up genre.</p>    <p>Tennis sims were also vitally important in the early home computer gaming boom of the 1980s. Titles such as Match Point on the ZX Spectrum and International Tennis on the Commodore 64 provided compelling and intuitive two-player experiences that didn’t require a whole team of animated players like footie sims. The accessibility of tennis as a game concept also appealed to Nintendo, with its Tennis, Mario Tennis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2007/feb/12/themostrevela\">Wii Tennis</a> (from Wii Sports) games becoming its most popular sporting titles.</p> <p>Since then, every generation of consoles has had its staple tennis titles, usually not as big and showy as the football or basketball sims, but always there in the background, perfect for when non-gamers wanted to join in the fun. Namco’s Smash Court, Codemasters’ Pete Sampras Tennis, 2K’s TopSpin and Sega’s Virtua Tennis have added interesting assets to the central concept of hitting a ball over a net, and while they have all sought to simulate a range of surfaces and competitions, it’s the idyllic vision of the Wimbledon grass court that has sold them. In tennis, you have an almost unique set of properties: wide consumer knowledge, an easy-to-understand rule-set married to deep skill mechanics and a highly constrained play space providing concentrated single-screen action.</p> <p>Would people have queued for hours outside a science research base in Upton, New York, in the autumn of 1958 to play a space blaster or kung fu fighting game? I don’t think so – it would have been unworldly and mystifying to many attenders. Look at Computer Space, the first commercially available space shooter arcade game, released in 1971 (designed by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney) – it did modestly well, but it was far from the global success that Pong achieved. The controls were too complicated, the concept too abstract. Tennis was the Trojan horse of the video game industry – it snuck video games into our homes and our amusement arcades, and by the time we realised what had happened, it was too late ever to go back.</p> <h2>What to play</h2>    <p>I was going to be predictable and recommend a tennis game here – probably a classic such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/08/virtua-tennis-4-review\">Virtua Tennis</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/apr/24/topspin-2k25-review-tennis-sim\">Top Spin 4</a> – but instead I’m going for a different sort of retro treat. <strong>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</strong> is a modern update of what many consider to be the pinnacle of the Worms series, 1999’s Worms Armageddon, a daft multiplayer turn-based battle game where you set out to destroy your enemy’s army of annelids with sheep launchers, banana bombs and … a concrete donkey.</p> <p>It’s such a ridiculous and funny game, but also requires deep tactical thinking and such a mastery of angles and trajectory it may as well be considered educational software. An update to the game also gives access to previous titles in the series for the Mega Drive and Game Boy. A boisterous bargain.</p> <p><strong>Available on: </strong>PS5, Switch, Xbox<strong><br>Estimated playtime: </strong>10 hours to 25 years</p> <h2>What to read</h2>    <ul> <li><p>The concern over <strong>rising video game prices</strong> continues. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2le0wpwe18o\">The BBC has a report</a> talking to one consumer who says: “New video games cost me a whole day’s wages.” Major titles can now cost up to £80, with increased manufacturing and development costs getting the blame – although we should perhaps also be looking at the generous pay packets <a href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-earned-260-times-more-than-the-median-worker-last-year\">some industry CEOs are able to command</a>.</p></li> <li><p>How does Metacritic actually work?

What’s the latest thinking?”</em></p> <p>As referenced in the What to Read section above, Laura Fryer, an early Xbox employee, has stated that Microsoft is preparing to kill games hardware development in favour of getting its Xbox app on to different platforms. We’ve seen this approach taking shape with the recent <strong>ROG Xbox Ally</strong> and <strong>Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</strong> announcements; Samsung is also making Xbox game streaming a part of its Smart TVs. However, Microsoft has also <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-strikes-strategic-multi-year-agreement-with-amd-powering-the-next-generation-of-xbox\">just announced</a> a multi-year partnership with chip manufacturer AMD, which it stated would include “Future Xbox consoles”. Meanwhile, Sony, which lacks the sort of ecosystems open to Microsoft thanks to Windows, has recently <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-top-of-mind-exploring-new-and-enhanced-ways-to-play/\">reiterated its commitment to dedicated games consoles</a>, which is unsurprising considering that PS5 has sold around 78m units, and rumours of a third Switch <a href=\"https://www.gamingbible.com/news/platform/nintendo/nintendo-switch-3-specs-teased-before-switch-2-558550-20250410\">are already swirling</a>. Earlier this month, Switch 2 sold over 3.5m units in its first four days on sale – a record for console hardware.</p> <p>So no, I don’t think dedicated games consoles are going anywhere soon. They’re convenient, cheaper than buying and maintaining a gaming PC and offer a more stable and reliable experience than streaming games via a set-top box. Also, after five years of increased virtualisation, where we generally don’t own the music we listen to or the movies we watch, there is a growing kickback against digital apps and streaming services – the games console is a desirable object, specifically designed for fun and rife with sentimental memories. It’s illogical really to want a big chunk of plastic and circuit boards to play games on, but when that chunk looks as cool as a <strong>Mega Drive</strong>, a <strong>Neo Geo</strong> or a <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, it becomes more than just a platform. While we still enjoy visible artefacts that express our likes and tastes, there will be consoles to put next to the TV and gaze at adoringly.</p> <p><em>If you’ve got a question for Question Block – or anything else to say about the newsletter – </em><em>email us on <a href=\"mailto:pushingbuttons@theguardian.com?utm_term=685bd6c06ea0d777c20a8a3e3f20f129&amp;utm_campaign=PushingButtons&amp;utm_source=esp&amp;utm_medium=Email&amp;CMP=pushingbuttons_email\">pushingbuttons@theguardian.com</a>.</em></p> <p><em>• In last week’s Pushing Buttons, we incorrectly said that the film Walkabout was directed by Peter Weir.

       " {'how-mortal-kombat-and-moral-panic-changed-the-gaming-world.html': '<h1>How Mortal Kombat (and moral panic) changed the gaming world</h1>\\n<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-11-03T10:00:29Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Keith Stuart &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Games</div>\\n<p>On 9 December 1993, Democratic senator Joe Lieberman sat before a <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/program/senate-committee/video-game-violence/129470\">congressional hearing on video game violence</a> and told attendees that the video game industry had crossed a line. The focus of his ire was Mortal Kombat, Midway’s bloody fighting game, recently released on the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo Entertainment System after a successful run in the arcades. “Blood splatters from the contestants’ heads,” he told the room. “The game narrator instructs the player to finish his opponent. That player may choose a method of murder ranging from ripping a heart out or pulling off the head of the opponent, with spinal cord attached.”</p> <p>Lieberman’s aim with the congressional hearing had been to force the US games industry into creating a formal ratings system, preventing minors from buying violent titles. He succeeded in that – the Entertainment Software Rating Board was established as a result of the hearing – but he also boosted a moral panic that had quietly begun with the launch of the Mortal Kombat arcade game in 1992. This then took on more urgency following the high-profile home console release on 13 September 1993 – a global simultaneous launch Midway named Mortal Monday. US news networks were <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6jdBJYR8SJk?si=GOeKKF82JYt_XPdl\">sending reporters to arcades</a>, interrogating teens as they enthusiastically dismembered each other’s fighters. Newspapers were interviewing alarmed child psychologists. The BBC responded by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SgMPr0UZObY?si=-uINyE1F_BwrHlpX\">featuring the game</a> on its late-night news magazine programme The Late Show, calling in author Will Self to play live in the studio.</p>    <p>It’s interesting now to watch those hearings and then look at the game they were describing. Released this week, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is an anthology of the first four titles in the series, in arcade and various home console forms, as well as an array of spin-offs for the Game Boy Advance and PlayStation. The original titles are almost quaint relics of 1990s teen culture. The digitised visuals, created by filming actors performing martial arts moves then converting that footage into 2D sprite animations, are charmingly jerky and low-resolution, the controversial fatalities more bloodily amusing than horrifying. Brilliantly, the Kollection comes with a Fatality Trainer allowing you to easily access and practise the viscera-splattered death moves from each title. If this mode had been available at the time, it’s probably the only thing I’d have played.</p> <p>Playing again now, the game is obviously a product of twenty-something guys brought up on 80s horror films. Midway had originally assembled a four-man team including coder Ed Boon and John Tobias to produce a combat action game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, when that deal fell through, Boon and Tobias imagined a competitor to hugely successful Capcom hit Street Fighter II, inspired by the wave of popular hyperviolent martial arts flicks such as Bloodsport and Best of the Best. Boon’s elevator pitch was “the MTV version of Street Fighter”, and the fatalities emerged throughout the development process, the team pulling in ideas from their favourite movies: RoboCop, Terminator and Enter the Dragon. Straight away, the company knew that blood and guts would mean notoriety and no one was fazed. <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/23393378/mortal-kombat-30th-anniversary-ed-boon-interview/\">Talking to Polygon in 2022</a>, Boon said, “If there was something that we would even say, ‘Is this going too far?’ our CEO was like, ‘No, go even further.’ Plus we had [Midway game designer] Eugene Jarvis as our mentor […] he had just done Narc, which was a pretty violent game in its own right. So if anything, we were encouraged to go <em>even</em> further.”</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O89KZUGXbqY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"480\" width=\"854\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O89KZUGXbqY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>In effect, the moral panic over Mortal Kombat was to the early 1990s what the video nasty controversy was to the early 1980s. It was about the fear of new entertainment technologies entering family homes unchecked and poisoning the minds of children. It also ensured the success of the series. Mortal Kombat became the biggest-selling game of the Christmas season and beyond, shifting six million copies across multiple machines. What the Kollection shows is how adaptable the games have been, taking the original arcade concept on to handheld platforms and then into the 32-bit console era where spin-offs Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and Mortal Kombat: Special Forces expanded into the action-adventure genre.</p> <p>For the industry itself, the Mortal Kombat panic simply became a new front on which to fight the console wars. Sega courted the controversy, allowing Mega Drive owners to access the full gore of the arcade version by inputting a “secret” code. By contrast, Nintendo sought to bolster its family-friendly image by removing fatalities and turning the game’s blood into grey “sweat”. Unsurprisingly, it was the Sega version that sold best.</p>    <p>There have been many media panics since this one. Doom remained a tabloid fixture for the entire 1990s, becoming <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/1999/04/23/gamers/\">inextricably linked</a> with the Columbine school shooting due to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold’s interest in the game. Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty were regular targets throughout the 2010s, and more recently Fortnite has been accused of leading a generation of schoolchildren <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63911176\">into addiction</a>. But the sight of Joe Lieberman in that wood-panelled senate room describing gruesome images from Mortal Kombat – as well as Night Trap and Lethal Enforcers – retains its unique fascination. </p> <p>This was a turning point for the games business – it was the era in which the focus shifted from children to teens, from abstract puzzlers and platformers to graphically rich shooters, bloody fighting games and adult-oriented action adventures. Midway set out to discover exactly what it could get away with. The answer shaped the entire industry.</p> <p>• Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is out now on PC, PS5, Switch and Xbox.</p>'},\n",

In 1991, less than two years after the show’s debut, Acclaim released Bart vs The Space Mutants, a side-scrolling platformer in which Bart must defeat an extraterrestrial invasion by doing frustrating pixel-perfect jumps and fighting bosses including Nelson and Sideshow Bob, while “enjoying” a scratchy sound sample of “eat my shorts” over and over again.</p> <p>Despite mediocre reviews, the game sold 1m copies, and inspired a rash of Bart-focused games such as Bart vs The World and Bart’s House of Weirdness. This interplay made perfect sense; Bart is, of course, a huge video game fan, and in the early days of the show, when he was the focal point of the writing, he represented the target demographic of the contemporary games industry: a mischievous 10-year-old boy with an interest in comical violence.</p> <p>The relationship would come to the fore in the classic 1995 Christmas episode Marge Be Not Proud in which Bart watches a TV ad for a hyper-violent hack-’em-up named Bonestorm. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/50IrgZzQ-g0?si=6yPHbka_SCklbE5T\">(The commercial</a> has a muscular Santa bursting into a family living room holding a rocket launcher and yelling: “Tell your folks, buy me Bonestorm or go to hell!”) It’s a clear parody of the frenzied, super-targeted marketing behind 1992’s Mortal Kombat, a game Bart would have relished thanks to its array of decapitations and eviscerations. At the end of the episode, Bart gets a video game for Christmas, but it’s the joyously sedate Lee Carvallo’s Putting Challenge. It’s funny, but it is also symbolic of the console war at the time: the rebellious Sega Mega Drive v the family-friendly Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>    <p>The best early Simpsons game would arrive a few months after Bart vs Space Mutants. Konami’s 1992 arcade hit, The Simpsons, is an excellent four-player brawler in which the family is pitted against Mr Burns – who has, in a daft plot that is just an excuse to visit a lot of Springfield locations and attack enemies with skateboards and vacuum cleaners – kidnapped Maggie. My favourite example from the 1990s, though, was the 1996 PC release The Simpsons Cartoon Studio, which gave players a range of locations, characters and soundbites from the show in order to create their own mini Simpsons cartoons – a little foretaste of the TikTok memes Fortnite Simpsons fans are bound to make and share.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the show itself has kept finding new ways to gently satirise video games. Springfield’s regularly featured arcade Noiseland is crammed with amusing coin-operated games from Jane Fonda’s Legwarmers of Death to the wonderful My Dinner With André from season five’s Boy-Scoutz ’n the Hood (press up on the joystick to offer “Trenchant Insight”). But games are also used as a useful pop cultural tool for poking fun at the characters themselves. The favourite game of the godly Flanders kids is Billy Graham’s Bible Blaster, an evangelical preach-’em-up that has Rod Flanders shouting, “Keep firing; convert the heathens!”</p>    <p>However, the Simpsons video game that probably best foreshadows the Fortnite tie-in is 2003’s much-loved Simpsons Hit &amp; Run, a glorious Homer-fronted pastiche of Grand Theft Auto. Here you can drive around town visiting Android’s Dungeon, Krusty Burger and the Legitimate Businessman’s Social Club, while carrying out missions to prevent another alien plot. This was, to be honest, the last great Simpsons title, and it’s interesting how a lot of <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-simpsons-crossover-game-springfield/\">the games press coverage</a> of the Fortnite tie-in is essentially: “I’d rather have Hit &amp; Run 2, but I guess this will do.”</p> <p>What the collaboration really shows is how The Simpsons has continued to survive as a cultural icon, despite its decline as a must-watch TV phenomenon. The heady combination of slapstick, parody and social commentary aligns with the scrambled self-aware narratives of video games, where crazed violence often intercuts with gooey sentimentality and knockabout laughs. Both The Simpsons and video games came of age in the early 1990s, a hyperactive postmodern theme park of an era, and they have both continued to explore and exploit the worst excesses of our consumer society. Fortnite might not be the place we wanted to find a proper modern Simpsons game, but it makes sense for it to be here – a palace of memes, soundbites and cartoonish antics that will no doubt continue to generate fun and money for many years to come.</p> <h2>What to play</h2>    <p>Despite how much I am enjoying it, I believe that <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/\">Ball x Pit</a> may be a work of great evil. A concerningly potent combination of Space Invaders, Vampire Survivors and old ball-bouncing action games such as Breakout, it is a dungeon-delving arcade game in which you fire balls at lines of descending skeleton hordes as you descend down a bottomless pit. The balls bounce off enemies, or burn them, poison them, pass through them; every wave of defeated creatures unlocks a new suite of perks and bonuses and upgrades for you to combine. Above ground, you build a base for your characters and ping them about to harvest wood and stone to build yet more. The screen is always visually cacophonous, crowded with mesmerising waves of creatures and spells and bouncing balls. Most of the time I feel as if it’s playing itself. But still: it’s just so absorbing. <em><strong>Keza MacDonald</strong></em></p> <p><strong>Available on: </strong>Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox, PC, Mac<strong><br>Estimated playtime: </strong>Possibly forever, in 15-20 minute bursts</p> <h2>What to read</h2>    <ul> <li><p>The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which represents a huge variety of gig economy workers including those on contracts at video game studios, <a href=\"https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/staff-at-rockstar-fired-en-masse/\">has accused</a> Grand Theft Auto VI producer <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> of “the most blatant and ruthless act of union-busting in the history of the games industry”.

Is it, perhaps, that coming up with interesting games that don’t involve fighting is too difficult? </em><em>Not all games are violent, but all the big-budget games seem to be.”</em></p> <p>This is a much-discussed question among game designers and thinkers. Since Space Invaders, video games have presented players with an enemy to defeat: without competition and combat and adrenaline, how do you make it fun? Some see conflict as a driving force behind most stories, an almost inevitable part of game design. Others view video game violence as a failure of imagination.</p> <p>On <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/slouching-toward-relevant-video-games\">Gamesindustry.biz</a> in 2017, the game designer Brie Code posited that most games were geared towards inducing a fight-or-flight stress response in the player, and wrote about how games might move towards a different modality: tend-and-befriend. “What is game design missing? I ask this question in terms of game mechanics and game systems. I ask in terms of adrenaline, dopamine, oxytocin, opioids, and other reward systems. I ask in terms of gameplay, that helps a wider range of people understand themselves and their responses to stress and to the world.”</p> <p>I am also reminded of a <a href=\"https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/designing-nonviolent-games-a-hopepunk-love-letter-to-your-audience\">Game Developer essay</a> by Brian Fairbanks. “Life is complicated, messy, stressful and painful. Our problems take so many forms, and our chosen entertainment takes those problems, distills them into a single entity and puts a Foe badge on them,” he wrote. “The issue here is, in nonviolent games, we don’t have access to that power in the same way. Our games are structured so that the challenge and progression does not revolve around literally destroying your problems with weapons. We have to find other ways to get there.”</p> <p>By the way, there are a great many non-violent games around. Some of them, such as Animal Crossing, certainly count as blockbusters. There’s no comprehensive database off them, but <strong><a href=\"https://thinkygames.com/search/\">ThinkyGames</a></strong> is the closest (you can filter out action, combat and timing), and there’s also an active <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/curator/35899705-Non-violent-Entertainment/\">non-violent entertainment</a> curation page on <strong>Steam</strong>.

Then a drill, built with iron mined by your own hand. Hours later, the planet is covered in neat (or not) arrays of extractors and conveyor belts, machines whirring comfortingly as they create their infinite thingummies. Corporate strip-mining simulator it may be, but it’s just so absorbing.</p> <h2>19. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/31/thank-goodness-youre-here-review\">Thank Goodness You’re Here!</a></h2> <p><strong>PS4/5, PC, Nintendo Switch</strong><br>Like much of the best British comedy, this slapstick puzzle game is topped off with just a smattering of unease. As a tiny travelling salesman, you explore a barmy Viz-flavoured northern town, solving its citizenry’s weird problems (a boy with a fear of milk, pie meat of questionable provenance, a lost screwdriver stolen by sentient rats). Unfailingly funny.</p> <h2>18. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/may/08/crow-country-review-survival-horror-game-silent-hill#:~:text=Guardian%20Pick,great%20gameplay%20and%20emotional%20impact.\">Crow Country</a></h2> <p><strong>PS4/5, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch</strong><br>A cleverly self-referential horror game about a gruesome theme park that draws on all of the genre classics of the 90s, and borrows their fuzzy polygonal aesthetic. Its twisted-fairground settings are as detailed as a doll’s house, evolving unsettlingly as the hours pass and Crow Country’s mystery unfurls – and the bold ending is worth the effort.</p>    <h2>17. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/nov/07/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-review\">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a></h2> <p><strong>Smartphones</strong><br>What first appears to be a manipulatively compelling card-collecting mobile game with a bunch of different inscrutable currencies is … well, exactly that, but with the addition of impressively well-balanced, snappy and enjoyable competitive battling. It plays fast and smart, and allows for creative deck-building and creature combinations that let each player put their own twist on their game.</p> <h2>16. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/23/fear-the-spotlight-review-cozy-game-pals-blumhouse-games\">Fear the Spotlight</a></h2> <p><strong>PS4/5, Xbox, PC</strong><br>A seance in a high-school library goes very wrong in this adventure game, a creepy, fun tribute to the best of 90s horror, both film and games. Thanks to its heartfelt, lightly metaphorical story and merciful absence of gore, this is the kind of game that even people who usually <em>hate </em>horror can enjoy.</p>    <h2>15. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/22/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review-a-miracle-of-fan-service\">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></h2> <p><strong>PS5, PC (2025)</strong><br>Using 1997’s Final Fantasy VII as a foundation, Rebirth creates a bigger, richer and, of course, much more beautiful world for Cloud Strife and his companions to roam. A maximalist miracle of fan service replete with things to do, and new, expansive detail on some of the most beloved characters and stories in gaming’s history.</p> <h2>14. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/aug/20/tactical-breach-wizards-review-best-strategy-game-since-xcom\">Tactical Breach Wizards</a></h2> <p><strong>PC</strong><br>From the title, you would expect a game about a magical special ops team blasting their way through enemy territory with spells and time-rewinding powers. You might not expect a quietly radical story with superb characterisation and the courage to question the morality of the entire military-shooter genre it borrows from – but you’ll get that, too.</p> <h2>13. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/jan/31/tekken-8-review-3d-fighter-packs-more-punch-than-ever\">Tekken 8</a></h2> <p><strong>PS5, Xbox, PC</strong><br>Just a splendid modern fighting game, polished in every aspect. New contenders join the highlights of 30 years’ worth of Tekken rosters (including martial artists, cyborgs, a demon and <em>two </em>giant bears) to smack each other about in thrillingly ostentatious bouts that can turn around at any moment.</p>    <h2>12. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/may/16/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-eerie-visuals-and-a-thrilling-story\">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a></h2> <p><strong>PS4/5, PC, Nintendo Switch</strong><br>An artist invites you to an abandoned baroque hotel where nothing is as it seems. When you get there, you can rely only on your mind to disentangle the confused timelines and bespoke puzzles that await you, finding fragments of answers in paintings, discarded documents, behind locked doors and on the other end of a ringing phone. As ambitious, compulsive and stylish as puzzle games come.</p> <h2>11. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/08/animal-well-review-billy-basso-bigmode-beautifully-wrought-indie-underground-adventure\">Animal Well</a></h2> <p><strong>PS5, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch</strong><br>The eeriness of this subterranean maze, filled with disquieting pixellated animals trying to snap you up for a snack, is offset by quiet beauty. Fronds of luminescent plants sway as you pass them; drips and creaks and distorted animal cries echo off the damp walls of intricate caverns. Exquisitely clever and atmospheric.</p> <h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/dec/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review\">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></h2> <p><strong>Xbox, PC</strong><br>The adventurous archaeologist whips around fascinating recreations of the Vatican City and the Pyramids of Giza in the 1940s, delving into ancient crypts and, naturally, punching Nazis. Anyone expecting a first-person Uncharted or Tomb Raider will be pleasantly surprised by the emphasis on puzzles, disguises and exploration over whipping out a revolver.</p> <h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/12/ufo-50-games-review-80s-spelunky-mossmouth\">UFO 50</a></h2> <p><strong>PC</strong><br>A compilation of 50 games from the long-defunct (fictional) 1980s game company, UFO Soft, encompassing a stunningly creative variety of themes and gameplay styles while remaining faithfully retro in look and feel. Almost any one of these games individually would be an indie release worth paying for. Together, they are an absurdly generous package.</p> <h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/aug/27/black-myth-wukong-review-a-fantastically-exciting-action-game\">Black Myth: Wukong</a></h2> <p><strong>PS5, PC</strong><br>It is rare to play an action game in 2024 that feels truly original. Black Myth: Wukong’s spectacular take on Journey to the West is as flashy as Devil May Cry and (almost) as rewardingly challenging as Dark Souls. A tightly curated journey through Buddhist legend and jaw-slackening scenery.</p>    <h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/14/helldivers-2-review-the-most-fun-ive-had-with-a-co-op-shooter-since-left-4-dead\">Helldivers 2</a></h2> <p><strong>PS5, PC</strong><br>This hit shooter’s premise is so simple and so well trodden: four players land on a planet full of insectoid aliens and blast it all to bits. But everything from the feel of the guns to the rhythm of each mission to the jingoistic satire is precisely engineered to entertain, and with the right friends, every session has the potential to devolve into slapstick hilarity.</p> <h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/17/neva-review-sublime-portrait-of-a-warrior-and-her-wolf-in-a-dying-world\">Neva</a></h2> <p><strong>PS4/5, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch</strong><br>A warrior and her wolf pup fight to survive and repel an incursion of oil-black demons into their natural paradise. As the seasons pass, the wolf grows, and so does the threat. One of the most extraordinary-looking games you’ll ever play, infused with deep and sincere feeling.</p> <h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/mar/20/dragons-dogma-2-review-chaotic-unpredictable-fantasy-fun\">Dragon’s Dogma 2</a></h2> <p><strong>PS5, Xbox, PC</strong><br>A highly unusual and unfailingly entertaining quasi-medieval fantasy role-playing game that has no qualms about dropping you into hot water and challenging you to figure things out for yourself. Stuck out in the woods at night after forgetting to pack your camping kit, surrounded by ghosts, you cannot fail to find your way to adventure.</p>    <h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/feb/27/balatro-mashup-solitaire-poker-has-taken-over-my-life-roguelike\">Balatro</a></h2> <p><strong>PS4/5, Xbox, PC, Nintendo Switch, smartphones</strong><br>The year’s biggest breakout indie hit, this chillwave psychedelic take on poker can make hours disappear. Create outrageous hands with decks of cards that transmogrify with each playthrough, making your score ping higher and higher (if you know what you’re doing). Wins are elusive but every attempt brings you tantalisingly closer.</p> <h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2024/oct/09/pushing-buttons-metaphor-refantazio\">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a></h2> <p><strong>PS4/5, Xbox, PC</strong><br>Extraordinary art direction, an operatic soundtrack and theatrical battles between transforming fantasy robots and grotesque Boschian human-adjacent monstrosities come together in an impassioned plea for the embrace of multicultural society and an end to divisive politics. A role-playing game as intelligent as it is grandiose, pairing philosophical postulating with intense strangeness and outrageous style.</p> <h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree\">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a></h2> <p><strong>PS4/5, Xbox, PC</strong><br>Not technically a sequel to 2022’s dark fantasy masterpiece, but it may as well be. Shadow of the Erdtree adds tens of hours, more creatively disturbing foes and yet more fascinatingly defiled locations to FromSoftware’s peerless realm. It reinvigorates an already superb game with a renewed sense of danger and possibility.</p>    <h2>1. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/sep/05/astro-bot-review-team-asobi-playstation-5-team-asobi-sony\">Astro Bot</a></h2> <p><strong>PS5</strong><br>A cute blue-and-white robot and his hundreds of little friends romp across a galaxy of fun-packed planets, aided by backpack monkeys, extendable frog boxing gloves and a rocket-powered chicken. A brisk 10-plus hours of pure, concentrated playfulness from Sony’s Team Asobi, this inventive and adorable adventure shows exactly what modern consoles’ advanced technology can add to the business of fun.</p>'}]"
