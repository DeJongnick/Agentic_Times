<p>Powerful lock Lukhan Salakaia-Loto has earned a return to the Wallabies’ squad for the two Tests in South Africa to kick off this year’s Rugby Championship, but injuries in the halves have forced coach Joe Schmidt to call on Nic White a week after his supposed retirement from international rugby.</p> <p>The Wallabies showed progress in the series against the British &amp; Irish Lions and won the third Test to prevent a whitewash, but they cannot afford to rest heading into the clashes with the top-ranked Springboks, who beat the All Blacks in the 2023 World Cup final.</p> <p>The 35-player squad is similar to the one selected for the Lions series and includes Rob Valetini, the John Eales Medal winner who missed the third Test due to a calf injury, as well as veteran No 10 James O’Connor. But there are also some new faces, including three uncapped players.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/aug/06/wallabies-can-take-heart-from-lions-series-for-litmus-tests-against-south-africa">Wallabies can take heart from Lions series for litmus Tests against South Africa | Angus Fontaine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Salakaia-Loto, who has been out of the Australian squad so far this year, wins a place after starring for the First Nations &amp; Pasifika XV against the Lions three weeks ago. He played off the bench in the last of his 41 Wallabies appearances against Ireland late last year.</p> <p>Schmidt said the group has made “some positive steps” during the start of the international season but there is work ahead.</p> <p>“It’s pleasing to be able to keep the core of the group together, while also leaning on some depth and fresh bodies,” he said. “We’re very conscious of how difficult it is going to be, playing South Africa on their home turf over two consecutive weekends.”</p> <p>Fly half Tane Edmed has been called up due to the concussion suffered by Tom Lynagh in Sydney. Lynagh himself was only thrust into the starting lineup for the Lions series following the neck injury to Noah Lolesio. Ben Donaldson has the inside running to start at No 10, having been named on the bench for all the Lions Tests, but O’Connor is well placed to don the gold again for the first time since 2022.</p> <p>Edmed made his Wallabies debut last year against Ireland but it ended three minutes after he came on due to a concussion. He has struggled to cement the No 10 at the Waratahs this year, and has signed a contract with the Brumbies to replace Lolesio, who is leaving Super Rugby to play in Japan.</p> <p>The 24-year-old said he thought he was in the mix for selection but to be named again is an honour. </p> <p>“Despite the Super [Rugby] comp probably not going the way I would have liked, I always felt like I was a chance,” he said. “Everyone potentially could get injured or stuff can happen, so you can never kind of count yourself out. I’ve been ready and I’ve stayed ready.”</p> <p>There is more uncertainty at scrumhalf due to the hamstring injury to Jake Gordon that saw him miss the third Test. It means an SOS to White, who takes his place alongside Tate McDermott and the uncapped Brumby Ryan Lonergan in the squad.</p> <p>Lonergan’s teammate in the ACT, winger Corey Toole, and new Queensland Reds recruit Aidan Ross are the other uncapped players named, although Ross played a single Test for New Zealand in 2022. He has moved from the Chiefs to the Reds this year.</p> <p>Western Force hooker Brandon Paenga-Amosa keeps his place after his belated call-up for the third Lions Test. His selection was made more likely by the retirement announcement this week of David Porecki.</p> <p>Young centre Josh Flook and hooker Josh Nasser joined their Reds teammate Salakaia-Loto as new faces in the squad, which will play the first Test against the Springboks in Johannesburg on 16 August. The second Test is a week later in Cape Town.</p> <p>Edmed, who will travel to South Africa for the first time, said the presence of strong forwards Valetini and Will Skelton in the squad gives the Wallabies confidence, but the players are well aware of the task in front of them. </p> <p>“I’m not delusional to the fact that it’s going to be a very tough couple of games and I’m sure the squad’s the same, but we’re going to prepare as best we can, and I’m sure Joe and the squad are ready for the challenge,” he said.</p> <h2>Wallabies squad</h2> <p><strong>Forwards</strong>: Angus Bell, Nick Champion De Crespigny, Langi Gleeson, Tom Hooper, Fraser McReight, Josh Nasser, Zane Nonggorr, Brandon Paenga-Amosa, Billy Pollard, Tom Robertson, Aidan Ross, Lukhan Salakaia-Loto, Will Skelton, Carlo Tizzano, Taniela Tupou, Rob Valetini, Jeremy Williams, Harry Wilson</p> <p><strong>Backs</strong>: Ben Donaldson, Tane Edmed, Josh Flook, Len Ikitau, Max Jorgensen, Andrew Kellaway, Ryan Lonergan, Tate McDermott, James O’Connor, Dylan Pietsch, Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii, Nic White, Tom Wright</p>
