<p>The former Leicester and Everton manager Willie Kirk is closing in on a return to football after holding advanced talks with the Swedish top-flight women’s team Linköping about becoming their head coach.</p> <p>Kirk, who also managed Hibernian and Bristol City before a spell as Manchester United’s assistant manager, has been out of work since he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/mar/28/leicester-sack-willie-kirk-manager-after-investigation-into-alleged-relationship-with-player">sacked by Leicester</a> in March 2024 because he had a relationship with one of the club’s players. In a May interview with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-13403643/Willie-Kirk-Leicester-manager-sacked-breaks-silence-treated-criminal-WSL.html">the Daily Mail</a>, Kirk said: “I’ve made a mistake and I’ve been punished for my mistake. I take responsibility for that.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2025/may/28/womens-transfer-window-summer-2025-nwsl-wsl-liga-f-frauen-bundesliga-premiere-ligue-serie-a-femminile">Women’s transfer window summer 2025: all deals from world’s top six leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kirk’s proposed move, which could be announced this week, was first reported by Sportbladet, which said Linköping are poised to sack their manager, Jonne Kunnas. The team are 13th, in the relegation zone, but have a strong history having won the Damallsvenskan title in 2009, 2016 and 2017.</p> <p>Kirk is a former Scottish Cup winner with Hibernian and led Everton to a Women’s FA Cup final at Wembley in 2020, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/01/everton-manchester-city-womens-fa-cup-final-match-report">his side lost against Manchester City</a> after extra time. He also oversaw Bristol City’s promotion to the top flight in 2016.</p> <p>Everton are close to signing Yuka Momiki, whose Leicester contact is expiring. The Japan forward has a medical on Monday. The 29-year-old, who has played for OL Reign in the US and for Linköping, has been with Leicester for 18 months.</p> <p>Everton have announced the signing of the Netherlands under-23 midfielder Rosa van Gool after the 21-year-old’s contract with Ajax expired.</p> <p>Wages for the Watford women’s team were not paid on time for June, the Guardian has learned, but all outstanding payments were made by Monday afternoon. Players and staff had expected to be paid on Friday but many were left waiting until Monday because of what is being put down to a banking fault.</p> <p>Some non-playing staff on the men’s side of the club were also not paid on time, although most club employees were paid on schedule. A club spokesperson said: “The club payroll was released in full on Friday but a processing error meant that not all members of staff were paid in full. This was not unique to the women’s team and everybody was paid in full by close of business on Monday. We have apologised to the small number of staff who this minor and unforeseen delay affected.”</p>
