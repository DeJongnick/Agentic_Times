<p>Good morning. The war in Gaza – which began with the horror of the Hamas slaughter and kidnapping of Israeli civilians on 7 October 2023, and has brought unimaginable death and destruction to the population of Gaza almost every day since – has entered its 21st month.</p> <p>So far every attempt to end the conflict has failed. But the the fraying patience of the US president, Donald Trump, who has promised to deliver peace to Gaza, has seen Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu dispatch a team of negotiators to Qatar for indirect talks with Hamas, with the Israeli leader expected to come under pressure on this week’s trip to Washington DC to agree to a ceasefire.</p> <p>Yet despite Trump’s desire to end the war, and Israel and Hamas making positive noises about the prospect of a ceasefire, the two sides are still far apart on a number of crucial negotiating points.</p> <p>Last night, just hours before Netanyahu told Trump at a White House dinner that he had nominated him for the Nobel peace prize, Israel laid out a plan that would force all Palestinians in Gaza into a camp on the ruins of Rafah, in a scheme <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/israeli-minister-reveals-plan-to-force-population-of-gaza-into-camp-on-ruins-of-rafah">that legal experts described as</a> “a blueprint for crimes against humanity”.</p> <p>For today’s newsletter, I talked to the Guardian’s Middle East correspondent <em><strong>Emma Graham-Harrison</strong></em> about the prospects for peace, and what is at stake for everyone involved. First, the headlines.</p> <h2>Five big stories</h2> <ol> <li><p><em><strong>Immigration</strong></em> | Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/france-uk-plan-small-boat-crossings-keir-starmer-emmanuel-macron">are expected to announce</a> plans for French police to do more to block small boats crossing the Channel at a summit in London this week, but a wider deal on returning asylum seekers is still up in the air.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Iran</strong></em> | The Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/iranian-president-says-israel-tried-to-assassinate-him">said in an interview</a> released on Monday that Israel, which last month fought a 12-day war with Iran, had attempted to assassinate him by bombarding an area in which he was holding a meeting.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Poverty</strong></em> | Children in England are living in “almost Dickensian levels of poverty” where deprivation has become normalised, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/08/children-england-living-almost-dickensian-levels-poverty">the children’s commissioner has said</a>, as she insisted the two-child benefit limit must be scrapped.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Environment</strong></em> | Millions of tonnes of treated sewage sludge is spread on farmland across the UK every year despite containing forever chemicals, microplastics and toxic waste. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/07/millions-of-tonnes-of-toxic-sewage-sludge-spread-on-uk-farmland-every-year">An investigation by the Guardian</a> and Watershed has identified England’s sludge-spreading hotspots and shown where the practice could be damaging rivers.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>US news</strong></em> | The Texas senator Ted Cruz ensured the Republican spending bill slashed funding for weather forecasting, only to then go on vacation to Greece while his state <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/07/ted-cruz-trump-weather-forecasting-cuts">was hit by deadly flooding</a> – a disaster that critics say was worsened by cuts to meteorology.</p></li> </ol> <h2>In depth: What a new ceasefire might look like – and the risks if it fails</h2>    <p>A few hours before Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump met yesterday, the latest rounds of indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Doha ended without a breakthrough. Despite this, Trump insisted at a dinner with Netanyahu last night that negotiations were “going along very well”.</p> <p>If a new ceasefire is agreed and does come into effect, it will be the third during a war that has claimed the lives of at least 57,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians.</p> <p>The first ceasefire – in November 2023 – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/04/ceasefire-war-gaza-why-it-could-happen-now-iran-israel-netanyahu">lasted just 10 days</a>. The second, in February and March this year, collapsed after Israel reneged on its promise to move to a second phase that could have seen a definitive end to the conflict.</p> <p>In the months since, a new Israeli offensive has claimed the lives of thousands more Palestinians. Extreme hunger is everywhere after an 11-week siege and ongoing tight blockade, with only minimal food and aid allowed in.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What are the terms of this new proposed ceasefire?</strong></p> <p>The details of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/indirect-talks-gaza-ceasefire-netanyahu-washington-visit-trump">this new deal</a> include the staggered release of 10 living hostages still held in Gaza by Hamas, and the return of the bodies of 18 more, in exchange for a number of Palestinians held in Israeli jails. There would also be more aid entering the area and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from some parts of the Gaza Strip.</p> <p>Like the previous ceasefires, it will last for 60 days, with Trump and regional allies guaranteeing Hamas that Israel will engage in “meaningful” talks to bring about a permanent end to the war.</p> <p>The deal would leave 22 hostages, 10 of them believed to be alive, still held in Gaza.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>How strong </strong><strong>is Netanyahu’s </strong><strong>position with Trump?</strong></p> <p>Emma Graham-Harrison said that, on paper, Donald Trump has most of the leverage, which he is using to push a reluctant Netanyahu to the negotiating table.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, the world watched as Trump publicly eviscerated Israel for breaking a tentative ceasefire with Iran. He had already forced the Israeli prime minister to turn around fighter jets on their way to Iran – a display of raw power over Israel’s leader that Emma said is “unprecedented”.</p> <p>Since Trump’s F-word outburst, the two allies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/07/netanyahu-israel-iran-gaza-white-house-analysis">have once again appeared in lockstep</a>, with the US going on to launch a bombing run in support of Israel against Iran’s nuclear programme, handing Netanyahu a huge political boost.</p> <p>Trump has also backed Netanyahu on a number of other key political issues, calling for corruption charges facing the Israeli prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/trump-calls-for-netanyahu-corruption-trial-to-be-cancelled-ntwnfb">to be dropped</a> and continuing to back his policy for distributing food to Palestinians in Gaza through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), despite hundreds of Palestinians being shot and killed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/24/at-least-40-more-palestinians-killed-seeking-aid-in-gaza-say-medics-and-officials">while trying to reach the distribution points.</a></p> <p>“Netanyahu has made sure that he appears to be taking Trump’s demands for an end to the war seriously; for example sending a team of negotiators to the ceasefire talks in Doha,” said Emma. </p> <p>At last night’s dinner, Trump was upbeat about the prospect of a ceasefire. When the US president was asked about Israel’s reported plans to force all Palestinians in Gaza into a new “humanitarian city” built on the ruins of Rafah, Trump directed Netanyahu to answer the question. In response Netanyahu said he was working with the US on finding countries that will “give Palestinians a better future”.</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Does Netanyahu really want to end the war?</strong></p> <p>While Netanyahu is aware he needs to appease Trump’s desire to present himself as a peacemaker by announcing a ceasefire, Emma said that Netanyahu’s critics say he has multiple, compelling reasons not to want a lasting end to the war.</p> <p>He is still very much beholden to far-right parties within his coalition government who are vehemently opposed to a ceasefire. National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and finance minister Bezalel Smotrich have both threatened to leave the government if Netanyahu ends the war.</p> <p>“There are very powerful voices in the Israeli government who are openly on a messianic mission to ethnically cleanse Gaza ,” said Emma.</p> <p>There is also the separate issue of that corruption trial which, even with Trump’s support, he may not be able to avoid if he loses political office.</p> <p>A third reason Netanyahu might want to keep the war going, Emma said, is that it allows him to delay any official examination of how the 7 October attacks happened on his watch. She thinks one possible option is that Netanyahu could attempt a “political fudge”, accepting a ceasefire and appearing to agree to Trump’s plan that it should lead to a permanent end to the war, while telling allies at home that Israel can return to fighting once the 10 hostages are home. </p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What about Hamas?</strong></p> <p>The hostages held by Hamas are the group’s only significant leverage in the talks, said Emma.</p> <p>Militarily, Hamas has been crippled by Israel’s relentless assault and obliteration of its senior leadership, (although Emma pointed out that Hamas is far from eliminated as a fighting force.</p> <p>“Agreeing to give up more hostages in a situation that doesn’t seem to be concretely leading to a permanent end to the war is arguably not that attractive an option for them,” says Emma. “I think their key aim now will be to end the war in a way that preserves some kind of power and influence in Gaza and trying to making sure that some elements of their organisation are still functioning.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What</strong><strong> if the talks fail?</strong></p> <p>The Israeli offensive has reduced most of Gaza to ruins since 2023, displaced almost the entire 2.3 million population, destroyed its healthcare system and killed more than 57,000 people, burying thousands of others under the rubble.</p> <p>The total siege imposed for 11 weeks after the collapse of the last ceasefire has only partly been lifted to allow a small amount of food aid and medical supplies into the territory. Aid workers are saying that fuel stocks are close to running out, which would lead to the “complete collapse” of humanitarian operations, the health system and communications.</p> <p>Amid all the discussions about the ceasefire, the voices of Palestinian people themselves have seldom been heard, so I want to end this newsletter with Lama, a 12-year Palestinian girl who was interviewed by our Gaza correspondent Malak A Tantesh <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/06/gaza-mood-ceasefire-talks">about what is really at stake</a> if peace is not achieved.</p> <p>“I was so happy during the last ceasefire. We felt a bit safe. When the war returned, I cried a lot because it meant going back to the suffering of tents, the summer heat and repeated displacement,” Lama said.</p> <p>When asked about what she was afraid of if the ceasefire talks failed, she told Malak that she was scared of being “torn apart, killed, paralysed or losing a limb”.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>If you weren’t tuned in to Australia’s extraordinary “mushroom murders” trial, in which <strong>Erin Patterson</strong> was found guilty on Monday of deliberately poisoning three relatives, Nino Bucci <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/07/erin-patterson-trial-australian-mushroom-murders-guilty-verdict-ghoulish-fascination-ntwnfb">has a startling breakdown</a> of every twist and turn in the unbelievable tale. <em><strong>Charlie Lindlar, acting deputy editor, newsletters</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Hugh Muir looks back on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/07/7-july-bombings-20th-anniversary-london">Ken Livingstone’s speech of defiance and unity</a> that followed the <strong>7/7 London terrorist attacks</strong> through the prism of our increasingly divisive politics 20 years on. <em><strong>Annie</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>One often hears that we can’t raise taxes on <strong>the super-rich</strong> or they’ll leave the UK and take their money with them … but is it really true?
