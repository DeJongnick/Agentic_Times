<p>The former Arsenal footballer Thomas Partey has been charged with five counts of rape and one count of sexual assault, the Crown Prosecution Service said.</p> <p>The allegations relate to three women who reported incidents between 2021 and 2022. Partey has been charged with two counts of rape of one woman, three counts of rape of a second woman, and one count of sexual assault of a third woman. He will appear at Westminster magistrates court on 5 August.</p> <p>Jaswant Narwal, of the CPS, said: “The Crown Prosecution Service has today authorised the prosecution of Thomas Partey for multiple counts of rape – after carefully reviewing a comprehensive file of evidence. Our prosecutors have worked closely with officers in the Metropolitan police who have carried out the investigation, to review the evidence and advise on the appropriate charges.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/04/thomas-partey-the-former-arsenal-midfielder-facing-five-charges">Thomas Partey: the former Arsenal midfielder facing five rape charges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We remind everyone that criminal proceedings are active, and the defendant has the right to a fair trial. We know there will be significant public interest in this announcement, but it is absolutely vital that there is no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.”</p> <p>Partey’s lawyer, Jenny Wiltshire, said in a statement: “Thomas Partey denies all the charges against him. He has fully cooperated with the police and CPS throughout their three-year investigation. He now welcomes the opportunity to finally clear his name. Given that there are now ongoing legal proceedings, my client is unable to comment further.”</p> <p>Partey, who lives in Hertfordshire, was charged four days after leaving Arsenal when his contract came to an end. He spent nearly five years at the club, playing 130 games and scoring nine goals.</p> <p>Born in Krobo Odumase, Ghana, in June 1993, Partey signed for Atlético Madrid in 2012 and made his debut for the club three years later after loan spells at Mallorca and Leganés. He made 188 appearances for Atlético, helping the club win the Europa League in 2018 before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/05/arsenal-make-move-to-sign-thomas-partey-from-atletico-madrid-for-51m">moving to Arsenal in October 2020</a> for £45m, his release clause, signing a four-year contract as Mikel Arteta went about constructing a squad capable of challenging for major honours.</p> <p>Partey established himself as the defensive anchor of Arteta’s midfield, featuring 33 times as they finished second to Manchester City in the Premier League in 2023. The following season he featured only 14 times because of a hamstring injury as Arsenal again finished runners-up to City and, overall, his time at the club was beset by injury issues.</p> <p>However, he largely overcame that in his final campaign at the club, featuring 52 times as Arsenal again finished second, this time to Liverpool, and reached the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup and Champions League. Partey has 53 caps for Ghana, for whom he has scored 15 goals.</p> <p>Det Supt Andy Furphy, whose team is leading the investigation for the Metropolitan police, said: “Our priority remains providing support to the women who have come forward. We would ask anyone who has been impacted by this case, or anyone who has information, to speak with our team. You can contact detectives about this investigation by emailing CITmet.police.uk.”</p> <p>Arsenal released a statement on Friday night, which read: “The player’s contract ended on 30 June. Due to ongoing legal proceedings the club is unable to comment on the case.”</p>
