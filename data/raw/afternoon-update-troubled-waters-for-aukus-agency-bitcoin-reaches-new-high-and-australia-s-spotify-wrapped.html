<p>Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update.</p> <p>The agency overseeing Australia’s almost $400bn acquisition of nuclear submarines under the Aukus pact <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/05/australian-submarine-agency-morale-crisis-asa-nuclear-submarines">has run into troubled waters</a> with a staff morale crisis and the departure of a senior leader. The Australian Submarine Agency is facing a looming external review, with the former defence secretary Dennis Richardson appointed to look into its structure and direction.</p> <p>Guardian Australia understands David Hallinan, the deputy director general responsible for policy and program implementation, quit a year into his tenure after he tried to raise concerns about the agency’s operations and was dissatisfied with the response.</p> <p>The defence minister, Richard Marles, is also understood to have raised concerns about the state of the agency with the ASA director general, Vice-Admiral Jonathan Mead.</p> <p>The findings of the annual Australian Public Service staff census, published last week, showed 70% of ASA respondents said they were significantly or slightly overworked, 42% reported being stressed often or always and 38% felt burnt out. </p> <p>A spokesperson for the ASA said the results were “common for newly established agencies”. But the Coalition and Greens were pressing the government to schedule a spillover hearing to question the agency before Christmas.</p> <h2>Top news</h2>    <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Australian debt collection giant will cease to exist</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>| </strong></em>Panthera Finance, mired in scandal since the federal court found it had unlawfully harassed Australians for money they did not owe, has been sold and its brand <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/05/panthera-debt-collection-agency-sold-end-operation">will cease to exist</a> after claims that it circumvented a blacklisting barring it from operating in Victoria.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Chris Dawson launches appeal | </strong></em>The 76-year-old convicted wife-killer is seeking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/05/chris-dawson-wife--lynette-murder-carnal-knowledge-conviction-appeal-ntwnfb">overturn his conviction</a> for sexual activity with one of his teenage students after a bid to appeal against his murder verdict failed.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Boris Johnson to cut short Australian book tour</strong></em><strong> </strong><em><strong>| </strong></em>The former UK PM was due to speak at a Saturday dinner in Melbourne after another event in Sydney to promote his political memoir, Unleashed.
