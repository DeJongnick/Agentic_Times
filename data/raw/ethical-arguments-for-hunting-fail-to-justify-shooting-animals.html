<p>This long pro-hunting piece (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/31/hunting-personal-essay">I’m a liberal who loves hunting. Allow me to change your mind, 31 August</a>) is full of the usual defences: that hunters are the ones who really care about wildlife and who protect it with their taxes and their efforts, and that hunting is a more ethical and humane means of consuming meat than store-bought factory-farmed. It conveniently overlooks the fact that hunters lobby government wildlife offices, hunters manage wildlife populations so that there is always a surplus of the kinds of animals they want to kill, and that hunters hold vast (usually right-leaning) political power in the US.</p> <p>And the fact is that hunters not only eat their “reverential” kills but also readily eat the “ethically inferior” often factory-farmed meat; the author makes brief mention of that in admitting her weakness for store-bought poultry. Frankly, hunted meat may normally be less cruel than meat produced by animal agriculture, but there is overlap in their government lobbying efforts – for example, both want wild horses <a href="https://time.com/6984002/horses-helicopters-congress-diane-lane/">removed from public lands</a> and both want hunting seasons on wild predators such as wolves and bears.<br><strong>Kim Bartlett</strong><br><em>President, Animal People Inc</em></p> <p>• If you must murder, murder softly (or so runs Jessica Reed’s defence of hunting). Forgive me for being dissatisfied with this defence. For it leaves unanswered the crucial question: why must you murder at all?<br><strong>Sasha</strong><strong> Arridge</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p>
