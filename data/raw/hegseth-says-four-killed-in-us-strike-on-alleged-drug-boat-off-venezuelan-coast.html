<p>The United States carried out a strike against an alleged drug-trafficking boat on Friday that killed four people, US defense secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a> said, a day after the Trump administration told Congress it was entering a new “non-international armed conflict” with cartels.</p> <p>The strike, which Hegseth said he directed on Donald Trump’s orders, appears to be at least the fourth in recent weeks. Hegseth gave few details about the boat or the evidence that it was carrying narcotics, other than saying the US had confirmed it was carrying drugs.</p> <p>“The strike was conducted in international waters just off the coast of Venezuela while the vessel was transporting substantial amounts of narcotics – headed to America to poison our people,” Hegseth said on X.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/trump-administration-caribbean-drug-cartels">Trump officials push claim that US in ‘armed conflict’ with drug cartels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Our intelligence, without a doubt, confirmed that this vessel was trafficking narcotics, the people onboard were narco-terrorists, and they were operating on a known narco-trafficking transit route,” Hegseth said.</p> <p>The latest attack on a boat comes as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> provided a notification on the issue to Congress in the form of a memo that attempted to legally justify the increasingly expansive use of military force against alleged Venezuelan drug boats.</p> <p>The notification was provided by senior Pentagon officials as part of an attempt to explain the Trump administration’s legal arguments for the strikes. It also included a classified briefing to members of the Senate armed services committee that took place on Wednesday.</p> <p>Hegseth’s post claimed the boat was “affiliated with Designated Terrorist Organizations”, a term the administration introduced for the first time in a confidential memo sent to Congress that attempted to legally justify the strikes. The Guardian reviewed a copy of the memo.</p> <p>Until this week, the administration has referred to Tren de Aragua and other cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, or FTO. Legal experts suggested that simply characterizing drugs cartels as an FTO did not give the administration any additional authority to use lethal force.</p> <p>White House officials have sought to justify the strikes internally and externally by claiming Trump was exercising his article II powers, which allows the president to use military force in self-defense in limited engagements.</p> <p>The self-defense argument revolves around Trump’s designation of Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization, a claim advanced by Stephen Miller, Trump’s deputy chief of staff, in order to defend the deportations of dozens of Venezuelans earlier this year under the Alien Enemies Act.</p> <p>The administration claimed that Tren de Aragua had infiltrated the regime of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro – and so the presence of the cartel’s members in the US amounted to a “predatory incursion” by a foreign nation, allowing for the deportation of any Venezuelan national.</p> <p>But the administration has yet to provide concrete evidence that Tren de Aragua has become an instrument of the Venezuelan government, and legal experts contacted for this story said the White House could only justify the strikes if it could make that showing.</p> <p>The strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug boats have largely been overseen by Miller and Tony Salisbury, his top lieutenant at the White House homeland security council (HSC), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/29/stephen-miller-venezuela-drug-boat-strike">the Guardian has previously reported</a>.</p> <p>Miller empowered the HSC earlier this year to become its own entity in Donald Trump’s second term, a notable departure from previous administrations where it was considered part of the national security council and ultimately reported to the national security adviser.</p> <p>That was the case, for instance, with the second Venezuelan boat hit with hellfire missiles on 15 September. While the White House was informed the Pentagon had identified the boat as a viable target more than four days before, many top White House officials only learned of the impending strike hours before it happened.</p> <p>The previous strikes trikes on three boats in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/caribbean">Caribbean</a> have killed 17 people and triggered widespread international outrage. Hegseth added in his social media post: “These strikes will continue until the attacks on the American people are over!!!!”</p>
