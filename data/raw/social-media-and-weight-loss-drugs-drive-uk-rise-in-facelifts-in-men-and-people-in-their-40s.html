<p>Growing numbers of men and younger people are getting facelifts, a trend driven by social media, advances in surgical techniques and the rise of weight loss drugs.</p> <p>Figures from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (<a href="https://baaps.org.uk/default.aspx">Baaps</a>) show facelifts are on the rise in the UK. In 2024 there were 1,882 procedures, up 8% from the previous year. Women accounted for the majority, with numbers rising by 7% to 1,742. But the steepest increase came from men: procedures grew by 26%, from 111 in 2023 to 140 in 2024.</p> <p>The president of Baaps, Nora Nugent, a consultant plastic surgeon, said the changes reflected growing awareness that surgery could achieve natural, durable results without the constant upkeep of fillers.</p> <p>But experts warn that having a facelift is still major surgery and carries risks, including scarring, nerve damage, infection and uneven results. Recovery typically takes weeks and facelifts will only last for five to 10 years. A full face and neck lift, including all fees, starts at about £15,000 and most patients pay between £20,000 and £40,000.</p> <p>Helena Lewis-Smith, an associate professor of psychology at the University of the West of England, said: “Appearance pressure in society has never been stronger than it is now, given the availability of weight loss drugs and the normalisation of various procedures.</p> <p>“Kris Jenner, who recently had a facelift, said: <em>‘</em>Just because you get older, it doesn’t mean you should give up on yourself.’ This reflects the idea that you cannot age and that there is now immense pressure to look eternally young, one of the reasons people undergo procedures. While women are more vulnerable to this pressure, men are also being judged by their looks, getting hair transplants and, unsurprisingly, facelifts.”</p>    <p>Lewis-Smith said much of this pressure came from social media and advertising, which had normalised cosmetic work. “Influencers often receive procedures for free and share them with vulnerable followers,” she said.</p> <p>She expressed concern that the risks of major surgery were “frequently minimised”. She said: “It is also crucial that individuals undergo psychological assessment before having plastic surgery.”</p> <p>Nugent said: “This isn’t a procedure to be done cheaply … What’s essential is choosing a qualified surgeon with proven experience, reviewing before-and-after photos, and ensuring their aesthetic matches yours.”</p> <p>She agreed that social media had played a role in normalising cosmetic procedures. “What was once seen as unusual is now considered common for both women and men,” she said.</p> <p>The rise of social media has also coincided with more patients in their 40s seeking facelifts, raising questions about whether people are feeling pressure to look younger for longer.</p> <p>Nugent said: “Facelifts in particular are becoming more popular, driven by greater awareness that surgery can provide a long-lasting, natural-looking result, without the constant upkeep required by non-surgical treatments … The old stereotype of an ‘overdone facelift’ is fading.”</p> <p>She said this was a key factor in more men considering the procedure. “No one wants to look overdone, but men are often more private about undergoing plastic surgery compared to women.”</p> <p>Modern facelifts often target the deeper structures of the face and may be combined with fat transfer, brow lifts or other procedures. “Older facelifts relied too much on pulling the skin,” Nugent said. “Now, successful facelifts are multifactorial, they depend on a combination of techniques, not just one approach.”</p> <p>Newer methods are being adopted such as the “scarless” or endoscopic facelift pioneered in the US by Dr Marc Mani, which hide incisions within the hairline. These approaches are best suited to patients with mild to moderate ageing.</p> <p>The widespread use of weight loss medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy has also contributed to rising demand. These drugs can lead to rapid fat loss, sometimes leaving the face looking gaunt, a phenomenon sometimes called “Ozempic face”.</p> <p>Nugent said: “Since 2023, about half of facelift consultations in some practices have involved patients who are on, or have recently been on, weight loss medication. This has led to a surge in both facial and body contouring surgeries.”</p>
