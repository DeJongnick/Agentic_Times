<h2>Winning tip: an away day in Scotland’s Outer Hebrides</h2> 
<p>I’d recommend visiting the Outer Hebrides island of Berneray for an experience of true remoteness. Here you can walk across the rare grassland called the machair to the white, three-mile long <a href="https://www.visitouterhebrides.co.uk/see-and-do/berneray-west-beach-and-machair-p522901">West Beach</a>, which looks out into the North Atlantic, and marvel at the immense space and colour of the sea. We stayed at a <a href="https://gatliff.org.uk/?page_id=9">Gatliff Hebridean hostel</a>, which consists of two converted crofts where for about £20 a night for a bunk you will be staying in probably one of the most peaceful locations in the world. Berneray is between North Uist and Harris.<br><strong>Nik Fernee</strong></p> 
<h2>Ancient and modern digs in the Highlands</h2> 
<p>Perched above the sea in remote Achiltibuie, the <a href="https://www.thebrochs.co.uk/">Brochs of Coigach</a> are two stunning stone dwellings that blend ancient design with modern luxury. With panoramic views of the Summer Isles, red deer grazing nearby and sea eagles overhead, it’s a true escape into the wild. Visit in autumn for fiery sunsets, crisp air and a chance to see the northern lights. The midges are gone, the beach below is perfect for evening walks and the silence is unforgettable.<br><strong>Dean</strong></p> 
<h2>Greek island without the crowds</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2023/sep/19/greece-island-astypalea-electric-vehicles-holidays">Astypalaia</a> has the same pretty, white-washed houses you see on famous Greek islands, but it’s far less busy. The main town, Chora, is beautiful, with buildings leading up a hill to an old castle. We rented a small apartment and spent our days on quiet pebble beaches that we had almost to ourselves. It’s a genuinely peaceful place where you can properly switch off from the noise of modern life. This Dodecanese island is the focus of a scheme for emission-free transport, with generous grants to replace petrol and diesel vehicles with electric ones.<br><strong>Roy</strong></p>

<h2>Under the stars of Carmarthenshire</h2> 
<p>We woke to birdsong and the sounds of a rushing brook and ate breakfast while the morning light streamed through the windows of <a href="https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/wales/pembrokeshire/lower-hill/y-caban?adults=2">Y Caban</a>, near the village of Login in Carmarthenshire. Hearing its story of being created from local forests was as fascinating as the walk through the tall woods that surround it. We watched red kites soar over the valley before stargazing under a sky free from light pollution. Such tranquility and connection with nature is hard to find in the UK these days, but the benefits are palpable – we left rested and refreshed, more so than any recent holiday.<br><strong>Hannah</strong></p> 
<h2>Magical Irish castle</h2> 
<p>We stayed at the <a href="https://irishlandmark.com/properties/annes-grove-miniature-castle/">Annes Grove Miniature Castle</a> in Castletownroche, County Cork, near to the ruined Augustinian <a href="https://visitballyhoura.com/explore/bridgetown-priory">Bridgetown Priory</a> and Blackwater Castle, in what felt like the middle of nowhere. It was magical. The Irish Landmark Trust has renovated it for people to stay in, complete with a wood-burning stove and comfy gothic bed. I found there to be nothing like having a whiskey by the fire surrounded by beautiful nature – and being able to say you spent a weekend in a castle, how cool is that! <br><strong>Lotte</strong></p> 
<h2>Delta ‘on the edge of the world’, Romania</h2> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/article/2024/jun/15/amazon-of-europe-wildlife-trip-danube-delta-romania">Danube Delta</a> in Romania feels like the edge of the world at the eastern frontier of the EU. Accessible by boat from the port of Tulcea, it is one of Europe’s largest and most vital wetland ecosystems and is full of wildlife. We stayed at the <a href="https://deltaboutique.ro/en/home/">Delta Boutique &amp; Carmen Silva Resort</a> in Crișan, an old working fishing village where tranquil evenings are broken only by the lively chorus of frogs. Guided boat safaris, including to see pelicans, can be arranged through the hotel.<br><strong>Josh</strong></p> 
<h2>‘Shrouded in fog and empty space’ in the Faroe Islands</h2> 
<p>Some years ago, having read Girl, Interrupted author Susanna Kaysen’s bleakly beautiful account of an anthropologist’s stay in the Faroe Islands (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28093.Far_Afield">Far Afield</a>), I took myself to what is now the <a href="https://hoteldjurhuus.fo/?_l=en">Hotel Djurhuus</a> on the edge of the capital, Tórshavn, to experience the archipelago for myself. Expertly guided by Tora tours, I endured a dreadful but thankfully short sea crossing to Mykines to see puffins, visited the beautiful villages of Saksun (population: eight) and Gjógv (a metropolis of 31 inhabitants) and explored Tinganes, location of the islands’ parliament. It was the most wonderful, wild and remote August week, shrouded in fog and empty space.<br><strong>Abigail</strong></p> 
<h2>Off-grid in Northumberland</h2> 
<p>Last October we had a wonderful week in the most remote part of Northumberland – the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/05/upper-coquet-valley-fight-for-electricity-photo-essay">Upper Coquet</a> valley. Our stay was an off-grid, simple bunk barn called Nightfold at the top of the valley. We spent a week living like woodland creatures in autumn – eating heartily, keeping ourselves warm (thanks to the wood-burning stove) and sleeping. In the daytime, we did long walks where we didn’t see a single other person – only sheep, deer, birds and squirrels. At night there were endless stars, the Milky Way and reading by candlelight. Bliss.<br><strong>Ben</strong></p> 
<h2>Free camping in Portugal’s mountains</h2> 
<p>The sleepy villages of continental Portugal’s highest mountain range, the Serra da Estrela, are a world away from the coastal honeypots of Lisbon and Porto. In Vila Cova à Coelheira there is a free campsite on the banks of the Alva river, reached via an old Roman bridge that you can swim under (or jump in from if you’re feeling brave). Even better, there is a bar at the river beach that serves excellent pica-pau – pork braised in wine, with onions and pickles. During my stay there I never encountered more than one or two others camping.<br><strong>David</strong></p> 
<h2>Croatia’s Mljet island is not for the jet set</h2> 
<p>Away from Dubrovnik’s cruise-ship crowds, Mljet island feels like another world: pine forests dipping into turquoise bays, an ancient monastery on a tiny islet in the middle of a saltwater lake, and hardly a sound beyond cicadas and the wind. I stayed in a simple family-run cottage just outside the national park gates, where evenings meant grilled fish on the terrace and nights under skies thick with stars. Days were spent kayaking across mirror-still water and walking through pine-scented trails where I rarely met another soul. It felt like stepping into a slower rhythm of life, a corner of Europe the 21st century has politely passed by.<br><strong>Mark Adamson</strong></p>
