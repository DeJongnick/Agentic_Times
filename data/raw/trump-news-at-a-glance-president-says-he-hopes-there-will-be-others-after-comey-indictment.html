<p>Donald Trump has denied the indictment of former FBI director James Comey is part of a campaign of retribution against his political opponents.</p> <p>The US president told reporters on Friday: “It’s about justice, it’s not about revenge.

He lied a lot,” the president claimed.</p> <p>Trump also said he hoped “there will be others” who were prosecuted.</p> <p>Comey, a former Republican appointed to lead the bureau by Barack Obama and kept on by Trump until he fired him in 2017, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/25/james-comey-fbi-director-indictment">indicted on Thursday</a> on charges related to allegedly lying to Congress five years ago during a hearing on the FBI’s investigation into Russia’s meddling in the 2016 US election.</p>  <h2>‘Dangerous abuse of power’: lawmakers sound alarm over Comey indictment</h2>  <p>The indictment is the latest sign that the president is making good on his promise “to turn our justice system into a weapon for punishing and silencing his critics”, said Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.</p> <p>Democratic senator Adam Schiff, a former federal prosecutor who played a lead role in Trump’s first impeachment, <a href="https://x.com/SenAdamSchiff/status/1971360273857425667">said on X</a> he had “never witnessed such a blatant abuse” of the justice department, calling it “little more than an arm of the president’s retribution campaign”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/james-comey-indictment-reaction"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Musk among names in latest Epstein cache released</h2>  <p>Democratic lawmakers on Friday released documents from the investigation into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a> that may show interactions between the disgraced financier and prominent conservatives including Elon Musk, Steve Bannon and Peter Thiel.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/democrats-jeffrey-epstein-documents"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Ice officer ‘relieved of duties’ after manhandling woman  </h2>  <p>A federal officer for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) has been “relieved of his duties” after a video showing him pushing a woman to the floor at an immigration court in New York City spread quickly <a href="https://x.com/propublica/status/1971387520400425057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1971387520400425057%7Ctwgr%5E6f4e5cd301f4b662af6075460e2c891e4967a603%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Flive%2F2025%2Fsep%2F26%2Fjames-comey-fbi-indictment-donald-trump-executive-orders-tariffs-us-politics-live%3Fpage%3Dwith3Ablock-68d6c3ad8f081f77e6af3de5">on social media</a>.</p> <p>Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, sent a statement to the Guardian saying<strong> </strong>the officer’s actions were “unacceptable and beneath the men and women of Ice”. “This officer is being relieved of current duties as we conduct a full investigation,” she added.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/26/ice-officer-video-relieved-of-duties"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Immigrants without criminal records now largest group in Ice detention</h2>  <p>Immigrants who have no criminal record are now the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/aug/29/trump-immigration-ice-cbp-data">largest group</a> in US immigration detention, according to data released by the government.
