<p>A military vehicle mowed down a woman in the Mozambican capital, Maputo, as protests have gripped the southern African country weeks after an election that the opposition said was rigged.</p> 
<p>Videos of the incident on Wednesday that have been widely shared on social media showed an armoured vehicle speeding down a busy street into a makeshift wooden barricade attended by protesters and then driving over the woman. </p> 
<p>She sustained head injuries but was not in danger of dying, the director of the emergency department at Maputo central hospital said on Thursday.</p>

<p>Mozambique’s armed forces said in a statement that they “accidentally ran over a citizen” and would take responsibility for her medical care at the hospital. “The [armed forces] deeply regrets what happened,” the statement said. “The incident will be rigorously investigated to ensure that this type of situation does not happen again.”</p> 
<p>Police shot and killed two protesters on Wednesday in the northern city of Nampula after a crowd that had barricaded a road and burned tyres confronted officers sent to break up the protest, an activist said.</p> 
<p>Mozambique has been gripped by weeks of protests after elections in which Daniel Chapo, the presidential candidate of the Frelimo party which has ruled the southern African country since 1975, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/24/mozambique-ruling-party-daniel-chapo-winner-presidential-election">secured 70.7% of the vote</a>, according to official results.</p> 
<p>The opposition leader Venâncio Mondlane, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/09/mozambique-ruling-party-likely-to-win-elections-despite-dissatisfied-youth">captured the imagination</a> of many young voters, was said to have won just 20.3% of the vote. He has since fled abroad and called for people to block traffic from 8am to 4pm from Tuesday to Friday.</p> 
<p>On Thursday, Mondlane’s supporters across the country continued to heed his call. On the highway leading from Maputo to South Africa’s border, women cooked pap, a staple maize porridge, plucked chickens and chopped lettuce for a salad.</p> 
<p>On the road to the capital city’s international airport there was a festive mood, with some protesters sitting on chairs around a steaming pot of pap and fish, while others chanted, sang and danced.</p> 
<p>At least 10 children have been killed by security forces since late October, according to Human Rights Watch. The Centre for Democracy and Human Rights, a local civil society group, said last week it knew of 65 people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/02/death-toll-rises-as-protesters-rage-against-mozambique-election-result">killed by police</a>.</p> 
<p>Ancha Bai, 30, an informal mobile money agent protesting in the city centre, said: “We want change in the country. We want to be free and … we no longer want to study just to stay at home with a diploma.” </p> 
<p>A philosophy graduate who did not want to be named said: “We’re fed up with this corrupt and oppressive regime. Frelimo has already stolen [the election], but enough is enough. If I have to die, I’ll die here. I’d rather die in the protests than starve at home.”</p> 
<p>On 19 October, Elvino Dias, a lawyer, and Paulo Guambe, a film-maker and opposition party Podemos official, were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/19/mozambique-opposition-figures-killed-protest-disputed-election-podemos">shot dead by unknown attackers</a>. The deaths, for which no one has yet been arrested, fit a pattern of what human rights researchers have said are targeted killings of opposition figures without anyone being brought to justice.</p> 
<p>The embassies of the US, UK, Canada, Norway and Switzerland said in a joint statement: “We strongly condemn the escalation of violence against civilians … This included an incident on 27 November in which a Mozambican security forces vehicle sped towards a group of people and brutally ran over a person.” </p>
