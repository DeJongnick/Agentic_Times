<p>The Republican vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/16/vance-2020-election-answer/">told</a> a reporter on Wednesday that there were “serious problems” in the 2020 election and suggested for the first time that the then president Donald Trump did not actually lose the race.</p> <p>“Did Donald Trump lose the election? Not by the words that I would use,” Vance said in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. “But look, I really couldn’t care less if you agree with me or disagree with me on this issue.”</p> <p>He was pressed on his<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/vance-says-trump-not-lose-2020-election-not-words-use-rcna175787"> response</a> by a reporter later in the day on another campaign stop in Wilmington, North Carolina, saying: “I think that big tech rigged the election in 2020. That’s my view. And if you disagree with me, that’s fine.”</p> <p>The response comes in the wake of a non-response earlier this month, when during an interview with the<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/11/vance-2020-election-new-york-times-interview/?itid=lk_inline_manual_14"> New York Times</a>, Vance was given five opportunities to “acknowledge that Trump did not win in 2020” and he “refused to say so”.</p> <p>Trump notably lost the 2020 election and currently faces <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/07/politics/trump-indictments-criminal-cases/">numerous charges</a> related to election interference after being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/30/trump-guilty-hush-money-trial-biden-response">found guilty</a> in May 2024 on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in a New York hush-money trial.</p> <p>The Harris campaign criticized Vance’s responses to the question about the 2020 election.</p> <p>“There we have it – JD Vance finally admitted he denies the 2020 election results,” a Harris campaign spokesperson, Matt Corridoni, said in a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/16/vance-2020-election-answer/">statement</a>. “As Governor Walz said on the debate stage weeks ago, Donald Trump selected Vance for this exact reason – he knows Vance will be a loyal soldier in Trump’s pursuit for absolute, unchecked, limitless power.”</p> <p>Previously, Vance has sidestepped answering the question directly, deflecting when pressed by the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, Tim Walz, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/walz-vance-debate-2020-election">during a debate</a> if Trump lost the 2020 election. He also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/09/jd-vance-pence-january-6-jack-smith">downplayed</a> the insurrection on 6 January, 2021.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Don’t miss important US election coverage. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-guardian-live-world-news/id409128287?mt=8">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>“Tim, I’m focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their minds in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?” Vance said.</p> <p>In September 2024, during a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/10/vance-electors-2020-election-00178266">podcast interview</a>, Vance responded to a question on what he would have done differently than the former vice-president Mike Pence in January 2021: “I would have asked the states to submit alternative slates of electors and let the country have the debate about what actually matters and what kind of an election that we had.”</p> <p>Vance was once a critic of Trump, comparing him to Hitler ahead of the 2016 presidential election. He shifted toward backing Trump’s election denial claims as he vied to be his running mate.</p> <p>Shortly before joining the Trump campaign, Vance <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jd-vance-defends-trump-claims-invoking-jean-carroll/story?id=106925954">claimed</a> in an interview with the ABC News This Week anchor George Stephanopoulos: “Mike Pence could have done more, whether you agree or disagree, Mike Pence could have done more to sort of surface some of the problems in the 2020 election.”</p> <p>Trump has claimed there will be a “bloodbath” if he does not win the 2024 election. He also claimed his supporters will not have to vote any more if he wins as Trump and his allies have laid the foundation to contest the 2024 election results.</p>
