Totally and utterly brilliant. They deserve to celebrate long into the night having secure victory in Johannesburg for the first time in the professional era. </p> <p>Where do the Boks go from here? We’ll find out next week if they’ve righted the many wrongs as the two teams once again square up in Cape Town.</p> <p>I’ll be there to call it live.

They’re swarming forward until the move is stifled by van Staden who is pinged for being off-side. All Australia now. Can they get the ball bacl down the left. They can, but the pass to Jorgensen isn’t accurate and Arendse catches it. No matter, they have the penalty which is nudged to the corner. O’Keefe gives a team warning.

Libbok and Williams were made to work swiftly thanks to aggressive Wallaby defence, but brilliant play from Etzebeth, Esterhuizen and du Toit, as well as Kolisi who has been hovering in space in the tram all game, means the Boks make metres. Things fray at the seams eventually before Libbok floats a wide pass right. Kolisi charges and feeds Esterhuisen who is isolated a metre short. Wright and Ikitau make the hit and win the ball back. There’s a penalty call – holding on I think, actually, no idea – and O’Connor can hoof it long.</p> <p>South Africa have been really good through the phases.

Penalty kick becomes a line-out which becomes a break down the line. Jorgensen, off his wing, found Kellaway in the left tram with a floater. He burst down upfield and nudged ahead for Ikitau. Arendse had to scamper across and clean up. Luckily for the Boks, the kick bobbled over the try-line so Arendse could fall on it and win back possession.
