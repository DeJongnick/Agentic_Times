<p>Morning everyone. It seems the vast cost of holding refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru – about $1.5m paid out per year to an American prisons operator for every detainee – is not enough to keep hunger at bay, with many telling us they can’t afford to eat. The ATO is pursuing a new batch of taxpayers for years-old debts. Two people have been killed in a terror attack on a synagogue in Manchester. Hamas is expected to demand key revisions to Donald Trump’s peace plan. And could Nigel Farage really become the next British prime minister?</p>
