Before Everton travel to Fulham, our Merseyside football correspondent Andy Hunter considers the Everton players out of contract at the end of the season. Our WSL expert Suzanne Wrack will be on hand to guide you through all that’s at stake in Saturday’s final round – email her your questions at <a href="maiilto:matchday.live@theguardian.com">matchday.live@theguardian.com</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport"><sub>Read more</sub></a></p> <p>11am</p> <p>County Championship live</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p>Tanya Aldred provides updates from day two of the latest round of County Championship matches. Former England batter Jason Roy is making an unexpected red-ball comeback with Surrey at Edgbaston, five years on from his last appearance. The reigning county champions, who have lost Ollie Pope, Jamie Smith and Gus Atkinson to England duties, are further boosted by the arrival of overseas pair Kurtis Patterson and Nathan Smith.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2025/may/10/warwickshire-v-surrey-nottinghamshire-v-hampshire-and-more-county-cricket-live"><sub>Read more</sub></a></p> <p>12.30pm</p> <p>Lingfield Derby trial day live</p> <p>Racing</p>  <p>Greg Wood covers all the action from Lingfield as 10-time Derby-winning trainer Aidan O’Brien runs Giselle in the Oaks Trial (1.15pm), one of his three contenders on the card for the Epsom Classics. The Ballydoyle maestro also has a strong hand in the William Hill Lingfield Derby Trial Stakes, which he has won six times, notably in 2019 with subsequent Epsom victor Anthony Van Dyck. His Stay True made a big impression when scoring first time out at Leopardstown last month but stablemate Puppet Master has the better form in the book, finishing fourth in the Royal Lodge as a juvenile and not being disgraced behind Delacroix in the Ballysax at Leopardstown on his three-year-old debut.</p> <p>12pm</p> <p>Final day live</p> <p>Women’s Super League</p>  <p>Follow the final round of the regular season, with Emillia Hawkins at the live helm and Suzanne Wrack reporting as Arsenal take on Manchester United. Having then lost their last two, Renee Slegers’ Gunners will look to cement second place at the Emirates, while Marc Skinner’s third-placed United side, who have sealed a Champions League berth and reached another FA Cup final, can leapfrog their opponents with a win. Should the champions Chelsea avoid defeat against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge the Blues would become the first side to complete a 22-match WSL campaign unbeaten. Bompastor’s Invincibles, anyone?</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/may/10/arsenal-v-man-utd-chelsea-v-liverpool-and-more-wsl-final-day-live">Read more</a></p> <p>3pm</p> <p>Live Premier League goals and more</p> <p>Saturday clockwatch</p>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/barryglendenning">Barry Glendenning</a> keeps the updates flowing as the race for the Champions League spots hots up and relegated Southampton face Manchester City. It’s been a season to forget for the relegated Saints and their record against City is hardly comforting. Southampton have won just one of their last 15 Premier League games against Pep Guardiola’s side, a 1-0 home win in July 2020. By contrast, City are on a good run, their joint-longest winning streak of the season, having won their last four. They’re looking to win back-to-back away league games for the first time since August.</p> <p>3.05pm</p> <p> Bristol v Bath</p> <p>Gallagher Premiership</p>  <p>Gerard Meagher reports as the West Country derby crosses the Severn to Cardiff where there’s plenty at stake for the old rivals at the Principality Stadium. Some 10,000 extra train seats have been made available for the English invasion of the Welsh capital. The pressure is on the Bears, who are clinging on to third place after three straight defeats, but will take comfort from their recent form against Bath, having won four of their past five Premiership meetings. Bath, though, are flying after five Premiership wins on the trot, and 10 in a row in all competitions.</p>   <h2></h2> <p>5.30pm</p> <p>Bournemouth v Aston Villa live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>The late game features another club in the top-four mix, Aston Villa. Ben Fisher reports from their clash on the south coast at Bournemouth. Scott Murray takes on the live blogging duties from 5.30pm. The Cherries are on a charge, unbeaten in their last five Premier League games. Following their 2-1 win at Arsenal last time out, Bournemouth are looking to win consecutive league games for the first time since January. And there’s nothing shabby about Villa’s form either. After a run of just six wins in 21 Premier League games between September and February, Villa have now won seven of their last nine.</p> <p>8pm</p> <p>Inside football with Jonathan Wilson</p> <p>Analysis</p>  <p>Our intrepid columnist turns his focus on Napoli’s Antonio Conte, the trophy-winning machine who has claimed league titles with three clubs across two countries and is leading the way in Serie A.</p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>Rob Smyth and Dominic Booth will pick out the best of Saturday’s action before looking ahead to Sunday’s big matches in the Premier League: Newcastle v Chelsea, Manchester United v West Ham, Nottingham Forest v Leicester, Tottenham v Crystal Palace and Liverpool v Arsenal. Checking in from Wembley is Simon Burnton where Whitstable and Whyteleafe contest the FA Vase final (12.15pm) before Spennymoor and Aldershot battle for the FA Trophy (4.15pm). Plus: Nicky Bandini roves an expert eye over the race for the Serie A title – and reflects on what was a colossal week for Inter.</p> <p>12pm</p> <p>Newcastle v Chelsea live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Fourth-placed Newcastle confront fifth-placed Chelsea. The clubs are level on 63 points and while the winners will boost their Champions League hopes significantly, the losers could be overtaken immediately by Nottingham Forest, who face relegated Leicester at 2.15pm. In these clashes, the force is with Eddie Howe whose team have won seven of their last 11 home games against Chelsea and have already beaten Chelsea 2-0 at St James’ Park this season in the EFL Cup. Daniel Harris follows the action live and Louise Taylor and Jonathan Wilson report.</p>   <p>3.15pm</p> <p>Barcelona v Real Madrid live</p> <p>El clásico</p>  <p>Arguably the standout game of the day. Daniel Harris takes liveblogging duties and who better to deliver a report from the Olympic Stadium than Sid Lowe. There’s plenty to play for in the La Liga title race. Barcelona have a four-point lead over Real Madrid at the top with four games left and a win would firm up their grip on the title. That said, Madrid will be eager to go out swinging in Carlo Ancelotti’s last <em>clásico</em>. So far it’s been a clean sweep for Hansi Flick’s side, however. Barça won 4-0 at the Bernabéu in October, then won again 5-2 in January in the Spanish Super Cup final and last month snatched <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/27/barcelona-real-madrid-copa-del-rey-match-report#:~:text=An%20epic%20Copa%20del%20Rey,Not%20quite%2C%20but%20very%20nearly.">the Copa del Rey 3-2 in extra time</a> amid chaotic scenes in Seville.</p> <p>4.30pm</p> <p>Liverpool v Arsenal live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Best not to mention PSG, but as the champions take on an Arsenal side deflated by their midweek semi-final defeat in Paris, the stakes remain high for Mikel Arteta. His side stand second and need three points from games against Liverpool, Newcastle and relegated Southampton to make absolutely sure of a return to the Champions League. Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 14 home games against Arsenal in all competitions, since a 2-0 loss in the Premier League in September 2012. Dominic Booth provides minute-by-minute coverage.
