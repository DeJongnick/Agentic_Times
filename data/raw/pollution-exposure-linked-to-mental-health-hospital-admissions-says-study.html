<p>Exposure to air pollution is linked to an increased risk of hospital admission for mental illness, according to the most comprehensive study of its kind.</p> <p>The research, involving more than 200,000 people in Scotland, found an increase in exposure to nitrogen dioxide in particular was associated with a higher number of people being admitted to hospital for behaviour disorders and mental illnesses.</p> <p>Previously published research on the health effects of long-term exposure to ambient air pollution has tended to emphasise deaths rather than hospital admissions, and physical, rather than mental, ill health, the researchers said.</p> <p><a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/14/12/e084032">The study</a> found that air pollution was linked to increased risks of hospital admission for mental health, as well as physical illness.</p> <p>Stricter environmental restrictions would benefit millions of people and curb the impact on secondary care, the researchers said.</p> <p>Dr Mary Abed Al Ahad of the University of St Andrews, who led the study, said policies to tackle air pollution and a shift to renewable energy could help ease the burden on hospitals of people with both physical and mental illnesses in the long term.</p> <p>“Policies and interventions targeting air pollution emissions such as zero-emission zones or incentives for renewable energy in transportation and energy production sectors could help ease the hospital-care burden in the long term both locally and globally.”</p> <p>The analysis of data tracked from Public Health Scotland examined four key pollutants between 2002 and 2017 and the impact of ambient air pollution.</p> <p>Researchers drew on individual level data from the Scottish Longitudinal Study, which represents 5% of the Scottish population and includes demographic information from linked censuses.</p> <p>In all, 202,237 people aged 17 and above were included in the research, which was <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136//bmjopen-2024-084032">published in the open access journal BMJ Open</a>.</p> <p>Their health and hospital admissions for cardiovascular, respiratory, infectious diseases, mental illnesses or behaviour disorders were tracked from Public Health Scotland data.</p> <p>They were linked to levels of four pollutants from road traffic and industry: nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>); sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>); particulate matter diameter of at least 10μm (PM10); and small particulate matter of 2.5μm or less (PM2.5) per 1km<sup>2</sup> in each person’s residential postcode.</p> <p>Average cumulative exposure to air pollution was strongly associated with higher rates of hospital admissions, both for mental and physical illnesses. Higher cumulative exposure to NO<sub>2</sub>, PM10, and PM2.5 was associated with a higher incidence of hospital admissions for all causes.</p> <p>Ioannis Bakolis, a professor of public mental health and statistics at King’s College London who was not involved with the study, said the “large-scale” data was “appropriately analysed” and provided further evidence on the link between air pollution and mental health.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/20/growing-up-in-air-polluted-areas-linked-to-mental-health-issues">Research has previously shown</a> how people who spend their childhood in areas with high levels of air pollution may be more likely to later develop mental disorders.</p> <p>But a study by researchers in the US and Denmark has suggested a link between air pollution and an increased risk of mental health problems, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and personality disorders.</p> <p>Between 1% and 2% of the UK population have bipolar disorder in their lifetime, with similar figures for schizophrenia. It is estimated that <a href="https://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mental-health/problems-disorders/personality-disorder">about 5% of people in the UK</a> have a personality disorder at any one time.</p>
