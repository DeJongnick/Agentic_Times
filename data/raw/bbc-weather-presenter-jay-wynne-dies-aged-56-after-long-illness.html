Rest in peace mate.”</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/SimonOKing/status/1966492477247918083">Simon King</a>, who is also a BBC weather presenter and meteorologist, said: “Really sad news about former colleague Jay Wynne. Such a lovely bloke and brilliant broadcaster. Always a joy to be on shift with him and his wicked sense of humour. Good memories. RIP Jay.”</p> <p>The <a href="https://x.com/JenBartram/status/1966501258560176138">presenter Jen Bartram posted</a>: “Jay was such a lovely colleague and friend – we had such laughs at the weather centre in the good old days; and I’m shocked to hear of his death today.”</p> <p>Wynne’s brother Matthew said: “Jay had a gift for gentle clarity, making his forecasts for sometimes complex weather systems feel accessible and engaging.</p> <p>“A keen skier, golfer and musician, Jay enjoyed travelling to pursue his sporting interests. We will miss his wisdom, generosity and dry sense of humour.”</p> <p>Wynne studied environmental geography at the University of Aberdeen and went on to complete a master’s in applied meteorology at the University of Reading.</p> <p>When he joined the Met Office his training involved a 14-month secondment to RAF Northolt. Before forecasting he spent time as a technician on North Sea oil rigs and a stint teaching English in Fukuoka, Japan.</p> <p>In an interview with the Radio Times in 2011, he said: “I have been known to drive around after night shifts, waiting for the sun to come up.</p> <p>“At night, it’s difficult to tell what kind of cloud there is on satellite pictures, so I like to see if I was right. More often than not, I am.”</p>
