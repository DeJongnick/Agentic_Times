  <p><strong>Gold has hit a new record high of $2,954 per ounce, as investors flock to safe-haven assets as geopolitical tensions rise.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>From gold to Goldfinger…. James Bond is now in the hands of a billionaire’s business empire.</strong></p> 
  <p>Amazon has struck a deal with Michael G Wilson, and Barbara Broccoli, the heirs to the legendary film producer Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, to take creative control of the spy franchise.</p> 
  <p>The agreement will give Amazon “creative control” of the franchise, potentially opening the door to production starting on a long-awaited new film and also to a variety of spin-off TV shows for the Amazon Prime streaming service.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Amazon takes creative control of James Bond</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Big news in the movie world: Amazon has just announced it is taking creative control of the James Bond franchise.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Amazon</strong> has formed a new joint venture with <strong>Barbara</strong> <strong>Broccoli</strong> and <strong>Michael</strong> <strong>G</strong> <strong>Wilson</strong>, whose <strong>Eon</strong> production company have produced the Bond films.</p> 
  <p>This new venture will house the James Bond intellectual property rights, and remain co-owners of the franchise, but <strong>Amazon</strong> <strong>MGM</strong> <strong>Studios</strong> – formed when Amazon bought Bond’s parent studio in 2022 – will gain creative control.</p> 
  <p>This could potentially end the ongoing saga over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/oct/08/bonds-audience-will-be-patient-amazon-mgm-studios-boss-on-the-hunt-for-a-new-007">who will replace Daniel Craig</a> as the next James Bond and when the next film will be announced. Craig’s successor has yet to be announced, more than three years on from his final appearance as 007.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mike Hopkins</strong>, head of Prime Video and <strong>Amazon</strong> <strong>MGM</strong> <strong>Studios</strong>, says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“We are grateful to the late Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman for bringing James Bond to movie theatres around the world, and to Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for their unyielding dedication and their role in continuing the legacy of the franchise that is cherished by legions of fans worldwide.</p> 
   <p>We are honoured to continue this treasured heritage, and look forward to ushering in the next phase of the legendary 007 for audiences around the world.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The new joint venture comes after a Dubai-based property developer filed claims in the UK and Europe challenging the James Bond franchise.</p> 
  <p>As my colleague Mark Sweney<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/14/james-bond-in-battle-to-keep-hold-of-007-super-spys-name"> reported last week</a>, Austrian businessman Josef <strong>Kleindienst</strong> has filed a slew of “cancellation actions based on non-use” targeting the James Bond name.</p>

  <p><strong>Barbara</strong> <strong>Broccoli</strong>, whose father <strong>Albert</strong> produced many of the Bond films, says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“My life has been dedicated to maintaining and building upon the extraordinary legacy that was handed to Michael and me by our father, producer Cubby Broccoli.</p> 
   <p>I have had the honour of working closely with four of the tremendously talented actors who have played 007 and thousands of wonderful artists within the industry. With the conclusion of <em>No Time to Die</em> and Michael retiring from the films, I feel it is time to focus on my other projects.”</p>

  <p>The Bond films were launched by Broccoli in 1962, before his daughter, Barbara, and stepson Michael Wilson, took over.</p>

  <p><strong>Analysts are attributing today’s rise in the gold price to the deterioration in relations between the US and Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Daniela Sabin Hathorn</strong>, senior market analyst at <strong>Capital.com, </strong>explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Recent developments have contributed to a cautious return of risk appetite in global markets. Early attempts at peace talks in Eastern Europe have rekindled optimism, with the United States playing a crucial role in fast-tracking negotiations to resolve the prolonged conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Initial concerns that the US might exclude Europe and Ukraine from discussions were allayed after a meeting in Riyadh, where it was confirmed that European participation would be integrated at a later stage.</p> 
   <p>Despite these positive signals, gold’s upward trend was briefly interrupted last week as broader market sentiment improved. However, ongoing uncertainty—exacerbated by unpredictable political figures and intermittent trade policy announcements—continues to bolster demand for safe-haven assets.</p> 
   <p>For instance, recent tariff announcements by Donald Trump, including a 25% tariff on auto imports and similar measures on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, have added to the market’s cautious tone.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>And here’s <strong>David Morrison, </strong>senior market analyst at <strong><a href="https://www.tradenation.com/">Trade Nation</a></strong>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Gold<strong> </strong>rallied again overnight, pushing to a fresh record high and trading above $2,950 for the first time ever. It continues to trade in ‘overbought’ territory as measured by the daily MACD [<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways-,Moving%20average%20convergence%2Fdivergence%20(MACD)%20is%20a%20technical%20indicator,from%20the%2012%2Dperiod%20EMA.">a technical indicator</a>] </p> 
   <p>But investors seem to be relatively unfazed by this, as the rally since the end of December has been steady and measured. In fact, this is the definition of a ‘stealth rally’, one which has brought a succession of record highs, yet has been largely ignored by investors. Perhaps the reason for this is that gold’s rally has been largely technical. Non-OECD central banks have been adding to their holdings for a while now, but this isn’t much of a story. Now, there’s the uncertainty surrounding the actions of the Trump administration, with the possibility that tariffs, deregulation and tax cuts add to inflationary pressures. Couple that with Trump’s hostile attitude to President Zelensky of Ukraine, and his cosying up to Russian President Putin, and suddenly gold looks attractive as a potential ‘safe haven’ away from ‘overvalued’ US equities. </p>

  <p><strong>The gold price has hit a new all time high today, putting the $3,000 per ounce level within sight.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Susannah Streeter,</strong> head of money and markets at <strong>Hargreaves Lansdown,</strong> says gold is benefitting from being a safe haven as traders mull the inflationary risks of US tariffs and geo-political risks.</p> 
  <p><strong>Streeter </strong>adds:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The precious metal is riding high at record levels amid concerns about Trump’s trade and foreign policy stances. Tensions remain high around talks over Ukraine after the US President referred to President Zelensky as a dictator. The US message that Europe should do more itself to counter military threats, is adding to concerns about a fracturing of solid defence relations.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Geopolitical tensions have also pushed up demand for gold.</p> 
  <p><strong>Inki Cho, </strong>financial markets strategist consultant to<strong> Exness, </strong>says President Donald Trump’s recent announcement of a new 25% tariff on key imports, including cars, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, sparked a “risk-off” dash into safer assets, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>On the geopolitical front, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine adds another layer of complexity. The US started negotiations with Russia, raising hopes for a resolution. Steady progress in negotiations could strengthen risk appetite, putting pressure on gold. Conversely, any setbacks may reinforce gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset.</p>

  <p><strong>Jim Reid</strong>, strategist at <strong>Deutsche</strong> <strong>Bank</strong>, says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That followed a social media post from President Trump that was highly critical of Ukrainian President Zelenskiy, referring to him as “a dictator without elections”.</p> 
   <p>This followed President Zelenskyy’s comments earlier in the day that US proposals on Ukrainian minerals were “not a serious conversation”. So that backdrop led to a renewed underperformance for regional assets, including Ukraine dollar bonds and CEE currencies.</p>

   <p>“Lloyds has capped off a strong year with a clouded fourth-quarter result, setting aside a hefty £700m provision for potential charges related to the ongoing motor finance saga.

Despite this, the stock is up over 40% in the past year, reflecting a solid banking outlook and robust performance.</p> 
   <p>Beneath the surface, Lloyds is delivering strong results. Excluding the motor finance charge, fourth-quarter figures exceeded expectations, thanks to borrowers performing better than anticipated.

 <h2 class="block-title">UK consumer confidence sinks to new low</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets, and the world economy.</strong></p> 
  <p>Confidence among UK consumers has dropped off a cliff since last summer, as people – particularly women – grow more worried about the state of the economy, and their own finances.</p> 
  <p>A new survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and Opinium has found that the public’s expectations for the economy worsened for a fifth month running in February,</p> 
  <p>Households are also gloomier about their own personal finances, as they anticipate further price rises in the shops – as retailers pass on higher taxes.</p> 
  <p>February’s drop in confidence continues a decline that started last July, when the Labour party won the general election – and swiftly began warning about ‘tough choices’ and ‘painful decisions’ to fix the country’s finances.</p> 
  <p>Last October’s budget, with its increase in the national insurance contributions (NICs) paid by businesses, appears to have also hit confidence.</p> 
  <p><strong>Helen Dickinson, </strong>chief executive of the <strong>British</strong> <strong>Retail</strong> <strong>Consortium</strong>, explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>People’s expectations of the economy reached a new low, having fallen almost 40pts since July 2024.</p> 
   <p>Even Gen Z (18-27), the most upbeat generation on the economy and their own finances, saw a drop off in optimism. There was also a widening gender divide in confidence this month, with women more pessimistic than men about both the economy and their own finances by 13 and 17pts respectively.</p> 
   <p>With many businesses warning of the impact that April’s employer NIC’s increase will have on hiring, and the rising energy price cap pushing up the cost of domestic bills, it is little surprise that many households are worried. And while there was a positive increase in expectations of personal retail spending, this may be largely driven by the expectations of higher prices in the future.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Here’s the details of the survey:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The state of the economy</strong> worsened to -37 in February, down from -34 in January. This is the fifth consecutive month in which expectations have worsened.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Their personal financial situation</strong> dropped to -11 in February, down from -4 in January.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Their personal spending on retail</strong> rose to -5 in February, up from -9 in January.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Their personal spending overall</strong> remained at +4 in February, the same as in January.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Their personal saving</strong> remained at -3 in February, the same as in January.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Dickinson </strong>suggests consumers are correct to anticipate higher prices:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Expectations of higher prices are not unfounded, with two-thirds of retailers saying prices will have to rise as a result of the £7bn in additional costs, including higher employer NICs and a new packaging levy. Almost half of retailers also warned of hiring freezes, with entry-level jobs often among the first to go as they seek any cost efficiencies to help them protect customers from the worst of the rising costs.</p> 
   <p>As the Government bill on the future of business rates progresses through Parliament, it is essential that no shop ends up paying more in rates as a result of these reforms, otherwise retailers will face a triple whammy of Budget costs, business rates rises, and new packaging and recycling levies, all of which will filter through to consumer prices.</p>
