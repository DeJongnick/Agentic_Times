This amounted to “misinformation,” they said. <br><br>However, they suggested it was natural for regulators to be poking around the private credit industry - now worth nearly $3tn globally - but that regulators were unlikely to find any problems.<br><br>It comes as the Bank of England confirmed last week that it was preparing to run stress tests to check on potential systemic risks, particularly as a result of interconnectivity with the banking industry, which often provides loans to private credit firms that issue loans directly to businesses. <br><br><strong>Daniel Leiter</strong>, senior managing director at <strong>Blackstone</strong> and head of international and global head of liquid credit strategies at Blackstone Credit and Insurance said: <br></p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think they will come to the conclusion that what is happening in private credit, is fundamentally safer to happen in private credit, rather than on banks balance sheets.</p> </blockquote> <p>He claimed that this was partly because private credit was funded through institutional investors like pension funds and insurers - rather than being backed by consumer deposits - which could lock in their money for longer, and that the private credit industry maintained close relationships with businesses they lend to, following rigorous due diligence.<br><br>He also argued that if borrowers went bust, the private credit firm would take the loss, and it would not result in contagion to other funds in the firm let alone the wider financial system. Furthermore, banks borrowed much more per pound, in order to issue loans, than private credit firms, he said. </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The regulators will do this work, and will come to the conclusion that the system is going to be more stable whenever we do go through economics hocks, because now, away from just relying on the banking system, private credit can provide a source of financing through difficult times.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leiter said this justified what many claim is a lack of close supervision by regulators: “it should be regulated differently.” <br><br>It comes a week after Bank of England’s governor, <strong>Andrew Bailey</strong>, said the recent failures of Tricolour and First Brands had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/21/bank-of-england-chief-warns-worrying-echoes-2008-financial-crisis-tricolor-first-brands">worrying echoes of the sub-prime mortgage crisis</a> that kicked off the global financial crash of 2008. <br><br>Meanwhile, the IMF warned that a downturn could have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/14/us-shares-correction-markets-imf-bonds">ripple effects across the financial system</a>, given that banks were increasingly exposed to a largely unregulated private credit industry. There are concerns that a downturn could destabilise traditional banks that issue loans to the shadow banking sector.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690229f28f082aa93a7eb5e7" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T14:58:37.106Z">2.58pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Bank of Canada</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates by a quarter point to 2.25%, as expected.</p> <p>This has taken the policy rate to the bottom of its 2.25% to 3.25% neutral range estimate. The move had been close to 90% priced in by financial markets.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Brown</strong>, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>With the Bank of Canada’s decision to cut today widely anticipated, the key development was that it signalled that it now thinks the policy rate is “at about the right level to keep inflation close to 2% while helping the economy through this period of structural adjustment”. That is a sure sign that it is likely to keep interest rates unchanged in December, as we anticipate, although we still think the Bank will eventually be forced to cut interest rates by another 50bp next year…</p> <p>We’ve always assumed that the bar to additional cuts would be higher once the policy rate reached the bottom of the Bank’s neutral range estimate, however, with those cuts unlikely to come until the middle of 2026. While the Bank is still concerned that cutting interest rates too far in the face of a structural shock to supply would risk pushing up inflation, we judge that the much bigger shock from changes to US tariff policy have been to demand. </p> </blockquote> <p>The Bank of Canada said on X:</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/bankofcanada/status/1983541943830233433">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📣 Our Monetary Policy Report is out! <br><br>Explore key <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/economy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#economy</a> and inflation trends in our quick video.<br><br>🔗 Check out the full report: <a href="https://t.co/TlF7NSqzsy">https://t.co/TlF7NSqzsy</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnecon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cdnecon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EconomicTrends?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EconomicTrends</a> <a href="https://t.co/dkfsLJmhbD">pic.twitter.com/dkfsLJmhbD</a></p>&mdash; Bank of Canada (@bankofcanada) <a href="https://twitter.com/bankofcanada/status/1983541943830233433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2025</a></blockquote>   </figure> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6902200a8f082aa93a7eb55d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T14:20:00.070Z">2.20pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Wall Street indices hit record highs as Nvidia tops $5tn valuation</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Wall Street’s main indices hit new record highs, as Nvidia become the first company ever to surpass a $5tn stock market valuation.</p> <p>This comes amid a wave of big tech earnings reports, and as investors are waiting for the US Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision later today – it is widely expected to cut rates by a quarter point to 4%.</p> <p><strong>Art Hogan</strong>, chief market strategist at B.Riley Wealth Management, told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>While the $5tn milestone seems unfathomable in a historic context, it comes in the wake of a company that has managed to outperform on all metrics.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nvidia shares rose as much as 5% and are now up 4.5%, boosted by chief executive <strong>Jensen Huang</strong>’s spree of deals, $500bn in AI chip orders, and plans to build seven supercomputers for the US government.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 tech index gained 1.4% while the wider S&amp;P 500 rose by 0.3%, the Nasdaq added 0.7% and the Dow Jones was up 0.6%.
