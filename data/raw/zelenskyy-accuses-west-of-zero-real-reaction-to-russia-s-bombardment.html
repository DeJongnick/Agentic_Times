<p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused the west of “zero real reaction” to Russia’s escalating bombing campaign against Ukraine, after a massive attack on Sunday killed six people and injured 18.</p> 
<p>The western city of Lviv, normally considered one of the safest in the country, suffered its most sustained and serious bombardment since the start of Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion.</p> 
<p>For five hours, Russian Shahed drones and missiles targeted the city, which is about 70km from the Polish border. Large explosions were audible from the centre, a Unesco world heritage site.</p> 
<p>Victims included a 15-year-old girl, who died with three members of her family when their house was flattened in the village of Lapaivka in the Lviv region. Eight others were hurt in the same strike. One person died in the city of Zaporizhzhia when drones struck an apartment block.</p> 
<p>In a <a href="https://web.telegram.org/k/#@V_Zelenskiy_official">video address</a>, Zelenskyy said Russia had refused all offers to stop its all-out war. It was deliberately trying to destroy civilian infrastructure – in particular Ukraine’s gas and energy system – ahead of winter, he said.</p> 
<p>He added: “There is no worthy, strong reaction from the world to everything that is happening. To the constant increase in the scale and audacity of the strikes. That is why Putin is doing this: he is simply laughing at the west, at its silence and lack of strong action in response.”</p> 
<p>Ukraine’s president promised his country would respond “so Russia feels the answers”. He said the weapons used in Sunday’s attack – about 500 drones and more than 50 missiles – included components from western countries, including the US and UK. Stronger export controls were needed, he said.</p>

<p>Poland’s air force said it scrambled jets and took preventive action on Sunday to secure its airspace, after an incursion last month by Russian decoy drones. There were numerous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2025/oct/05/a-collective-anxiety-attack-the-psychology-of-unexplained-drone-sightings-across-europe">drone sightings last week in EU countries</a> including Germany and Denmark.</p> 
<p>Part of Lviv was left without electricity, according to the mayor, Andriy Sadovyi. Large fires broke out in several locations, including a civilian industrial park in the south of the city, he reported. A <a href="https://x.com/AndriySadovyi/status/1974778369624658282">school, kindergarten and church</a> were also damaged.</p> 
<p>As the acrid smell of smoke and fumes engulfed Lviv, the regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, urged residents to close their windows and avoid going out or to use gas masks or respirators.</p> 
<p>On Sunday morning, ash was still falling on the streets of Lviv, as exhausted residents ventured out and attended church services. The twisted metal remains of a Russian drone lay on a pavement outside a block of flats, cordoned off with red tape.</p> 
<p>Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskyy said Russia had carried out a combined attack featuring cruse missiles, Iranian-designed Shaheds and Kinzhal ballistic missiles.</p> 
<p>Numerous regions were hit, including Ivano-Frankivsk, in the west of the country, as well as Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, Kherson, Sumy, Kharkiv and Chernihiv. Zelenskyy called on Ukraine’s allies to help boost air defences and to impose a no-fly zone – something they have so far been reluctant to do.</p> 
<p>The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas <a href="https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2025/10/05/8001303/">said Moscow was waging terror attacks on Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure</a> to mask its “failed summer offensive”. She said it would not stop “until it was forced to”, adding that the EU would support Kyiv for as long as it took.</p> 
<p>In recent days, Russia has targeted Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, causing power blackouts in several areas, a tactic it has repeated in the run-up to winter for the past three years. Ukraine, meanwhile, continues to hit oil production facilities deep inside Russia with its own long-range drones.</p> 
<p>Lviv was partway through the annual <a href="https://www.hayfestival.com/lviv-bookforum">Lviv BookForum</a>, with writers and audiences gathered in the city for one of the largest book festivals in eastern Europe.</p> 
<p>Alongside Ukrainian writers, including poets Artur Dron and Julia Musakovska, there were international speakers including the British Forward prizewinning poet Fiona Benson, and, joining by video link, the Booker prize-winner Bernardine Evaristo, and the Nobel laureate Olga Tokarczuk.</p>
