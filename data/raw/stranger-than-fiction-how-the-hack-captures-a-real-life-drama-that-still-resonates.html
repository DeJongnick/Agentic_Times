<p>For fans of knotty, ripped-from-the-headlines dramas, British TV remains hard to beat, and the new Stan original series <a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/the-hack?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=the-hack" rel="nofollow">The Hack</a> is a worthy addition to the lineage. <br><br>Co-written by the BAFTA winner Jack Thorne, fresh off his 2025 water-cooler hit Adolescence, the seven-part series unpacks the labyrinthine phone hacking scandal at the UK tabloid News of the World, exposed by the Guardian’s reporting in 2009 and 2011.</p> <p>The Hack weaves together two parallel narratives based on true stories, unfolding between 2002 and 2012. One follows the Guardian journalists Nick Davies (David Tennant) and Amelia Hill (Cara Theobold), backed by the newspaper’s editor-in-chief, Alan Rusbridger (Toby Jones), as they investigate allegations of illegal practices at the News of the World, owned by News Corporation. The other centres on Metropolitan Police Detective Chief Superintendent David Cook (Robert Carlyle), whose pursuit of the still-unsolved 1987 murder of a private investigator, Daniel Morgan, reveals deep-seated institutional corruption.</p> <p>Even for seasoned news junkies, the resulting scandal is a tangled web. The Guardian’s reporting exposed widespread phone hacking carried out by News of the World journalists, who targeted celebrities (including Sienna Miller, whose wrenching story is portrayed in the series), politicians, members of the British royal family and ordinary citizens such as the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Meanwhile, Cook’s inquiry into Morgan’s murder ultimately made him a target of harassment by News of the World operatives working to undermine the police investigation.</p> <p>A story this intricate demands a sharp creative engine. Co-writing with Annalisa Dinnella (Call the Midwife, Sex Education), Thorne found an ideal collaborator in the director Lewis Arnold, who guided Tennant to an International Emmy for the 2020 British TV mini-series Des.</p> <p>“Sometimes directors simply serve the script, but Lewis served the story,” Thorne says in a Stan Q&amp;A. He also praises Jones’s “brilliant” portrayal of Rusbridger, and adds: “It’s a joy to have Robert Carlyle and David Tennant together – two great Scottish actors who studied at the same drama school but forged separate careers until now.”</p> <p>The Guardian’s phone hacking investigation exposed “laziness” as much as conspiracy and corruption, Thorne says. “We trick ourselves into believing there is this dark cabal that exists behind it,” he says. “And actually it’s a load of shadows that don’t want to challenge each other.”</p> <p>Thorne says he’s “obsessed with challenging the rhythm of television”, as demonstrated by Adolescence’s single-take claustrophobia. The Hack presented the challenge of weaving two separate narratives into one coherent story, pushing him to twist them together within each episode in a way that’s initially jarring but ultimately clicks. “I think audiences are hungry for change,” he says.</p> <p>Because of the complexity of the real events, Thorne calls The Hack “the most terrifying thing I’ve ever done” – a challenge that demanded a shared authorial effort from the entire creative team to balance character-driven storytelling with hard facts. As much as it’s a gripping, bingeable drama, Thorne sees the series as both a “celebration and condemnation” of journalism. “It’s about the shadow of what this moment did to the one we now live in,” he says.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzpAdd2hE-s"                                                                        > <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YzpAdd2hE-s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/the-hack?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=the-hack" title="https://www.stan.com.au/watch/the-hack?utm_source=the-guardian&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=the-hack" rel="nofollow">Watch The Hack exclusively on Stan now.</a></strong></em></p>
