<p>This live-action adaptation of Bambi, a Life in the Woods, the original novel by Felix Salten, is not in the mould of Disney’s heavily augmented and even nightmarish CGI “live action”, but more like a nature documentary with a voiceover. It’s not dissimilar to those sentimental anthropomorphic shows that add narrative to footage of deer and rabbits. The story begins moments after Bambi’s birth, and he is adorable – all knock-kneed charm and massive eyes. </p> <p>The production wisely eschews the intricacies of dialogue, so the players express themselves much as silent actors. They get particular mileage out of a very knowing crow: its limited appearances recall the scene-stealing performances of a Judi Dench or Maggie Smith. A rabbit seems a little at sea in a key secondary role that requires more chemistry. Thumper’s shadow from the 1942 Disney cartoon is long. I suspect this rabbit was cast for looks, not acting chops.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_So6329FgC0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_So6329FgC0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The target audience is no doubt younger children, but drug-addled students might like to add this one to the roster – it is extremely mellow. Apart, of course, from the Great Tragedy, which lands with bleak emotional punch worthy of Werner Herzog, as the narrator intones: “Sadness is a deep coldness on the inside, and he doesn’t know yet that it will last for ever.” Yikes.</p> <p>Perhaps this film is the movie equivalent of the beautiful wooden toys kids reject in favour of something loud and luminous. But for parents who can’t face another lurid cartoon, this is the (mostly) chilled-out alternative.</p> <p>• Bambi: A Tale of Life in the Woods is in UK and Irish cinemas from 15 August.</p>
