<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">Chinese</a> government-linked hackers are believed to have targeted phones used by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> and his running mate, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jd-vance">JD Vance</a>, as part of a larger breach of US telecommunications networks, according to a New York Times report.</p> <p>The Trump campaign was informed this week that the phone numbers of the Republican presidential and vice-presidential nominee were among those targeted during a breach of the Verizon network, the paper said, citing sources.</p> <p>Investigators are working to determine what data, if any, was accessed by the “sophisticated” hack, the sources said. Other current and former government officials were also targeted, according to the report.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/25/elon-musk-has-been-in-regular-contact-with-putin-for-two-years-say-reports">Elon Musk has been in regular contact with Putin for two years, says report</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/joint-statement-fbi-and-cisa-prc-activity-targeting-telecommunications">confirmed</a> an investigation was under way into the “unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China”. It did not name the Trump campaign in the statement.</p> <p>“After the FBI identified specific malicious activity targeting the sector, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims,” the agency said.</p> <p>The Trump campaign did not directly address whether the phones used by Trump and Vance had been targeted.</p> <p>In a statement, a Trump campaign spokesperson, Steven Cheung, criticized the White House and Trump’s opponent, Kamala Harris, and sought to blame them for allowing a foreign adversary to target the campaign, the Times reported.</p> <p>A Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/u-s-wiretap-systems-targeted-in-china-linked-hack-327fc63b">report</a> last month said a cyber-attack linked to the Chinese government had infiltrated multiple US telecommunications firms and may have gained access to systems used by the federal government in court-approved wiretapping efforts.</p> <p>The hackers accessed at least three telecommunication companies – AT&amp;T, Verizon and Lumen Technologies – in what may have been an attempt to find sensitive information related to national security, according to the report.</p> <p>The Trump campaign earlier this year revealed it had been hacked and said Iranian actors had stolen and distributed sensitive internal documents.</p> <p>The US justice department <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/27/charges-iran-trump-campaign-hack">unsealed criminal charges</a> in September against three members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps suspected of hacking the Trump campaign.</p> <p>Justice department officials said hackers were trying to undermine Trump’s campaign and intended to sow discord, exploit divisions within American society and potentially influence the outcome of the 5 November election.</p> <p>With the election under two weeks away, Trump and Kamala Harris are locked in a tight race. In both national head-to-head polls and surveys in the crucial swing states where the election will be decided, the pair seem almost deadlocked.</p>
