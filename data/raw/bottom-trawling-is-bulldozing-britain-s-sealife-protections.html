<p>The decision not to ban bottom trawling in the UK’s marine protected areas is indefensible (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/12/the-guardian-view-on-fishing-and-nature-bottom-trawling-boats-dont-belong-in-conservation-zones">The Guardian view on fishing and nature: bottom-trawling boats don’t belong in conservation zones, 12 September</a>). As David Attenborough has pointed out, dragging weighted nets over sensitive seabeds is like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/01/ocean-david-attenborough-trawling-fishing-industry-film-documentary">bulldozing a rainforest</a> – obliterating habitats vital for fish, seagrass and countless&nbsp;species. Other European nations are taking action, but Britain’s protections are token at best, covering just three sites. Conservation cannot be a meaningless label; marine protected areas must actually be&nbsp;protected.</p> <p>Healthier oceans benefit everyone, including fishing communities that depend on thriving stocks. If the UK is serious about safeguarding 30% of its waters&nbsp;by 2030, it must stop allowing destructive fishing in areas set aside for nature. Without real action, any claim of ocean stewardship rings hollow.<br><strong>Rick Klink</strong><br><em>Guildford, Surrey</em></p> <p>• Months in the making, the <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/48204/documents/252309/default/">environmental audit committee’s 60-page report</a> categorically calls for a whole-site ban on bottom trawling in marine protected areas: 16 MPs and 61 parties contributed to the report, including conservation NGOs, marine scientists and academics (including myself). And yet, despite all the effort, time and expertise put in, the ruling from on high is that the destruction will continue within what are so fraudulently called “protected” areas. Words fail us.</p> <p>Unversed, hubristic civil servants and politicians should be compelled in law to follow scientific&nbsp;advice on marine policy, or be taken out of the decision‑making process altogether – if not, we’ll never be able to protect the sea from ruin.<br><strong>Deborah Rowan Wright</strong><br><em>Bristol</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
