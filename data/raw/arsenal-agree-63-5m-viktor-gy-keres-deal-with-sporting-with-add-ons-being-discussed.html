<p>Arsenal have agreed to pay €63.5m (£55m) up front for Viktor ­Gyökeres and are close to a complete ­agreement with Sporting over the Sweden striker. </p> <p>It is understood the clubs remain in negotiations over ­potential add-ons that could take the total cost of the deal close to €80m, with ­Arsenal believed to have offered a further €15m in performance‑related bonuses for the 27-year-old forward. </p> <p>However, with Gyökeres facing disciplinary action from Sporting after he missed his deadline to report for pre-season training on Saturday, there is confidence in both camps that an ­agreement will be reached and the deal is expected to be ­finalised in the coming days.</p> <p>The Guardian understands that the agents involved in the transfer will not receive the customary commission – typically about 10% of the deal’s total value – clearing the way for Sporting to receive a larger sum up front. If Arsenal had met ­Sporting’s initial €70m asking price under stan­dard terms, the Portuguese club would have netted roughly €63m after fees. Under the new arrangement, they will receive slightly more without losing a cut to intermediaries.</p> <p>Tensions between Gyökeres and Sporting have grown in recent weeks as he has made no secret of his desire to join ­Arsenal. But their president, Frederico ­Varandas, had insisted they would not budge over their valuation of a player who scored 54 times in 52 games last season. He confirmed that Sporting intend to fine Gyökeres unless he can present a legitimate justification for his absence, such as medical reasons, extended leave authorised by the board, or an urgent family matter.</p> <p>“We are calm,” Varandas said on Saturday evening. “Everything can be resolved with the close of the transfer window, a heavy fine and an&nbsp;apology to the group.” With ­reference to Arsenal he said: “If they don’t want to pay Viktor’s fair market value we are very comfortable with that for the next three years.”</p> <p>Arsenal are also expected to make a new approach for Christian Mosquera this week after their initial bid of £14m was rejected by Valencia. The Spain Under-21 defender has already agreed personal terms for a move to the Emirates Stadium.</p> <p>Leandro Trossard could be sold to help balance the books, with Bayern Munich the latest club to show an interest in him. The Belgium forward has also been linked with Fenerbahce and clubs in Saudi Arabia and is likely to cost around £20m.</p> <p>Noni Madueke is close to finalising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/10/arsenal-line-up-52m-transfer-of-23-year-old-chelsea-winger-noni-madueke">his £52m move from Chelsea</a> to Arsenal and is poised for his medical this week. The 23-year-old will sign a five-year contract.</p> <p>Arsenal have also made progress in negotiations over a new contract for Ethan Nwaneri, who has attracted interest from Chelsea and clubs in Germany but is expected to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/26/myles-lewis-skelly-signs-new-arsenal-contract-five-years">join his fellow academy graduate Myles Lewis-Skelly</a> in agreeing a deal to stay.</p>
