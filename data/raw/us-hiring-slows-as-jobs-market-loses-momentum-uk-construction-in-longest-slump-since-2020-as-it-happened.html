However, even as the pace of decline has eased, firms will be looking for a longer-term stabilisation in new orders before adding capacity to their books.</p> <p>“In this environment, contractors should keep a tight grip on cash flow and costs, act early if challenges emerge, and remain realistic about risks so they are not caught off guard if market conditions deteriorate. The government’s return from recess will be key as it looks to implement a new 10-year infrastructure plan, backed by £725 billion of public investment.</p> <p>However, ambition alone won’t be enough.
