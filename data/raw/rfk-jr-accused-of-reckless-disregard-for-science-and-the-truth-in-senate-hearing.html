<p>The US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, faced the Senate finance committee in a tense and combative hearing on Thursday, during which lawmakers questioned his remarks expressing vaccine skepticism, claims that the scientific community is deeply politicized and the ongoing turmoil plaguing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> 
<p>In a hearing lasting more than three hours and ostensibly about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s healthcare agenda, Kennedy defended his leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), claiming that his time at the agency would be focused on “unbiased, politics-free, transparent, evidence-based science in the public interest”. </p> 
<p>Senate Democrats on the committee began the hearing calling for Kennedy’s resignation. “Robert Kennedy’s primary interest is taking vaccines away from Americans,” ranking member Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, said in his opening remarks. “People are hurt by his reckless disregard for science and the truth in this effort. I hope at the very least, Robert Kennedy has the decency to tell the truth this morning.”</p> 
<p>Raphael Warnock, also a Democrat, called Kennedy a “hazard to the health of the American people”, repeating calls for him to step down or for Donald Trump to fire him.</p>

<p>Last week, Kennedy fired the CDC director, Susan Monarez, less than a month after she was confirmed to her position. She is now mounting a legal case challenging her removal.</p> 
<p>Shortly after Monarez’s termination, several leading public health officials at the CDC <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/cdc-leaders-quit-susan-monarez-firing">resigned from their positions</a>, citing frustration with Kennedy’s approach to vaccines and his management style.</p> 
<p>Kennedy said Monarez was “lying” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-the-cdc-and-me-b4ca2eaa?mod=hp_opin_pos_2">about her claims</a> that she was fired for refusing to sign off on the secretary’s new vaccine policies. Instead, Kennedy said that she was removed after admitting to being untrustworthy. </p> 
<p>The Democratic senator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a>, of Massachusetts, was unconvinced –&nbsp;citing Kennedy’s prior characterization of the former CDC director as “unimpeachable”.</p> 
<p>“You had full confidence in her and you had full confidence in her scientific credentials, and in a month she became a liar?” she asked. Thom Tillis, the outgoing Republican senator of North Carolina, asked about the same contradiction in his questioning.</p> 
<p>Monarez’s lawyers responded <a href="https://x.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/1963682298441662816/photo/1">in a statement</a> to Kennedy’s comments, calling them “false” and “at times, patently ridiculous”. They added that Monarez would repeat her published claims “under oath”.</p> 
<p>Kennedy also justified wider firings at the CDC , calling them “absolutely necessary”.</p> 
<p>“We are the sickest country in the world,” he said. “That’s why we need to fire people at CDC. They did not do their job. This was their job to keep us healthy.”</p> 
<p>In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee – a move that defied a promise he made during his confirmation hearing to the Republican senator Bill Cassidy, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee. Many of Kennedy’s replacements for the advisory panel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/11/rfk-jr-new-vaccine-advisers-panel">have a history of vaccine skepticism</a>.</p> 
<p>When asked about the changes to the advisory committee, and how that will change vaccine recommendations and scheduling, Kennedy said he didn’t anticipate changes to the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine.</p> 
<p>In an exchange with Kennedy, Cassidy noted the possible conflict of interest with some of the panel’s new members who are involved in ongoing litigation with vaccine manufacturers.</p> 
<p>Cassidy cast a critical vote to confirm Kennedy earlier this year. He had previously expressed a number of concerns about the health secretary’s historic comments that undermined vaccine efficacy. The senator has since been critical of a number of Kennedy’s policies, including his decision to cut half a billion dollars worth of mRNA vaccine funding – calling the move “<a href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1953239825353425174">unfortunate</a>”.</p> 
<p>Last month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the new batch of Covid-19 vaccines, but placed restrictions on who would be able to access them. The agency has authorized shots for people 65 and older, who are known to be more at risk from serious illnesses from Covid infections. Younger people will only be eligible if they have an underlying medical condition that makes them vulnerable. Infectious disease experts say that this policy could prove extremely dangerous, particularly for young children.</p> 
<p>On Tuesday, Kennedy defended HHS’s handling of the measles outbreak that affected several states <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-were-restoring-public-trust-in-the-cdc-6f26c176?">in an opinion piece</a>. While the secretary branded his agency’s response as effective, public health experts said Kennedy’s own messaging around vaccines was muddied and confusing.</p> 
<p>Cassidy concluded his remarks at the hearing by telling Kennedy that his policies were “effectively denying people the vaccine”, sharing an email from a doctor friend who expressed confusion about Covid inoculation eligibility given the FDA’s new recommendation policies.</p> 
<p>Kennedy snapped back: “You’re wrong.”</p> 
<p>The Republican senator John Barrasso, of Wyoming, also a doctor, expressed similar concerns about Kennedy’s policies. “In your confirmation hearing you promised to uphold the highest standard for vaccines,” Barrasso said. “Since then, I’ve grown deeply concerned.”</p> 
<p>During a back and forth with the Virginia senator Mark Warner, a Democrat, Kennedy falsely claimed that there are “no cuts to Medicaid” under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act –&nbsp;Trump’s hallmark domestic policy legislation that was signed into law in July.</p> 
<p>The congressional budget office <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/Wyden-Pallone-Neal_Letter_6-4-25.pdf">estimates</a> that about 7.8 million people stand to lose their health insurance over a decade, due to Medicaid changes under the law.</p> 
<p>Multiple Democrats on the committee had heated exchanges with the health secretary. Many of them pointed out the inconsistency between Kennedy’s recent support for the president’s “Operation Warp Speed” and his disparagement of the Covid-19 shot. He has previously called it the “deadliest” vaccine ever manufactured.</p> 
<p>At the hearing, Kennedy refused to acknowledge the wealth of data that shows that the Covid-19 vaccine has saved lives.</p> 
<p>“Trump has said the vaccine works, and has saved millions of lives. Your own process, on the other hand, has not been transparent,” said the Democratic senator Maggie Hassan, of New Hampshire. “You repeatedly choose to ignore data because it doesn’t match your preconceived notions and lies.”</p>
