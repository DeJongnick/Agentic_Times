A process whereby people refused asylum can be swiftly sent back is seen as a notable disincentive, with the number of Albanian nationals seeking asylum in the UK having dropped sharply.</p> <p>Starmer said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We’re looking at what we can do on returns agreements. We’ve done a number of bilateral returns agreements. So the question is, again, whether it’s possible to go a bit beyond that. But we are including looking at this question of visas now, and whether we can’t be a bit smarter with the use of our visas in return in relation to countries that don’t have a returns agreement with us.</p> </blockquote> <p>This would be, he added, “much more sort of transactional” in approach.</p> <p>More widely, Starmer said, he had spoken at length at the summit with France’s President Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Georgia Meloni, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, about asylum and small boats. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It was a central part of my discussion, certainly with France, with Germany and with Italy in the bilaterals that we had.</p> <p>I think we need to strengthen our existing tools, but then go further and see what else we can do. And that is a piece of work we’re looking at with the French in particular.

Because the UK status quo has proved itself incapable of delivering on the hopes and ambitions of the people of Scotland.</p> <p>That is why, like a clear majority of Scots, I believe that our nation should have the right to choose.</p> <p>Such a Scotland is within reach, I have no doubt. But if we want it, we have to work for it, we have to vote for it, we have to actively, purposefully, and I hope also joyfully, make it happen.</p> </blockquote> <p>It’s interesting to hear Swinney’s full-throated rhetoric in the context of ongoing criticism of the SNP’s “disastrous” strategy at the recent Hamilton byelection, which saw them lose the pivotal central Scotland Holyrood seat to Labour, and arguably talk up the threat of Reform.</p> <p>Although rumblings about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/12/snp-swinney-criticism-bylection-result">plots to oust him as leader</a> have been dismissed as the usual suspects on manoeuvres by senior party figures, it remains the case that there is disquiet amongst MSPs and activists about the party’s plans for Holyrood election campaign – how can the party get its independence-supporting base to the ballot box, given the low profile Swinney has given it, even sacking his minister for independence? And how does the SNP sell independence to more doubtful voters, with a cost of living crisis still biting and no clear route to a second referendum?</p> <p>Most curious of all, polling just ahead of the Hamilton byelection suggested that the threat of a Reform success was actually pushing more voters to support independence.

been urged by two Labour MPs to “jump” at the chance to push for reform of the European convention on human rights (ECHR).</p> <p>In<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/comment/columnists/article/give-yvette-cooper-power-to-overrule-the-echr-rh2hdwfhp"> a joint article for the Times</a> <strong>Jake Richards</strong> (Rother Valley) and <strong>Dan Tomlinson</strong> (Chipping Barnet) say that it is increasingly clear that international human rights law will be changed, and that what is unresolved is whether it will be done by progressives or rightwing populists.</p> <p>Pointing out that they represent “red wall” and “blue wall” seats respectively, they say a <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2025-06-16/fugitives-wanted-for-murder-and-child-rape-given-right-to-live-in-britain">recent ITV News report,</a> showing foreign suspects wanted for murder and child rape are being protected from extradition by human rights law, highlights the need for change.</p> <p>They acknowledge that the government has already said it wants to produce new guidelines affecting the way article 8 of the convention (the right to a family life) is interpreted by judges in asylum cases. There are concerns that the courts are treating mitigating factors as “exceptional” far too often.</p> <p>But the two MPs suggest they want the government to go further. They say:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>A recent letter drafted by nine European allies called for an “open-minded conversation about the interpretation of the ECHR”. It was welcomed by the Council of Europe [the body overseeing the convention], who said the convention needed “adaptation” and that there would be “no taboo” in discussions.</p> <p>The government should jump at this opportunity. From bogus asylum claims to the deportation of dangerous criminals, the unwieldy reach of the modern operation of the ECHR can hamper effective government. The prime minister is right to call for an “insurgent” approach to governing, to cut through constraints to deliver on political priorities.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68516a1e8f087b2d3ee4d4e4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-17T13:18:57.430Z">2.18pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK announces fresh sanctions against Russia</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has announced a new wave of UK sanctions against Russia.</p> <p>In a news release, <strong>Downing Street</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The 30 targets strike across Russia’s financial, military and energy sectors in response to Putin’s continued aggression.

They voted against it. Mocked campaigners. Smeared them. Branded it a “far-right bandwagon” and a “dog whistle.” </p> <p>Now they’re pretending they supported it all along? Disgraceful. Their hand was forced. </p> <p>Our job now is to make sure this inquiry delivers justice for every survivor. No more delays.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> Angela Rayner, deputy prime minister, chairs cabinet.
