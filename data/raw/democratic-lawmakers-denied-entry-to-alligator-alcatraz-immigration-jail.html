<p>A group of Florida lawmakers were denied entry on Thursday into the new Florida-based immigration jail dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” one day after the first immigrant detainees began to arrive.</p> <p>Five Democratic lawmakers attempted to enter the facility, which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/trump-alligator-alcatraz-immigration-florida">previously toured</a> on Tuesday by White House officials, but were stopped by law enforcement officers from local agencies, according to the state representative Anna Eskamani in an interview with CNN.</p> <p>“This is a blatant abuse of power and an attempt to conceal human rights violations from the public eye,” the five said in a joint statement.</p> <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed that the first detentions at the facility began on Wednesday, but did not respond to questions regarding the number of people detained so far.</p> <p>The controversial Everglades jail was quickly set up in a partnership between the federal and Florida state governments. Sitting approximately 50 miles (80km) west of Miami, the remote facility is managed by the state but in large part funded the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). </p> <p>“It might be as good as the real Alcatraz. A little controversial, but I couldn’t care less,” Trump said on Tuesday after touring the site. During the tour, Trump joked about immigrants being pursued by snakes and alligators if they attempted to escape.</p> <p>Since Trump took office, Florida has been assisting the administration’s goals in rounding up a large number of immigrants to be detained and deported. Through a program called 287(g), local law enforcement agencies partner with DHS and become deputized to carry out immigration enforcement operations. According to the <a href="https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2025/governor-ron-desantis-highlights-floridas-leadership-immigration-enforcement">state government</a>, Florida has more 287(g) deputizations than any other state in the US, which has allowed it to engage in widespread operations targeting immigrant communities.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/trump-alligator-alcatraz-immigration-florida">Trump celebrates harsh conditions for detainees on visit to ‘Alligator Alcatraz’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Immigrants arrested by Florida law enforcement under the arrangement will be detained at the facility, DHS said.</p> <p>“You’ll have a lot of people that will deport on their own because they don’t want to end up in an Alligator Alcatraz, or some of these other places,” Florida governor Ron DeSantis said after touring the facility with Trump. “This is a model, but we need other states to step up.”</p> <p>Being undocumented in the US is not a crime; rather, it is a civil offense. Data analysis by the Guardian shows that there has been a dramatic nationwide increase in the arrest of undocumented immigrants <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/24/trump-immigrants-ice-arrests">with no criminal record</a>.

DHS said it expects the facility to expand quickly to 5,000 beds.</p>
