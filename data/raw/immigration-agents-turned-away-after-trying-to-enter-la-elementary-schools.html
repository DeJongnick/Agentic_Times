<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">Immigration</a> officials attempted to enter two <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> elementary schools this week, but were turned away by school administrators. The incident appears to be the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s first attempt to enter the city’s public schools since amending regulations to allow immigration agents to enter “sensitive areas” such as schools.</p> <p>At a Thursday press conference, the Los Angeles unified school district superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, confirmed that agents from the Department of Homeland Security were seeking five students in first through sixth grades.</p> <p>Officials attempted to enter two south Los Angeles schools, Lillian Street elementary and Russell elementary, but were turned away after the schools’ principals asked to see their identification. Los Angeles Unified is a <a href="https://edsource.org/2024/lausd-unanimously-affirms-support-for-immigrant-and-lgbtq-students-leading-up-to-trumps-inauguration/722594">sanctuary district</a> and does not cooperate with federal immigration agencies.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/11/ice-immigration-agents-worship-houses-ruling">Ice can conduct enforcement actions in places of worship, US judge says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The news comes as the Trump administration has escalated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/how-many-student-visas-revoked">its attacks against international students</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/immigration-venezuelans-detained-legal-status">ramped up efforts</a> to deport undocumented and documented immigrants alike. In January, homeland security rescinded Biden administration guidelines preventing its agents from entering “sensitive areas” including schools and churches.</p> <p>“Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest,” former acting homeland security secretary Benjamine Huffman said in <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/21/statement-dhs-spokesperson-directives-expanding-law-enforcement-and-ending-abuse">a statement</a> announcing the new policy. “The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.”</p> <p>In response, LA Unified began distributing “Know Your Rights” cards to students and the school police department issued <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/la-school-police-ice-immigration/3618203/">a statement</a> saying it would not “assist or engage in immigration compliance checks, immigration enforcement activity, or ICE-related task force operations”.</p> <p>“I’m still mystified as to how a first-, second-, third-, fourth- or sixth-grader would pose any type of risk to the national security of our nation,” Carvalho said. “Schools are places for learning. Schools are places for understanding. Schools are places for instruction. Schools are not places of fear.”</p> <p>The superintendent told reporters that the immigration agents who arrived at the Los Angeles elementary schools said they wanted to see the “students to determine their well-being” as unaccompanied minors, and that they had received authorization to speak with students from their caretakers. He added that the district later spoke with the students’ caretakers and learned that was untrue.</p> <p>“DHS is leading efforts to conduct welfare checks on these children to ensure that they are safe and not being exploited, abused, and sex trafficked,” the homeland security department said in a statement to <a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/lausd-superintendent-addresses-homeland-security-activity">Fox 11 Los Angeles</a>.</p> <p>“Unlike the previous administration, President Trump and Secretary Noem take the responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to reunite children with their families. In less than 70 days, Secretary Noem and Secretary Kennedy have already reunited nearly 5,000 unaccompanied children with a relative or safe guardian.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/11/mahmoud-khalil-deportation-ruling-immigration">US judge rules Mahmoud Khalil can be deported for his views</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Carvalho contested that, and said as an educator who entered the United States without authorization at the age of 17 himself, he felt “beyond my professional responsibility, a moral responsibility to protect these students”.</p> <p>The incident has drawn attention from congressional lawmakers, including Pasadena Democrat Judy Chu.</p> <p>“I’m absolutely incensed that DHS agents would try to enter elementary schools this week, and I’m so grateful to the brave LAUSD administrators who denied them entry. These are children who should be learning to read and write, not cowering in fear of being ripped away from their homes,” she said.</p> <p>“I’m concerned parents may keep their children home rather than risk sending them to school. As Angelenos, we must lock arms together in moments like these to protect kids from deportation squads and protect schools from Trump’s campaign of terror.”</p>
