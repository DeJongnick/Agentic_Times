<p>Late-night hosts talk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s proposed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/trump-gold-card-visa-rich-foreigners">“gold card” visas</a>, Trump’s first cabinet meeting and confusion over who leads the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></h2> <p>Trump announced another disquieting idea on Wednesday – to allow foreigners to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/trump-gold-card-visa-rich-foreigners">purchase new “gold card” visas</a> for $5m apiece – and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> was not happy about it. “What a good idea – I’ve always said our immigration system should run more like the customer rewards program at a casino in Atlantic City,” he joked on Wednesday evening.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_xvpqNFShI"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a_xvpqNFShI?start=459&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=459" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>“Somehow, he’s managed to make everything disgusting,” Kimmel continued. “This is basically what he does at Mar-a-Lago. He’s selling memberships to a country club, but this club is actually our country. The land of the free, and by free I mean $5m bucks.”</p> <p>Trump also said he would consider selling the visas to Russian oligarchs: “I know some Russian oligarchs who are very nice people, it’s possible.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/26/jimmy-kimmel-fyre-festival-trump">Jimmy Kimmel: ‘The whole country is a Fyre Festival right now’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Let me tell you something: he may know oligarchs, but not as well as they know him,” Kimmel quipped.</p> <p>Kimmel also mocked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, who tried to defend Doge’s slash-and-burn approach to civil servant layoffs as an organization that owned up to mistakes. During Trump’s first cabinet meeting, Musk conceded that Doge “accidentally” canceled USAid’s Ebola prevention program, but “restored it immediately”.</p> <p>“Oh, well, that’s fine then,” Kimmel joked. “He only canceled our Ebola prevention for a couple of days, calm down, everybody.</p> <p>“That’s not an excuse,” he added. “Just ask the doctor – ‘As soon as I realized I unplugged my mother’s life support to charge my iPhone, I immediately plugged it back in.’”</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8E8YE8a6Ntk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8E8YE8a6Ntk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>On Wednesday, Trump held his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/trump-cabinet-meeting-musk">first full cabinet meeting</a> of his second term, “and everybody was there”, said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> on The Late Show. “It was a who’s who of why them?”</p> <p>“As commander in chief, Trump made it immediately clear who is in charge: Elon Musk,” Colbert continued. Musk, who attended the meeting, introduced himself as “humble tech support” because “that is almost a literal description of the work that the Doge team is doing”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/21/stephen-colbert-trump">Stephen Colbert on Trump: ‘With this guy, every troll is a trial balloon’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Well, of course. I mean, we’ve all had that call with tech support,” Colbert mocked. “Hello? Yes, you’re computer’s frozen? Have you tried turning it off and then firing 4,000 people with an email.”</p> <p>Trump rambled on in nonsense fashion about Doge, somehow landing on the topic of circumcision. “That long, rambling response actually reminds me of circumcision, because somebody really should have cut that dickhead off,” Colbert quipped.</p> <p>While Musk is supposedly head of Doge, the White House continues to insist that he’s not in court filings and through its press secretary. Finally, on Tuesday, for reasons that remain unclear, the White House stated the agency is led by the career civil servant Amy Gleason. “Why Gleason? We don’t know for sure!” said Colbert.</p> <p>At the time of the announcement, Gleason was on vacation in Mexico. When reached by reporters, she declined to comment. “I am not surprised,” said Colbert. “It’s really hard to speak clearly when you’re under a bus.”</p> <h2><strong>The Daily Show</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1895097168660165075">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump’s new gold card visa beats the old way of becoming a citizen: marrying Donald Trump <a href="https://t.co/3e5zBZLQN2">pic.twitter.com/3e5zBZLQN2</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1895097168660165075?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>And on The Daily Show, Desi Lydic mocked Trump’s proposed “gold card” visas, which he described as “green card privileges plus”.</p> <p>“Oh? Green card privileges plus? See, I was still getting America with ads,” Lydic joked. “Quick question: if I’m unhappy with America, can I cancel my subscription after seven days?”</p> <p>According to Trump, the gold card visas will be “a route to citizenship, and wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card. They’ll be wealthy, and they’ll be successful and they’ll be spending a lot of money.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/feb/25/jon-stewart-elon-musk-firing-workers">Jon Stewart on Doge firings of civil servants: ‘Animated by malice’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Did this guy just put a cover charge on America?” Lydic wondered. “It’s $5m to get in, but he’ll waive it if you bring three hot girls with you.</p> <p>“I mean, I guess this beats the old way of becoming a citizen? Which was to marry Donald Trump,” she added.</p> <p>“Now you might be thinking, wait a second, if the US is just going to put citizenship up for sale, doesn’t that mean can any monster can buy one as long as they’re rich? Well, according to Trump, yes,” she continued, pointing to Trump’s comment that he knows Russian oligarchs who are “very good people”.</p> <p>“Seems like Trump watched Anora, and his takeaway from that movie was ‘we need to do more to help out that rich Russian teenager. He’s so good at sex!’” Lydic joked.</p>
