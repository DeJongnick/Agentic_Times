<p>British electric car sales hit a record high in September as new taxpayer subsidies helped to attract buyers in the most important month for the market.</p> <p>Battery EV sales rose by nearly a third in September compared with a year earlier, to 72,800, according to preliminary figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group.</p> <p>The UK government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/14/buyers-of-new-evs-discount-uk-scheme-tesla">reintroduced an electric car grant in July</a> after intense lobbying by carmakers who argued that they were struggling to meet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/24/uk-carmakers-ev-sales-rules-zev-mandate">targets on electric sales</a>, known as the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate.</p> <p>The grant appeared to help some carmakers to sell more pure electric cars in September, while sales of plug-in hybrids, which combine a petrol engine with a smaller battery that can be recharged by cable, jumped by 56% to 38,300. Hybrid sales have boomed as struggling carmakers have shifted focus towards vehicles that are more profitable, amid intense competition, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/20/sing-when-youre-winning-how-karaoke-heralds-the-triumph-of-chinese-carmakers">particularly from newer Chinese rivals</a>.</p> <p>The electric car grants of up to £3,750 apply to only about a quarter of battery cars on sale in the UK – including models from Citroën, Renault, Nissan and Vauxhall – because of rules on emissions during manufacturing that effectively block Chinese brands from benefiting, as well as an upper <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/09/uk-subsidies-electric-cars-ev-market-eligible-models">price limit of £37,000</a>.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g84RB/1/" data-alt="Electric car share chart"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/g84RB/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, said: “Our discounts have sparked a surge in electric car sales, making them cheaper and within reach of more households than ever before.”</p> <p>Pure electric and hybrid cars overall accounted for more than half of the market in September. They helped overall sales to rise by 14% compared with a year earlier, to 312,900, the strongest September since 2020. However, sales are well below levels seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/05/uk-new-car-sales-september-electric-vehicles-number-plate">before the coronavirus pandemic</a>, amid cost of living pressures.</p> <p>September is the key month for car retailers in the UK, as buyers return from holidays and number plates change to a new year, which helps vehicles to retain resale value.</p> <p>Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: “Electrified vehicles are powering market growth after a sluggish summer – and with record ZEV uptake, massive industry investment is paying off, despite demand still trailing ambition.”</p> <p>The share of electric car sales so far this year is 22.1%, well below the 28% headline target under the ZEV mandate. However, the mandate also includes significant “flexibilities”, under which carmakers gain credit for reducing emissions of the petrol and diesel cars they sell.</p> <p>The government made the flexibilities more generous in April to help carmakers, despite the official Climate Change Committee warning that the concessions were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/29/weakening-of-sales-rules-may-lead-to-fewer-electric-cars-on-uk-roads-says-climate-adviser">likely to lead to higher carbon emissions</a>. New Automotive, a thinktank tracking the mandate, estimated that the true target for battery car sales is below 22%.</p> <p>David Farrar, policy manager at New AutoMotive, said the early evidence from the take-up of the electric car grant – which will help only the first 400,000 buyers – suggested that the scheme might have to close earlier than intended.</p>
