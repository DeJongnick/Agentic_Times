<p>The water regulator, Ofwat, has ordered Anglian Water to pay £62.8m over failures in managing its wastewater treatment works and network that meant it was unable to cope with sewage flows.</p> <p>The regulator found that the company, which supplies water to 7 million customers across the east of England and Hartlepool, “failed to operate, maintain and upgrade its wastewater assets adequately”, leading to a breach of its legal obligations.</p> <p>The “enforcement package” comes at a time of public anger over how much <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/27/raw-sewage-hours-dumped-water-companies-england-last-year-data">raw sewage is still dumped</a> by water companies while their bosses <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/20/have-water-companies-managed-to-sidestep-labour-bonus-ban">continue to receive large bonuses</a>. Most of the money will be spent improving Anglian’s wastewater flows, to reduce environmental damage.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/26/water-chiefs-pay-rises-england-wales-ban-bonuses-sewage"> Water chiefs’ pay rises to average of £1.1m despite ban on bonuses and outrage over pollution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ofwat’s investigation found that Anglian did not have adequate processes or oversight by senior managers and its board to ensure that its sites were performing adequately.</p> <p>The Ofwat senior director for enforcement, Lynn Parker, said: “Our investigation has found failures in how Anglian Water has operated and maintained its sewage works and networks, which has resulted in excessive spills from storm overflows. This is a serious breach and is unacceptable.”</p> <p>Parker added that Anglian accepted it had “got things wrong” and was “now focusing on putting that right and taking action to come back into compliance”.</p> <p>As part of the enforcement package, Anglian Water and its shareholders will be required to rectify any future breaches and ensure its sites comply in future.</p> <p>The total £62.8m enforcement package for Anglian includes a £57m investment in developing and providing “excess flow management plans” to remove or improve wastewater flows in at least eight catchments in its region, to improve the local environment.</p> <p>In addition, the company is required to speed up its own planned investment for dealing with reducing storm overflow discharges, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/18/thames-water-data-reveals-raw-sewage-discharges-rivers-2024">raw sewage is released into rivers and coastal waters</a>, by providing storm tanks and screens earlier.</p> <p>Anglian is also required to develop a remediation and compliance plan to ensure that all its storm overflows comply with legal requirements.</p> <p>The company must create a £5.8m community fund to support projects that benefit local communities.</p> <p>Anglian said it would accelerate planned investment to reduce spills at high-risk sites with new storage, while removing surface water and optimising its network, which it has already been trialling in Yaxley, near Peterborough.</p> <p>The Anglian Water chief executive, Mark Thurston, said: “We understand the need to rebuild trust with customers and that aspects of our performance need to improve to do that.</p> <p>“Reducing pollutions and spills is our number one operational focus, and we have the investment and the partners in place to deliver on those promises as part of our £11bn business plan over the next five years.”</p> <p>Anglian Water is one of six water companies – including Thames Water, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/unitedutilities">United Utilities</a> and Yorkshire Water – that have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/05/bonuses-banned-for-10-english-water-bosses-over-sewage-pollution">banned from paying bonuses</a> for the 2024-25 financial year to their chief executives and chief financial officers.</p> <p>The Water (Special Measures) Act 2025 brought in by Labour prohibits performance-related payments to senior executives of water companies that repeatedly pollute English and Welsh waterways with sewage.</p> <p>Ofwat is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/21/new-powerful-water-regulator-to-replace-failed-ofwat-in-drive-to-reset-sector">due to be abolished and replaced</a> by a new water regulator amid a drive by the government to “reset” a sector tarnished by scandals over sewage spills and financial mismanagement.</p>
