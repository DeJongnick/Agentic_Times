<p>Ruben Amorim has insisted he is “very far from quitting” Manchester United, the head coach moving to clarify his suggestion after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/11/manchester-united-west-ham-premier-league-match-report">Sunday’s loss to West Ham</a> that he could walk away.</p> <p>After the 2-0 defeat at Old Trafford that left his team in 16th Amorim stated that if next season started with the same dismal form it may be time for “new persons to occupy this space”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/13/manchester-united-ruben-amorim-europa-league-final">Manchester United intend to keep Amorim even if they lose Europa League final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking at United’s official Europa League final media conference on Wednesday, Amorim stated his intention was to remain for the long term. “What I am saying is that since I arrived here I am always talking about the standards, and I cannot see the team having these results, especially in the Premier League, and not say anything and not take the responsibility,” he said. “It’s just that. I have a clear idea what to do. I understand the problems of the team. I am far from quitting.</p> <p>“What I am saying is we need to perform and this season and in the future we need to perform or else they [the executive] will change us. That is a normal thing. That was my feeling [after West Ham] and is still my feeling today.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/09/spurs-manchester-united-fans-weigh-up-bilbao-travel-options-europa-league-final">United face Tottenham</a> in next Wednesday’s final and Amorim has paid for 30 of his backroom staff to take their families to the showpiece at Athletic Bilbao’s San Mamés Stadium after learning that the club will not pay for them. He explained this was related to Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s cost-cutting. This has included the club’s largest minority shareholder making up to 450 redundancies when the last round is executed.</p> <p>“The situation is simple,” Amorim said. “People are leaving, a lot of change in the staff. It is complicated for the club to start giving to other members of staff so it is a really hard position. That situation was explained and in that moment my reaction was to help. It is not going to change my life.”</p> <p>If Spurs are beaten, United will qualify for next season’s Champions League. But Amorim admits this has him torn as the team will have less time to train, yet if they lose and do not have Champions League football and the results remain bad this will increase the pressure.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/14/tottenhams-dejan-kulusevski-to-miss-europa-league-final-after-knee-surgery">Tottenham’s Dejan Kulusevski to miss Europa League final after knee surgery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Yeah for sure, if we don’t win. But I’m not concerned about that. It is going to be really bad,” said the Portuguese. “I don’t want to use that as an excuse [but] the patience of the fans and you guys next year if we don’t win it is going to be on the limit. That is my feeling, we need more time with the team. We need to arrange a lot of things in Carrington that we need more time to not think game by game by game. And then we have the squad.</p> <p>“We proved this year we need to be a better squad if we want to win European games and then be really competitive during the Premier League. It’s going to be tough. So my feeling is that. I don’t want to use that as an excuse, it’s going to be really tough. The patience of the fans and you guys [media], the patience for next season and the limit [of what is acceptable] will have to be perfect.”</p>
