This part of its business, called ITV Studios, was always seen as the most likely bit to receive a takeover offer.</p> <p>“The fact the media and entertainment arm has attracted a suitor, rather than Studios, is a surprise. There was a lot of uncertainty over whether anyone would want to relieve ITV of this ball and chain, so to see interest from Sky is Christmas come early for management and shareholders.</p> <p>“ITV’s media arm includes the TV channels and ITVX streaming service, both of which act as platforms to carry third party advertising. Linear TV viewing is in a slow decline, with households increasingly showing a preference to watch on-demand streaming services or YouTube.</p> <p>“ITV has done a fantastic job of staying relevant with the ITVX platform, and it’s fair to say that has been a much bigger success than people thought when it originally launched. It’s given ITV some breathing space to figure out what the future of the group should be, and it was clear that a break-up could be the logical path to follow.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690db8158f08d1d817777218" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-07T09:26:55.615Z">9.26am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">World food prices fall for second month running</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Good news in the fight against inflation – world food prices have fallen for the second month running.</strong></p> <p>The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has reported that world food commodity prices fell in October, adding to a drop in September, thanks to ample global supplies and </p> <p>The FAO Food Price Index, which tracks a basket of globally traded food commodities, averaged 126.4 points in October, down from a revised 128.5 in September. That’s 21.1% below its record high, set in March 2022.</p>    <p>The FAO reports that lower price indices for cereals, dairy products, meat and sugar in October outweighed an increase in the vegetable oil index. </p> <p>The report says:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The FAO Cereal Price Index</strong> fell 1.3% in October and was 9.5% lower than a year ago, with wheat price falling thanks to “ample global supplies, favourable production prospects in the southern hemisphere where harvesting is underway, and steady progress of winter wheat planting across the northern hemisphere”.<br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Meat prices</strong> fell 2.5% in the month, but were 4.8% higher than a year ago. October saw sharp drops in pig and poultry meat prices and a fall in ovine meat prices, partially offset by higher bovine meat quotations. <br></p></li> <li><p><strong>Dairy prices</strong> fell 3.4% in October, but were 2.7% higher than a year ago.Butter fell by 6.5%, due to “ample export availabilities” from the EU and New Zealand. Whole milk powder by 6.0%, skim milk powder by 4.0%, and cheese by 1.5%.<br></p></li> <li><p>The biggest losses were on the <strong>FAO Sugar Price Index</strong>, which dropped by 5.3% during the month and was 27.4% lower than a year ago. The drop was mainly driven by expectations of ample global sugar supplies, with favourable weather in Brazil’s key southern growing regions, and expectations of higher output from Thailand and India. </p><p>Also, lower international crude oil prices pushed down sugar prices, due to lower demand by the biofuel sector.<br></p></li> <li><p>However, the <strong>Vegetable Oil Price Index</strong> rose 1.5% in October to its highest level since July 2022, due to higher quotations for palm, rapeseed, soy and sunflower oils.</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690dad808f08bdefda48514f" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-07T08:38:41.302Z">8.38am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Rightmove shares plunge after it lays out AI investment plans</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>At the other end of the market, shares in property portal Rightmove have plunged by over 15% this morning, after it outlined plans to invest more in AI.</strong></p> <p>Investors seem unimpressed by <strong>Rightmove’s</strong> latest trading update, in which it predicts underlying operating profit growth will slow to 3-5% in 2026, down from 4-9% in 2024 and 2025.</p> <p><strong>Rightmove</strong> insists it is delivering “strong business value” from its platform.
