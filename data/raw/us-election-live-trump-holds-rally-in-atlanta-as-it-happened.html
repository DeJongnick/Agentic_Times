But as the US election approaches, it is analysts in China who are struggling to read the tea leaves on what differentiates <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a> and Donald Trump when it comes to their stance on the US’s biggest geopolitical rival.</p> <p>Commentators are calling it the vibes election. For Beijing, despite the cheers and whoops of Harris’s campaign, her vibes are largely similar to Trump’s.</p> <p>“Harris will continue Biden’s policies” on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a>, says Wang Yiwei, a professor of international studies at Renmin University in Beijing. What are Biden’s policies? He is a “Trumpist without the Trump”, says Wang.</p> <p>Harris has done little to dispel the belief that her stance on China will be largely the same as Biden’s, should she win the election in November. In her headline speech at the Democratic national convention on 22 August, China was mentioned just once: she promised to ensure that “America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century”.</p> <p>Harris has little foreign policy record to be judged on. But in an economic policy <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/08/16/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-a-campaign-event-in-raleigh-nc/">speech</a> on 16 August, she emphasised her goal of “building up our middle class”, a vision that Biden has used to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/05/14/remarks-by-president-biden-remarks-by-president-biden-on-his-actions-to-protect-american-workers-and-businesses-from-chinas-unfair-trade-practices/">justify</a> placing high tariffs on Chinese imports, extending Donald Trump’s trade war.</p> <p>Beijing fundamentally does not see there being much difference between a Democratic- or Republican-controlled White House. Indeed, hawkishness on China has become one of the few bipartisan issues in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-politics">US politics</a>.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/does-china-prefer-harris-or-trump">recent piece</a> for Foreign Affairs, leading foreign policy commentators Wang Jisi, Hu Ran and Zhao Jianwei wrote that “Chinese strategists hold few illusions that US policy toward China might change course over the next decade … they assume that whoever is elected in November 2024 will continue to prioritise strategic competition and even containment in Washington’s approach to Beijing.” The authors predicted that although Harris’s policymaking would likely be more “organised and predictable” than Trump’s, both would be “strategically consistent”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/16/china-us-trade-harris-trump">Taiwan and trade: how China sees its future with the US after the election</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-670f18918f088ef416005b45" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-10-16T01:36:58.898Z">2.36am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Trump again complains about electric cars that “don’t go very far” and are “made in China”.

We are divided as we have not been since the time just before the civil war. And while I hope it wouldn’t – and don’t think it would – rise to those kinds of outcomes, the foundations of the public are being shaken. Frankly, the way we have seen ourselves is being re-evaluated in ways I could never have imagined. So I think this is a very important moment for us to re-establish norms and return to what made us the ‘shining city on the hill’.”</p> <p>With regard to the Ronald Reagan quote Dodson referenced, he said Reagan “was quoting someone else, and that is the point. He and I could disagree with a policy, and would have, but that isn’t what we’re discussing. We’re now talking about the functioning of the democracy and whether we simply seize power by hook or crook, or whether we actually allow people a voice in their governance. That’s the real issue underneath this contest.</p> <p>“I think that election day plus one will be a very difficult day for a lot of people, and election day plus two, and election day plus three, but also Thanksgiving, and also December, at Christmas, or at the New Year’s party or at Hanukkah. I mean, I think that when you really think about it, one half of this country will be very, very unhappy with the results. But the question is, and you spoke about the tenor of this conversation, the conversation has degraded to a point of coarseness, and fear is ruling a huge amount of this discourse. And under fear comes this feeling of being threatened. And when you get threatened, people get angry. And so then, now we’ve filled a country with weapons, and I, too, worry that there are people who really do seem to feel that an outcome that is OK here is a violent outcome, So, this is the point: this is not the great experiment that has been us.

At Sabato’s Crystal Ball, an outfit affiliated with the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics that is one of several well-regarded poll watchers nationwide, they view all seven swing states as toss-ups. But in <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/three-weeks-to-go-has-anybody-seen-our-crystal-ball-anywhere/">an analysis released this morning</a>, they offer some thoughts on how the states may end up voting – though do not predict a winner of the presidential race.</p> <p>Their thoughts on Michigan:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We still think Michigan is likeliest to be Harris’s best state out of this group, as it was for Biden in 2020, and it generally has been the most Democratic of these seven states over the past couple of decades.</p> </blockquote> <p>And North Carolina:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Meanwhile, North Carolina is the one state among the seven that Biden did not carry in 2020, and we remain somewhat skeptical of Harris’s ability to actually win it.</p> <p>One thing that is preventing us from being confident enough to move it to Leans Republican is the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene in western North Carolina, which could have impacts on turnout in what is on balance a Republican-leaning area. In 2020, the 25 counties that FEMA currently <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/voting/upcoming-election/helene-recovery-and-voting">considers</a> to be the disaster zone favored Trump by 25 percentage points while Biden carried the rest of the state by 3.5 points. The state has taken efforts to keep <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/briefs/nearly-all-early-voting-sites-in-western-nc-are-ready-to-open-next-week/">early voting on track</a> in western North Carolina; giving voters additional opportunity to make their voices heard in the midst of an unforeseen disaster is probably the best argument there is for offering robust absentee and early voting options.</p> </blockquote> <p>And finally Georgia and Arizona, two states that generally vote Republican, but which Trump lost four years ago:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Trump has generally, although not always, led polling in Arizona and Georgia, the two typically Republican-leaning states that fell out of his grasp in 2020. Forced to choose, one might also be inclined to tilt those states to Trump. It seems possible that a critical mass of “softer” Republican voters in those states who dislike Trump personally are expressing some buyer’s remorse after they took a chance on Biden in 2020. It wouldn’t take all that many of them to flip Arizona and Georgia back to Republicans after Biden won each by less than half a percentage point.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-10-15T16:28:24.563Z">at 5.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-670e8d128f0898da3e0b4e0c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-10-15T15:43:01.302Z">4.43pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Speaking of Georgia, an attempt by a Republican voting official to get out of certifying election results was rejected by a court, the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/george-chidi">George Chidi</a> reports:</em></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2024">Election</a> certification is a mandatory duty, not discretionary, for county election officials in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgia">Georgia</a>, a judge ruled on Tuesday, rejecting assertions made by a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republican</a> elections official that elections board members could refuse to certify an election based on their suspicions of fraud or error.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/04/republican-julie-adams-georgia-election-integrity-network">Julie Adams</a>, a Republican member of the Fulton county board of registration and elections, brought the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/10/georgia-election-board-member-lawsuit-dismissed">suit</a> earlier this year after abstaining from a vote to certify the May primary election.

In fact, he might make them go up:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Last month, the Peterson Institute for International Economics predicted that Trump’s policies – the deportations, import taxes and efforts to erode the Fed’s independence – would drive consumer prices sharply higher two years into his second term. Peterson’s analysis concluded that inflation, which would otherwise register 1.9% in 2026, would instead jump to between 6% and 9.3% if Trump’s economic proposals were adopted.</p> <p>Many economists aren’t thrilled with Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic agenda, either. They dismiss, for example, her proposal to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-price-gouging-ban-inflation-65dc8844bb41159d76886f752b6cab28">combat price gouging</a> as an ineffective tool against high grocery prices. But they don’t regard her policies as particularly inflationary.</p> <p>Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, and two colleagues have estimated that Harris’ policies would leave the inflation outlook virtually unchanged, even if she enjoyed a Democratic majority in both chambers of Congress. An unfettered Trump, by contrast, would leave prices higher by 1.1 percentage points in 2025 and 0.8 percentage points in 2026, they concluded.</p> <p>Taxes on imports – tariffs – are Trump’s go-to economic policy. He argues that tariffs protect American factory jobs from foreign competition and deliver a host of other benefits.</p> <p>While in office, Trump started a trade war with China, imposing high tariffs on most Chinese goods. He also raised import taxes on foreign steel and aluminum, washing machines and solar panels. He has still grander plans for a second term: Trump wants to impose a 60% tariff on all Chinese goods and a “universal’’ tariff of 10% or 20% on everything else that enters the United States.</p> <p>Trump insists that the cost of taxing imported goods is absorbed by the foreign countries that produce those goods. The truth, though, is that U.S. importers pay the tariff – and then typically pass along that cost to consumers in the form of higher prices, which is how Americans themselves end up bearing the cost of tariffs.</p> <p>What’s more, as tariffs raise the cost of imports, the weakened competition from foreign products makes it easier for U.S. producers to raise their own prices.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-10-15T15:09:43.088Z">at 4.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-670e7e848f088ef416005505" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-10-15T14:42:47.482Z">3.42pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Donald Trump has been prolific on Truth Social, the social network he owns and uses most frequently.</strong></p> <p>He made several late-night posts this morning and yesterday, insisting he is healthy enough to serve as president for another four-year term.
