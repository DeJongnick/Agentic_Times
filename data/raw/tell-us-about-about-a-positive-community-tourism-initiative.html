<p>When it comes to planning a trip, how we travel is just as important as where we go – the connections we make, the insights into different cultures and, hopefully, a sense that our visit is having a positive impact on the communities that host us. We’d love to hear about the community tourism initiatives that you’ve encountered on your travels, whether it was a wilderness lodge or trekking company owned and run by locals, a cultural exchange programme, or a conservation project perhaps.</p> <p>If you have a relevant photo, do send it in –<strong> but it’s your words that will be judged</strong> <strong>for the competition</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Keep your tip to about 100 words</strong></p> <p>The best tip of the week, chosen by <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/">Tom Hall of Lonely Planet</a>, will <strong>win a £200 voucher to stay at a <a href="https://www.coolstays.com/">Coolstays</a> property</strong> – the company has more than 3,000 worldwide.
