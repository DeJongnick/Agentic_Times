<p>Police have shut down the alleged medicinal cannabis operation of one of New Zealand’s most renowned “green fairies”, prompting an outpouring of support from a prominent politician and the hundreds of people who rely on such products to ease their pain.</p> <p>Police raided the rural Northland property of 66-year-old Paul Smith – more widely known as “Gandalf” – last week, destroying plants and greenhouses and<strong> </strong>seizing cannabis products. Smith was charged with cultivating, possessing for supply and selling cannabis – which could carry an eight-year jail sentence – and was summonsed to court. </p> <p>Medicinal cannabis has been legal in New Zealand since 2020, but patients are reliant on gaining a doctor’s prescription to access it for treatment. So-called “green fairies” provide cheaper, more readily available, hidden market products.</p>    <p>More than 50 protesters gathered outside Whangārei District Court on Monday where Smith pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p> <p>“This isn’t just an attack on one man, it’s an assault on hundreds of patients who rely on … affordable relief,” said protest organiser Pearl Schomburg, who is a patient of Gandalf’s and the convener of Auckland Patients Group – an advocacy group pushing for cannabis law reform.</p> <p>About a dozen police officers arrived at Gandalf’s property last week with sledgehammers and axes to destroy roughly 40 plants and greenhouses, Schomburg told the Guardian.</p> <p>“They ransacked his house and took away all of his … thank-you cards and letters.”</p> <p>Smith was “no criminal mastermind” she said. “He’s a compassionate, barefoot hippy with a battered truck and a heart of gold.”</p> <p>People wishing to access medicinal cannabis do not always succeed in obtaining a prescription or can feel discomfort asking their doctors for one, due to the stigma surrounding cannabis. For others, the up to $400 a month price-tag puts the legal products out of reach, Schomburg said.</p> <p>“The only people that can access legal cannabis currently in New Zealand are the wealthy – there is not equality of access to these products,” she said.</p> <p>Smith thanked his supporters in a short video shared to social media and a <a href="https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/gandalf-needs-your-help">donations page</a> set up to help pay for his legal fees.</p>    <p>“To all you lovely people out there, I give you a big hug, a heartfelt thanks for all your kind words and support … I’ve never experienced anything like this in all my life.”</p> <p>Cannabis is New Zealand’s most commonly used illicit drug, with over half a million adults having used it between 2023 and 2024, according to the NZ Health Survey. In 2020, the country <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/06/new-zealand-narrowly-votes-no-to-legalising-cannabis-in-referendum">narrowly voted against legalising cannabis</a>.</p> <p>Green Party co-leader, Chlöe Swarbrick threw her support behind the protesters, saying the raid on Smith was “an absolutely abysmal waste of public resources”.</p> <p>The costly “war on drugs” had done little to reduce drug use or move addiction statistics, she said, adding that a new approach based in harm reduction and evidence was necessary.</p> <p>Swarbrick – who has long advocated for the legalisation of cannabis – pointed to a <a href="https://www.massey.ac.nz/about/news/survey-shows-one-third-of-medical-cannabis-users-now-have-a-prescription-for-legal-prescribed-cannabis-products/">recent Massey University study</a> showing two-thirds of New Zealand’s medicinal cannabis users still access it through the hidden market, mostly due to the expense of legal cannabis.</p> <p>“That should be a really clear sign that the rules that we have in place right now are not working, and that we should do something about [them]… instead of terrorising a 66-year-old man.”</p> <p>In a statement to the Guardian, the police said it would be inappropriate for them to comment on Smith’s case, as the matter was before the courts.</p>
