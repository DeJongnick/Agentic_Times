<p><strong>Coronavirus restrictions have tightened across greater Sydney, with 68 cases now linked to the northern beaches cluster.</strong> As the state yesterday recorded 30 new cases, premier Gladys Berejiklian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/20/covid-restrictions-tightened-across-sydney-as-nothern-beaches-cluster-grows">reverted to previous restrictions on in-home and public gatherings</a> and urged all resident to wear masks. (Here’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/20/sydney-covid-restrictions-explained-limits-on-gatherings-venues-and-the-northern-beaches-lockdown">what you need to know</a> about the new rules in New South Wales, and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/18/coronavirus-nsw-hotspots-list-regional-sydney-covid-19-outbreak-locations">list of the hotspots</a>.) Other states and territories have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/20/australia-border-restrictions-here-are-the-new-state-and-territory-covid-rules-for-nsw-travellers">introduced border closures and restrictions</a>, Queensland declaring the whole greater Sydney region a hotspot from today, Victoria effectively barring travel from the area, and Western Australia reinstating its hard border. Holiday plans have been thrown into disarray for thousands of families – many separated, others facing Christmas Day in quarantine. In the words of one dad: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/20/its-2020-being-2020-sydney-covid-outbreak-disrupts-christmas-plans-across-australia">“It’s 2020 being 2020.”</a></p> 
<p><strong>European countries have reacted to the discovery of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/20/fast-spreading-covid-variant-in-england-uk">fast-spreading strain of Covid-19</a> in England by announcing bans on flights carrying passengers from the UK. </strong>As the World Health Organisation called on its members in Europe to step up measures, on Sunday Austria, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/20/belgium-italy-and-netherlands-ban-flights-from-uk-over-new-covid-strain">announced bans on travel from the UK</a>, with similar plans reportedly being considered by France, Germany and Ireland. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/20/most-incompetent-government-londoners-fury-at-covid-tier-4-rules">Millions of people in London</a> and the south-east began their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/19/pm-announces-tier-4-covid-curbs-and-curtails-christmas-mixing-in-england">first full day of a new lockdown</a> as the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/20/england-new-covid-restrictions-likely-to-stay-for-months-until-vaccine-rollout">the newly identified strain of the virus was “out of control”</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Republican Mitt Romney has made his views on Donald Trump clear,</strong> calling the president’s flirtation with declaring martial law in battleground states and appointment of a conspiracy theorist in his attempt to overturn the election <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/20/donald-trump-electoral-fraud-sidney-powell-michael-flynn-republicans-mitt-romney">“really sad” and “nutty and loopy”</a>. Speaking to CNN on Trump’s refusal to accept the election results and baseless claims of voter fraud, Romney said: “Because the president could right now be writing the last chapter of this administration, with a victory lap with regards to the [Covid-19] vaccine. After all he pushed aggressively to get the vaccine developed and distributed, that’s happening on a quick timeframe. He could be going out and championing this extraordinary success. Instead … this last chapter suggests what he is going to be known for.”</p>

Current PM Scott Morrison remembered him as “a man with no pretences who was passionate about regional Australia”.</p> 
<p><strong>Apologies for the expletives but the results of Guardian Australia’s word of the year poll show you thought 2020 was, well ... very, very bad. </strong>In the 6,185 responses we’ve received so far, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/dec/21/word-of-the-year-poll-guardian-readers-describe-2020-as-shit">there’s been one clear standout</a>.

<p><strong>“Guides for talking to teenagers range from the useless to the psychopathic. </strong>‘Really listen,’ one reads, ‘control your emotions,’ says another, ‘water daily and place in full sun,’ suggests a third. For boomers, or even the old-at-heart millennials among us, this advice won’t equip you for climbing the mounting fear that talking to younger cousins and nephews at Christmas lunch inspires.” Enter: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/21/want-to-do-the-spacegirl-dance-with-me-how-to-talk-to-teens-this-christmas">this helpful guide to what teenagers actually want you to ask them about</a>, courtesy of a recent graduate of the kids’ table.</p>

The companies that host Sky’s viral far-right disinformation bombs are in cahoots with them. Nothing about this is likely to change in 2021, outside the unlikely event of massive pushback on the channel from an Australian public that hardly knows the channel exists.”</p>
