<p>Consumer price figures released on Wednesday will determine whether a cautious Reserve Bank of Australia will give millions of mortgaged Australians a rate cut next month, economists say.</p> <p>The RBA board earlier this month shocked the market and experts when, in a split decision, it decided to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/08/rba-interest-rates-reserve-bank-australia-cash-rate-meeting-july">hold its key cash rate at 3.85%</a>, defying near-unanimous predictions of a move to lower it.</p> <p>Two weeks away from the board’s next meeting on 11-12 August, slightly chastened investors and analysts are once again assuming a rate cut is a done deal – with only one caveat.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/24/rba-wary-of-cutting-rates-until-it-has-more-evidence-on-inflation-bullock-says">RBA wary of cutting rates until it has more evidence on inflation, Bullock says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Unless this [week’s inflation report] is a surprise … then almost certainly we will get a rate cut,” said Jonathan Kearns, chief economist at investment firm Challenger and a former senior RBA official.</p> <p>The message from ANZ’s head of Australian economics, Adam Boyton, was the same: a high consumer price number could “derail an August rate cut”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Which begs a broader question: If inflation is already below the mid-point of the central bank’s 2% to 3% target range – and if the RBA believes monetary policy is slowing the economy – then why are we even still in this will-they-won’t-they discussion?</p> <p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics’s consumer price report will show inflation eased further to 2.2% in the year to June, from 2.4% in June, according to the median analyst forecast. Inflation has dropped in almost every quarter since it peaked at 7.8% at the end of 2022.</p> <p>It’s no surprise then that the message from Michele Bullock, the central bank’s governor, is that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/08/rba-cash-rate-interest-rates-cut-is-a-question-of-when-not-if">interest rates are on the way down</a>.</p> <p>But as much as indebted homeowners are crying out for the relief rate cuts bring, the message is also that the RBA will not be rushed.</p> <p>In deciding to hold rates at the last meeting, the majority of board members decided there was merit in “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/24/rba-wary-of-cutting-rates-until-it-has-more-evidence-on-inflation-bullock-says">waiting for a little more information</a> to confirm that inflation remains on track to be at 2.5% on a sustainable basis”.</p> <p>Monthly price figures, which offer only a partial picture, suggested there were still some lingering worries inflation was not dropping as quickly as hoped, Bullock has said.</p> <p>There are also the ongoing worries that Donald Trump will announce a major new escalation in his trade aggression. And the fact that billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded subsidies have provided an artificial tailwind in the race to bring inflation back under control.</p> <p>Household electricity bills, for example, would be 26% higher today were it not for temporary rebates from federal and state governments.</p> <p>As these handouts end, inflation will drift back towards 3% by the end of the year, according to the RBA’s May forecasts, and then it will take 18 months to get back to 2.6%.</p> <p>As is its usual practice, the central bank focuses on an underlying measure of inflation that strips out more volatile price movements, such as for electricity and petrol, to get a clearer picture. Using a “trimmed mean” measure rather than the “headline” rate, inflation has only just returned to the target band, at 2.9% in the year to March.</p> <p>It is this core inflation rate that economists will be focused on come Wednesday at 11:30am.</p> <p>Kearns said a “surprise” result would be consumer prices rising “materially” faster than the anticipated 0.7% increase in the underlying figure in the three months to June. A rise of 0.9% – which would push the annual rate to 3% – or more “would certainly” give the RBA board pause for thought, he said.</p> <p>Boyton said he expected the quarterly underlying inflation figure would come in at 0.6%, or 2.7% year-on-year.</p> <p>That said, even a 0.8% quarterly increase would “present a challenge for the board”.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
