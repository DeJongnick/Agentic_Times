<p>Morning everyone. With Anthony Albanese expected to outline proposed cost-of-living relief measures at tomorrow’s Labor caucus meeting, the Greens are upping the pressure on him to scrap the stage-three tax cuts to fund help for low- and middle-income earners. Plus, there are calls today for the consumer watchdog to investigate whether the big supermarkets are exploiting their market power, and Glenn Maxwell is being investigated by cricket bosses after ending up in hospital following a night out.</p>

But critics say it is a deeply divisive tactic by Modi in an election year.</p>
