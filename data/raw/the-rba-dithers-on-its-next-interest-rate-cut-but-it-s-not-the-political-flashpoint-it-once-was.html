<p>The former US president Harry Truman famously asked for a one-armed economist after growing tired of hearing “on the one hand, this” and “on the other hand, that”.</p> <p>Those listening to Michele Bullock, the Reserve Bank of Australia’s governor, talk about the future path for interest rates may sympathise.</p> <p>As expected, the RBA’s monetary policy board held the cash rate steady at 3.6% on Tuesday.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/26/inflation-jim-chalmers-nobody-wanted-to-say-mission-accomplished">Nobody wanted to say ‘mission accomplished’ on inflation – certainly not Jim Chalmers. But he was surely thinking it</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the regular post-meeting press conference, Bullock said she could envision a future where rates are on hold for the foreseeable future, and where they need to be cut again.</p> <p>“What we’re focusing on is an interest rate path that will deliver us inflation sustainably in the band,” she said, batting away repeated attempts to pin her down.</p> <p>“That could mean a couple more reductions. It might not. I don’t know at this point, and we’ll look at all this again in November.”</p> <p>Analysts were alarmed last week after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/26/inflation-jim-chalmers-nobody-wanted-to-say-mission-accomplished">monthly inflation figures</a> showed price growth jumped back to 3% in the year to August – the very top of the central bank’s target range.</p> <p>Those monthly numbers are volatile and less reliable than the quarterly figures (due late October), and Bullock was certainly not pressing the panic button.</p> <p>Still, there was enough in the recent consumer price figures for RBA board members to worry that inflation may be proving more “persistent” than hoped.</p> <p>“Private demand is recovering a little more rapidly than expected,” the board said in its statement. Bullock went on to say the three rate cuts already delivered are still working their way through the economy.</p> <p>Going by financial markets – which offer as good a guide as any – the chance of a rate cut in six weeks’ time has dwindled, from about 55% before the announcement to 35%, according to NAB.</p> <p>There was a matching vibe from economists: a November rate cut is still possible, but could easily be pushed back until 2026.</p> <p>Westpac’s chief economist, Luci Ellis, said “the choice is still when to cut further, not whether”.</p> <p>As the RBA dithers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/jim-chalmers--australian-politician-">Jim Chalmers</a> was a little more forthright about the latest call by what he loves to refer to as “the independent central bank”.</p> <p>“This is not the outcome that millions of Australians would have wanted,” the treasurer noted.</p> <p>The shadow treasurer, Ted O’Brien, was quick to blame Labor’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/30/australia-treasurer-chalmers-budget-deficit-smaller-than-expected-structural-challenges-loom">spending spree</a>”.</p> <p>But inflation and the RBA’s six-weekly decisions are no longer the political flashpoint they were last year and leading up to the election.</p> <p>If anything, rate cuts are increasingly seen through the lens of the boost they provide to an already unaffordable housing market.</p> <p>Perhaps, then, rates at about current levels wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.</p> <p>• Patrick Commins is Guardian Australia’s economics editor</p>
