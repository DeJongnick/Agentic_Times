<p>Voters on the vast Arctic island of Greenland are going to the polls after a dramatic election campaign that the territory’s prime minister said had been “burdened by geopolitical tensions”.</p> <p>The vote on Tuesday has attracted global attention after Donald Trump’s repeated assertions about acquiring the autonomous territory, using military and economic force if necessary.</p> <p>The election, which takes place against a backdrop of growing calls for independence, is also being closely scrutinised by Denmark, which ruled Greenland as a colony until 1953 and continues to control its foreign and security policy.</p> <p>Greenland, along with the Faroe Islands, remains part of the Danish kingdom. However, Copenhagen fears that if voters give strong backing to the largest opposition party, Naleraq, a prominent pro-independence voice and supporter of US collaboration, Greenland could instead strengthen its ties with the US.</p> <p>The sole polling station in Greenland’s capital city, Nuuk, where the sun was shining after days of rain and wind, opened at 9am local time (11am GMT), with a result expected in the early hours of Wednesday.</p> <p>Among the first to vote at Godthåbhallen were coalition partners Múte B Egede, the territory’s prime minister and chair of the Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA) party, and Erik Jensen, the chair of Siumut.</p> <p>Egede, who was celebrating his 38th birthday, was sung a celebratory birthday song at the polling station, reported the newspaper Sermitsiaq.</p> <p>“It has been an election campaign that has been burdened by geopolitical tensions,” Egede told the Danish broadcaster DR on Tuesday. “It is a time of struggle between Greenland and Denmark, where we are speaking out, and where the Danes have to look themselves in the eye and make concessions. And in addition, we have the USA on the sidelines, pressing on.”</p> <p>He added: “It is a fateful choice, but also a choice that gives us opportunities if we do it properly.”</p>    <p>In his speech to Congress last week, Trump said that he would acquire Greenland <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2025/mar/05/donald-trump-on-greenland-i-think-were-going-to-get-it-one-way-or-another-video">“one way or the other”</a>. On Sunday, he attempted to appeal to Greenlanders directly by reiterating his invitation to join the US and pledging to “invest billions of dollars to create new jobs and make you rich”.</p> <p>However, while many in Nuuk are open to strengthening collaboration with the US, the idea of Greenland being acquired by the Trump administration has been widely rejected.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/01/greenland-zip/giv-4559va4EnwKXAa2f/" data-alt="Graphic showing location of Greenland in relation to US and Denmark"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/01/greenland-zip/giv-4559va4EnwKXAa2f/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/05/greenland-politicians-condemn-disrespectful-trump-takeover-claim">recent remarks were not helping</a>, Egede said. “We need to draw a line in the sand and spend more effort on those countries that show us respect for the future we want to draw,” he added.</p> <p>Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland’s minister for natural resources, equality, business and justice and a member of IA, said Trump’s latest comments were seen as “crass and inappropriate”. “It’s the wrong way to do foreign policy if you want to get a closer tie with Greenland,” she added.</p> <p>Of the six parties running, only Naleraq has promised to hold a snap vote on independence and all parties, except for Atassut, support secession – although with varying degrees of urgency.</p> <p>Greenland’s longstanding independence movement has gained significant traction in recent years after a series of scandals highlighting Denmark’s racist treatment of Greenlanders – including the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/29/i-was-only-a-child-greenlandic-women-tell-of-trauma-of-forced-contraception">IUD scandal</a>, in which up to 4,500 women and girls were allegedly fitted with contraception without their knowledge, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/20/denmark-to-ditch-parenting-competency-tests-for-greenlandic-families">“parenting competency”</a> tests that have separated many Inuit children from their parents.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/08/its-very-unpredictable-divided-greenland-prepares-to-vote-amid-trump-inspired-existential-crisis">‘It’s very unpredictable’: divided Greenland prepares to vote amid Trump-inspired existential crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With the US administration expressing interest in Greenland’s “incredible natural resources”, chiefly its mineral wealth, Egede’s IA and another party, Siumut, have said they would set up a national mining company to enable Greenland to profit more from its raw materials.</p> <p>Nathanielsen said that despite the geopolitical drama the issues on voters’ minds were the usual preoccupations such as education and healthcare.</p> <p>“We are getting asked the exact same questions as usual by voters,” she said. “But on top of that there is, of course, a real concern about what is going on the world stage, especially with regards to Greenland.”</p> <p>Trump’s promises of interest and money in Greenland have so far been “very vague”, she said. “Right now it is just talk and very unclear what they [the US] actually think and what he [Trump] means by making Greenlanders rich, that’s still to be seen.”</p> <p>Aviâja Korneliussen, 18, a high school student and first-time voter, said: “I am excited but also very nervous because we don’t know how it’s going to affect our communities and we know that the whole world is watching and waiting.”</p> <p>Korneliussen said she had not yet decided whether to vote for Naleraq, IA or the Democrats. She wanted Greenland to become independent and to have more connection with the Arctic region rather than with Denmark or the Nordics or Europe. But she was unsure when it came to the US.</p> <p>“I’m a bit conflicted because we know [what] the US has done to their own Indigenous groups and how they can manipulate things to be their way. But I get the idea they want to work together to be more independent from Denmark, so it’s a bit 50/50 for me.”</p> <p>Trump had been “disrespectful … he looks at us as objects to own” and she did not want Greenland to become the 51st state, she added.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 11 March 2025. An earlier version said that 4,500 women and girls were allegedly fitted with contraception without their knowledge. In fact, the exact number of women and girls who did not give their consent is unknown but 4,500 contraceptives were fitted during the IUD scandal between 1966 and 1970.</p>
