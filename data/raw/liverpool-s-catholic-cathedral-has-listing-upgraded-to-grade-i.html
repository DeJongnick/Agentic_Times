<p>It’s known locally as the “Wigwam” or the “Mersey Funnel”, although one architect also likened it to “a gargantuan concrete aberration from the Apollo space programme”.</p> <p>Love it or not, Liverpool’s Catholic cathedral can now be regarded as one of the most important buildings in the UK.</p> <p>The Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced it has upgraded the 1960s concrete Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King from Grade II* to Grade I status.</p> <p>The change, following advice from Historic England, means it is now nationally recognised as a building of the highest architectural and historical interest.</p> <p>It joins the vast majority of England’s cathedrals which are also Grade I-listed, including St Paul’s, Coventry and Liverpool’s more traditionally built Anglican cathedral.</p>    <p>The news was greeted with appreciation by civic leaders in the city, with Steve Rotheram, the region’s metro mayor, calling it “a welcome and well-deserved honour”.</p> <p>He said the cathedral was architecturally brilliant and one of Liverpool’s most iconic landmarks: “The bold, modern design broke new ground and has become a beacon of faith, hope and innovation, not just for our region but across the world.”</p> <p>The cathedral was built between 1962 and 1967 to a design by Sir Frederick Gibberd, the architect who also created the new town of Harlow and designed Heathrow Terminal 1.</p> <p>It was built over a Sir Edwin Lutyens-designed granite crypt that had been intended to be the start of a grand, classical-style cathedral. That project began in the 1930s but was abandoned because of increasing costs and the second world war.</p>    <p>That cathedral would have become the second-biggest church in the world and is regarded as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/jan/25/architecture">one of the greatest buildings never built</a>.</p> <p>Work on the more modest Gibberd cathedral began in October 1962, the month that the Beatles released Love Me Do. It was consecrated in May 1967, a week before the Beatles released Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.</p> <p>Roger McGough wrote a celebratory poem:</p> <p><em>“Let it not be a showroom <br>for would-be good Catholics,<br>or worse:<br>a museum, a shrine, a concrete hearse …”</em></p> <p>The cathedral has never been universally loved. The architect who likened it to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jun/03/from-sgt-pepper-to-the-sublime-in-praise-of-liverpools-metropolitan-cathedral-at-50">“aberration from the Apollo space programme” was Michael Manser</a>, a president of the Royal Institute of British Architects. In 2013 CNN named it one of the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-metropolitan-cathedral-named-one-3355180">ugliest buildings in the world</a>.</p>    <p>Its fans would urge critics to step inside the cathedral to appreciate its full wonder and openness.</p> <p>Historic England said it represented a revolution in cathedral design and the upgrading “reflects a deeper understanding of Sir Frederick Gibberd’s architectural vision and the cathedral’s significance as an international example of progressive Roman Catholic architecture during the mid-20th century”.</p> <p>John Sherrington, archbishop of Liverpool, said the cathedral commanded the skyline and is visible for miles around.</p> <p>“The building has been described as ‘the soul of the city’ and brings hope to thousands who visit each year,” he said.</p>    <p>“The colours of the stained glass and revolutionary architectural style help raise their minds and hearts beyond this world to the transcendent and to God.”</p> <p>The upgraded listing was also welcomed by Liam Robinson, the leader of Liverpool city council, who called it a proud moment for the city: “This recognition not only honours a masterpiece of modern architecture but also celebrates the spirit of innovation and resilience that epitomises our city.”</p> <p>Catherine Croft, the director of the <a href="https://c20society.org.uk/">Twentieth Century Society</a>, which campaigns for buildings and architecture from that era, said the cathedral was “unique in world architecture and has long been a powerful homecoming beacon for Liverpudlians”.</p> <p>She added: “Liverpool now rightly has two magnificent Grade I-listed cathedrals which together demonstrate just how varied, exciting and emotionally uplifting 20th-century architecture can be.”</p>
