 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/05/zohran-mamdani-new-york-nyc-donald-trump-mayor-election-california-new-jersey-virginia-latest-news-results?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-690bc5128f08fa7fae3069f5#block-690bc5128f08fa7fae3069f5">took a victory lap</a> after Tuesday’s election day wins with the chair of Democratic National Committee saying the party “is all gas, no brakes” and “this is not your grandfather’s Democratic party”. Despite that, Jared Golden, a democratic representative for Maine, announced Wednesday that he wouldn’t seek re-election, which could pose a challenge for democrats in the highly contested seat.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, in the midst of creating a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/05/zohran-mamdani-new-york-nyc-donald-trump-mayor-election-california-new-jersey-virginia-latest-news-results?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-690bd60a8f082152466b6b0d#block-690bd60a8f082152466b6b0d">new golden lettered sign for the Oval Office</a>, Donald Trump went on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/trump-truth-social-posts">a Truth Social posting frenzy</a> that covered everything from Nigerian Christians to Obamacare to Peter Navarro’s new book.</p> 
  <p>Here’s what else happened today:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>A federal judge in Chicago issued a temporary restraining order that requires an immigration facility to improve its conditions.</strong> The ruling came after detainees sued the government over what they say are “inhumane”, unsanitary and crowded conditions. The judge ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide detainees with clean and adequate bedding, daily showers and three meals a day.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that if a deal isn’t reached in the government shutdown, the Federal Aviation Administration will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/government-shutdown-duffy-airspace-closures">cut 10% of flights in 40 major airports</a> across the country.</strong> The announcement did not specify which 40 airports would see the reduction, but Duffy said it will affect cargo, private and passenger traffic. During the historic 36 days of the government shutdown, airports have seen air traffic control staffing shortages and delays in flights. Those employees must work during the shutdown, but aren’t paid until it’s over. FAA administrator Bryan Bedford said the agency is working with airlines and that the drawdown will be “prescriptive” and “surgical”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US supreme court appeared skeptical of the legal basis of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s sweeping global tariff regime on Wednesday after justices questioned the president’s authority to impose the levies. </strong>The question at the heart of the case is whether the Trump administration’s tariffs violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a 1977 law which only gives the president authority to “regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency”. Today, even conservative justices <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-oral-arguments">sounded doubtful</a> of the strength of the Trump administration’s position. “The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress,” said Chief Justice John Roberts. Lawyers for the small businesses challenging the White House said that the president’s actions were unprecedented. “They are tariffing the entire world in peacetime, and they are doing it asserting a power that no president in our history has ever had,” said attorney Neal Katyal.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>As he hosted Republican senators at the White House, Donald Trump offered some initial thoughts on the Democratic victories across the country on election night. </strong>“Last night, it was not expected to be a victory, it was very Democrat areas. But I don’t think it was good for Republicans,” the president said. “I’m not sure it was good for anybody.” Later, while speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami, Trump particularly disparaged Zohran Mamdani’s historic win in New York City. “The decision facing all Americans could not be more clear – we have a choice between communism and common sense,” he said, while mispronouncing the new mayor’s name.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>On Capitol Hill,</strong> <strong>and day 36 of the government shutdown (now the longest on record), Republicans continued to rebuke Democrats for failing to pass a stopgap funding bill. </strong>House speaker Mike Johnson also used his daily press conference to both downplay and foreshadow what Tuesday’s election results suggest going forward. “There’s no surprises. What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue. We all saw that coming,” the speaker said, before stating the importance of maintaining a Republican majority in the midterm elections. “If we lose the majority in the House, and this radical element of the Democrat party were able to take over, we’ve already seen that movie. They will try to end the Trump administration,” Johnson said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Meanwhile, Trump had choice words for GOP lawmakers, as he pushed for them to blow up the filibuster.</strong> Despite reticence from Republican leaders on Capitol Hill, the president pushed the virtues of abolishing the 60-vote threshold needed to end debate on legislation. His argument largely rests on the grounds that Democrats would do the same, and would use it to advance their own agenda if they were given the opportunity. “We have to get the country going. We will pass legislation at levels you’ve never seen before, and it will be impossible to beat us,” he said. “They’ll [Democrats] most likely never attain power, because we will have passed every single thing that you can imagine.”</p></li>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Trump administration says it’s revoked 80,000 non-immigrant visas since January, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-has-revoked-80000-non-immigrant-visas-us-official-says-2025-11-06/">according to Reuters</a>.</strong> A senior state department official told the news outlet that the revocations are for offenses that range from driving under the influence to assault.</p> 
  <p><strong>Karoline Leavitt</strong>, the White House press secretary, also posted on <a href="https://x.com/PressSec/status/1986190291699986783">social media</a> on Wednesday that US Border Patrol has released zero immigrants into the country for the sixth month in a row.</p> 
  <p>The pronouncements come as <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s crackdown on immigration has intensified throughout the year. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have led indiscriminate raids in cities across the country with families, green card holders and even US citizens being detained. The administration has also deported record numbers of people.</p> 
  <p>According to Reuters, around 16,000 of the visa revocations were for allegedly driving under the influence, 12,000 were for alleged assault and 8,000 were for alleged theft – making up nearly half of the total tally. </p> 
  <p>The State Department confirmed in April that it had revoked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/how-many-student-visas-revoked">hundreds of student visas</a> for alleged overstays and breaking the law. And last month, the agency said it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/us-foreign-visas-charlie-kirk-social-media">revoked visas from six foreigners</a> who made comments on social media about the assassination of far-right commentator <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong>.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Donald Trump goes on a tear posting dozens of self-promoting videos to Truth Social</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In rapid-fire succession, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> posted a slew of videos, images and statements to his Truth Social account over the course of an hour on Wednesday evening. The posts covered a gamut of topics – from his desire to test nuclear weapons to celebrating the anniversary of the presidential election to hawking several pro-MAGA books.</p> 
  <p>He even covered one of his favorite topics, criticizing <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, while touting Walmart deals for Thanksgiving.</p> 
  <p>“Walmart just announced that Prices for a Thanksgiving Dinner is now down 25% since under Sleepy/Crooked Joe Biden, in 2024. AFFORDABILITY is a Republican Stronghold. Hopefully, Republicans will use this irrefutable fact!” Trump posted.</p> 
  <p>Some of the photos and videos appeared to be altered by artificial intelligence. One <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115499692369427170">photo</a> of Trump and <strong>JD Vance</strong>, which reads “1 year since elected”, shows the two men with unnaturally waxen skin. Fireworks shoot off in the background and Trump’s teeth are a gleaming white. Other videos seem to be ads for the president, looking back at his past as a young real estate developer and surviving the assassination attempt.</p> 
  <p>“MY FELLOW AMERICANS, OUR MOVEMENT IS FAR FROM OVER–IN FACT, OUR FIGHT HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN!” reads the post pinned to the top of Trump’s account.</p> 
  <p>The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment, but did send an auto reply saying it’s experiencing staff shortages because of the “Democrat Shutdown” and “as you await a response, please remember this could have been avoided if the Democrats voted for the clean Continuing Resolution to keep the government open”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Federal judge orders immigration facility in Chicago to improve its conditions</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Robert Gettleman</strong> issued a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/943713376/Broadview-TRO">temporary restraining order</a> requiring federal authorities to provide sanitary conditions at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Wednesday. The facility is in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago, and has been the site of anti-ICE protests.</p> 
  <p>The judge’s order came after detainees sued the facility saying they have been kept in “inhumane” and crowded conditions and forced to sleep on the floor or in plastic chairs. The detainees also said that the toilets overflowed with human waste, which seeped into the areas where people had to sleep.</p> 
  <p>The judge said that he found the evidence highly credible and ordered ICE to provide detainees with clean bedding and toilet facilities. He also said that detainees must be allowed to shower every day and have three full meals with a bottle of water. Additionally, they are to be supplied with adequate soap, toilet paper and other hygiene products.</p> 
  <p>The temporary restraining order is to remain in effect until 19 November, when there will be another hearing on the case.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Oval Office appears to be getting Mar-a-Lago-style gilded lettering</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Oval Office looks to be getting its own gilded sign, in the vein of Mar-a-Lago.</strong> A mock-up of a sign reading “The Oval Office” in cursive golden lettering appeared taped on the outside of the White House. It was first noticed by reporters and photographers on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>This appears to be the latest move in the makeover of the White House by <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, who is known to add gilded flourish to his hotels and clubs. And it comes on the heels of the rapid demolition of the East Wing. Trump’s renderings for his upcoming ballroom, which will supposedly be built where the East Wing once stood, are full of golden embellishments.</p> 
  <p>The Oval Office sign made the rounds on social media with <a href="https://x.com/MarioNicolaiEsq/status/1986085862699143333">some joking</a> that such a label helps people with dementia and others <a href="https://x.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1986134569381470467">saying</a> it would make Marie Antoinette say: “Tone it down”. California governor Gavin Newsom even took a poke at it, <a href="https://x.com/GovPressOffice/status/1986154749247545406">posting an edited photo on X</a> that changed the wording of the sign to “Live Laugh Lose”.</p>

  <p><strong>The Federal Aviation Administration said it’s planning to cut 10% of flights at major airports if a deal isn’t reached on the government shutdown.</strong> Transportation secretary <strong>Sean Duffy</strong> made the threat at a news conference on Wednesday, saying the reduction in flights could come as soon as Friday.</p> 
  <p>“As we start to implement this drawdown in service, it will be restricted to these 40 high volume traffic markets,” FAA administrator <strong>Bryan Bedford</strong> said, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/05/us/airport-traffic-cuts-government-shutdown">according to CNN</a>. “We’re going to ask the airlines to work with us collaboratively to reduce their schedules.”</p> 
  <p>Bedford didn’t offer details on which states and cities those 40 airports are located in, but said that the drawdown will be “prescriptive” and “surgical”.</p> 
  <p>During the historic 36 days of the government shutdown, airports have seen air traffic control staffing shortages and delays in flights. Those employees must work during the shutdown, but aren’t paid until it’s over. CNN estimates that more than 400 staffing shortages have been reported at FAA facilities since the shutdown began, which is more than four times than in the same days last year.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Democrats take a victory lap after the party notches coast-to-coast wins</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Ken Martin</strong>, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, held a call with reporters on Wednesday, declaring: “Make no mistake, the Democratic party is back.</p> 
  <p>“The Democratic Party is all gas, no brakes,” Martin added.</p> 
  <p>“We made it clear we don’t want gilded ballrooms. We want lower healthcare costs,” he said. “We don’t want marble bathrooms. We want lower energy bills. We don’t want Great Gatsby parties. We want kids to be able to eat dinner every night.”</p> 
  <p>Martin credited the candidates with a relentless focus on affordability issues – from <strong>Zohran Mamdani</strong>’s freeze on rent in New York City to <strong>Mikie Sherrill</strong>’s day-one state of emergency on utility costs in New Jersey.</p> 
  <p>He also touted the party’s inroads with young people, and particularly young men, a demographic group Democrats have struggled with. It was his hope that the resounding victory on California’s redistricting measure creates a “chilling effect” on Republican states weighing gerrymanders at Trump’s request.</p> 
  <p>“This is not your grandfather’s Democratic party. We will meet you in every single state that you decide to try to steal more seats,” he said.</p>

  <p><strong>Tuesday’s election results point to voter discontent with Donald Trump, according to a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-california-new-jersey-virginia-new-york-e9c7f72bde65f01ef3378a03de48428c">new poll by the Associated Press</a>.</strong> The news organization surveyed more than 17,000 voters in states that held elections this week and found most disapproved of Trump’s performance as president.</p> 
  <p>In Virginia and New Jersey, slightly less than half of voters said Trump was a factor in their voting. But the majority of those who did cite the president as a factor said their vote was to oppose him – four in 10 voters. Similar patterns were seen in New York City and California.</p> 
  <p>Republicans mostly said Trump wasn’t a factor in their vote, despite saying they approve of his job performance. In California, only one in 10 voters said they were voting to support Trump.</p> 
  <p>Immigration was a hot-button issue for many voters who said Trump’s aggressive approach had “gone too far”. This was most starkly seen in New York City and California, where about six in 10 voters said their state shouldn’t cooperate with the White House on immigration enforcement.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Maine representative Jared Golden announces he won't seek re-election, leaving Democrats vulnerable</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Jared Golden</strong>, the Maine Democratic representative, announced today that he won’t seek re-election to Congress in 2025.</p> 
  <p>“I have grown tired of the increasing incivility and plain nastiness that are now common from some elements of our American community – behavior that, too often, our political leaders exhibit themselves,” the congressman <a href="https://www.bangordailynews.com/2025/11/05/opinion/jared-golden-why-i-wont-seek-reelection-column/">wrote in a column</a> for the Bangor Daily News. “Additionally, recent incidents of political violence have made me reassess the frequent threats against me and my family.”</p> 
  <p>Golden said that while he’s confident he would win if he were to run again, “what has become apparent to me is that I now dread the prospect of winning”, also citing the ongoing government shutdown –&nbsp;now the longest on record – as part of his decision. “The nonstop, hyperbolic accusations and recriminations by both sides reveal just how broken Congress has become,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Golden’s decision to step aside in a district that supported both him and Donald Trump in 2020 and 2024 poses a challenge for Democrats. To keep the seat competitive, they’ll need to find a candidate who can connect with rural voters in a state with a strong libertarian streak.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Republicans in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> on Wednesday filed a federal lawsuit challenging a high-stakes redistricting measure that could help flip up to five congressional seats for Democrats.</strong></p> 
  <p>The suit, filed by Republican assembly member <strong>David Tangipa</strong>, 18 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> voters and the state Republican party, in the US district court for the central district of California <strong>argues that the new maps are unconstitutional because they were drawn to increase the voting power of a particular racial group</strong>. It asks the court to block the new maps from taking effect, at least temporarily.</p> 
  <p>The measure, Proposition 50, was approved by voters on Tuesday evening, in a decisive victory for Democrats. The plan temporarily gives the power to draw congressional districts to the California legislature, allowing it to adopt maps that will help Democrats pick up five seats in the US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">House of Representatives</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Mike Columbo</strong>, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that California Democrats drew the maps to increase the power of Latino voters.</p> 
  <p>While <strong>the supreme court allows states to use race as a factor in drawing political maps</strong>, Columbo argued that the intent was to help minority voters elect the candidates of their choice. In California, he noted, Hispanic voters represent the largest ethnic group.</p> 
  <p>“There is no majority race in California more than Hispanics,” Columbo said. “Hispanics have had fantastic success in electing candidates of their choice. Accordingly, California cannot meet this exception.”</p> 
  <p>Democrats have expressed confidence that the maps would withstand a legal challenge.</p>

  <p>Trump’s address today in Miami is sounding more like a campaign rally, as he responds to the Democratic victories across the country after Tuesday’s election.</p> 
  <p>“Let’s see how a communist does in New York. We’re going to see how that works out. We’ll help them. We want New York to be successful. We’ll help them a little bit,” the president said, after Zohran Mamdani was elected as the city’s youngest, first Muslim mayor.</p>

  <p>The White House had said Donald Trump’s remarks would be addressing his economic agenda and the trade deals he has signed in recent weeks. But it swiftly became a familiar litany of personal insults against political foes, including <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, the California governor <strong>Gavin Newsom</strong>, <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> and <strong>Zohran Mamdani</strong>, the Democrat elected Tuesday as mayor of New York.</p>

  <p>Donald Trump’s speech started off with a lengthy self-congratulation for winning his second term of office exactly one year ago today.</p> 
  <p>“We rescued the economy … we saved our country,” he insisted, before recounting his pre-election photoshoot with a garbage truck, and serving hamburgers in a McDonald’s restaurant.</p> 
  <p>“This is the golden age of America,” he said, touting a slew of recent trade deals with other nations, and insisting they would net $21tn for the US economy in one year. He claimed to have removed 600,000 Americans from food stamp aid, and that 2 million more were working than when he took office.</p> 
  <p>“Prices are coming down very fast,” he said. “We’re going to have a bigger, better, stronger economy than my first four years.”</p>

  <p>“If you want to see what congressional Democrats wish to do to America, just look at the result of yesterday’s election in New York, where their party installed a communist,” Trump said, inciting a series of boos as a result. “Now the Democrats are so extreme that Miami will soon be the refuge for those fleeing communism in New York.”</p> 
  <p>He went on to summarize the situation at large: “The decision facing all Americans could not be more clear – we have a choice between communism and common sense.”</p>

  <p>Mamdani’s message can be replicated around the country, Piker said, despite the contention from some that the democratic socialist’s platform would be too radical for other parts of the country.</p> 
  <p>“This is probably the 700th time saying this, and not just about Zohran in general, not even just last night. This is the message of my entire political advocacy. This is the message of my entire political career as a commentator, as someone who works with organizers and activists,” Piker said.</p> 
  <p>“Yes, <strong>Zohran’s message is universal</strong>. <strong>It is applicable</strong>, and I think <strong>as long as you localize it to address the ailments that people feel, the issues that people feel in whatever locality, </strong>in whatever state that you are running for, as long as you <strong>center working-class struggles and affordability at the heart of your campaign</strong>, you will definitely win.”</p>

  <p>Away from the supreme court for a moment, my colleague <strong>Richard Luscombe</strong> reports that we might hear more of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s thoughts about Tuesday’s election results shortly when he addresses the America Business Forum in Miami.</p> 
  <p>The president is the headline speaker at the two-day conference, which brings together influencers and leaders from the worlds of politics, business and sports.</p> 
  <p>According to White House officials, he will focus his remarks on economics, especially a number of trade deals he has taken credit for brokering around the globe. But Trump is known to veer off script, so we’ll be listening for any further commentary about the disappointing night for Republicans.</p> 
  <p>Earlier today, the conference heard via a video link from Venezuelan opposition leader and democracy activist Maria Corina Machado, the winner last month of the Nobel peace prize that the president had coveted.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/03/trump-us-venezuela-maduro-doubts-war">recent aggressive stance</a> towards Venezuela and its president, Nicolás Maduro, which has included military strikes on multiple alleged drugs trafficking vessels, was “correct”, she said: “[Maduro] is not a legitimate head of state, he is head of a narco-terrorist structure. You need to cut those cash flows and that’s precisely what President Trump is doing to protect millions of lives. Maduro started this war and President Trump is ending that war.”</p> 
  <p>Other conference speakers include soccer star Lionel Messi; Argentina’s president, Javier Melei; Trump’s Middle East envoy and adviser Steve Witkoff; and the Amazon and Blue Origin founder, Jeff Bezos.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s address is scheduled for 1pm ET. We’ll bring you anything noteworthy.</p>

  <p>It’s worth noting that even conservative justices sound doubtful of the strength of the Trump administration’s position on the legality of its tariffs. “The vehicle is the imposition of taxes on Americans, and that has always been a core power of Congress,” said Chief Justice <strong>John Roberts</strong>.</p> 
  <p>After <strong>D</strong><strong> John Sauer</strong> argued that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, enabled Trump to impose sweeping tariffs, Justice <strong>Brett Kavanaugh</strong> said: “One problem you have is that presidents since IEEPA have not done this.”</p>

  <p>If you’re listening to the arguments, you will have heard the term “major questions doctrine” come up a few times.

  <p>Because the IEEPA doesn’t include specific terms like “tariffs” or “duties”, justices today have taken issue with the Trump administration’s argument today. Chief Justice Roberts questioned why the solicitor general doesn’t think the doctrine applies in this case.</p> 
  <p>Justice Gorsuch pushed Sauer even further, warning that the tariffs in this case could be “a one-way ratchet toward the gradual but continual accretion of power in the executive branch and away from the people’s elected representatives”.</p>

  <p>So far, some justices have expressed skepticism over the law – <strong>known as the IEEPA</strong> – that the president used to slap steep duties on almost every US trading partner.</p> 
  <p><strong>D</strong><strong> John Sauer</strong>, the solicitor general defending the Trump administration in the case, has argued that these duties amount to “regulatory tariffs, not revenue-raising tariffs”. He said: “We don’t contend that what’s being exercised here is the power to tax.”</p> 
  <p>“I just don’t understand this argument,” said Justice <strong>Sonia Sotomayor</strong>. “You want to say tariffs are not taxes, but that’s exactly what they are.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Liberal justices push Trump administration on justification for tariffs</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Solicitor general Sauer is getting pushed now by liberal justices <strong>Sonia Sotomayor </strong>and <strong>Ketanji Brown Jackson</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Jackson particularly took umbrage with Sauer’s argument that the Trump is able to enact tariffs to “regulate foreign powers”, despite the fact that Congress passed the IEEPA to limit the president’s authority.</p> 
  <p>“My point is that Congress enacted this legislation with the intent of preventing the president from having unlimited powers in this area,” Jackson said. “And you’re asking us to now interpret that statute consistent with an understanding that Congress wanted to allow the president to do pretty much whatever he wanted in this area.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The supreme court has started to hear oral arguments for and against the legality of most of Donald Trump’s tariffs. “One would expect Congress to confer major powers on the president,” said <strong>​D. John Sauer</strong>, solicitor general.</p> 
  <p>A reminder that the Trump​ administration cited the <strong>International Emergency Economic Powers Act</strong> (IEEPA), a 1977 law which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency, as he slapped steep duties on imports into the US.</p> 
  <p>The supreme court – controlled by a rightwing supermajority that was crafted by Trump – will review whether the IEEPA grants the president the authority to levy a tariff, a word not mentioned in the law. Congress is granted sole authority under the constitution to levy taxes.</p> 
  <p>The court has until the end of its term, in July 2026, to issue a ruling on the case.</p>

  <p><strong>Chuck Schumer</strong>, the top Democrat in the Senate, and <strong>Hakeem Jeffries</strong>, the House minority leader, both extended congratulations to Zohran Mamdani on winning the New York mayoral election. Notably, both lawmakers represent the Empire state.</p>

  <p>“We have worked together on a number of vital issues – like delivering historic debt relief for taxi drivers. I look forward to building on that partnership to keep NYC strong, fair, more affordable and thriving,” he added.</p> 
  <p>The Senate minority leader also called the wider sweep of Democratic successes across the country a “repudiation of the Trump agenda”.</p>

  <p><strong>Donald Trump has continued his relentless criticism of the filibuster –&nbsp;the 60-vote threshold needed to end debate on legislation and bring a bill to the floor for a vote.</strong></p> 
  <p>In recent days, the president has posted up a storm on social media, urging Republican lawmakers to abolish the procedural maneuver (which they have described as an important legislative safeguard) on the grounds that Democrats would do the same, and would use it to advance their own agenda if they were given the opportunity. “They’re going to pack the court, they’re going to make DC a state, and they’re going to make Puerto Rico a state,” Trump said.</p> 
  <p>Despite explicit reticence from GOP leaders on Capitol Hill, the president pushed the virtues of a filibuster-free Congress today.</p> 
  <p>“We have to get the country going. We will pass legislation at levels you’ve never seen before, and it will be impossible to beat us,” he said. “They’ll [Democrats] most likely never attain power, because we will have passed every single thing that you can imagine.”</p>

New Yorkers celebrated his monumental election at official and unofficial parties spread across the five boroughs.</p> 
  <p><em>My colleagues Sam Wolfson, Alaina Demopoulos and Saam Niami were at various scenes:</em></p> 
  <p>At a Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) party in Brooklyn, supporters erupted shortly after the race was called at 9.30pm. The DJ immediately started playing I Gotta Feeling by Black Eyed Peas. Tonight <em>was</em> a good, good night for those in the room, who erupted in tears, hugs and twerking.</p> 
  <p>“This just shows that our politics are not radical, that New Yorkers actually think what we believe is sensible, and maybe the rest of the country is ready for sensible, commonsense, Democratic socialism,” said 40-year-old health department worker Will, a DSA member for years.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is the first time we’ve had hope in so long.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>These are the people who fought for Mamdani when he was polling at 1%, who celebrated his socialist principles when others said they disqualified him.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile hundreds queued up on the sidewalk outside another DSA watch party, cheering and holding signs, and, in the case of one woman, a cardboard cutout of Mamdani.</p> 
  <p><strong>The crowd was a genuine mix: Black, white, brown, young folks and old folks, party gays, butch lesbians, bridge-and-tunnel kids who couldn’t even vote in the election but felt its reverberations nonetheless.</strong></p> 
  <p>Amber Pease, 25, lives in Nassau county in Long Island. Her inability to cast a vote didn’t stop her from traveling in to volunteer for Zohran’s campaign. She wants to get a job and move into the city soon.</p>

  <p>It was a campaign that made Mamdani a global sensation and invigorated many New Yorkers like never before, attracting almost 100,000 volunteers. Mamdani rejuvenated the left beyond New York’s borders, encouraging other progressives to run for office across the US, and could yet influence the Democratic party ahead of next year’s midterm elections.</p> 
  <p>The flip side, however, is clear: the residents of New York have had their hopes set incredibly high, and now Mamdani has to deliver.</p>

  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Zohran Mamdani </strong>is the mayor-elect of New York City with a commanding victory over former governor Andrew Cuomo. With more than 97% of the votes counted, the 34-year-old received more votes – at least 1.03 million – than all the other candidates combined, including Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Democrats also won two key state governor races with <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/04/nyc-mayor-election-zohran-mamdani-andrew-cuomo-results-latest?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-690aa7418f08fa7fae305dfb#block-690aa7418f08fa7fae305dfb">Abigail Spanberger</a></strong> triumphing in Virginia and <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/04/nyc-mayor-election-zohran-mamdani-andrew-cuomo-results-latest?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-690ab6008f089a1496315839#block-690ab6008f089a1496315839">Mikie Sherrill</a></strong> in New Jersey.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>California <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/04/california-prop-50-voting-result">passed Proposition 50</a>,</strong> a measure which will temporarily redistrict the state in hopes of countering Republican efforts to do the same in Texas. The new maps could help Democrats pick up five additional seats in the US House of Representatives.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>President Donald Trump</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/04/nyc-mayor-election-zohran-mamdani-andrew-cuomo-results-latest?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-690ac3608f08fa7fae305eca#block-690ac3608f08fa7fae305eca">distanced himself from the losses</a>, suggesting on social media that the Republican defeats were due to the government shutdown and because his own name was not on the ballot.</p></li> 
   <li><p>As Mamdani delivered his victory speech, the president also posted a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/nov/04/nyc-mayor-election-zohran-mamdani-andrew-cuomo-results-latest?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-690ad8038f089a1496315910#block-690ad8038f089a1496315910">cryptic</a> missive: “<strong>AND SO IT BEGINS!”.</strong></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Mamdani directly challenged Trump</strong> in his victory speech in Brooklyn, vowing to use his role to counter his politics of division. “Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you: <strong>turn the volume up.</strong>”</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Dawn of a leftist mayor</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning – it is the dawn of a new era in New York City where many are celebrating after a decisive mayoral race victory for Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani.</p> 
  <p>Mamdani is the city’s first Muslim mayor and at 34, the youngest to serve in more than a century.</p> 
  <p>In an exultant speech at his victory party last night, Mamdani took it to Trump directly, saying he knew the Republican president was watching.</p> 
  <p>“If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him. And if there is any way to terrify a despot, it is by dismantling the very conditions that allowed him to accumulate power.”</p> 
  <p>“In this moment of political darkness, New York will be the light.”</p> 
  <p>Let’s get into it.</p>
