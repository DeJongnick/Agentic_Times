And because everybody is really, really concerned about what’s happening in Palestine every single day, it really kind of pales in significance,” she said.</p> <p>“I’m a filmmaker, there’s teachers here, there’s a bus driver, like we’re just ordinary people that have been forced by our governments in action to do this. We’re not radicals… we’ve got baby food and medicine. So it’s just a real blight on our world leaders that we’ve been forced to do this.”</p> <p>Surya McEwen, another Australian on board, said many in the flotilla have done extensive non-violence training and are prepared if their ships are intercepted.</p> <p>“We’re trying to be as calm and as organised and as careful as we possibly can to make it the least dangerous scenario as it could possibly be,” said McEwen.</p> <p>“We’re very experienced in de-escalation and communicating in ways that are non-threatening… but we’re resolved to keep going to Gaza, if there’s any way to do so without being attacked.”The Australian government has also made representations to nations including Spain, Italy and Greece for their support for Australians on board.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/01/gaza-aid-flotilla-sumud-update-location-tracker-greta-thunberg-israel-blockade">Italy announced it would stop tracking the flotilla</a> with a military vessel, and urged flotilla members to accept a compromise proposal to drop aid in a Cyprus port and avoid a confrontation with Israeli forces.</p> <p>The government has urged Australians who want to deliver aid to do so through official channels.</p> <p>“We understand people are distressed and want to respond to the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza – we also want to see critical aid being delivered,” said Thistlethwaite. “However, we are very concerned about the safety of these people, including Australians.”</p> <p>In August, two Australians on board a separate flotilla mission arrived back in Australia after being detained by Israeli forces.</p> <p>They told media upon their arrival that they were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/01/gaza-freedom-flotilla-aid-boat-vessel-australian-activists-allege-idf-israel-brutalised-psychologically-ntwnfb">“brutalised psychologically in every way”</a>.</p> <p>The government said it stands ready to provide consular assistance to any affected Australians, and continues to call on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza.</p> <p>“Australia is part of the international call on Israel to immediately enable the full resumption of aid into Gaza,” said Thistlethwaite.</p> <p>“We have been clear that Israel must comply with the binding orders of the international court of justice, including to ensure the unhindered provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance at scale.”</p> <p>The Israeli embassy said it could not yet provide a statement on the latest developments.</p>
