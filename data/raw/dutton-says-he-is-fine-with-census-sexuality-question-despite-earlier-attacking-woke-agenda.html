<p>Peter Dutton has said he is “fine” with gender and sexuality questions being in the census despite earlier attacking Labor for having a “woke agenda”.</p> <p>The opposition leader said the government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/30/anthony-albanese-lgbtq-census-sexuality-question-australia-abs">partial backflip on the questions</a> was “weak leadership” and demonstrated a loss of control over the national agenda. Asked specifically about counting “LGBT Australians” in the census, Dutton said he was “fine with that, if the prime minister’s got a proposal”.</p> <p>“It requires legislation. He’s had no discussion with us,” Dutton said. </p> <p>“The prime minister has a job to lead, and at the moment, as Australians can see, we’ve got a weak prime minister who doesn’t know what he believes in.”</p> <p>On Thursday Dutton had advocated for maintaining “the set of questions we’ve got at the moment” which “stood us well as a country”. </p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/article/2024/aug/14/breaking-news-alerts-australia-guardian-email-newsletter?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>“If you’ve got the woke agenda, which I think is at odds with the vast majority of Australians, then the prime minister should argue that case, but I think we’re pretty happy with the settings that we’ve got in place at the moment,” Dutton said.</p> <p>Late on Friday, prominent LGBTQI+ campaigner and Labor senator Louise Pratt welcomed the prime minister’s rethink on the census.</p> <p>“As LGBTIQ+ Australians, we want to know we count,” Pratt said in a statement.</p> <p>“I thank my colleagues that have stood up and responded to the concerns of the community and the people they represent.”</p> <p>Pratt said census questions had contained wording that made it hard for some people to answer accurately or forced them to lie.</p> <p>“The 2021 census was frankly difficult to complete truthfully for LGBTIQ+ Australians, as it didn’t provide options which accurately represent who we are… Better data equals better policy outcomes. It is in everyone’s interest that we collect census data which represents all Australians.”</p> <p>Senior Albanese government frontbenchers had originally defended the scrapping of the proposed questions as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/29/anna-cody-labor-census-sexuality-gender-lgbtiq">avoiding a “divisive” debate</a> in the community.
