<p>Nikki Giovanni, bestselling American poet and civil rights activist, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/feb/24/at-80-i-still-have-a-lot-of-anger-american-poet-nikki-giovanni">blazed on to the scene in the 1960s</a>. In this documentary, completed before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/dec/10/nikki-giovanni-acclaimed-poet-of-the-black-arts-movement-dies-aged-81">she died in December</a>, we watch Giovanni in her late 70s, reigning over sold-out public appearances. On stage she recites poems about love, race and gender and in between, with the timing of a standup comedian, she has the auditorium erupting in whoops and laughter. Posing for selfies, a woman tells Giovanni she named her daughter after her; another says she wrote to her on the verge of dropping out of college. “You wrote back. I’m a teacher now!”</p> <p>In archive footage, Giovanni as a young woman, reads her 1968 poem Nikki-Rosa, which has a line about how white people fail to understand the lives of black people: “they’ll probably talk about my hard childhood / and never understand that / all the while I was quite happy”. Giovanni was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, during segregation and, after witnessing domestic violence at home, she went to live with her grandparents. Speaking in a radio interview she is blunt: “Either I was going to kill him” – she’s talking about her father – “or I was going to move.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyb3NV1U9SA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kyb3NV1U9SA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Filmed at home with her long-term partner Virginia, Giovanni comes across with tenderness. For fans she has all the time in the world, endlessly smiling for selfies. But clearly she was not a woman to suffer fools; as a documentary subject she is firm with her boundaries, refusing to budge on areas that she deems off-limits – that includes challenges in her childhood and the death of Martin Luther King.</p> <p>Her poems, read by Giovanni herself and the actor Taraji P Henson, made the hairs on the back of my neck prickle. There are snippets too from a conversation – televised in 1971 – between Giovanni, still in her 20s, and the writer James Baldwin. Two utterly original and brilliant thinkers, a flicker of recognition sparks between them that here is someone on their level, a match for their fierce intellect. It’s electric.</p> <p>• Going to Mars: The Nikki Giovanni Project is at Bertha DocHouse from 21 March </p>
