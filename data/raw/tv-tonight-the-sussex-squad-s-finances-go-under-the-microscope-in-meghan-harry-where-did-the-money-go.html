<h2><strong>Meghan &amp; Harry: Where Did the Money Go? </strong></h2> <p><strong>8.30pm, Channel 5 <br></strong>The Sussex Squad may have largely disappeared from British public life, but they still seem to arouse tabloid fury. Hence, this unnecessary documentary on the exiled couple’s financial affairs. The sources of their wealth don’t seem too mysterious: inheritance, a massive Netflix deal and a payout from the publishers representing the Sun newspaper won’t have hurt. But clearly it’s time for another stir of the pot. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>The Chase: Celebrity Special</h2> <p><strong>6.30pm, ITV1<br></strong>What do dancer AJ Pritchard, athlete Hollie Arnold, actor Giovanna Fletcher and singer Russell Watson have in common? They all made it out of the I’m a Celebrity jungle with energy to spare, and are now raring to go up against the ruthless Chasers. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2><strong>Blankety Blank</strong></h2> <p><strong>8.10pm, BBC One <br></strong>Kelly Holmes, Steph McGovern,Omid Djalili and Lucy Beaumont are among the panellists for the quiz that delights in its own naffness. The contestants include Sonny, a “cow-obsessed” children’s illustrator, and Nathanael, a rugby coach with a prosthetic leg. Bradley Walsh presents. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2><strong>40 Hits of 1985 at the BBC</strong></h2> <p><strong>8.10pm, BBC Two </strong></p>    <p>It was the year of Live Aid, shoulder pads and power ballads. But even if 1985 feels like a fallow time – punk had fizzled out but the next wave (dance music and hip-hop) had yet to arrive – there was still plenty going on. Expect bangers from the thematically named likes of Queen, King, Prince and Princess. <em>PH</em></p> <h2><strong>Nasa, Nazis &amp; the Space Race</strong></h2> <p><strong>8.35pm, Channel 4<br></strong>Operation Paperclip is not that well known, and there’s probably a good reason for that. It involved more than 1,600 Nazi scientists receiving pardons before being brought to the US and enlisted into the service of Nasa, who were then engaged in the space race. This documentary explores a shameful episode for American science. <em>PH</em></p> <h2><strong>The Last Anniversary</strong></h2> <p><strong>9.35pm, BBC One<br></strong>If not quite as addictive as Big Little Lies, this Aussie adaptation of another Liane Moriarty bestseller has still been an engrossing ride. The penultimate episode sees incomer Sophie continuing to chip away at the mystery that put Scribbly Gum Island on the map, while Margie learns that Ron has been hiding more than his Just for Men bottle. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Echo Valley (Michael Pearce, 2025), Apple TV+</strong></p>    <p>Coming from the writer of Mare of Easttown, Brad Inglesby, it should be no surprise that this satisfying thriller has a strong middle-aged woman at its heart. Julianne Moore plays Kate, who runs a struggling horse-riding centre and is grieving her dead wife. Then her desperate junkie daughter Claire (Sydney Sweeney) turns up asking for money – again – and Kate is reluctantly drawn into a world of drug deals, double-crosses and death. Michael Pearce, director of the edgy Jessie Buckley mystery Beast, is great at withholding information for maximum dramatic effect while posing the moral question: how far would you go to protect your child? The fun here is working out your own answer. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <p><strong>The Magnificent Seven (John Sturges, 1960), 1.55pm, BBC Two<br></strong>This sturdy, star-riddled 1960 John Sturges western is an adaptation of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai – which was itself influenced by John Ford and other masters of the genre. Yul Brynner takes the lead role of the experienced gunslinger who cobbles together a ragtag band of mostly American shooters (Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn) to protect a Mexican village from bandits. Initially only in it for the money, the vigilantes end up befriending the locals and finding common cause. Nicely rounded characters give depth to the shoot-em-ups. <em>SW</em> </p> <p><strong>Kidnapped (Marco Bellocchio, 2023), 9pm, BBC Four<br></strong>In 1858 in Bologna, a city state under papal rule, a young Jewish boy, Edgardo (Enea Sala), is taken away by priests. They claim he has been baptised and so must be raised a Christian in Rome. Marco Bellocchio’s period drama is a tragic true story of religious intolerance and a family ripped apart, but it is also an origin story of the secular Italian nation. So we follow one father, Salomone (Fausto Russo Alesi), fearing his impressionable son is slipping away from him, while <em>il pape</em>, Pius IX (Paolo Pierobon), sees his God-given power over his flock collapsing. <em>SW</em></p> <h2><strong>Live sport</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tennis: Queen’s, 1.25pm, BBC One<br></strong>The singles semi-finals. </p> <p><strong>Premiership Rugby Union: Bath Rugby v Leicester Tigers, 1.30pm, TNT Sports 1; 2.30pm, ITV1<br></strong>Leicester and England greats Ben Youngs and Dan Cole (pictured above) play their last rugby match in the league final at Twickenham.</p> <p><strong>Golf: US Open, 4pm, Sky Sports Main Event<br></strong>Day three of the major at Oakmont. </p> <p><strong>Fifa Club World Cup Football: Al Ahly v Inter Miami, midnight, Channel 5<br></strong>The opening match in Miami.</p>
