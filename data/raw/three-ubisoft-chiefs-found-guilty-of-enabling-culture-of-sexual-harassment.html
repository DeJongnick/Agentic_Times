He was given a three-year suspended prison sentence and fined €30,000 (£26,000).</p> <p>The court heard how he once tied a female member of staff to a chair with tape, pushed the chair into a lift and pressed a button at random. He was also accused of forcing one woman wearing a skirt to do handstands.</p> <p>She told the court: “He was my superior and I was afraid of him. He made me do handstands. I did it to get it over with and get rid of him.”</p>    <p>At a 2015 office Christmas party with a Back to the Future theme, François allegedly told a member of staff that he liked her 1950s dress. He then allegedly stepped towards her to kiss her on the mouth as his colleagues restrained her by the arms and back.
