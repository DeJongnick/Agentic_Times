Rather than rethinking these commitments, ramping up spending further has been taken as given. This is is a strategy for BAE Systems’ shareholders, not genuine security.

The US is making a strategic mistake in dismantling USAID: the UK should not fall into the same trap.</p> <p>“With defence spending set to rise beyond 2.5 per cent, and other pressures on public services growing, further spending cuts will not be a viable strategy in the future. The world has changed since Labour took office.

An extra 0.2% of GDP is around £6 billion, and this is the size of the cut to the aid budget. Yet he trumpeted a £13 billion increase in defence spending.</p> <p>It’s hard to be certain without more detail from the Treasury, but this figure only seems to make sense if one thinks the defence budget would otherwise have been frozen in cash terms.

They simply will not be able to afford higher energy prices and will cut back usage further, at significant risk to their own health.</p> <p>If the government, industry regulators and energy providers can’t stop this seemingly inexorable rise in the cost of energy, then we urgently need to see more support offered to help reduce people’s energy usage.</p> <p>Home improvement services are vital to improving homes for millions of people, we need adequately funded, comprehensive support for people to maintain, repair and adapt their homes across the country.</p> <p>By acting now to ensure that everyone has the same access to a national network of one-stop shops for home improvement, we can ensure that safe, suitable, and energy-efficient homes are not a privilege but a basic right for all.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Independent Age </strong>chief executive, <strong>Joanna Elson CBE</strong>, is urging the government to widen elibility for the Winter Fuel Payment, which it means-tested last summer:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Today’s price cap announcement is more bad news for the older people in poverty that have already been subjected to a brutally long and cold winter. We now know that energy prices will rise again by 6%, from an average of £1,738 to £1,849. People in later life on low fixed incomes have stretched their budgets to breaking point during the colder months, and many tell us they don’t have enough money to turn the heating on full stop. Now, their bills rise yet again to amounts they simply cannot afford.</p> <p>“History cannot be allowed to repeat itself next winter. The UK Government needs to put in place plans that support older people in financial hardship to turn their heating on. Since the changes to Winter Fuel Payment were made in July, our helpline has seen a massive increase in calls regarding the payment, and many of the people we have spoken to have made drastic cutbacks, such as only living in one room and cutting down on food.</p> <p>Far too many older people on low incomes don’t receive Pension Credit and are now falling through the cracks – in the short term, the UK Government should urgently review and widen the financial threshold of the Winter Fuel Payment. </p> </blockquote> <p>Dame<strong> Clare Moriarty, </strong>chief executive of<strong> Citizens Advice, </strong>reports that the number of people living in a household in debt to their energy supplier has reached a new high of nearly seven million. </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“We’re particularly concerned about households with children, where over one in three struggle to afford bills, rising to more than half of those on low incomes. </p> <p>“The government can’t let another winter go by without targeted support for those most in need, and there is a way of paying for this.

However, the reality is, our gas-led wholesale power market and reliance on international imports limits the impact of what any government policy can have - at least in the short-term - there is only so much you can do when prices are rising across the world.</p> <p>“That’s not to say the government and the regulator are without options to help lower consumer bills. Ofgem has ongoing consultations looking at the non-wholesale costs included in the cap, and of course the government has levers it can pull from social tariffs to support payments. </p> <p>We are also seeing initial considerations on structural changes to the cap, with Ofgem’s consultation on a zero standing charge variant announced last week. However, many would argue all of this is merely tinkering with what is - at least for bill payers - a fundamentally broken system.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67bd6e178f08f637c97481e8" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-02-25T07:22:11.767Z">7.22am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Unilever CEO Hein Schumacher to step down</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Newsflash: Consumer goods maker Unilever has surprised the City by announcing the departure of its CEO, Hein Schumacher.</strong></p> <p><strong>Schumacher</strong> is leaving <strong>Unilever</strong>, which owns Marmite, Dove and Ben &amp; Jerry’s, having only taken control of the company 19 months ago, in July 2023.</p> <p><strong>Unilever</strong> says he is departing “by mutual agreement” and will leave the company on 31 May 2025.</p> <p>He is being replaced by <strong>Unilever’s</strong> chief financial officer, <strong>Fernando</strong> <strong>Fernandez</strong>.</p> <p>Schumacher had been implementing a “growth action plan”, and Unilever’s board indicaate they want <strong>Fernandez </strong>to accelerate it – a hint that <strong>Schumacher </strong>wasn’t making changes quickly enough?</p> <p><strong>Unilever</strong> chairman <strong>Ian</strong> <strong>Meakins</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Hein for resetting Unilever’s strategy, for the focus and discipline he has brought to the company and for the solid financial progress delivered during 2024.
