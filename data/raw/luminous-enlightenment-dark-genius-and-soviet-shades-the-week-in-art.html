From Caravaggio’s intense scenes to Rembrandt’s profound portraits, artists had been experimenting with darkness for centuries. This painting shows how deeply Dutch 17th-century artists were drawn to the dark. It dwells in the darkest part of the church, brooding among shadows. At the sides, we can see the church’s public spaces are brightly lit, presumably with many candles. But in the dark, less visited part, fears and phantoms might dwell. In a great <a href="https://www.online-literature.com/lefanu/1780/">horror story by Sheridan Le Fanu</a>, the similarly dark paintings of Gottfried Schalken turn out to contain a terrifying secret. Perhaps this painting holds a horror story of its own, for a tomb in it bears the name of Hendrick van Steenwyck the Younger – but the canvas is signed by him too. Did he paint it posthumously? A more boring explanation is that it’s by an imitator.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/imitator-of-hendrick-van-steenwyck-the-younger-interior-of-a-church-at-night">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in </strong><strong>touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
