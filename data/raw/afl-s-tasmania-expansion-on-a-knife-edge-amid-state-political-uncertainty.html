<p>The AFL’s expansion into Tasmania is on a knife edge as the state’s politicians consider a move to oust premier Jeremy Rockliff, which could trigger a state election and potentially torpedo the Devils’ plans to join the league.</p> <p>The Devils on Wednesday said the political uncertainty was cause for “great concern” and presented “a serious risk … for the future of Tasmania Football Club”.</p> <p>The club, which has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/20/tasmania-devils-afl-team-memberships">already attracted 210,000 members</a>, is due to enter the competition in 2028 under an agreement with the AFL, and move into the newly complete venue on the Hobart waterfront the following year.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/19/tasmania-devils-afl-mascot-rumun">Ferocious, cheeky or ‘nightmare fuel’?
