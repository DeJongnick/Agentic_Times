<p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City and adviser to Donald Trump, has been disbarred in New York for making false statements about the results of the 2020 election.</p> <p>A New York appeals court made the decision on Tuesday.</p> <p>A panel of judges ruled that Giuliani would be “disbarred from the practice of law, effective immediately, and until the further order of this Court, and his name stricken from the roll of attorneys and counselors-at-law in the State of New York”, the Associated Press reported.</p> <p>The decision comes after Giuliani already had his New York law license suspended for making false statements after the 2020 election.</p> <p>In May, Giuliani was also suspended by New York radio station WABC for using his show to declare that Trump had lost the 2020 presidential election because of supposed electoral fraud.</p> <p>In an interview with<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/10/nyregion/giuliani-radio-suspended.html"> the New York Times</a>, billionaire John Catsimatidis, the Republican owner of WABC, said that Giuliani had been “warned” to not discuss lies about the 2020 election.</p> <p>“We’re not going to talk about fallacies of the November 2020 election. We warned him once. We warned him twice. And I get a text from him last night, and I get a text from him this morning that he refuses not to talk about it … So he left me no option. I suspended him,” said Catsimatidis.</p> <p>Despite the slew of legal trouble, Giuliani has said he has no regrets for his role in trying to overturn the 2020 election.</p> <p>Last month, after posting bond in the Arizona fake electors case against him, Giuliani said he didn’t regret his actions.</p> <p>“I’m very, very proud of it,” Giuliani said while leaving the state courthouse.</p> <p>Giuliani has plead not guilty to criminal charges for reportedly pressuring Arizona legislators and the Maricopa county board of supervisors to change the state’s 2020 presidential election results. Giuliani also told Arizona Republican electors to vote for Trump.</p>
