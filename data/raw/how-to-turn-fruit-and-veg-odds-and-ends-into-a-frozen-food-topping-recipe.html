<p>While most Instagram food trends prioritise spectacle over substance, the viral frozen tomato idea that I’m employing today delivers genuine culinary value, and solves a common kitchen problem into the bargain. I’m a bit late to the party, admittedly, but it’s a versatile waste-saving technique.</p> <p>Its origin clearly derives from either Hawaiian shaved ice or granita, that classic Italian frozen dessert made by stirring and scraping or grating a sorbet-like base into shavings, and the approach essentially applies granita principles to fresh produce, while at the same time cutting out all of the hassle: simply pop any surplus or past-its-best fruit or vegetables in the freezer until they’re rock solid, then grate! </p> <h2>Frozen fruit and vegetable “granita” with burrata</h2> <p>The freezer is one of the best tools we have for saving waste, so if in doubt, freeze! I especially love the simplicity of this incredibly versatile dish, which can help save on waste by making use of various odds and ends or of wonky fruit and veg at the back of the crisper drawer by simply freezing it for later, then upcycling it into a really special starter. </p> <p>Burrata is the perfect vehicle for the subtlety of this shaved ice. It’s made by stretching a ball of mozzarella into a delicate pouch, and filling it with stracciatella (essentially, strands of mozzarella mixed with cream), and so creating one of the most delicious cheeses known to humankind.</p> <p>One fruit or vegetable is plenty for this, and will stand-alone if you want to create a simple dish, but if you have other ingredients that will work well, by all means go for it. I wanted a Neapolitan-style <em>tricolore</em> granita on my burrata, but ended with more of a Jamaican flag because I had only a green cucumber end, a red beef tomato and a yellow pepper spare. Other good seasonal combinations are beetroot, balsamic and dill, carrot; fennel, aleppo pepper and orange juice; and fig, balsamic and black pepper.</p> <p>This dish is hard to share so serve a whole burrata per person.</p> <p>Serves <strong>1</strong> </p> <p><strong>1 fruit or vegetable</strong> <br><strong>1 burrata<br>Sea salt</strong></p> <p>Optional extras (all to taste)<br><strong>Oil</strong>: extra-virgin olive oil, avocado oil or cold-pressed rapeseed oil<br><strong>Herbs and spices</strong>: basil, oregano, thyme, chilli flakes, sumac, aleppo pepper<br><strong>Acid</strong>: orange or lemon juice, plus the finely grated zest, if the fruit’s organic and unwaxed (especially good with carrot and fennel); or aged balsamic vinegar (thicker balsamic sits better on the granita, rather than melting it).</p> <p>Take your chosen fruit or vegetable and freeze for at least six hours, or overnight, until solid. </p>  <!-- Recipe element -->  <p>When you’re ready to serve, place the burrata on a plate and grate your chosen frozen ingredient directly over the top. Season generously with sea salt, then drizzle with the oil of your choice. Add a sprinkle of herbs or spices and, if you like, a touch of acidity, then serve immediately because the frozen shavings melt <em>very </em>quickly.</p>
