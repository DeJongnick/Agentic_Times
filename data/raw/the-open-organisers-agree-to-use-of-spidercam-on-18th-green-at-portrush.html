<p>The R&amp;A has installed a Spidercam above the 18th green at Portrush for next week’s Open – the first time the technology has been used in golf.</p> <p>The four-point wire-cam system has been suspended above the final hole using four 25-metre-high pylons and will be used to provide spectacular aerial views and unique angles of play, as well as capturing the Open champion’s final walk up the 18th in unprecedented detail.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/08/open-golf-organisers-poised-move-tee-times-amid-concerns-loyalist-parade-disruption">Open organisers poised to move tee times amid concerns of loyalist parade disruption</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The players were briefed on the R&amp;A’s plans on Friday morning. While there were concerns expressed during internal discussions beforehand that some players would be unhappy with the intrusion and the potential for distraction caused by a roving camera during preparations for a shot, it is understood there have been no complaints.</p> <p>Spidercam has been deployed by broadcasters in stadium-based sports such as football, rugby union and cricket for several years, but the logistics and cost involved have prevented it being used in golf. The R&amp;A is understood to be paying the operational costs of about £300,000 for the week at Portrush after a 12-month planning project undertaken in ­collaboration with European Tour Productions, which, in ­conjunction with IMG, is responsible for producing coverage of the Open, the Ryder Cup and the DP World Tour.</p> <p>The Spidercam coverage will be made available to the R&amp;A’s broadcaster partners, including Sky Sports in the UK and NBC in the US, who are both delighted with the innovation. If deemed successful, Spidercam could be used in future tournaments where the logistics allow, although due to the cost, it is unlikely to become a regular feature of golf events. Discussions over whether Spidercam can be used at next year’s Open at Royal Birkdale will take place after the championship.</p>    <p>“It’s not often the Open is the first to do something, as usually innovations are made by the Tours before being introduced by the Majors, so this is really exciting,” the R&amp;A’s head of broadcasting and media rights, Paul Sutcliffe, said. “Portrush is one of the few venues without a clubhouse on the 18th green so that gave us a unique opportunity.</p> <p>“With more space around the green we have been able to install technology. There will be some wires around the green, but the camera will retract to the grandstand before each ­player’s second shot so we’re confident there will be no interference.</p> <p>“2019 was one of the iconic Opens with the emotion of Shane Lowry winning at Portrush and Spidercam will enable viewers to walk with the 2025 champion up the 18th. It’s the greatest walk in golf and should be very special.”</p> <p>Spidercam will complement existing technology, including a plane camera, aerial drones and bunker cameras, to enhance live coverage of the Open.</p> <p>Neil Armit, chief commercial officer at the R&amp;A, said: “We have worked closely with European Tour Productions to invest in cutting-edge broadcast technology and believe that Spidercam will bring millions of fans a new perspective of the action with incredible detail and accessibility wherever they are in the world.</p> <p>Richard Bunn, chief content and revenue officer at the European Tour Group, said: “European Tour Productions has a shared vision with the R&amp;A to use the latest technologies to create a truly immersive experience for the millions of fans watching the global broadcast. With new innovations such as Spidercam being rolled out this year, The 153rd Open will get fans closer tor the action than ever before.”</p> <p>The Open is the longest single broadcast in golf, with 48 hours of live coverage on air over four days from next Thursday.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was updated on 15 July to correct a reference to IMG Media – the company is now known as IMG</p></li> </ul>
