<p>Regarding Dom Pérignon on prescription (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/01/which-states-would-donald-trump-surrender-for-peace-in-his-time">Letters, 1 May</a>), when I was a pharmacist apprentice in the 1960s, we were able to dispense a Brompton cocktail. This was primarily alcohol laced with morphine and cocaine, and was used to alleviate pain and distress in terminally ill patients. It was stored under lock and key. We humble apprentices were permitted to compound it, but only in the eagle-eyed presence of the pharmacist.<br><strong>Chris Osborne</strong><br><em>West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire</em></p> <p>• Re having shoes on or off at home (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2025/apr/30/shoes-on-at-home-or-shoes-off-if-you-care-about-your-health-its-a-no-brainer">Polly Hudson, 30 April</a>), while on holiday in Scandinavia several years go, I noticed that every home I visited had a bag of felt slippers in graduated sizes. They were for guests to use, and were warm and comfortable. I brought some home and hung them up. None of our visitors want to use them and it feels slightly un-British to imply that their feet might be dirty.<br><strong>Duncan Grimmond</strong><br><em>Harrogate, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• Private eye clinics are reportedly making “eye‑watering” profits doing cataracts for the NHS (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/04/profits-from-nhs-england-eye-care-outsourcing-same-as-100-pfi-contracts-research-finds">Profits from NHS England eye care outsourcing same as 100 PFI contracts, research finds, 4 May</a>).

Who knew there was any other way to eat them.<br><strong>Stephen Bassey</strong><br><em>Porthtowan, Cornwall</em></p> <p>• I eat chocolate digestives both ways – depends which end&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;packet I open.<br><strong>Frank Haines</strong><br><em>Devoran, Cornwall</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
