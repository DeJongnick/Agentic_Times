Congratulations to the kickers, well done, good on you, great, you have excelled. It’s not good for Rugby though with three points a kick. I’m not a sore loser, just being realistic. Tries are what rugby is all about. Lineouts and scrums - at least in my day - but nowadays it’s all about penalty kicks. How about a single point for a successful kick?”</p> <p>I absolutely accept the point about the relative value of penalties (the obvious comparison being rugby league where the tariff is only two points) but I would counter that the international game has never been more attacking and that a commitment to try-scoring has never been more evident. </p> <p>The difficulty with it all is how contentious the breakdown has become with different referees from different hemispheres interpreting the contact differently resulting in confusion amongst players and observers. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c50f458f0880bae9c52c5b" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-13T06:30:49.448Z">7.30am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>“How was that last try given?” asks an incredulous Andrew Sparrow. “The most obvious forward pass you’ll ever see.

Australia 7-3 Argentina (Sua'ali'i, 5)</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Another short kick-off ricochets favourably Australia’s way on the left wing, and it’s honoured by strong runs from Valetini and Wilson as the Wallabies gather momentum. Play stalls on Argentina’s 22 after six phases but the halves don’t panic. Edmed picks the right moment to expand and he sets off a move through hands to the right. There appears to be an overlap as Kellaway accepts possession in the right centre position, but instead of looking to his outside he turns the ball back in to Sua’ali’i. The rugby league convert then turns on the afterburners, accepts contact, and drags three Argentinians over the line with him! That was an awesome demonstration of power finishing from the young superstar. What a statement of intent.</p> <p>The touchline conversion from the right by Edmed is beautiful. Australia are back in front.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-13T04:27:37.145Z">at 5.27am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68c4f0ff8f086519d3271355" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-13T04:20:53.593Z">5.20am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Penalty!

Kick-off at Allianz Stadium in Sydney will be sometime around, but not before, 2pm (AEST).</strong></p> <p>The feelgood factor in Australian rugby prevails – just – after last week’s nail-biting victory over Argentina in Townsville. Despite the Pumas leading for 81 minutes of play it was the Wallabies who ran out winners, executing a spirited second-half comeback and holding their nerve at the death, finding the match-winning try after repeatedly declining point-blank shots for goal that would have earned a draw.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/06/australia-wallabies-v-argentina-pumas-rugby-championship-test-match-report">Angus Bell’s last-gasp try seals Wallabies’ dramatic Rugby Championship win over Argentina</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a performance of two halves from the men in gold. The first period was bad old Australia, full of handling errors, indiscipline at the breakdown, and poor kicking options. After a rollicking from the increasingly impressive Joe Schmidt at the break, Australia were transformed at the ruck, the interchange dominated, and confidence began to return.</p> <p>It was another demonstration of the split personality of this Australian group, one full of potential, but still lacking game management nous. The majority of first XV names are aged 26 or under: Max Jorgensen is a star at 21, Joseph Sua’ali’i a worthy marquee at 22, and Angus Bell is a world-leading prop at 24. There remains a gaping hole in the halves, and the constant chopping and changing of 9s and 10s through form and fitness continues to deny the Wallabies a clear identity. With Tom Lynagh going down again Schmidt is onto his third starting flyhalf in four matches, all of their partnering a scrumhalf who announced his retirement a month ago.</p> <p>For Argentina last week was further confirmation that they belong at this elite level. A stronger interchange would have surely sealed a deserved victory, one built on power up front and dash behind, especially in the centres where Santiago Chocobares and Lucio Cinti were dynamic.</p> <p>The Pumas have a decent record in the Harbour City with two wins and a draw from their last three visits, although these matches were all played at Commbank Stadium in the western suburbs, not Allianz Stadium in the east.</p> <p>I’ll be back with the line-ups shortly.
