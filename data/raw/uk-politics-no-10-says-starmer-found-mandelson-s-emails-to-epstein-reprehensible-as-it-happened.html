Normally he avoids saying anything revelatory about his wife on the podcast, but his comments today could be seen as confirmation that Cooper was not happy about the move – even though arguably it could be seen as a promotion.</p> <p>Commenting on the reshuffle, Balls said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It’s really hard again to see the logic. </p> <p>David Lammy has spent four years building an array of foreign contacts around the world. Suddenly, he’s taking the sentencing legislation, through the House of Commons … which has been put in place by Shabana Mahmood. She’s been moved and so we have to start from scratch in terms of working out how to deliver that. </p> <p>I think, from Yvette’s point of view, how could you not be excited by the idea of being the foreign secretary? But it’s obviously frustrating when you spent years getting to the point where you had a plan to turn this round in terms of migration, and whether that’s around deportations, or getting other departments to pull their weight in terms of housing asylum seekers, turning around the appeals system, getting the France deal in place, the Germany deal coming through, third country relations which are in the pipeline – and suddenly to find you have to have a new home secretary, starting from scratch and you’ve gone to the Foreign Office.

It was hardly the biggest lie in politics – Farage argued that whether “whether I say ‘I’ or ‘we’ is pretty irrelevant” – but it was indicative of a certain slipperiness and casual attitude to accuracy that critics would argue is typical of the Reform UK leader.</p> <p>The scoop did not attract huge interest at the time. But, after Angela Rayner resigned as deputy prime minister because she had underpaid stamp duty, there was renewed interest in the Farage Clacton house. Rayner got into trouble because she should have paid the extra stamp duty owed when someone buys a second home, and Farage was asked if he had been doing the same thing.</p> <p><strong>Billy Kenber </strong>and<strong> Phil Kemp</strong> from the BBC have now published the results of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce845w70g0yo">a very thorough investigation into this</a>. They have found no evidence that there was anything about the purchase that was unlawful. But they have found evidence that undermines Farage’s suggestion that his partner, a former waitress, was able to buy the £885,000 home without a mortgage because she comes from a wealthy family.</p> <p>They also found that Farage recently commissioned a KC specialising in tax to provide a statement saying the correct stamp duty was paid – even though Farage says he was not involved in the purchase.</p> <p>Kenber and Kemp say:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is legal for an unmarried person to gift or otherwise transfer wealth to their partner for them to buy a property in their own name and doing so does not incur stamp duty.</p> <p>Farage has though faced accusations that he has acted hypocritically and sought to avoid tax if he played a role in financing the purchase of his constituency home in his partner’s name.</p> </blockquote> <p>Commenting on the BBC story, <strong>Anna Turley</strong>, the Labour party chair, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Nigel Farage repeatedly misled his constituents and the British public about buying a home in his constituency. There are now far too many unanswered questions about the house he stays in while in Clacton. He must urgently come clean with the public as to whether he financially contributed towards the purchase of this property.</p> <p>Misleading the public for political gain about buying a constituency home is appalling in itself. But if he deliberately put in place this arrangement to avoid paying his fair share of tax that would be even worse. </p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Sarah Olney</strong>, a Lib Dem Cabinet Office spokesperson, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Nigel Farage has serious questions to answer over this. After spending days attacking others over their tax arrangements he now needs to be frank and honest about his own.</p> <p>I’m not holding my breath. The only time Nigel Farage wants to answer questions is when he is in the US talking Britain down.</p> </blockquote> <p>In a statement to the BBC, a <strong>spokesperson for Farage</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Laure Ferrari is the sole legal and beneficial owner of the property. It belongs solely to Laure and was purchased with funds which belong to her. All taxes were properly paid.

In 2019 Epstein was arrested again on sex trafficking charges. </p> <p><em>Q: Given that it has been widely known for several years that Peter Mandelson stayed in Jeffery Epstein’s luxury New York mansion in 2009, stayed in his luxury Paris property 2010 and 2011 – these are all reported facts – why have some supportive emails changed the PM’s view?</em></p> <p>The <strong>spokesperson</strong> said what was new was the information about the “extent and depth” of the relationship, and that the new information was “materially different”.</p> <p><em>Q: If the PM was surprised by the new information, showing Mandelson encouraged Epstein to fight his first conviction, but he knew Mandelson had stayed in Epstein’s flat after that conviction, did the PM think Mandelson stayed there thinking Epstein was guilty?</em></p> <p>To this, the <strong>spokesperson</strong> just repeated the “extent and depth” point.</p> <p><em>Q: You seem to saying it is fine to stay in a convicted paedophile’s property if you think they are guilty, but not if you think they are innocent?</em></p> <p>The <strong>spokesperson</strong> did not engage with this point, and just repeated the “materially different” line.</p> <p><em>Q: Can you clarify for other ministers and ambassadors – is it OK to stay in a paedeophile’s house?</em></p> <p>The <strong>spokesperson</strong> said there was a process for appointments.</p> <p><em>Q: Does the PM take a dim view of all high-profile political figures who have in the past associated with Epstein?</em></p> <p>The <strong>spokesperson</strong> dodged this one completely.</p> <p><em>Q: Does the PM have confidence in the vetting process if it missed these elements of the Mandelson/Epstein relationship?</em></p> <p>To this one, there was a clear answer. “Yes,” the <strong>spokesperson</strong> said.</p> <p><em>Q: Does the PM feel personally let down by Mandelson?</em></p> <p>The <strong>spokesperson</strong> said the PM has acted the the basis of new information that had come to light.</p> <p><em>Q: The new emails did not really reveal anything that we did not already know. So was Mandelson sacked because he was just becoming a political liability?</em></p> <p>The <strong>spokesperson</strong> said he disagreed with that “fundamentally”. The emails revealed something “materially different”, he said.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-11T13:17:53.491Z">at 2.17pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68c2c1ae8f086519d326fe40" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-11T12:36:59.125Z">1.36pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">No 10 declines to say Starmer was 'misled' by Mandelson about Epstein links ahead of appointment as ambassador</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>At the Downing Street lobby briefing the <strong>PM’s spokesperson</strong> repeatedly said that Peter Mandelson was sacked because of “new information” that came to light about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.</p> <p>But, despite being asked repeatedly, the spokesperson declined to say that No 10 had been “misled” by Mandelson.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c2c0938f084b3c85a4c94e" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-11T12:33:07.768Z">1.33pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">No 10 says Starmer found Mandelson's emails to Epstein 'reprehensible'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>At the Downing Street lobby briefing the <strong>PM’s spokesperson</strong> said that Keir Starmer found Peter Mandelson’s emails to Jeffrey Epstein “reprehensible”.</p> <p>When he was asked if Starmer agreed with Mike Tapp, the Home Office minister who said this morning the emails were “sickening” (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/sep/11/peter-mandelson-keir-starmer-deputy-labour-leader-uk-politics-latest-news?page=with%3Ablock-68c28c9b8f084454b70cc441#block-68c28c9b8f084454b70cc441">10.11am</a>), the spokesperson was at first reluctant to use the same language.</p> <p>But, when pressed, he said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think it’s self-evident that he found the content of these emails reprehensible.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c2b6688f084b3c85a4c8bb" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-11T12:21:42.425Z">1.21pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">No 10 struggles to explain why previous disclosures about Mandelson/Epstein links didn't disbar him from US job</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>This morning’s Downing Street lobby briefing last about an hour – almost twice as long as usual – and that is normally a clear sign that that the government is in trouble.

Keir Starmer knew that Peter Mandelson had had a long and close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein when he appointed him ambassador to Washingon. He also knew that Mandelson has been a scandal magnet for most of his career. But he was not appointing him archbishop of Canterbury. He calculated that Mandelson would be the right person to forge a good relationship with the immoral plutocrat narcissist now running America (also an old friend of Epstein’s), and by all accounts Mandelson has done this very successfully.</p> <p>But, as <strong>Rowena Mason</strong> reports in her overnight story, Starmer is now under pressure to ditch the ambassador because new revelations about his relationship with Epstein have made it increasingly hard to defend – not least because Mandelson continued to support him in private even after he was facing charges for child sex offences.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/10/mandelson-told-epstein-your-friends-love-you-after-2008-charges-emails-show">‘Your friends love you,’ Mandelson told Epstein after 2008 charges, emails show</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yesterday the leftwingers Bell Ribeiro-Addy and Kim Johnson were about the only Labour MPs calling for Mandelson to be sacked. But this morning, in an interview with the Today programme, <strong>Andy McDonald</strong>, a shadow cabinet minister under Jeremy Corbyn and under Starmer until 2021, also spoke out, saying Mandelson should go immediately.</p> <p>McDonald told the programme:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>[Mandelson] should go immediately. His position is completely and utterly untenable and him staying on in post is causing the government and the Labour party further damage. I’m afraid if he doesn’t do the right thing and resign today then the prime minister should sack him …</p> <p>Angela Rayner did the right thing. She was under pressure for an inadvertent failure to pay tax. This is of a completely different scale. This speaks about morality and judgement, and Peter Mandelson’s position just is totally untenable, and he needs to act and take responsibility for his failures and withdraw from the political scene immediately.</p> </blockquote> <p>More significantly, McDonald also claimed this was the private view of most or all Labour MPs. Asked how many other Labour MPs agreed with what he was saying about Mandelson, McDonald replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It’s 100%. People have got their heads in their hands over this and I haven’t spoken to anybody who is offering any glimmer of support for Peter Mandelson. It is widespread revulsion that we, by association, being in the same party, are being brought under the microscope for something that he has done.</p> <p>He’s got to take responsibility for his actions and bring this to a close.</p> <p>There isn’t anybody in the Labour party who is supporting Peter Mandelson today and the prime minister’s got to hear that and understand that he’ll weaken his position if he continues to support him. He cannot defend the indefensible.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that it was worth keeping Mandelson in post because he was helping the UK to get favourable decisions out of the White House, McDonald replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There’s got to be a moral compass. There are women who have been so fundamentally damaged by the behaviour of Epstein and his associates, and, in honour of them, we’ve got to put down a marker and say this is wholly and utterly unacceptable.</p> <p>And the consequences that flow from somebody having to fall on their sword will be the consequences, and we will deal with it.</p> <p>It will not derail the relationship between the United States and the UK. That will sustain way beyond this current prime minister and this current president.</p> </blockquote> <p>In part this is just Labour factionalism; it’s the latest skirmish in a battle between Mandelson and the left that has been going on since the 1980s. Mandelson once famously said he wanted to consign the Corbynite left to a “sealed tomb”, and the MPs who have been speaking out against him, like McDonald, are leftwingers who are returning the favour. But it is not just that. Opposition parties are demanding Mandelson’s resignation too, and the rightwing papers are <a href="https://x.com/Lou_obrien19">gunning for him as well</a>.</p> <p>There will be quite a lot more of this as the day goes on.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> NHS England publishes its latest monthly performance figures.</p> <p><em>9.45am:</em> Wes Streeting, the health secretary, speaks at a Policy Live event in London.</p> <p><em>10.3am:</em> Alan Campbell, the new leader of the Commons, takes business questions in the chamber.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>Noon:</em> John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, takes questions at Holyrood.</p> <p><em>2.30pm:</em> John Healey, the defence secretary, speaks at the DSEI conference in London.</p> <p><em>Afternoon:</em> David Lammy, the new deputy PM and justice secretary, visits a prison in south London.</p> <p><em>5pm:</em> Nominations close for the Labour party deputy leadership.
