<p>I have always had a degree of&nbsp;health anxiety, but when Covid hit, it really spiked. At home with the family, I made sure we washed all our food and even then I didn’t feel safe eating it. I&nbsp;would bring in the post and then be worried about touching the front door. I’d shower for ages, trying to wash the virus away.</p> <p>I’m a journalist, so before the anxiety set in I was a pretty outgoing and adaptable person. But from the start of lockdown until September 2022, I didn’t go anywhere indoors other than home or the hospital. I didn’t even walk down a street for a year and a half, for fear of passing too close to someone.</p> <p>For a long time, I didn’t want to get better. I felt so scared by the world. It seemed like my old life just wouldn’t happen again, that I’d never feel OK being in a bar, a club, a gig or anything that involved being near lots of people. Music became really important as a&nbsp;way to cope – especially a band called Bastille, who I was late to discover but instantly loved.</p> <p>By spring 2022, I was very slowly starting to get better. I was still washing all my food and not going near people, but I was able to walk down the street again, even if I did hold my breath every time someone walked past. However, my progress had plateaued and I didn’t know what&nbsp;to do.</p> <p>Then I had a vivid dream about going to a live Bastille gig. The excitement and joy of that dream helped me realise how much I wanted music, people and new experiences in my life&nbsp;again. I had to get better. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/30/my-cultural-awakening-asian-dub-foundation-free-satpal-ram-racism">My cultural awakening: an Asian Dub Foundation song gave me the courage to take a stand against racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I started to pour all my energy into&nbsp;my recovery. I became more optimistic. I looked around for concerts close to me and discovered that Bastille were playing at the Victorious festival, which is&nbsp;just down&nbsp;the road from my home in Southampton. I contacted the&nbsp;PR team&nbsp;and was delighted to be offered&nbsp;review tickets for a&nbsp;nonprofit community website I run. Best of&nbsp;all, I was granted an <a href="https://www.in-common.co.uk/2022/08/30/7432/">interview with&nbsp;Bastille</a>.</p> <p>From that moment on, I worked hard to prepare myself for the gig. I&nbsp;began to get fit again. I went into a&nbsp;shop for the first time in months, started socialising more and going for walks with friends.</p> <p>On the day of the concert, we went through the VIP entrance, which was much quieter, so that really helped. I&nbsp;stood backstage with the PR team, waiting for my turn to interview the band. My heart was racing, not just because I was meeting Bastille, but also because I really didn’t want to use hand sanitiser in front of them, which had become a habit. I had to pretend that the last couple of years hadn’t happened to me and, somehow, I was able to. When I shook their hands, it took the total number of people I’d had any physical contact with in the last two-and-a-half years to about 10.</p> <p>During the concert, we started off on the periphery of the crowd and slowly edged further into the centre. It didn’t feel stressful; actually, it felt really good. I remember dancing and feeling happy, and finding the whole thing unbelievable. “Look what I’ve done,” I thought. “I’m doing this!”</p> <p>Over the next days, weeks and months, I gradually became more active. It took a while for the anxiety to go completely, but it didn’t control me any more. On top of the work for my website, I got a job at a community centre for lonely and vulnerable people. They were really tolerant of my initial shyness and helped me find my way back into the world again.</p> <p>Bastille is definitely my favourite band. I recently saw them at a packed gig on Oxford Street, and a cramped record shop gig in Southampton. And I&nbsp;always go to Victorious festival now. I&nbsp;love it. </p> <p><em>Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change? Email us at cultural.awakening@theguardian.com</em></p>
