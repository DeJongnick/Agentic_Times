<p>The Environment Agency is considering legal action against South West Water after the company spilled sewage into the sea at a Devon beach.</p> <p>Swimmers were told to stay out of the sea at Exmouth beach after a sewer burst on private land on Thursday next to Maer Lane wastewater treatment works.</p> <p>The Environment Agency said: “As regulator, we are keeping pressure on the water company to do all it can to prevent pollution from damaging bathing water quality.</p> <p>“We continue to monitor the site closely and encourage the public to check <a href="https://environment.data.gov.uk/bwq/profiles/">Swimfo</a> for the latest status of bathing water quality before swimming.</p> <p>“Given the seriousness of the incident, the Environment Agency is considering what legal approach to take for these pollutions on Exmouth beach.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/20/sewage-spilling-english-water-firms-denied-top-marks-rankings">Sewage-spilling English water firms could be denied ‘top marks’ in rankings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Clarissa Newell, regulatory manager at the Environment Agency, told BBC Radio Devon: “We are investigating and considering all enforcement options … that could be a warning, it could be the water company promises to invest in the environment they damaged or the infrastructure that caused that damage, or we go to prosecution.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for South West Water said it had temporarily fixed the broken sewer pipe, adding: “We always work with all of our regulators, including the Environment Agency, and are continuing to keep them fully updated.</p> <p>“We continue to work around the clock to complete this essential work. We would like to thank residents and visitors for their patience, and we are sorry for the disruption caused throughout this event.”</p> <p>The company has been using tankers to transfer sewage flowing into the treatment works to reduce the spill while repairs are under way.</p> <p>There have been concerns about the impact on local tourism, with reports the beach was much quieter than usual over the weekend. After the spill, yellow warning signs were erected and lifeguards used loudspeakers to warn people against going in the water.</p> <p>David Reed, the Conservative MP for Exmouth and Exeter East, said: “To see Exmouth beach with so few people enjoying it on a beautiful August day is extremely depressing.</p> <p>“This current event with South West Water needs to end ASAP. I’ve been clear with senior representatives from SWW that it’s their duty to provide accurate and timely updates to let locals and tourists alike know how repairs are progressing.”</p> <p>Earlier this summer, businesses in the south-west reported tourism was down after the parasitic disease cryptosporidium was found in South West Water’s supply.</p> <p>Dozens of people reported falling ill and people in the Brixham area <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/15/devon-resident-told-to-boil-tap-water-over-risk-parasitic-disease-south-west">had to boil their tap water</a> for weeks until they were alerted that it was safe to drink.</p>
