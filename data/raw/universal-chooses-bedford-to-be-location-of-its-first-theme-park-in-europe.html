<p>First Beijing, and now Bedford: a “transformative” new British tourist magnet is coming to the home counties – just off the A421.</p> <p>A former brickworks will be the site of a new multibillion-pound theme park from the entertainment behemoth Universal, the government confirmed on Wednesday.</p> <p>The venture is projected to bring 8.5 million visitors near to the market town, which is 50 miles north of London.</p> <p>The development will create tens of thousands of jobs and become the biggest visitor attraction in Britain.</p> <p>The first Universal theme park in Europe, it will squat on a 192-hectare (476-acre) site at the former <a href="https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/7924334">Kempston Hardwick brickworks</a>, as part of a larger complex incorporating a 500-bed hotel and “a retail, dining and entertainment complex”.</p> <p>Though it is “still too early” to think about planned rides and attractions at the resort, Universal has said, among the draws at <a href="https://www.universalbeijingresort.com/en">its most recently opened park in Beijing</a> are the Minions-themed Loop-Dee Doop-Dee, the Transformers Megabase Decepticoaster and an area entitled the Kung Fu Panda Land of Awesomeness.</p> <p>Universal claims the project will be “transformative for Bedford and deliver significant benefits for the UK economy”. Announcing the deal on Wednesday, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, was eager to claim credit for any potential benefits.</p> <p>“This is our plan for change in action,” Starmer said, “combining local and national growth with creating around 28,000 new jobs across sectors such as construction, AI, and tourism.</p>    <p>“It is not just about numbers; it’s about securing real opportunities for people in our country. Together, we are building a brighter future for the UK, getting people into work and ensuring our economy remains strong and competitive.”</p> <p>The project, the government says, will bring a £50bn boost to Britain’s economy and create 20,000 jobs in construction, with a further 8,000 operational roles once it is up and running, forecast for 2031.</p> <p>The enormous project does not yet have planning permission and will be a test of the government’s <a href="https://www.building.co.uk/news/starmer-pledges-to-speed-up-infrastructure-schemes-by-scrapping-key-legal-challenges/5133955.article">promise to speed up major construction projects</a> by reducing the scope for legal challenges. It has been strongly backed by local government leaders, however.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bedfordtoday.co.uk/news/politics/universal-studios-its-vital-to-unleash-potential-of-bedford-says-prime-minister-5042342">Questioned by Bedford MP Mohammad Yasin</a> last month, Starmer agreed that it was “vital that we do unleash the potential of … Bedford, by generating growth, jobs, and opportunities”.</p> <p>As part of the announcement the government said it will make “a major investment in infrastructure around the site” to ensure it is easily accessible.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/dec/30/the-rollercoaster-king-the-man-behind-the-uks-fastest-thrill-ride-podcast">The rollercoaster king: the man behind the UK’s fastest thrill-ride – podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early discussion of the project – which has been under negotiation for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/26/universal-theme-park-bedfordshire-harry-potter-shrek-mario-kart">more than a year</a> – made much of Bedford’s relative proximity to London.</p> <p>Earlier this week, the transport secretary approved plans for a major expansion of nearby Luton airport – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/03/luton-airport-allowed-to-double-capacity-after-uk-government-overrules-planners">overruling planning inspectors</a> who had recommended blocking the scheme on environmental grounds – which will see annual passenger numbers almost double to 32 million by 2043.</p> <p>As well as Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, its flagship theme park in Orlando, Florida, and its 2021 venture in Beijing, Universal also runs resorts in Japan and Singapore.</p> <p>The company, rebranded Universal Destinations and Experiences in 2023, is owned by the US telecoms group Comcast, which is also the parent company of Sky.</p> <p>Mike Cavanagh, president of Comcast Corporation, said he “could not be more excited to take this very important step in our plan to create and deliver an incredible Universal theme park and resort in the heart of the United Kingdom, which complements our growing US-based parks business by expanding our global footprint to Europe”.</p> <p>Rachel Reeves, the chancellor said: “At a time of global change, this investment is a vote of confidence in Britain as a place to do business.</p> <p>“Universal’s investment will bring billions to the economy and create thousands of jobs to the UK, putting more money in people’s pockets.”</p>
