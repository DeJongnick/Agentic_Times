<p>Donald Trump fired a top federal prosecutor in Sacramento just hours after she warned immigration agents they could not indiscriminately detain people in her district, according to documents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/26/us/trump-fires-us-attorney-california-immigration.html">reviewed by the New York Times</a>.</p> 
<p>Michele Beckwith, who became the acting US attorney in Sacramento in January, received an email at 4.31pm on 15 July notifying her that the president had ordered her termination.</p> 
<p>The day before, Beckwith had received a phone call from Gregory Bovino, who leads the Border Patrol’s unit in El Centro, a border city 600 miles south of Sacramento. Bovino was planning an immigration raid in Sacramento and asked Beckwith who in her office to contact if his officers were assaulted, the Times reported, citing Beckwith.</p> 
<p>She informed Bovino that agents were not allowed to indiscriminately stop people in her district, north of Bakersfield, per a federal court order issued in April that prevents the agency from detaining people without reasonable suspicion. The US supreme court overturned a similar court order issued in Los Angeles earlier this month.</p> 
<p>In a 10.57am email on 15 July, Beckwith repeated her message, telling Bovino she expected “compliance with court orders and the constitution”. Less than six hours later, her work computer and cellphone no longer functioning, she received a letter to her personal email account notifying her that she had been terminated.</p> 
<p>Two days later, Bovino proceeded with his immigration raid at a Sacramento Home Depot.</p> 
<p>“Folks, there is no such thing as a sanctuary city,” he said in a video he shared from the California state capitol building.</p> 
<p>“The former acting US attorney’s email suggesting that the United States Border Patrol does not ALWAYS abide by the constitution revealed a bias against law enforcement,” Bovino said in a statement to the New York Times. “The supreme court’s decision is evidence of the fact Border Patrol follows the constitution and the fourth amendment.”</p> 
<p>On 8 September, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/08/trump-supreme-court-ice-immigration-california">the supreme court ruled</a> that federal immigration agents can stop people solely based on their race, language or job, overturning the decision of a Los Angeles judge who had ordered immigration agents to halt sweeping raids there.</p> 
<p>Beckwith’s firing is one of a series of federal firings, including of prosecutors who did not abide by the president’s agenda. Last week, US attorney Erik Siebert <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/19/us-attorney-letitia-james-erik-siebert">resigned under intense pressure</a> and Trump replaced him with his special assistant Lindsey Halligan just hours after ordering his attorney general Pam Bondi to do so in a since deleted social media post.</p> 
<p>Siebert had been overseeing investigations into Letitia James and James Comey. Beckwith has appealed against her termination, according to the Times.</p> 
<p>“I’m an American who cares about her country,” she told the paper. “We have to stand up and insist the laws be followed.”</p>
