<p>Political power boils down to two things: votes and money. But when money buys presidents, senators and judges, votes are merely the sales receipts. What’s left is money, and the purpose of power is to get more of it.</p> <p>Trump’s non-billionaire followers appear thrilled that Elon Musk and his so-called “department of government efficiency” are burning down the government. “Imagine if Trump hadn’t met and talked with Elon Musk that all this progress on efficiency may not be taking place or at such a fast pace needed before the midterms,” comments holy666 on a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/irs-slash-thousands-workers-payroll-report">Fox News story</a> about the mass layoffs of federal employees.</p> <p>Firings at the IRS elicit particular glee. Writes EnemyCitizen: “A beautiful thing about Mr Trump’s approach is that internal revenue will slow down and Congress will have to sober up and stop passing appropriations bills that apply our hard-earned money to frivolous political agendas. No more blank checks, Congress!”</p> <p>In fact, what the megalomaniacal multibillionaire is destroying is everything – minus the policing functions, of course – that we pay taxes for, including such frivolous agendas as food inspection, flood mitigation and Medicare. This is how kleptocracies work. Taxes are collected from the hoi polloi. The more benign government functions – housing the poor, postponing climate apocalypse – are abolished. But the rest of these functions do not entirely disappear. Rather, they are farmed out to private enterprise, which undertakes what it’s paid to do with minimum expense and maximum profit (and we all know corporations never commit waste, fraud or abuse).</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>One of the diabolical features of what geographer Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls an "anti-state state" like our current regime is its ability to turn acts of resistance against the state against themselves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Watchdogs are eliminated, bribery is <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/trump-bribery-corruption-legal/681658/">legalized</a>. The most corrupt carry off the greatest rewards. And bereft of revenue, social services wither, the infrastructure crumbles, and the prisons fill with the destitute and the resistant.</p> <p>Maga wants to starve the bureaucracy. But it still wants money. And with the wealthiest awaiting gigantic tax breaks, they need it from the rest of us. With the Internal Revenue Service in effect transformed into a shell corporation laundering the money of the ultra-rich, why should we pay taxes?</p> <p>The IRS is being speedily organized for this rerouting. Doge is <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/live-updates/trump-2nd-term-tariffs-trade-war?id=118643360&amp;entryId=118860646">axing</a> as many as 15,000 law-abiding and knowledgeable civil servants. It is trying to coerce the agency to give Elon’s AI-wielding AV squad <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5150401-doge-irs-taxpayer-data-lawsuit/">unfettered access</a> to the system containing the personal and financial data of every American taxpayer, small business and non-profit.</p> <p>Not only would this arrangement provide an armory of intelligence to be deployed against the president’s enemies – according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537882-doge-irs-lawsuit/?mode=document#document/p4">lawsuit</a> filed by taxpayer advocates, unions and small business alliances, it would give Musk access to his rivals’ profit and loss statements, payrolls, tax records and information about IRS investigations into their (or his own) suspected tax fraud. “No other business owner on the planet has access to this kind of information on his competitors,” assert the plaintiffs, “and for good reason.”</p> <p>These are all good reasons to withhold your taxes.</p> <p>Can the tactic work? Is it right? Morally and politically motivated tax nonpayment has an honorable, if not always successful, history. After the Roman empire’s destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD Jewish people refused to pay Rome’s “temple tax”. Rome responded by destroying more temples. <a href="https://www.mkgandhi.org/articles/Gandhis-salt-march-the-tax-protest-that-changed-Indian-history.php">Gandhi</a>’s salt tax protest, on the other hand, was the first step toward India’s independence from the British empire. The American Revolution was a tax revolt, and that worked – although some colonists resisted taxes levied by the revolutionaries and, after independence, the states as well.</p> <p>More recently, American opponents of wars, nukes and abortion have refused to pay all or portions of their taxes in protest. Many went to prison for it. In <a href="https://blogs.law.columbia.edu/uprising1313/files/2017/10/Civil-Disobedience-by-Henry-David-Thoreau.pdf">Civil Disobedience</a>, Thoreau wrote of weighing the benefits and costs of any given action. He believed all taxation was illegitimate as long as the US condoned slavery. “If [the injustice] is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another, then I say, break the law,” he concluded.</p> <p>One of the diabolical features of what geographer Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls an “anti-state state” like our current regime is its ability to turn acts of resistance against the state against themselves. Principled prosecutors and agency heads resign rather than carry out the president’s illegal orders – leaving only Maga flunkies in their places. Civil servants quit rather than pervert the services or science they’ve devoted their careers to – leaving the work unguarded and the workforce decimated, precisely as the wrecking crew intends.</p> <p>So it is with tax resistance. Every dollar that does not come into Washington’s coffers is justification to cut another dollar. You may remember that the vanguard of 21st century far right populism was the Tea party, an anti-tax movement.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/17/us-politics-trump-staying-tuned-in">It’s never been more important to stay tuned in | Margaret Sullivan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/191573/musk-trump-freeze-ira-education-environment">New Republic</a>, Liza Featherstone argues that the destruction of popular government programs is not “a goofy misstep on this administration’s part. Rather, it’s exactly the point.” Whether firing park rangers, defunding daycare centers, or deep-sixing job-creating clean-energy projects in red states, the programs’ “popularity is precisely what the Trump-Musk administration dislikes about them. For anti-government ideologues, it’s important that people not have good experiences with the government.”</p> <p>And if people have bad experiences with the government – if they contract <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-bird-flu-hospitalizations-rise-ohio-discloses-case/">bird flu</a> because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention no longer have the wherewithal to control and prevent disease; if bridges collapse because the funds to repair them are cut off – well, there’s proof that the government can’t do anything right, and deserves to be destroyed.</p> <p>In fact, after it outsources the government, the regime would be smart to keep calling it the government. When IRS.com loses a taxpayer’s refund and assigns a bot to sort out the problem, the taxpayer will blame IRS.gov.</p> <p>Thanks to intentional staff shortages at the IRS, your missing tax payment might go unnoticed, just as the Trump family’s multibillion-dollar fraud escaped the agency’s auditors for decades. But if tax evasion is a secretive act, tax resistance is civil disobedience, a public, political act. The reason to withhold your taxes is not to cheat the government of much-needed funds. It is not even to cheat the crooks now running the country, satisfying as that may be. It is to expose the criminality of what is being done – and not done – with the money the state has a legal and moral obligation to collect and then to distribute, to serve all the people.</p> <ul> <li><p>Judith Levine is a Brooklyn journalist and essayist, a contributing writer to the Intercept and the author of five books</p></li> </ul>
