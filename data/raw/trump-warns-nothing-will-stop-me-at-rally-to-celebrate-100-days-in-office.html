<p>Donald Trump has celebrated his 100th day in office with <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-marks-100-days-in-office-in-macomb-county-michigan/659201">a campaign-style rally</a> in Michigan and an attack on “communist radical-left judges” for trying to curb his power, warning: “Nothing will stop me.”</p> 
<p>The president also served up the chilling spectacle of a video of Venezuelan immigrants sent from the US to a notorious prison in El Salvador, accompanied by Hollywood-style music and roars of approval from the crowd.</p>

<p>Trump’s choice of Michigan was a recognition not only of how the battleground state helped <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/06/donald-trump-wins-us-presidential-election">propel him to victory</a> over Vice-President Kamala Harris in last November’s election, but its status as a potential beneficiary of a tariffs policy which, he claims, will revive US manufacturing.</p> 
<p>But the cavernous sports and expo centre in the city of Warren, near Detroit, was only half full for the rally, and a steady stream of people left before the end of his disjointed and meandering 89-minute address.</p> 
<p>“We’re here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country!” Trump declared. “In 100 days, we have delivered the most profound change in Washington in nearly 100 years.”</p> 
<p>The 45th and 47th president falsely accused the previous administration of engineering a massive border invasion and allowing gangs, cartels and terrorists to infiltrate communities. “Democrats have vowed mass invasion and mass migration,” he said. “We are delivering mass deportation.”</p> 
<p>Trump defended his use of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime authority that allows the president to detain or deport the citizens of an enemy nation, to expel alleged foreign terrorists from the US as quickly as possible. Then <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1917347819234681178">he took aim at the courts</a> that have blocked many of his moves during the first 100 days.</p> 
<p>“We cannot allow a handful of communist, radical-left judges to obstruct the enforcement of our laws and assume the duties that belong solely to the president of the United States,” Trump said, with evident frustration. “Judges are trying to take away the power given to the president to keep our country safe.</p> 
<p>“It’s not a good thing, but I hope for the sake of our country that the supreme court is going to save this, because we have to do something. These people are just looking to destroy our country. Nothing will stop me in the mission to keep America safe again.”</p> 
<p>In a darkly theatrical touch, Trump encouraged the crowd to watch big screens that showed mainly Venezuelan alleged gang members deported from the US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/deportation-alleged-gang-members-el-salvador">arriving last month in El Salvador</a> and having their heads shaved or being manhandled by guards.</p> 
<p>The video, originally shared by El Salvador’s authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, was accompanied by moody music reminiscent of a thriller. Once it was over the big screens offered the simple message, “100 days of greatness,” while the crowd cheered raucously and broke into chants of: “USA! USA! USA!”</p> 
<p>The video elicited strong reactions outside of the centre too. “Trump is playing torture videos at his rally of people he illegally disappeared to El Salvador, including our [client] Andry,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, lawyer and co-founder of Immigration Defenders Law, on X. “As the video ends his supporters chant ‘USA’ and cheer loudly.</p> 
<p>“These shameful ghouls. Absolutely sick.”<strong> </strong></p> 
<p>The arena was surrounded by banners that read, “Investing in America”, “Jobs! Jobs! Jobs!”, “The Golden Age”, “Buy American, Hire American” and “The American Dream is Back”. Trump’s supporters held signs with slogans such as: “Make America Great Again” and “Golden Age of America.” Michigan’s unemployment rate has risen for three straight months.</p> 
<p>One person behind the president waved a “Trump 2028”, banner even though he is constitutionally barred from serving a third term. At one point <a href="https://x.com/margomartin47?lang=en">Margo Martin</a>, a White House aide, joined the president on stage and asked: “Trump 2028, anybody?” The crowd roared.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Democrats in Washington and Michigan decried the policies and agenda of the first 100 days.</p> 
<p>“Donald Trump’s first 100 days as president have been 100 days from hell for the American people,” Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/leader-schumer-dear-colleague-on-donald-trumps-disastrous-first-100-days">wrote in a letter to Senate colleagues</a>. “His first 100 days have been the worst for any president in modern history, and unsurprisingly, he has the lowest 100-day job approval any president has seen in 80 years.”</p> 
<p>In Michigan, former transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg pointed to Trump’s spotty economic record on X. “100 days into this presidency, Americans are paying the price – higher prices, crashing retirement accounts, and broken promises,” he said, amid low approval ratings that have recently hounded the president.</p> 
<p>But the rally sought to avoid that reality.<strong> </strong>Before it began, warm-up tracks included It’s A Man’s Man’s Man’s World by James Brown and Luciano Pavarotti, Nothing Compares 2 U by Sinéad O’Connor and YMCA by Village People. There were video clips of Elton John and the Who singing Pinball Wizard in the movie Tommy, and factory worker turned country singer Oliver Anthony performing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98FoEuBGOIU">Rich Men North of Richmond</a>.</p> 
<p>Yet despite the ostensible celebration of his election win and hugely consequential first 100 days, Trump spent much of the rally in campaign mode, fixated on past grudges and grievances.</p> 
<p>He mocked Biden’s mental acuity and even how he appears in a bathing suit, repeated the lie that he won the 2020 election and sought to discredit polling and news coverage unflattering to him. “When you watch the fake news you see fake polls,” he said, without evidence. “In legitimate polls I think we’re in the 60s, the 70s.”</p> 
<p>Trump defended his administration’s steep tariffs on cars and auto parts, hours after the White House announced it was softening them. He boasted of ending diversity, equity and inclusion “bullshit” across the federal government and private sector, and of making it official government policy that there are only two genders.</p> 
<p>He reiterated support for the beleaguered defense secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/26/pete-hegseth-leak-investigation">Pete Hegseth</a>, telling the crowd: “I have so much confidence in him. The fake news is after him, but he’s a tough cookie. They don’t know how tough he is.”</p> 
<p>Trump also heaped praise on his billionaire ally Elon Musk and his “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/27/elon-musk-doge-trump">department of government efficiency</a>”, or Doge, and condemned the backlash against the Tesla and SpaceX entrepreneur: “It’s not fair what they’ve done to him. That is a disgrace.”</p> 
<p>The rally featured guest speeches by Brian Pannebecker, a retired car worker who pitched a book he is writing about his support of Trump, and the White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1917355932801233246">who said earnestly</a>: “Thank you, President Trump, for being the greatest president in American history.”</p> 
<p>Democrats take a different view. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/01/ken-martin-chair-democratic-national-committee">Ken Martin</a>, chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: “Trump’s pathetic display tonight will do nothing to help the families he started screwing over 100 days ago.</p> 
<p>“Michiganders and the rest of the country see right through Trump, and as a result, he has the lowest 100-day approval rating in generations. If he’s not already terrified of what the ballot box will bring between now and the midterm elections, he should be.”</p>
