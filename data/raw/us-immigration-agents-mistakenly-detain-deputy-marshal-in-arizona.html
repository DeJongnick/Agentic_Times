<p>A US marshal was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents in Arizona, after being mistakenly identified as a man that agents were looking for, according to a statement from the US Marshals Service.</p> <p>The deputy marshal matched the “general description of a subject being sought by Ice” and was detained at a federal building in the Old Pueblo in Tucson.</p> <p>Officials said the detention was brief and the deputy marshal was released after his identity was “quickly confirmed” by other law enforcement officers.</p> <p>The Marshals Service did not say when the incident happened or who the deputy marshal was.</p> <p>“The Deputy US Marshal’s identity was quickly confirmed by other law enforcement officers, and he exited the building without incident,” a service spokesperson told <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-mistakenly-detain-us-marshal-rcna211599">NBC News.</a></p> <p>Ice agents are under pressure from the White House to increase arrests. On Tuesday, agents detained more than 2,200 people, the highest number of immigrant arrests in a single day in its history, according to reports.</p> <p>Hundreds of the people who were arrested had been enrolled in Ice’s Alternative to Detention (ATD) program, three sources familiar with the arrests told NBC News.</p> <p>Under the program, Ice releases undocumented immigrants who are not considered to be threats to public safety and tracks them using ankle monitors, smartphone apps, along with periodic check-ins at Ice facilities.</p> <p>Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy,<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/ice-arrests-record-number-immigrants-single-day-rcna210817"> reportedly</a> told a meeting with Ice leadership last month that senior officials could be fired if it did not start making 3,000 arrests a day.</p> <p>But with the raids in Los Angeles and elsewhere, the administration appears to be moving away from arresting suspected gang members or those with criminal histories and moving to a more generalized detention of undocumented immigrants.</p> <p>The Trump administration border czar,<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/national-guard-deployed-los-angeles-county-anti-ice-protests-rage-border-czar-tom-homan"> Tom Homan, told Fox News</a> on Saturday that the national guard would be deployed to Los Angeles county on Sunday after anti-Ice protests became violent amid police use of teargas on demonstrators.</p>
