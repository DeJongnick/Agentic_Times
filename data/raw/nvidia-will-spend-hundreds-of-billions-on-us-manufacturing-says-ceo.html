<p>The boss of the world’s biggest computer chipmaker, Nvidia, has promised that the company will shell out “several hundred billion” dollars to make semiconductors and other electronics in the US over the next four years.</p> <p>The comments from Jensen Huang illustrate how the California-headquartered AI chipmaker is remodelling its supply chain away from Asia amid unpredictable tariff threats by Donald Trump.</p> <p>The chief executive, who also co-founded Nvidia, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3fd3a717-2fbf-42ef-bb08-5baecdeb1985">told the Financial Times</a>: “Overall, we will procure, over the course of the next four years, probably half a trillion dollars worth of electronics in total. And I think we can easily see ourselves manufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the US.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/mar/20/bank-of-england-interest-rates-decision-economy-trade-war-wage-growth-slows-business-live">Bank of England expected to leave interest rates on hold today, as wage growth slows and redundancies rise – business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The remarks are the latest example of how Trump’s “America First” policy is having an impact on business investment, even forcing groups such as Nvidia – which is among the world’s most valuable companies – to rethink their global footprint.</p> <p>The Silicon Valley company, founded in 1993, has been the engine of the AI market boom, with hype around the technology propelling its valuation to a stratospheric $2.9tn (£2.2tn). But in recent years it and other big US tech companies, such as Apple, have become increasing dependent on chipmaking facilities in Taiwan run by TSMC and Foxconn – a supply chain now under threat from trade wars and from China’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/21/donald-trump-russia-ukraine-foreign-policy-impact-taiwan">territorial designs on its neighbour</a>.</p> <p>Huang said he was confident that Nvidia was well-positioned to deal with any worsening situation in Taiwan, which is also vulnerable to earthquakes. “At this point, we know that we can manufacture in the US, we have a sufficiently diversified supply chain,” he added.</p> <p>He added that the Trump administration could be in a position to bolster the US AI industry at a time of growing competition from China.</p> <p>Huawei, for example, had become the “single most formidable technology company in China”, having “conquered every market they’ve engaged”. Huang argued US efforts to constrain the Chinese company had been “done poorly”, as evidenced by Huawei’s continued success. </p> <p>For now, “having the support of an administration who cares about the success of this industry and not allowing energy to be an obstacle is a phenomenal result for AI in the US”, Huang said, referring to the large amount of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/04/can-the-climate-survive-the-insatiable-energy-demands-of-the-ai-arms-race">electricity needed to power its chips</a> in datacentres.</p> <p>Efforts to onshore manufacturing have been helped by a recent $100bn US investment by TSMC. The Taiwanese semiconductor firm’s investment means that Nvidia’s Blackwell chips – its top-of-the-line graphics processing unit – are being produced in the US, providing for “a substantial step up in our supply chain resilience”.</p>
