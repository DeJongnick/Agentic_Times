The sample used to create Junie was collected before Lua’s death, according to Colossal.</p> <p>Brady said the company “gave my family a second chance with a clone of our beloved dog” and added that he is “excited how Colossal and Viagen’s tech together can help both families losing their beloved pets while helping to save endangered species”.</p>    <p>Viagen, now owned by Colossal, has previously cloned pets for celebrities including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/feb/28/barbra-streisand-cloned-her-dog-twice-variety">Barbra Streisand</a> and Paris Hilton.
