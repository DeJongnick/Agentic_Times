<h1>Pete Hegseth fires US navy chief of staff</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-10-04T13:24:42Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Adam Gabbatt &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> US news</div>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, the US defense secretary, abruptly fired the navy chief of staff on Friday, removing an aide who had been key to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s efforts to reshape the Pentagon.</p> 
<p>Jon Harrison, who was appointed in January, had been key to broad changes made to the navy’s policy and budgeting offices. Together with John Phelan, a Trump mega-donor who was confirmed as navy secretary in March, Harrison had reportedly sought to limit the influence of the navy undersecretary, who typically has a key role in managing that military branch’s budget.</p> 
<p>The Pentagon confirmed Harrison’s departure in a statement <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/03/top-navy-official-fired-00593997">to Politico</a>, which first reported it.</p>

<p>“He will no longer serve as Chief of Staff to the Secretary of the Navy,” it said. “We are grateful for his service to the Department.”</p> 
<p>Harrison’s firing comes days after Hung Cao, a former naval officer who ran for Senate as a Republican last year, <a href="https://insidedefense.com/insider/senate-confirms-hung-cao-navy-under-secretary">was confirmed</a> as navy undersecretary.</p> 
<p>Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/26/navy-secretary-john-phelan-hung-cao-role-00477795">previously reported</a> that Harrison and Phelan, who had no prior military experience before being appointed, had reassigned several top aides who were supposed to help Cao adjust to his role. According to Politico, that move was intended to reduce the influence of the undersecretary’s role.</p> 
<p>Harrison’s departure comes after months of upheaval under Hegseth.</p> 
<p>In May, he ordered the military to cut 20% of its four-star generals and admirals, while Hegseth and Trump have fired more than half a dozen top generals <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-brown-joint-chiefs-firing-25668b583b8fb2262c7890a44164e287">since January</a>. They have also fired the only two women serving as four-star officers. In February, Hegseth also fired air force general CQ Brown Jr, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff and the second Black man to serve in that role.</p> 
<p>In an unusual speech to top military officials this week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/30/pete-hegseth-speech-takeaways">Hegseth railed</a> against diversity and inclusion guidelines and claimed the defense department had previously become “the woke department”. Many veterans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/pete-hegseth-generals-speech-veterans-react">reacted furiously</a> to the address by Hegseth, who before being appointed as defense secretary was a host on Fox News.</p>
