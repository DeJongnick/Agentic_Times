<p>Good morning. We lead today with the arrest of a promoter of the HyperVerse cryptocurrency investment scheme. Rodney Burton – AKA “Bitcoin Rodney” – is in custody in the US, accused of being part of a network that allegedly made “fraudulent presentations” to investors over bitcoin mining which investigators believe did not exist. It follows a Guardian Australia investigation last month that detailed the HyperVerse scheme’s links to the failed Australian company Blockchain Global that left creditors millions out of pocket.</p> <p>Meanwhile, housing advocates are calling for urgent reforms as new data reveals another sharp rise in capital city rents last year, with further rises expected this year.</p> <p>There’s also a worrying development on Nasa’s Peregrine 1 mission to the moon. And tributes are flowing for Germany’s World Cup-winning captain and manager Franz Beckenbauer, who has died aged 78.</p> <h2>Australia</h2>    <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Rental woes | </strong></em>Analysts are warning that Australia’s record shortage of rental properties <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/09/australian-capital-city-rents-up-13-per-cent-over-year-as-further-hikes-predicted-for-2024-amid-housing-shortage">will continue to drive prices up</a> – as a new report reveals that combined capital city rents rose 13.2% year-on-year.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>HyperVerse scheme | </strong></em>The crypto investment promoter “Bitcoin Rodney” has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/09/hyperverse-crypto-promoter-bitcoin-rodney-arrested-and-charged-in-us">arrested and charged in the US</a> over a scheme <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/dec/14/crypto-currency-schemes-investors-losing-millions-regulation-hyperverse-warning-ntwnfb">with links to Australian company Blockchain Global</a>, which collapsed owing creditors $58m.</p></li> <li><p><em><strong>Getting fair value?
