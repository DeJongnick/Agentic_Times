<p>Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced that they would oppose the nomination of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a> to become the next US secretary of defense, making them the first two Republican lawmakers to publicly reject one of Donald Trump’s cabinet picks and raising fresh doubts about the controversial nominee’s chances of confirmation.</p> <p>Murkowski indicated her opposition to Hegseth in a <a href="https://x.com/lisamurkowski/status/1882496900223377719">statement</a> shared on social media on Thursday, in which she criticized the Fox News host and army veteran as lacking the experience and character needed to lead the Pentagon.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jan/23/donald-trump-pardons-january-6-us-president-joe-biden-jd-vance-republicans-live-news">Senate votes to advance Pete Hegseth as Trump’s defense secretary despite some Republican opposition – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“After thorough evaluation, I must conclude that I cannot in good conscience support his nomination for secretary of defense,” Murkowski wrote. “I commend Pete Hegseth’s service to our nation, including leading troops in combat and advocating for our veterans. However, these accomplishments do not alleviate my significant concerns regarding his nomination.”</p> <p>Shortly after Murkowski made her announcement, Collins joined her in opposing a procedural motion to advance Hegseth’s nomination to a final Senate vote and released her own statement detailing her reservations about the cabinet pick.</p> <p>“After careful consideration, I have decided to vote against Pete Hegseth’s nomination for secretary of defense,” Collins said. “While I appreciate his courageous military service and his ongoing commitment to our servicemembers and their families, I am concerned that he does not have the experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job.”</p> <p>Given Republicans’ 53-47 advantage in the Senate, Hegseth can only afford to lose three of their votes, assuming every Democratic senator opposes his nomination. Hegseth overcame a procedural hurdle in the Senate on Thursday afternoon, with 51 Republicans voting to advance his nomination, but it remains unclear whether he will have the support necessary to be confirmed. </p> <p>The test vote came one week after Hegseth’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/14/pete-hegseth-testimony-congress-secretary-defense">contentious hearing</a> before the Senate armed services committee, where Democrats grilled the nominee on allegations of sexual assault, excessive alcohol use and financial mismanagement of two non-profits that he oversaw.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the top Democrat on the committee, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/21/pete-hegseth-affidavit-senators-confirmation">confirmed</a> that senators had received an affidavit from Hegseth’s former sister-in-law accusing him of engaging in aggressive and erratic behavior that prompted his family members to fear for their safety. Hegseth has denied the allegations, and his ex-wife, Samantha Hegseth, has said he never physically abused her.</p> <p>Murkowski continued in her statement: “While the allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking do nothing to quiet my concerns, the past behaviors Mr Hegseth has admitted to, including infidelity on multiple occasions, demonstrate a lack of judgment that is unbecoming of someone who would lead our armed forces.”</p> <p>Murkowski and Collins also cited Hegseth’s previous comments suggesting women should not be allowed to serve in combat roles, which he attempted to walk back during his hearing last week, as disqualifying.</p> <p>“He and I had a candid conversation in December about his past statements and apparently evolving views,” Collins said. “I am not convinced that his position on women serving in combat roles has changed. Women comprise nearly 18% of our active-duty military. They continue to make critical and valuable contributions to our national defense.</p> <p>“I have long advocated that women who wish to serve in and can meet the rigorous standards of combat roles should be able to do so. And numerous women have proved that they can accomplish this difficult feat.”</p> <p>Murkowski, meanwhile, concluded her statement by saying: “Given the global security environment we’re operating in, it is critical that we confirm a secretary of defense[;] however, I regret that I am unable to support Mr Hegseth.”</p> <p>The Senate is expected to hold the final vote on Hegseth’s nomination on Friday night.</p>
