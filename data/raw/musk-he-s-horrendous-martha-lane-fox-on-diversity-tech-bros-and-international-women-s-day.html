<p>As Elon Musk grinned in the Oval Office, one of Britain’s most influential tech investors looked on in horror. “He is absolutely horrendous. I have said it multiple times: I think it is horrifying what is happening,” says Martha Lane Fox.</p> <p>For the British peer and ex-Twitter board member, the sight of Musk holding forth from the bully pulpit of Donald Trump’s White House shows the Silicon Valley dream has gone sour.</p> <p>“The richest man in the world, who can stand there alongside the president, and kind of <em>carte blanche</em> make jokes about how he’s carving up people’s jobs in the government. Then he can be there with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/23/cpac-elon-musk">chainsaw laughing on stage…</a></p> <p>“It is really, really alarming, and I find it extremely unpleasant at a values-based level – but also, just how can we be watching this in plain sight? It makes me feel very anxious. I think it is gross.”</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em> to mark International Women’s Day, the president of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) warned the diversity pushback orchestrated by Trump and his tech bro acolytes will not only damage society, but also the economy at large.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>What Musk is doing is really alarming. How can we all be watching this in plain sight? I think it is gross</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Since his return to the White House, the US president has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/22/trump-orders-immediate-closure-of-all-us-federal-diversity-offices">shut down all federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives,</a> while Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is ripping up funding schemes.</p> <p>Some of the world’s biggest companies are following suit. Amid a wider pushback against everything from environmental targets to sustainable development, among the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/diversity-equity-inclusion-dei-us-trump-google-amazon-walmart">most prominent</a> taking part are US finance and tech companies, including Goldman Sachs, Accenture and Amazon, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/28/uk-based-british-pharma-gsk-pauses-diversity-work-citing-trump-orders">UK businesses such as GSK have also fallen in line</a>.</p> <p>“He needs to be contained,” Lady Lane Fox says of Musk’s role in the rollback. “I find it extraordinary that the richest man in the world is trampling all over these things and that we still have kind of fanboying from the tech sector. It’s already been corrosive for society, and I would argue it is going to continue to be.”</p> <p>For businesses, she says the bottom line is that companies that take diversity seriously appeal to the widest possible employee talent pool and are better placed to target a broad range of customers. This, she adds, is about profit as much as social justice. However, she has a broader concern about the future.</p> <p>“The first thing, it’s financial. But the second thing, it’s about power and money – like everything, right?</p> <p>“If you’re looking at a sector like the digital sector, where there’s the growth in jobs, growth in opportunity – it is the growth sector in the economy. Yet you are not including a whole bunch of people in that. Then you are going to be creating inequality. Full stop. So it’s financial and it’s a question of social justice.”</p> <p>Given the close ties between Britain and the US, there is a view that where corporate America treads, the UK naturally follows. But there are signs that some UK businesses – and even the British operations of some US companies – are prepared to stand apart.</p> <p>The accountancy firm Deloitte instructed staff working on contracts for the US government to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/11/deloitte-staff-us-government-contracts-pronouns-emails-trump-anti-diversity">remove pronouns from their emails</a>, while also announcing the end of its DEI programme. But its UK boss told staff its British operations remained “committed to [its] diversity goals”.</p> <p>“It feels as though global companies rooted in the US are making a politically motivated slight shift in emphasis and tilt, through to rowing back everything. And it does feel a bit more tempered here,” says Lane Fox.</p> <p>UK businesses have an opportunity to do something different, she says, which could bring financial benefits. “I think we’ll build more robust companies, attract talent and have a much better shot at building the most resilient companies of the future.”</p> <p>For almost three decades, Lane Fox has built a career – and multimillion-pound fortune – in tech. She made her first big money <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/mar/14/qanda">floating Lastminute.com</a>, the online travel site co-founded alongside fellow Oxford graduate Brent Hoberman in 1998.</p>    <p>She <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/08/twitter-board-new-martha-lane-fox-hugh-johnston">joined the board of Twitter</a> – now X – in 2016, landing herself a huge payday in Musk’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/27/elon-musk-completes-twitter-takeover">$44bn hostile takeover</a> in 2022, before he dissolved the board and appointed himself the sole director.</p> <p>Seeing Musk in the Oval Office, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/18/elon-musk-kids-work-pr-strategy">parading his son X on his shoulders</a>, made her question the gender divide. “Can you imagine if that was a woman? Can you imagine what that would look like? I mean, I just think the whole thing is really gross.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/trump-executive-order-musk-doge">Trump signs executive order expanding power of Elon Musk’s Doge agency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while railing against Musk in a personal capacity, the BCC president does not suggest this approach is for everyone. “It is really tricky to navigate. You have a responsibility to your customers and your employees that might be different to our personal view sometimes.”</p> <p>Government regulation to enshrine diversity targets is also a bad idea, she says, preferring instead that companies report their progress. “Keeping it in the light, keeping up the reporting, is important – keeping up good investors, looking at the right metrics and investing in the right companies all helps.”</p> <p>However, not enough progress is being made. Analysis this week showed that worsening unemployment and workforce participation for women has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/03/uk-awarded-its-lowest-ranking-for-workplace-gender-equality-in-a-decade">pushed the UK behind Canada</a> to its lowest global ranking for workplace equality among large economies in a decade.</p> <p>The gender pay gap has been declining slowly over time, but <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/genderpaygapintheuk/2024">average pay is still 7% less</a> for women than for men. It is a challenge Lane Fox is all too aware of. “Look at the data and it is really freaking depressing – and it is not moving,” she says.</p> <p>“What worries me is that it’s far too easy to find numbers that I thought we were moving on from.</p> <p>“In this week of International Women’s Day, we see representation at the executive level has gone back. I see progress on boards is still good at the FTSE 100 level, but bad at FTSE 250 and 350 level.</p> <p>“I know there will be people in the sector thinking: ‘Oh, here she goes again.’ That’s true of many women [that people think that]. But it is so important to keep making these arguments.”</p>
