<p>South Korea’s birthrate surged at its fastest pace in more than three decades in April, offering tentative signs of recovery in a country grappling with the world’s lowest fertility rate, official data showed.</p> <p>The number of babies born in April reached 20,717, marking an 8.7% increase from the same month last year and the steepest monthly growth since April 1991, according to <a href="https://kostat.go.kr/board.es?mid=a10301010000&amp;bid=204&amp;act=view&amp;list_no=437275&amp;tag=&amp;nPage=1&amp;ref_bid=203,204,205,206,207,210,211,11109,11113,11814,213,215,214,11860,11695,216,218,219,220,10820,11815,11895,11816,208,245,222,223,225,226,227,228,229,230,11321,232,233,234,12029,10920,11469,11470,11817,236,237,11471,238,240,241,11865,243,244,11893,11898,12031,11825,246,0067&amp;keyField=T&amp;keyWord=&amp;bodo_b_type=all">Statistics Korea</a>.</p> <p>The increase extends a positive trend that began last year, with births rising for <a href="https://www.chosun.com/english/national-en/2025/06/25/WB52TODSNFAZVDXWNTZ54BIFHQ/">10 consecutive months</a>.</p> <p>“The rise in births appears to be influenced by increased marriages since last year, growth in the population of women in their early 30s, and various birth promotion policies,” a Statistics Korea official <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250625004200320">said</a>.</p> <p>April saw 18,921 couples marry, a 4.9% increase year-on-year and the 13th consecutive month of marriage growth.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/07/south-korea-thinktank-suggests-girls-start-school-earlier-to-raise-birthrate">South Korea thinktank suggests girls start school earlier to raise birthrate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>South Korea’s strong correlation between marriage and childbirth, with few children born outside marriage, tends to make wedding figures a key indicator for future birth trends.</p> <p>The so-called “echo boomers” might also be contributing. The large cohort born between 1991 and 1995 is now aged 29-34 and entering prime marriage and childbearing years. Data shows that women aged 30-34 increased from 1.51 million in 2020 to 1.65 million in May this year.</p> <p>However, officials <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250528003900320">remain cautious</a> about the sustainability of the trend. The country’s total fertility rate – or the average number of babies a woman is expected to have in her lifetime – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/26/south-korea-birthrate-rises-marriages-surge">remains at a crisis level of 0.75</a>, well below the 2.1 needed to maintain population stability without large-scale immigration.</p> <p>A recent United Nations <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/assets/Files/WPP2024_Summary-of-Results.pdf">report</a> classified South Korea among nations experiencing “ultra-low fertility”, calculating a 0.1% probability that the country will recover to sustainable birthrates within three decades.</p> <p>In recent years, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/12/south-korea-splashes-the-cash-in-scramble-to-fix-fertility-crisis">authorities</a> at all levels and even <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240205006000320">large corporations</a> have launched aggressive campaigns to reverse the demographic decline, ranging from generous cash handouts to <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10491758">dating programmes</a>.</p> <p>Experts attribute South Korea’s demographic crisis to a variety of factors, including soaring housing costs, intense educational competition, demanding work culture, and changing attitudes towards marriage and family life among younger generations.</p> <p>Women are also increasingly delaying or forgoing childbirth due to career concerns and the burden of traditional gender roles.</p> <p>President Lee Jae Myung, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/03/lee-jae-myung-elected-as-south-korean-president-exit-polls-say">elected last month</a>, has made demographic recovery a cornerstone of his new administration.</p> <p>His <a href="https://www.news1.kr/economy/population-statistics/5802248">proposals</a> include providing all newlywed couples with 100m won (£53,800) loans with debt forgiveness based on the number of children born, <a href="https://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_view.htm?lang=e&amp;Seq_Code=193065">expanding child allowances</a> to age 18, and implementing <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/policy/politics/assembly/2025/04/30/KQ3OH64X45HAPGRFCXGZ4OIFEA/">family-friendly tax reforms</a> modelled on France’s family quotient system, which lowers taxes for families by adjusting for the number of children in the household.</p> <p>Experts have questioned whether financial incentives alone can reverse the demographic decline.</p> <p>Hong Sok-chul, an economist at Seoul National University, <a href="https://www.news1.kr/economy/population-statistics/5802248">told local media</a> that while the government’s policies appeared aimed at reducing costs related to marriage and childbearing, he had doubts about whether this would lead to a birthrate rebound.</p> <p>“There needs to be effort to solve structural social problems,” he said.</p>
