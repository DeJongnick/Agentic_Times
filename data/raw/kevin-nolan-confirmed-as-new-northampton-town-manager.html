<p>Kevin Nolan has been named Northampton Town’s new manager on a two-and-a-half year contract. The former West Ham first-team coach has returned to a No 1 role for the first time since being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/26/kevin-nolan-sacked-by-notts-county-with-winless-club-bottom-of-league-two">sacked by Notts County in August 2018</a>. Nolan’s first taste of management came as a player-manager at Leyton Orient two years earlier.</p> <p>The 42-year-old former Bolton and Newcastle midfielder was part of David Moyes’s staff at West Ham for four years but left when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/10/end-of-an-era-david-moyes-prepares-to-bid-farewell-to-stadium-he-soothed">Scot departed the club</a> in May this year and has been keen to return to frontline management. Nolan replaces Jon Brady, who this month resigned after three-and-a-half years in charge. Brady’s assistant, former manager Ian Sampson, has been in caretaker charge. Northampton are 20th in League One, a place above the relegation zone after a 5-0 defeat at home to Charlton at the weekend. They travel to Reading on Boxing Day.</p> <p>“I am delighted to be appointed the new manager of Northampton Town and I cannot wait to get going,” said Nolan, was also linked with the managerial vacancy at Bristol Rovers, who sacked Matt Taylor this month. “We have a busy schedule over the Christmas and New Year period so the challenge is to hit the ground running as best we can.</p> <p>“The club has a fine reputation in the game as being a well run club and it is clear it has moved forward on and off the pitch over the last few seasons. I am proud and honoured to be given the chance to try and continue and develop that work. I believe the squad can make progress up the table and I am determined to repay the faith that the board of directors have shown in me.”</p> <p>Northampton’s chairman, Kelvin Thomas, said: “Kevin was very impressive through the process and showed a real desire for the job. “He has done well in difficult circumstances in both of his previous managerial jobs and he impressed us with his knowledge, his energy, his experience and his passion. He showed a real desire and enthusiasm for the role, he couldn’t wait to get started and he has already taken charge of training for the first time.”</p> <p>In August, Nolan was appointed interim assistant head coach of England’s under-20s, supporting Paul Nevin, whom he worked with at West Ham.</p>
