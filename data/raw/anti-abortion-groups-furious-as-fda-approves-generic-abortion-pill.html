<p>In a move that has left anti-abortion advocates reeling, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) quietly approved a request to manufacture a new abortion pill earlier this week.</p> <p>Thanks to the approval, a company called Evita Solutions will be able to manufacture its generic version of mifepristone, one of two drugs typically used in most US medication abortions. A generic version of mifepristone, which was first approved as a brand-name drug in 2000, is already available on the market.</p> <p>Yet the approval stunned and infuriated foes of abortion, who have spent the three years since the 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade pressuring the federal government to curb access to mifepristone. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, announced last month his department would review the safety of mifepristone.</p> <p>“FDA had promised to do a top-to-bottom safety review of the chemical abortion drug, but instead they’ve just greenlighted new versions of it for distribution,” Josh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri and fierce abortion opponent, posted on X. “I have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.”</p> <p>Kristan Hawkins, president of the powerful anti-abortion group Students for Life of America, called the approval “a true failure”.</p> <p>“This is a stain on the Trump presidency,” she added in a statement.</p> <p>To bolster their attack on mifepristone, anti-abortion activists recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/04/trump-rfk-mifepristone-abortion-pill">seized on an April paper</a> by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a rightwing thinktank, claiming almost 11% of women experience sepsis or other serious complications within 45 days of taking mifepristone. In his letter announcing the review of mifepristone, Kennedy cited the center’s paper.</p> <p>But that paper was not peer-reviewed nor published in a medical journal, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/14/rfk-jr-fda-abortion-pill-mifepristone">experts have uncovered multiple flaws</a> in it. For example, it counts ectopic pregnancies – wherein an embryo implants somewhere outside of the uterine lining – as a serious complication. Mifepristone does not cause or worsen ectopic pregnancies.</p> <p>Meanwhile, more than 100 studies, conducted across more than three decades and dozens of countries, have concluded that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/01/health/abortion-pill-safety.html">mifepristone is a safe and effective tool</a> to end a pregnancy.</p> <p>Abortion rights supporters celebrated the news of the FDA’s approval, proclaiming it a victory for evidence-backed medicine.</p> <p>“By expanding generic options, the agency is reinforcing mifepristone’s impeccable safety record,” Kiki Freedman, co-founder and CEO of the telemedicine abortion provider Hey Jane, said in a statement.</p> <p>“At a time when politically motivated attacks threaten to undermine science and restrict care, it’s critical to underscore that the science couldn’t be clearer.”</p> <p>The health department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, a spokesperson for the department <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/health/abortion-pill-generic-fda.html">told the New York Times</a> in a statement that “the FDA has very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug”.</p> <p>“By law, the secretary of Health and Human Services must approve an application if it demonstrates that the generic drug is identical to the brand-name drug,” the spokesperson said.</p>
