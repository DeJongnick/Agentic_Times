  <p><em>Patrick Wintour is the Guardian’s diplomatic editor:</em></p> 
  <p>The Iranian president has said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> attempted to assassinate him by bombarding an area in which he was holding a meeting.</p> 
  <p>“They did try, yes. They acted accordingly, but they failed,” <strong>Masoud Pezeshkian</strong> told the US media personality Tucker Carlson in response to a question on whether he believed Israel had tried to kill him. </p> 
  <p>Carlson’s interview, conducted via an interpreter and released last Monday, is one the first interviews the Iranian president has given with western media since the 12-day war fought between Israel and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> last month.</p> 
  <p>“It was not the United States that was behind the attempt on my life. It was Israel. I was in a meeting … they tried to bombard the area in which we were holding that meeting,” he said, according to a translation of his remarks from Farsi, without specifying whether the alleged attempt was during the recent war.</p>

  <p>In 2015, Iran agreed a long-term deal on its nuclear programme with the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany.</p> 
  <p>The deal, formally known as <strong>the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)</strong>, allowed Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67% – enough to fuel a nuclear power plant, but far below the threshold of 90% needed for weapons-grade uranium.</p> 
  <p>It also drastically reduced Iran’s stockpile of uranium, limited its use of centrifuges – which spin at supersonic speeds to enrich uranium - and relied on the International Atomic Energy Agency to oversee Tehran’s compliance through additional oversight. In return, crippling economic sanctions on Iran were lifted.</p> 
  <p>But during his first term, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement">US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from the deal</a>, arguing it wasn’t tough enough and didn’t address Iran’s missile program or its support for militant groups in the wider Middle East. That set in motion years of tensions.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Iran says cooperation with nuclear watchdog will take 'new form'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We can bring you some more comments from Iranian foreign minister, <strong>Abbas Araghchi</strong>, who addressed diplomats in Tehran on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>He said that Iran’s cooperation with the <strong>International Atomic Energy Agency</strong> (IAEA) “has not stopped, but will take on a new form”, after the Islamic republic formally ended cooperation with the global nuclear watchdog in early July.</p> 
  <p>The order by the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, included no timetables or details about what that suspension would entail. Iran has limited IAEA inspections in the past as a pressure tactic in negotiating with the west.</p> 
  <p>Araghchi said on Saturday that requests to monitor nuclear sites “will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis... taking into account safety and security issues”, and be managed by Iran’s supreme national security council.</p> 
  <p>Israel, which condemned Iran’s move, is believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, and the IAEA doesn’t have access to its weapons-related facilities.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Guardian’s diplomatic editor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour">Patrick Wintour</a>, filed this report last week:</p> 
  <p>European nations will act to impose “dramatic sanctions” on Iran in the coming weeks if it does not end the uncertainty about its nuclear programme, including by allowing the return of UN inspectors, the UK foreign secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/david-lammy">David Lammy</a>, has warned.</p> 
  <p>He also told the Commons that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> could not assume Israel would not strike its nuclear sites again.</p> 
  <p>His tough warning was echoed by the French foreign ministry, which is working closely with the UK in an attempt to persuade Iran to end its new ambiguity about its nuclear intentions and re-engage in talks with the US.</p> 
  <p>The UK, France and Germany – the E3 – signed the original nuclear deal with Iran in 2015 and according to its terms can impose “snapback” UN sanctions without the risk of a security council veto, so long as they act by its expiry in October. Alternatively, they could table a UN resolution to delay the snapback by some months if Iran shows a willingness to negotiate.</p> 
  <p>The three countries are also using their power to reimpose UN sanctions as a lever to persuade the US to join the talks with the Iranians, but have so far had no success. You can read the full story here:</p>

  <p>During the 12-day war, Israeli airstrikes killed hundreds of people, including civilians, and injured thousands of others in Iran, according to official figures.</p> 
  <p>As we have already mentioned, the war on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> – cast as a preemptive attack for self-defence – was launched by Israel and later joined in by the US.</p> 
  <p>Israel claimed the attacks were necessary before its adversary got any closer to building an atomic weapon, although experts and the US government had assessed that Iran was not actively working on such a weapon before the strikes.</p> 
  <p>Israel has acknowledged being hit by more than 50 missiles during its war with Iran, resulting in at least 28 deaths, but the true extent of the damage may never be known due to stringent media restrictions.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Iran says it would resume nuclear talks with US if guaranteed no further attacks</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Welcome to our live coverage of the Middle East, with a focus on the prospect of US-Iran nuclear talks restarting.</p> 
  <p>According to state media, Iran’s foreign minister, <strong>Abbas Araghchi</strong>, said on Saturday that his country would be willing to re-engage in nuclear talks with Washington if there were assurances of no more attacks against it.</p> 
  <p>Araghchi served as lead negotiator in the strained nuclear talks with the US over the summer, which collapsed after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/what-has-israel-hit-in-iran-and-who-were-the-generals-and-nuclear-scientists-killed">Israel launched a surprise attack </a>on Iran’s nuclear sites on 13 June, including at the key Natanz nuclear site as well as at ballistic missile sites.</p> 
  <p>Referring to the subsequent 12-day Israeli bombardment of Iran’s nuclear and military sites, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/22/how-effective-was-the-us-attack-on-irans-nuclear-sites-a-visual-guide">and the US airstrike on 22 June</a>, Araghchi said that if the US and others wish to resume talks with Iran, then:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>First of all, there should be a firm guarantee that such actions will not be repeated. The attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities has made it more difficult and complicated to achieve a solution based on negotiations.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Both Israel and the US struck Iranian nuclear facilities in June but did not destroy the Iranian nuclear programme, likely setting it back by a couple of months, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/24/iran-strikes-nuclear-sites-report">according to an early Pentagon intelligence assessment of the attack</a>.</p> 
  <p>The Trump administration, which claims that Iranian nuclear facilities were completely destroyed in the attacks, insists that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.</p> 
  <p>Following the airstrikes, Iran suspended cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog<strong>, the International Atomic Energy Agenc</strong>y (IAEA), which led to the departure of inspectors.</p> 
  <p>Iran says it is not developing nuclear weapons and that its enrichment of uranium is for peaceful purposes.</p> 
  <p>Iran is maintaining a fragile ceasefire with the US and Israel but the risk exists of the crisis flaring up into further warfare unless a diplomatic agreement is found soon.</p>
