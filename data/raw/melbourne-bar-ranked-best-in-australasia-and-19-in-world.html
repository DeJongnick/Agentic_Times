It has climbed two places since 2024.</p>    <p>Maybe Sammy in Sydney, which was named Best Bar in Australasia for four consecutive years from 2019 to 2022, placed at number 42.</p> <p>“We are so incredibly proud to be recognised on the World’s 50 Best Bars list for the seventh year in the row – a milestone that means so much to us,” its owners said in a post on social media.

Names of the voters are confidential to prevent lobbying, and the award has 29 academy chairs across different regions to “further ensure fair representation”.</p>
