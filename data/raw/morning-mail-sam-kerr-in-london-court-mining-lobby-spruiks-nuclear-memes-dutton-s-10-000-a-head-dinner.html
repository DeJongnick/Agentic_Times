<p>Morning everyone. As pre-election campaigning heats up, some Liberal supporters are paying $10,000 a head to attend a fundraising dinner with Peter Dutton next week in the key Sydney marginal of Bennelong.</p> 
<p>Elsewhere, Sam Kerr has appeared in court in London overnight ahead of a trial next month for alleged racially aggravated harassment of a police officer; Los Angeles is braced for “extreme” fire danger today as winds pick up again; and it’s no problem for the Australian Open’s main character, Alex de Minaur.</p>
