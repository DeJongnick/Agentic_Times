<p>Re your report (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/15/claim-casts-doubt-on-origin-of-national-gallery-rubnes">A £2.5m dud? Fresh doubt cast on authenticity of National Gallery Rubens, 15 June</a>), I’d like to draw readers’ attention to the recent publication of <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/catalogues/martin-cahill-and-cornelis-forthcoming/samson-and-delilah">detailed art-historical and technical research on the National Gallery’s website</a> confirming the attribution of Samson and Delilah to Peter Paul Rubens.</p> <p>This extensive study, conducted by our curatorial and scientific teams using the latest imaging and analytical techniques, provides compelling evidence in support of the painting’s authorship. It offers transparency around our research process and contributes meaningfully to the wider field of art-historical scholarship.</p> <p>Given the interest and debate this painting has attracted over the years, we hope this publication will be of value to scholars and the public alike.<br><strong>Gabriele Finaldi</strong><br><em>Director, the National Gallery</em></p> <p><em><strong>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
