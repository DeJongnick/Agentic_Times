<p>October, said the poet Dermot Healy, is “<a href="https://gallerypress.com/product/a-fools-errand-dermot-healy/">when memory / is released</a>”. In bygone days, Ireland’s harvest season spanned between the ancient Celtic festivals of <em>Lúnasa</em> (1 August) and <em>Samhain</em> (1 November). But October was a vital month because, traditionally, this was when the <a href="https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/tillage-end-of-2024-main-crop-potato-harvest-is-in-sight/">potato crop</a> was lifted out of the ground. But despite its <a href="https://www.irishhistory.com/the-history-and-cultural-significance-of-the-irish-potato/">deep association</a> with the country, the potato was only introduced to Ireland during the 16th century. It then became a staple food thanks to its nutritional value and productivity – a single crop grown in a small plot of poor soil could feed a family for the better <a href="https://www.rte.ie/brainstorm/2023/0724/1396109-hunger-gap-ireland-19th-century-food-system-famine-potato-crop/">part of a year</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strokestown_Park">Strokestown House</a> used to be&nbsp;the home of the local Anglo‑Irish&nbsp;landowner, whose tenant farmers relied on the potato crop. After a tour of the house, I&nbsp;walk to where a pasture’s broad sweep and mature trees betray its previous life as manicured parkland. While I watch the grazing&nbsp;cattle, a litany of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_potato_cultivars">potato varieties</a> – kerr’s pink, golden wonder, maris piper – rises like an old chant in my mind. Yet until today’s tour, I’d never heard of the Irish lumper, the variety on which the 19th-century rural poor&nbsp;depended.</p>    <p>Potatoes are cultivated by a form of <a href="https://tinyfarmblog.com/cloning-potatoes/">cloning</a>. Nowadays, new varieties are deliberately <a href="https://potatocongress.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Achieving-Sustainable-Cultivation-of-Potatoes-Chapter-4-2018.pdf">created</a> to&nbsp;maximise genetic variation, which can improve disease resistance. In 1845, however, <em>Samhain</em>’s festival day was soured by <a href="https://irelandxo.com/ireland-xo/history-and-genealogy/timeline/report-potato-epidemic-boyle-sligo-and-beyond">reports</a> of a strange blight. I sniff the air. Even here, from the fields beyond this view, the stench of the crop’s decay might have carried on the breeze.</p> <p>Later recognised as the mould <em>Phytophthora infestans</em>, the blight ravaged the potato crop across Europe, leading to widespread hardship. In Ireland, however, the situation was so <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43910575?read-now=1#page_scan_tab_contents">culpably mismanaged</a> by the authorities that, while exports of other Irish food produce continued, there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)">famine</a> and <a href="https://strokestownpark.ie/national-famine-way/">forced migration</a> (1845‑52). Indeed, as its population plummeted, political leaders discussed their opportunity&nbsp;to <a href="https://www.rte.ie/history/famine-ireland/2020/0810/1158380-this-land-of-sorrows-the-poor-law-extension-act-1847/">remake</a> the country.</p> <p>Strokestown Park now houses Ireland’s <a href="https://strokestownpark.ie/national-famine-museum/">National Famine Museum</a>, which was established 150 years after the events it lays bare. Those events have troubling parallels with&nbsp;our own times.
