<p>England’s rugby players are seeking to emulate the Bazball ethos of their cricketing counterparts and strike a pre-emptive blow for the nation in the run-up to the forthcoming Ashes series. Steve Borthwick and members of his coaching staff have had discussions with Brendon McCullum and want their team to make a fast and furious start against Australia in the Quilter Nations Series on Saturday.</p> <p>There is a collective desire within the England camp to make a statement over the coming month and Borthwick and his defence coach, Richard Wigglesworth, have been picking McCullum’s brain on the best ways to encourage a positive mindset. “We met Brendon McCullum and his coaching staff a few weeks ago,” said Wigglesworth. “We had a sit down and a coffee in Manchester which was very enjoyable.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/29/australia-tommy-freeman-england-george-gregan-rugby-union-autumn-nations-series">Australia will target Freeman at centre in England clash, George Gregan warns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I asked him a lot around how he changed mindsets in English cricket which was really interesting. But then we got into the technicalities of coaching someone one-on-one and what that looks like. I wouldn’t want to say there was one main thing because we sat for a good period of time and took loads from it, but they’re on to a good thing.</p> <p>“We [also] want to be a team that can win in multiple different ways and adapt because every game is different. We feel we’ve got a dynamic team so we want to play that way.”</p> <p>Despite a sequence of seven successive victories this year England fans are still awaiting the launch of a spectacular new “Borthball” era to compare with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/21/england-test-cricket-zimbabwe-bazball-ben-stokes">eye-catching cricketing equivalent</a> led by McCullum and Ben Stokes. The next month, however, offers the chance to take a significant step forward with the draw for the 2027 Rugby World Cup set to be conducted in December.</p> <p>Beating the Wallabies on Saturday, hard on the heels of the British &amp; Irish Lions’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/04/british-irish-lions-special-moments-but-lacked-consistency-australia-wallabies-tour-rugby-2025">summer series triumph</a>, would also help to counter Australia’s success in last weekend’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/oct/25/england-australia-rugby-league-ashes-match-report">first rugby league Ashes Test</a> before the start of cricket’s Ashes series in Perth on 21 November. There are several avid cricket fans in the England rugby squad and Wigglesworth believes the “great rivalry” with Australia motivates both teams. “I think both sides really enjoy playing against each other because there’s something there. Hopefully we stick one on the board on Saturday.”</p>    <p>Wigglesworth was also part of the Lions management who tasted success in Australiain the summer and believes all the English coaches and players involved gained plenty from the experience. He has diplomatically resisted the temptation to consult Geoff Parling, the recent Australia assistant coach now in charge at Leicester, but says the intensity of the tour has had “a big impact” on his coaching approach.</p> <p>“If you’re working with such elite players, you can’t help but learn, because they’re usually the best teachers. I absolutely loved it, learned loads, we had a great time and we won. I think the players have noticed a difference in the lads who were lucky enough to go on a Lions tour. Until you’ve been on one you probably can’t feel like it. And the group who were in Argentina have also definitely grown. So the two have come back together really nicely.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/may/20/bring-back-that-bazball-feeling-mccullum-asks-england-to-reconnect-with-fans-zimbabwe-test-cricket">Bring back that Bazball feeling: McCullum wants England to reconnect with fans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wigglesworth’s role with England has changed with him now presiding over the team’s defence, with specialist input from Joe El-Abd and Byron McGuigan. A year ago Australia took advantage of some defensive uncertainty <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/09/england-australia-autumn-nations-series-rugby-union-match-report">to win 42-37</a> but the visitors may find fewer holes this time. “We definitely want a dynamic defence,” said Wigglesworth, also hoping to encourage his players to respond positively in adversity.</p> <p>“What I love about the game of rugby is that every game is different and can be won in different ways. Is it wet? What’s the referee doing? All these things go into the melting pot.” The former Saracens and Sale scrum-half is also adamant that empowering the players is the way ahead for England rather than constantly micromanaging them.</p> <p>“What I’m not going to do is go this defence has to change because of me and what I believe. The more we grow together, the more we know what everyone wants from each other and what’s going to make us a really good team. Then the more the players get to take a lead on that. Eventually you get to that sweet spot of empowerment that is productive, not empowerment that is setting them up to fail.”</p>
