<p>August is a tricky time to buy clothes. Shops are winding down their summer sales and introducing new season collections, but there’s still at least another month of good weather. Yet you don’t want to double down on summery separates <em>too </em>much, because autumn/winter is just around the corner.</p> <p>That’s why it’s the best time to start buying transitional pieces – those you can wear whether the temperature’s in the 30s or the low teens. Think about clothes that lend themselves to layering, such as an Oxford shirt. You could wear it over a tank top with trousers for a nice dinner fit on holiday, but it works just as well under a blazer when the weather changes. Similarly, a lightweight knit could be worn around your shoulders, over a T-shirt or even across your front<em> </em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/nicholas-hoult-superman-stylish-press-tour">a la Nicholas Hoult</a>.</p> <p>Try to buy natural fibres where you can, too. Anything made using human-made textiles (polyester, nylon, rayon etc) tends to be less breathable, so it’s a one-way ticket to sweat patches. Stick to cotton, linen, merino wool or even cashmere, which regulate your temperature more effectively whether you’re too hot or too cold.</p> <p>Or, to save you some time and effort, here’s my top pick of the best pieces to see you through this season and beyond. You, and your future wardrobe, can thank me later.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>A striped Oxford shirt </strong><strong>to wear year-round </strong></h2>    <p><strong>Arket relaxed poplin shirt</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.arket.com/en-gb/product/relaxed-poplin-shirt-bluewhite-1255889005/" > £75 at Arket </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.1255889005.html" > £63.75 at H&amp;M </a>  <p>I wear striped Oxford shirts more than anything else in my wardrobe – and Scandi high-street retailer Arket always has a good selection. Dress them up with trousers or down with jeans; wear them with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/25/best-mens-short-shorts-uk">short shorts</a> in summer; or with a blazer in winter – you can even wear them to work. You can make them appropriate for pretty much any situation.</p> <p>Stripes are trending for spring/summer 2026, too – just look at Dior, Saint Laurent, Wales Bonner and Emporio Armani – so even though it’s a timeless buy, it will also make you look like a menswear pro right now.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>A cap for all seasons</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Gant </strong><strong>cotton twill cap</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.cho.co.uk/products/gant-mens-high-shield-cotton-twill-cap" > £25.60 at Cho </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.gant.co.uk/shield-high-cotton-twill-cap-black/7325708026552.html" > £40 at Gant </a>  <p>Baseball caps have obvious benefits in summer, but they’re also useful when the sun’s not shining. They’re a stylish alternative to woollen hats, still delivering warmth and keeping the rain out of your eyes if you get caught in a shower.</p> <p>There’s loads to choose from, but I like six-panel constructions, which feel a little less structured than those with five. This Gant cap adds understated embroidery and a hidden pouch for the adjustable strap, which is a plus. </p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>The perfect versatile smart shoe</strong></h2>    <p><strong>GH Bass </strong><strong>penny </strong><strong>loafers</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.stuartslondon.com/g-h-bass-weejun-larson-penny-loafers-black-p45981/s315148" > £99 at Stuarts </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.farfetch.com/uk/shopping/men/gh-bass-co-weejuns-larson-penny-loafers-item-14844954.aspx" > £160 at Farfetch </a>  <p>Whenever you’re faced with a smart-casual dress code, you’ll want a pair of loafers to hand. No matter what time of year, they have the ability to make anything look elevated, whether you pair them with a T-shirt and jeans, a shirt and shorts, or a hoodie and work pants.</p> <p>My favourite silhouette is penny loafers – GH Bass is credited with popularising with this particular style (the Weejuns), which the brand first released in 1936. If you want something dressier, you could try <a href="https://dukeanddexter.com/products/wilde-black-bit-loafer">horsebit loafers</a> instead.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>A great pair of jeans</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Levi’s 501 jeans</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/levis-501-original-straight-jeans-stonewash/p857127" > £80 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.levi.com/GB/en_GB/clothing/men/501-levis-original-jeans/p/005010114" > £90 at Levi’s </a>  <p>A strong pair of jeans is a great investment. You can wear them with anything bar formal wear, and they last for a <em>really </em>long time – so it’s one of the best categories to buy secondhand, too (check <a href="https://www.beyondretro.com/collections/men-jeans">Beyond Retro</a>, <a href="https://www.rokit.co.uk/collections/mens-vintage-jeans">Rokit</a> and <a href="https://www.vinted.co.uk/catalog/257-jeans">Vinted</a>). </p> <p>Levi’s always has an amazing selection to choose from, but you can’t beat the 501, the brand’s OG straight leg silhouette. It’s been popular for more than 150 years (since 1873, to be exact), so chances are it’s not going out of style any time soon.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The cashmere sweatshirt that’s not just for winter</h2>    <p><strong>Rise &amp; Fall cashmere sweatshirt</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://riseandfall.co/products/mens-cashmere-sweatshirt" > £220 at Rise &amp; Fall </a>  <p>This might sound crazy, but a lightweight cashmere knit can be just as good in summer as winter. It’s lightweight. It’s comfy. And it helps regulate your temperature because it’s breathable.</p> <p>This Rise &amp; Fall sweatshirt lends itself to the transitional season with a loose, oversized fit, a relaxed dropped shoulder and a rolled hem that means it’s nice and airy. And if you get too warm, you can just throw it over your shoulders.</p> <h2><strong>***</strong></h2> <h2><strong>The low-profile trainers</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Onitsuka Tiger Serrano</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.onitsukatiger.com/gb/en-gb/serrano/p/1183b400-200.html" > £120 at Onitsuka Tiger </a>  <p>Retro trainers have been a hot topic for a few years (did someone say Samba?). This year’s update is even lower profile, giving them a smaller sole and making them even <em>more </em>lightweight – so they’re a great swap for sandals as things start to cool down. If, like me, you’ve been feeling a little Adidas Samba fatigue, Onitsuka Tiger’s Mexico 66 are a great alternative.</p> <p><em><strong>For more footwear ideas, check out our guide to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/22/guide-to-best-fashion-trainers">the best trainers</a></strong></em></p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>The boxy T-shirt</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Eme Studios </strong><strong>navy oversized tee</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://emestudios.com/en/products/ecc-navy-oversized-tee" > £50 at Eme Studios </a>  <p>There’s nothing worse than having the same T-shirt as <em>everyone </em>else (unless it’s <em>that</em> <a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E465185-000/00">Uniqlo Airism T-shirt</a>, naturally), so it’s worth seeking out independent brands. Eme Studios has been trending recently, worn by everyone from Josh O’Connor to Jaden Smith and Evan Mock. This design has a boxy fit that’s just as perfect for showing off short shorts as classic work pants and jeans.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>The classic tracksuit bottoms</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Adicolor Classics Firebird tracksuit bottoms</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.asos.com/adidas-originals/adidas-originals-firebird-track-pants-in-black/prd/204445780" > From £30 at Asos </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/adicolor-classics-firebird-track-tracksuit-bottoms/JP2539.html" > £38.50 at Adidas </a>  <p>Most guys have a pair of sports shorts to wear around the house. If you’d like something similar that you could <em>also </em>wear for a flight or even to pop to the shops, tracksuit bottoms are the answer<strong> </strong>– and they’re having a moment, with sporty separates big on the spring/summer 2025 runways at Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Moschino. The best on the market? Adidas’s Firebird has a comfy straight leg and retro-inspired details. It comes in a rainbow of colours, so you’re covered regardless of your preference.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Trousers for all weathers</h2>    <p><strong>Uniqlo pleated wide trousers</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.uniqlo.com/uk/en/products/E462429-000/00" > £39.90 at Uniqlo </a>  <p>There are a few occasions when shorts just won’t do, even in the heat. But many trousers don’t lend themselves to hot climates. Enter Uniqlo’s pleated wide trousers. They’re lightweight. They’re loose. They’re flowy. And, because they’re tailored, they also look smart. And they’ll look great with a cosy jumper when winter comes.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Classic wireframe sunglasses</h2>    <p><strong>Jimmy Fairly the Ben sunglasses</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.jimmyfairly.com/en-gb/products/m228-m1s-ben" > £135 at Jimmy Fairly </a>  <p>Buying high-street sunglasses can be tricky towards the end of the season, but there are a few brands that offer quality designs at a great price. Jimmy Fairly is one of my favourites. Designs like these wire frames feel classic, so they’re a safe bet all year round – unlike statement colours and XL designs, which may feel particularly summer-coded.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Swap citrus notes for woody accords</h2>    <p><strong>&amp;Horace eau de parfum, 50ml</strong></p>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://horace.com/en/product/and-horace-eau-de-parfum" > £62 at Horace </a>  <p>With fewer balmy nights on the horizon, you may want to change your lightweight spritz to one more woody or aromatic – but that doesn’t go as heavy as oud or leather. &amp;Horace has the perfect balance. Often compared to <a href="https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/le-labo-santal-33-eau-de-parfum-rm-50ml/13319661/">Le Labo’s Santal 33</a>, it combines a base of sandalwood with bergamot, white pepper and tobacco for a fragrance that’s at once crisp and warm.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Peter Bevan is a stylist and fashion journalist covering menswear, womenswear and beauty.
