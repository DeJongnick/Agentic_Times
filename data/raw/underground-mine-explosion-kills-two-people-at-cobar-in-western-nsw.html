These are two families – their lives will be impacted for ever.”</p> <p>The NSW premier, Chris Minns, extended his condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of the workers who died.</p> <p>“This is a heartbreaking day for the Cobar community and will be felt across the entire mining industry,” he said.</p> <p>“We understand investigations are still under way. The number one priority in any mine must be safety.
