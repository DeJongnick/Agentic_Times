It was bought in August 1944 – the month of the liberation of Paris – and remained in the same private collection ever since, but was shown to the public for the first time this week by the Parisian auction house where it will go under the hammer in October. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/18/picasso-painting-hidden-for-80-years-auction-paris">Read the full story here</a></p> <h2>What we learned</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/14/rosalyn-drexler-obituary">The remarkable Rosalyn Drexler juggled three careers, making polemical pop art, writing plays and novels and professional wrestling</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/15/theatre-picasso-review-pablo-bullfights-raging-genius">Tate Modern’s new Picasso show is a riotous five-star triumph</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/18/joy-gregory-artist-photographer-interview-whitechapel-gallery-london-exhibition">Photographer Joy Gregory’s retrospective unveils a new work so long in the making some of its participants have died</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/16/palestinian-artist-samia-halaby-on-being-cancelled-by-her-own-us-alma-mater-munch-award-artistic-freedom-7-october-attacks">Palestinian painter Samia Halaby brings an analytic eye to abstraction</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/15/paul-cocksedge-nelsons-column-view-london-design-festival">An installation in Trafalgar Square affords everyone the same view as Nelson</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/16/nicholas-grimshaws-architecture-eden-project">Architect Nicholas Grimshaw, who has died, influenced the way Britain moved, worked and shopped</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/12/im-completely-invested-rochdale-council-pulls-out-of-us-actors-ancestral-home-restoration">The renovation of stately home “Downton Shabby” has pit a US actor against Rochdale council</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/17/cartoonist-edizon-musavuli-comic-drc-baraka-and-the-unpredictable-life-of-goma">Graphic artist Edizon Musavuli has made a stunning comic strip of life in the Congo</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/sep/17/segregation-swines-and-social-gatherings-a-slice-of-black-life-in-texas-in-pictures">Community photographers played a valuable part in immortalising Black lives in small-town Texas</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/12/dennis-potter-hilary-lloyd-very-high-frequency-review-studio-voltaire-london">Hilary Lloyd’s enchanted installation takes a sideways look into the world of playwright Dennis Potter</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/sep/18/clarks-opens-up-a-shoebox-of-memories-with-museum-to-mark-200th-year">School shoes and Desert Boots spark memories in a museum celebrating two centuries of Clarks footwear</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/15/gaza-biennale-new-york-exhibition">The Gaza Biennale, a travelling exhibition of work by Palestinian artists, has reached New York</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2> <p><strong>The Banquet of Cleopatra by </strong><strong>Giovanni Battista Tiepolo</strong><strong>, 1740s</strong></p>    <p>You can feel the light and space of Venice in this oil sketch of a moment from ancient history, when Cleopatra was said to have dissolved a pearl in vinegar to show how little she thought of wealth. It may be a study for a fresco in a Venetian palace: it glows with a sense of the Venetian art tradition, directly evoking famous Renaissance artists such as Titian and Veronese. The way we look up the steps towards the blue melting sky recalls the airy upward view in Titian’s group portrait of the <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/titian-the-vendramin-family">Vendramin family</a>, also in the National Gallery: but the main model is Veronese’s <a href="https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010064382">Wedding at Cana</a>, in the Louvre. Tiepolo recreates this huge painting’s depiction of a banquet between lofty classical buildings. But his painting is even more airy and light than its Renaissance inspirations, inviting you to float in a shimmering fairytale atmosphere.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/giovanni-battista-tiepolo-the-banquet-of-cleopatra">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in </strong><strong>touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
