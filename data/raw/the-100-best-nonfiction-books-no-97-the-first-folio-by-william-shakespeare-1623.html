<p>In 1612, a contemporary of Shakespeare’s, the playwright Thomas Heywood, published <em>An Apology for Actors</em>, in which he expressed a patriotic sentiment about the English language, boastful at the time, which now seems unexceptional:</p> <p><em>Our English tongue, which hath been the most harsh, uneven and broken language of the world... is now continually refined, every writer striving in himself to add a new flourish unto it; so that it is grown into a most perfect and composed language.</em></p> <p>The coming of age of English at the beginning of the 17th century, after a golden generation of extraordinary growth and innovation, is symbolised by the publication of a landmark edition that the playwright himself had never bothered with in his own lifetime. Indeed, it was not until seven years after his death, thanks to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/jul/13/theatre.shakespeare" title=""><em>First Folio</em></a>, that his work began slowly to acquire the canonical status it enjoys today.</p> <p>Towards the end of November 1623, the bookseller Edward Blount, who traded at the sign of the Black Bear near St Paul’s, finally held in his hands the text of a great volume for which he had long been waiting: <em>Mr William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories &amp; Tragedies. Published according to the True Originall Copies</em>. In the words of one critic: “It is hard to overstate the importance of this literary, cultural and commercial moment.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/08/sherlock-holmes-of-the-library-cracks-shakespeare-identity">How ‘Sherlock of the library’ cracked the case of Shakespeare’s identity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book now known as the <a href="https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/shakespeares-first-folio" title=""><em>First Folio</em></a> (the first authoritative edition of Shakespeare’s plays) established “Shakespeare” for all time and it did this in two principal ways. First, it collects some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Folio" title="">36 plays</a>, including 18 scripts (notably <em>Macbeth</em>, <em>Julius Caesar</em>, <em>As You Like It</em> and <em>The Tempest</em>) which would be otherwise unknown. The trove of work thus assembled gave posterity not just a cast of immortal characters (Bottom, Falstaff, Lear, Portia, Jaques, Prospero et al), but also a heap of new words (including, for example, catastrophe, exaggerate, assassinate, indifference, monopoly and paradox).</p> <p>Second, it definitively connects his contemporary Ben Jonson (who declared his rival to be “the soul of the age”) and some of the actors who had first performed these plays with the historical person, the playwright himself, a figure helpfully illustrated by a famous frontispiece, the engraved portrait of the artist that has become an icon of “Shakespeare studies”.</p> <p>Other facts about the <em>First Folio</em>, a canon of incomparable power and authority, and the text that would help launch Shakespeare’s global literary afterlife are indisputable: both its value (somewhere north of $5m in rare books’ sales) and its comparative rarity (approximately 240 copies survive worldwide in public and private collections). This <em>First Folio</em> also does not include collaborations such as <em>Pericles</em> or <em>The Two Noble Kinsmen</em>. On the other hand, it does establish three categories for Shakespeare’s work – comedies, histories and tragedies – that survive to the present. Furthermore, it promotes a seductive myth of the artist’s genius, as “a happy imitator of nature”. According to John Heminges and Henry Condell, the two actors from the acting company the King’s Men responsible for putting this volume together: “His mind and hand went together and what he thought he uttered with that easiness that we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers.”</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>It’s been hard for some to accept that a man from the lower orders could be the greatest playwright who ever lived</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is a particularly tantalising reference. All the contemporary, working manuscript materials of Shakespeare’s plays are lost. We have his signature on several legal documents but – apart from one scene, his contribution to <em>Sir Thomas More</em> – nothing in his hand: no prompt copy, no printer’s proofs, nothing. As so often with Shakespeare, when you look closely at his work, you find layer upon layer of mystery, entwined with fathomless ambiguity.</p> <p>The <em>First Folio</em> does, however, have one significant and unequivocal characteristic. Unlike Shakespeare’s producers, Heminges and Condell were determined to promote the poet’s authorship. The name of Shakespeare had not been much of a selling point among Elizabethan playgoers, as the sometimes anonymous Quarto editions of his work indicate. For this Jacobean edition, however, his publishers wanted to create a literary artefact, a legacy volume. This, triumphantly, is what the <em>First Folio </em>achieves. After 1623, Shakespeare and his works are on the march across the English-speaking world.</p> <p>Which brings us to that frontispiece by the Dutch engraver Martin Droeshout. As the Shakespeare scholar Emma Smith has noted, this portrait “exists in three separate states”, indicating the trouble taken with the likeness. Droeshout’s engraving projects what Smith calls “an abiding sense that the man and his plays must be deeply interconnected… The book [the <em>First Folio</em>] presents us with a person, a personality, through his work.” In thus branding their volume, his publishers were leaning on a secure and careful image of Shakespeare himself to encourage its market and champion its contents.</p> <p>This in turn, brings us back to Ben Jonson, whose salute to Shakespeare faces the Droeshout portrait. Jonson’s role is crucial because his testament to Shakespeare and his work dominates the opening page of the <em>First Folio</em>. “Who is Ben Jonson?” we might ask. In brief, he is Shakespeare’s great rival, a playwright who had already gone to great lengths to oversee a collected edition of his own dramatic works, a man convinced of his own importance, mildly obsessed with posterity. Garrulous, argumentative, jealous, proud and deeply committed to exposing hypocrisy and corruption, Jonson is never a man to kowtow to nobility or privilege.</p> <p>How does Jonson make his contribution to this collected works? He writes in strikingly generous (almost awestruck) terms about a man he had mercilessly satirised in his lifetime. Opposite the portrait of his friend, he identifies the image of a writer whose work, he declares, far surpasses the quotidian limits of his ordinary life. It’s Jonson who coins the “<a href="https://shakespeareoxfordfellowship.org/waugh-on-jonsons-sweet-swan-of-avon/" title="">sweet Swan of Avon</a>” (ie the declaration that the author of the <em>First Folio</em> is from Stratford), in his dedicatory poem, and it’s Jonson who declares that he is “the applause, the delight, the wonder of our stage”, and then – a few lines later – that he is “not of an age, but for all time” and claims him, with proprietorial certainty, as “my gentle Shakespeare”. Here, beyond question, is one great literary figure paying posthumous tribute to another. This must confound those conspiracy theorists for whom “Shakespeare” is simply an alias, an elaborate code for other hands.</p> <p>You have to ask yourself, confronted with this documentary evidence, why on earth would Jonson, who never took instruction from anyone, who was notoriously awkward and who had competed with Shakespeare throughout his professional life, take part in a cover-up.</p> <p>There are countless examples of how impossible it is to imagine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/08/sherlock-holmes-of-the-library-cracks-shakespeare-identity" title="">Sir Francis Bacon</a> or Edward de Vere (the 17th Earl of Oxford) or anyone else writing these plays. Tiny details betray the work of a man steeped in everyday life: for instance, the brilliant detail from the history plays of the problem of fleas breeding in the corners of taverns where men have been pissing.</p> <p>This brings us back to Shakespeare’s provincial origins. As many have noted, it’s been hard for some to accept that a man from the lower orders, not formally educated at Oxford or Cambridge, could be a genius, the greatest playwright who ever lived. Combined with a natural human appetite for mystery, this has flourished into the “Anonymous” fantasy maintained by the Shakespeare-deniers. The <em>First Folio</em> is the obvious refutation of this nonsense. In the real world of serious literary criticism, it remains, in the words of the RSC’s <em>Complete Works</em>, an edition based on the <em>First Folio</em>, “unquestionably the most important single book in the history of world drama”.</p> <h2>A signature sentence<br></h2> <p>We have but collected them [the plays] and done an office to the dead to procure his orphans guardians, without ambition either of self-profit or fame, only to keep the memory of so worthy a friend and fellow alive as was our SHAKESPEARE, by humble offer of his plays to your most noble patronage.</p> <h2>Three to compare<br></h2> <p>Stephen Greenblatt: <a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/will-in-the-world.html" title=""><em>Will in the World</em></a> (2004)<br>James Shapiro: <a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/contested-will.html" title=""><em>Contested Will</em></a> (2010)<br>Emma Smith: <a href="https://www.guardianbookshop.com/making-of-shakespeare-s-first-folio.html" title=""><em>The Making of Shakespeare’s First Folio</em></a> (2015)<br></p>
