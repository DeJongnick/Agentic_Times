<p>The adaptation of movies into musicals continues apace. The latest addition to this booming subgenre is 2004 romcom 13 Going on 30, with a book by the original screenwriters, Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, and the backing of star Jennifer Garner as executive producer.</p> <p>As with the film, how much you enjoy it will probably depend on how much you surrender to your teenage self. The setup is swiftly established. After being humiliated by the popular kids at her 13th birthday party, Jenna Rink rejects her adoring best friend Matty and instead wishes to be “thirty, flirty and thriving”. The next thing she knows she has a grown-up New York apartment, a hot boyfriend and a job editing her favourite fashion magazine. But is this dreamlike adult existence all it seems?</p> <p>The silliness of this premise is suited to the heightened register of musical theatre and the creators know it. Both the colourful adolescent world of cheerleaders and crushes and the camply cut-throat environment of the magazine industry are enjoyably amped up in Andy Fickman’s production, with fun and spirited choreography from Jennifer Weber. Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner’s poppy songs are solid though not particularly memorable, with the exception of teen girl empowerment anthem Own It.</p>    <p>The essential takeaway – that you should embrace your true self, dorkiness and all – is simple and saccharine. But occasional knowing winks cut through the sentimentality and the performers bring much-needed charm to the earnest material. Lucie Jones is lovably goofy as Jenna, contrasted with David Hunter’s world-weary Matty – a man who no longer believes in soulmates and fireworks – and Grace Mouat’s deliciously catty turn as Jenna’s frenemy Lucy. They’re often accompanied on stage by the excellent young cast as reminders of the more hopeful, innocent versions of themselves they’ve left behind.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/sep/26/50-first-dates-the-musical-review-the-other-palace-london">50 First Dates: The Musical review – sunny ensemble serve up breezy romcom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As always, the question is: did this need to be adapted? While Fickman and co have done a decent job of transforming the film into a musical that stands alone, it’s hard not to wish this talent could be turned to new stories. But maybe that’s just thirtysomething me talking, while my inner 13-year-old bops to the music.</p> <p>• At <a href="https://www.1330musical.com/">Manchester Opera House</a> until 12 October</p>
