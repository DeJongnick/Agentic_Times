<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/rachel-maddow">Rachel Maddow</a>, the most influential host on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/msnbc">MSNBC</a>, called out parent company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/comcast">Comcast</a> on Monday night for being among the corporations that contributed financially to the White House’s expensive East Wing ballroom construction project.</p> <p>Last week, the White House released a list of 37 large corporations – including Google and Apple – and individual donors that have contributed to the $300m ballroom project. But only one, Comcast, owns and operates media companies, including the left-leaning MSNBC.</p> <p>The announcement has created an awkward on-air dynamic for the hosts and journalists at the network, who have covered the backlash to the contributions, which have raised concerns about quid pro quo.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-reaction">Trump’s ballroom blitz sparks chorus of disgust: ‘The perfect symbol’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“For every Avelo Airlines, for every Paul Weiss law firm, and all the other law firms that did corrupt deals with Trump, for every corporation – like our parent company for another hot minute, Comcast – that wants to pay for Trump to take a literal wrecking ball, excuse me, I mean an excavator to the White House,” Maddow said on Monday, “those public-facing companies should know there’s a cost in terms of their reputation with the American people.</p> <p>“There may be a cost to their bottom line when they do things against American values, against the public interest, because they want to please Trump or buy him off or profit somehow from his authoritarian overthrow of our democracy.”</p> <p>Lawrence O’Donnell, another primetime MSNBC host, also called out Comcast for only being concerned about its financial interests and ability to merge with or acquire other companies in the future. O’Donnell called the destruction of the East Wing “a unique presidential crime against our history and our culture”.</p> <p>“Comcast – the current but not for long owner of the company I now work for – doesn’t think it’s a big enough business,” he said. “Comcast is committed to nothing but Comcast.”</p> <p>Maddow and O’Donnell referenced the temporary nature of Comcast’s control of their company. MSNBC is scheduled to be formally spun off from its parent, and to become part of a new company called Versant, in a few months. Starting 15 November, the network will become known as MS NOW.</p> <p>Stephanie Ruhle was the first MSNBC host to raise concerns about the donation during her late-night show last week. “Here’s the issue: Donors are paying for it. Corporations are paying for it. Comcast, our Comcast, is one of those that are underwriting this,” she told viewers last Wednesday. “Shouldn’t that be more concerning to the American people? Because there ain’t no company out there writing a check just for goodwill.”</p> <p>And a guest on the network, the Atlantic writer David Frum, suggested on MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace’s show that Comcast likely has ulterior motives for the donation.</p> <p>“Everyone who is giving the money, the quarter of a billion dollars to pay for [Trump’s new ballroom], with all due respect to Comcast – thank you for the hospitality – is doing so in expectation of something in return,” said Frum. “They’re not doing it for love of ballroom dancing.”</p> <p>Journalists who work for NBC News, which is also owned by Comcast, have noted in reports that their parent company is among the contributors.</p> <p>Jennifer Khoury, a spokesperson for Comcast, did not reply to a request for comment about the donation and the MSNBC host backlash to it. MSNBC also declined to comment.</p>
