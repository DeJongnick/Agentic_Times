<p>Good morning. All eyes are on Tehran as it weighs up options for retaliation after US airstrikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities. Despite global calls for diplomacy and de-escalation, Israel is escalating its own bombing campaign against Iran.</p> 
<p>It’s a terrifying wait for Australians with loved ones still trying to leave the Middle East, as the UN security council prepares to meet for talks over the crisis.</p> 
<p>And, closer to home, there are warnings that Australia is doomed to lose its struggle against nicotine if officials push a prohibition-style approach instead of focusing on harm reduction.</p>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>Iran’s Revolutionary Guards has warned the US to “expect regrettable responses” to its airstrikes on the country’s nuclear sites. However, Iran’s proxy militias across the Middle East are sending mixed signals about their willingness to strike US targets. Their apparent reluctance or inability to come to Iran’s aid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/22/iran-proxy-militias-may-be-unable-help-tehran-decides-strike-us">will limit Tehran’s options if it opts to escalate the conflict</a> with the US, Jason Burke writes.</p> 
<h2>Not the news</h2> 
<p>There are two kinds of readers: those who would choose death before dog-ears and those whose books bear the marks of a life well read. But a new generation of readers are finding a way to combine both approaches by reviving the art and romance of marginalia, by transforming their books and reading experiences into #aesthetic artefacts. Caitlin Welsh looks at how “annotating” books <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/23/marginalia-mania-how-annotating-books-went-from-big-no-no-to-booktoks-next-trend">went from a big no-no to BookTok’s next trend</a>.</p>
