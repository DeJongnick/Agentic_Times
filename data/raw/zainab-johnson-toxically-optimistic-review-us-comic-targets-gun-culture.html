<p>‘I’ve got a gun.” Nice to be pitched, with that opening line, straight into a show declaring itself different from the others. Zainab Johnson’s maiden fringe set – although she’s already a big noise in the US – gives an account of how she came to own a firearm. It’s not an explicitly political show – if a show about gun ownership by a black, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/09/muslim-americans-september-11-keith-ellison-zainab-johnson-mehdi-hasan">Muslim, American</a> female is allowed to be anything but. But Toxically Optimistic does invite engagement with some searching questions about guns, their use, and the safety they supposedly ensure – even if, so poised is Johnson’s delivery, you barely notice it doing so.</p> <p>Hers is that particularly American style of standup that can feel too polished for UK tastes: smiling, slick and a little bit frictionless. If a British comedian tells a dating story, you can bet they’ll be the butt of the joke; when Johnson does, it’s to lord it over the short guy who wants but can’t have her. Small wonder she is, by her own account, an eternal optimist – even if that quality is now to be tested when a friend tells her, apropos of her buying her own house, that she should acquire a gun without delay.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/aug/19/liam-withnail-big-strong-boy-review-edinburgh-tour">Liam Withnail: Big Strong Boy review – look back in laughter at misfit youth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is that so? Johnson resists, and keeps resisting, even when her friend drags her to a shooting range, even when she imagines the home invasion scenario that might make a gun worthwhile. She asks herself questions about fear, with reference to an odd anecdote about a homeless man and a “bucket of shit”, and about safety, which has arguably been secured, but at what cost?</p> <p>Delivered with authority by the Harlem comic, the tone is smooth and philosophical, with the safety catch coming off only occasionally – see the excellent joke explaining why she takes notes when out on a first date. The show’s final quarter pivots to a different subject entirely – and a less compelling one, too, notwithstanding that Johnson justifies it persuasively with a take-that reveal at the end. If you didn’t know she was armed and dangerous before, that fine flourish of an ending proves it.</p> <p>• At <a href="https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/zainab-johnson-toxically-optimistic">Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh</a>, until 24 August<br>• All our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/edinburgh-festival-2025+tone/reviews">Edinburgh festival reviews</a></p>
