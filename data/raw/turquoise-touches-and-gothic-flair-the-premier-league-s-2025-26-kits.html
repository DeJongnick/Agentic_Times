<h1>Turquoise touches and gothic flair: the Premier League’s 2025-26 kits</h1>

<p>Football strips nowadays are big business. Especially for the not insignificant number of clubs flogging shirts for £85+ a pop. As sport and fashion become ever more intertwined – Jack Grealish as an ambassador for Gucci; Son<a href="https://row.burberry.com/c/collaborations/son-heung-min/"> </a>Heung-min for Burberry; Kalvin Phillips in <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS6jbGkO2HBADoXvTfk0UAaUyVsIpkczcVBxeY2ul3Wafv1DJ9YgYTU5q0v52E8cWqiuqQ&amp;usqp=CAU">those massive Loewe boots</a> – mainstream football’s interest with clothes has moved on from just <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/luxury/2018/01/07/TELEMMGLPICT000001245244_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq9zz84avcQxL4oZeFUKZ5NoWi7KpiIUwHO7BESai7hVs.jpeg?imwidth=350">David Beckham in a sarong</a>. It is a state of affairs that <a href="https://www.nss-sports.com/en/lifestyle/32898/guardiola-man-city-catwalk">former catwalk model</a> Pep Guardiola no doubt appreciates.</p> <p>And, after a couple of years of subpar kit designs – running the gamut from insipid to truly horrifying – the 2025-26 Premier League season has upped its sartorial game. All-black away strips and turquoise touches have proved popular; while manufacturers still insist on “taking inspiration” from home stadium architecture and surroundings. (The success of this varies immensely; but Everton, Leeds, and Burnley have all nailed it this time around.) No brand has let the side(s) down, but the Adidas designers have done especially well with a series of understated new strips. The smaller labels have also impressed. And it is pleasing to see the three returnees dressed up for the occasion.</p> <p>2025-26 <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/en/news/3147426">is due to be the final season</a> that betting companies are allowed to serve as front-of-shirt sponsors, but judging by the number still present they will have to be dragged from the pitch kicking and screaming. Here are all the looks – taking in sand, sky, and sea – to soon emerge from the tunnel.</p> <h2>Arsenal</h2>    <p>The Gunners launched their new home strip on a heavily vignetted, blood-red <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/arsenal-launch-new-adidas-202526-home-kit">landing page</a>, complete with anatomical heart beating on the screen; an incongruously dark vibe until you consider that Mikel Arteta does indeed have <a href="https://img.a.transfermarkt.technology/portrait/big/47620-1681398729.jpg?lm=1">something of the night</a> about him. A subtle repeating motif on the shirt is a similarly eldritch, gothic <em>A</em> (a nod to the typeface used for the club’s 1949-50 “Victoria Concordia Crescit” <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f7/Arsenal_F.C._crest_%281949%E2%80%932002%29.png">crest</a>), offset by a crisp white collar and sleeve. Said sleeve is still urging us to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cp3w76rl476o">Visit Rwanda</a>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://footballfashion.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Arsenal-2025-2026-adidas-Jersey-4.jpg">away </a>kit is also good: a royal blue lightning bolt-ish pattern that harks back to the <a href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRnsPXWIQ2tgFOy7_91srpnxSo1BIeK-TUkqfdzMbPp1X9oDi1C6WpIvx6HxdFqo4OJPxRNGHmwdDW6VYuuP-sU6G7UBiKFat9YpPjdkc84IoMDehp7HNqbFg">mid-90s’ on-the-road design</a>, and only mildly – unintentionally – reminds one of the Victoria line moquette. The beautiful, art deco-influenced <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjAAcUVx7Mg7-uxAPJVhMZJPI4r_kKzwoaj-IYOGOJ-GMBaL3yt75zHHJo5AWIsmo6vWCSuw-wSieBF-frAVG9hgbpHB8m8rwGeW_P6_yR60dyJfAMfqfFJc8eWqDXdV4lDPsWAHEEvS46Z6QqX1QM-tSBOg12EsL3OR8eFmXovpDU_zeG58ie3giady9gs/s1160/arsenal-25-26-third-kit%20%283%29.jpg">third kit</a> in cream and burgundy features the Adidas <a href="https://www.adidas.co.uk/blog/967644-adidas-logos-history-and-meaning">trefoil logo</a>, AKA the one that looks like the top half of a ganja leaf. Apart from that, you would be happy to take it home to your mum.</p> <p>Do not ask me why Arsenal need <em>five</em> goalkeeper shirts, but you will find David Raya in any of the following (deep breath): <a href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcRc1M1rNEnJaxLrRCyAaEslkkPE69ChvTpO90APA3hxsYahY6_VbJifVU5BsHDT4AWBNsU3jw-rN-5DifniPAv4ihXeK2BLqRqA9y1BMbgUfqtNG3_IKLb9XQ">green</a>; a slightly darker green; <a href="https://arsenaldirect.arsenal.com/Football-Shirts-and-Kit/Goalkeeper/Arsenal-adidas-25-26-Home-Goalkeeper-Shirt/p/MJI9544">yellow and red</a>; yellow and black; purple.</p> <h2>Aston Villa</h2>    <p>The sleeve of Villa’s Adidas home strip ostensibly “pays homage” to the club stadium. This seems to be a common – but too often shoddily executed – theme this year. But the Villans’ top actually does reference Villa Park in a way that is recognisable; the cuff features the same intricate gold design that adorns the <a href="https://www.santosfootballplanet.com/uploads/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Villa-Park-Shutterstock.jpg?v=1637803647">Holte End facade</a>. The main shirt colour way is the classic claret and blue; the shorts are white. The socks feature a gold “AV” monogram.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.avfc.co.uk/news/2025/may/22/aston-villa-and-adidas-reveal-2025-26-away-kit/">away fit</a> is a mostly black design with grey raglan sleeve. It is OK, I guess; but it does slightly remind one of when the printer runs out of colour ink. Unlike the <a href="https://www.footyheadlines.com/2024/11/aston-villa-25-26-third-kit.html">third kit</a>, which is basically what would happen if a toddler was let loose with purple and blue finger-paints. A joy.</p> <p>As for the home goalkeeper jersey: you know when the doctor asks what colour phlegm you are bringing up, in case you have pneumonia? Usually indicated by an intense green? Well, it is <a href="https://images.footballfanatics.com/aston-villa/aston-villa-adidas-goalkeeper-shirt-2025-26-long-sleeve-kids_ss5_p-202699152+pv-1+u-zchy0xronpchh1xytdox+v-2hks1zkmiiff9qdfvzqk.jpg?_hv=2&amp;w=1018">not looking good</a> for Emi Martínez (or his potential replacement) …</p> <h2>Bournemouth</h2>    <p>There is no more awkward sponsor logo than the “bj88” slapped on the front of the Cherries’ shirts. It is difficult to see past such misfortune to assess the Umbro-made kit itself, but suffice to say it consists of black and red vertical stripes. In a hint at the club’s beachside location, there is a delightful “rippled sand” effect within the stripes. (And, for anyone fancying their chances with a metal detector along the coastline, the collar and cuff boast a gold trim.)</p> <p>The <a href="https://superstore.afcb.co.uk/afc-bournemouth/away-kit-9?srsltid=AfmBOoqpavAWD0s9ATYare5xsR6lN8gxwlrIvmXKaT1PbbKeDz7b34Nk">away strip</a> is a throwback to the blue and black epoch – the Cherries if you’d packed them at the bottom of the shopping bag – with the crest and Umbro logo embroidered. Which is as it should be: I do not want to tell you how many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic_polyurethane">TPU</a> badges I have lost to bathroom radiators. The <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLEwJdn9vveDLhWO1xT5RvMNHt7ktlwSkn46UGjrwwEtPqshpUskX_pvmjhYLUrJotcFFHzfS1tqH0dYtx7tco3u6JdWPhxbL7W5bHSpHa2tVxPYzFKWNOW2c2C7lnSl5r0FFK0otOl47Xij2YGRfSYSHOSO-2IuxhdwpOKsLFiLyFXTdH7j4UxX1ct90m/s1000/bournemouth-25-26-kit%20%282%29.jpg">third kit</a> is pastel pink. The <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiuaIWCeRN7DVCM7YMc1UqAvBsAKObfJFb3Ty5aIZ_NoifcEU8QhuK6DMKWcJEaCo7emknj_dmBXytSTK2ul0GY7Y6qDJdvZPA0VhYznQMnZBEDhyphenhyphenDDxn7f85eic3k2t5JtIIedcDiAXP84ErPj2paHvCYVSQkRUghu3QLVMC_0LjHAwm2Zb8pmUrLLlQ0g/s600/bournemouth-25-26-home-kit%20%283%29.jpg">home goalkeeper kit</a> is a luminous green; the <a href="https://superstore.afcb.co.uk/images/web-products/department-thumbs/GK25WMSHIRTWA.jpg">away</a> a bright purple.</p> <h2>Brentford</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/tottenham-confirm-appointment-thomas-frank-new-manager">Thomas Frank’s departure</a> is not the only change for the Bees this year: their kit supplier, formerly Umbro, is now Joma. The Spanish brand has done well (what do you mean you have never heard of them? Do you not watch tennis players who rank in the low-tens?) The kit celebrates the centenary of the traditional red-and-white colour scheme with a breezy “100” signoff on the back of the collar (although it is giving “ran out of space at the bottom of the page” so the handwriting starts to slide into the margin).</p> <p>In keeping with the anniversary celebrations, the design echoes the 1925 strip; broad stripes with pinstripe edging. The collar is a modern take on the classic lace-up. Now, I do not know if there is a job-share situation going on at Joma, but while the home strip slaps, the away one is … well. The players will be running out in what I can only describe as a <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgKbIZTr6_9ASMrVeIAAhBhEunMJ5QS12c7qPl51FLv8GFcgs5txNs7nTaRqd5sqtx7I8Pe_2APd-N5PUrIL4zE2awTXWXfMtkvagldprNv5Lg-dOXt7AwdFGpT2Vbu3rFSpvns3tB8qkABl-OaJ1lNu64z8Dme-30D2HDQ7MI_gpGah7vEB5UdY6sdE73r/s1000/brentford-25-26-away-kit%20%285%29.jpg">soil-brown monstrosity</a>. (Maybe it is a literal grower.) The goalie outfit, meanwhile, is a bright pink number. The <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi76H60hvmmqiMMH4hta-3s8ZLoi7O61LKF5fwXWqhyzu0pwYU2l6BE1ibi73jwnmb1QzPYaviv3Fl41NJz8SkbK-jxjrvl0rtP-DWSNS1l9uhoK5MlMVEIFoQi3mphIaZ6g0xBJjgDzEN5euD1dTHJ6SjDLW70VmI8_Ec83nKQdwS0SyOMnTH_pM0OQh28/s1000/brentford-25-26-third-kit%20%281%29.jpg">third kit</a> is a little meh; a pale blue, salmon, and burgundy – hues borrowed from the club’s pre-red ‘n’ white era.</p> <h2>Brighton</h2>    <p>Brighton’s new home strip is the first ever to feature the colour of “Hyper Turq”. This is because “Hyper Turq” is a colour Nike has made up. As the name suggests, it is turquoise. It is a nice touch (including on the Nike swoosh and underarm panels) on what can – apologies – historically be a pretty dull blue-and-white affair. Plus <s>Hyper Turq</s> turquoise is the colour of Brighton’s seafront railings. The smart v-shaped collar bears the quote: “WE ARE BRIGHTON”.</p> <p>The round-necked <a href="https://footballfashion.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/brighton-hove-albion-2025-2026-nike-kit-4.jpg">away kit</a> is a lilac and mauve mix. Interestingly, both the Nike swoosh and crest are centrally aligned, which makes for a pleasingly streamlined aesthetic. In a rare example of club owners not trying to squeeze every last penny from loyal supporters, Brighton tend to repurpose the previous season’s away kit as the next third kit, which, at present, looks to be the case again (despite an earlier statement <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c8804m0pe1mo">saying otherwise</a>). The three <a href="https://shop.brightonandhovealbion.com/kit/gk-kit/">keeper kits</a> are in yellow, orange, and black. Nike did their best work this season in the “city by the sea” (embroidered on the back).</p> <h2>Burnley</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/apr/21/back-where-we-belong-leeds-and-burnley-savour-promotion-heroics">Welcome back</a>, lads. It is good to see you – especially because Castore has created some lovely new fits. The home shirt is in the traditional claret and features an ultra-fine topographical pattern representing the contours of Lancashire’s countryside and the heights of the Pennines. This actually works, unlike when manufactures “take inspiration” from something and then just whack on a standard, or unidentifiable, motif.</p> <p>The <a href="https://shop.burnleyfc.com/kit-c1/away-kit-2025-26-c242">away shirt</a> is sky blue and has a decoration resembling cirrus clouds (those are the streaky ones; yes, I did pay attention in GCSE geography – ask me about onion skin weathering, I beg you. Anyone) – although apparently they are meant to be sound waves. All in all it is a very soothing kit, as opposed to the multiple vibrant keeper strips, which strongly suggest attendance at the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/story/holi-festival-of-colors">Holi festival</a>. The third kit will be a much more hangover-friendly <a href="https://www.footballkitarchive.com/burnley-fc-2025-26-third-kit/399360/">black with gold trim</a>.</p> <h2>Chelsea</h2>    <p>Dolly Parton once <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/viva/culture/dolly-partons-most-fashionable-quotes/GPHJ3AOG4PF2KJLCQU7TWOZNIU/">described</a> her style as “costing a lot of money to look this cheap”; and it has to be said that the wealthier legacy clubs often seem to follow the same mantra. But Chelsea, celebrating their 120th anniversary, have scrubbed up well – if a little blandly – for the new season. Nike’s marketing spiel is that the jersey’s (extremely) subtle pattern “embodies the youthful spirit that has shaped west London”. <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/article/chelseas-youngest-ever-players">Reggie Walsh</a> – the club’s current 16-year-old squad member – will be pleased. They also managed to get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggs">Suggs</a> in the promo video. Madness.</p> <p>The kit is the usual heritage colour of dark blue, but has red and white underarm inserts in a modern twist. The shirt will also boast a gold <a href="https://centralnews.co.za/chelsea-football-club-launches-new-home-kit-for-2025-26-season-featuring-fifa-club-world-cup-champions-badge/">Club World Cup</a> winners’ badge. As in recent seasons, a front-of-shirt sponsor is absent. The club is <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/henryflynn/2024/11/26/why-chelsea-is-still-mulling-over-its-next-shirt-sponsor/">holding out</a> for a lucrative long-term deal – although not signing a short one in the meantime does not seem to make a massive amount of business sense, IMHO. Shirts do look so much better without giant, garish logos though – especially when the logos are those of gambling companies. The home keeper shirt comes in <a href="https://store.chelseafc.com/en/chelsea-nike-goalkeeper-stadium-shirt-2025-26/p-572268590902261779+z-8-3905208563">black</a>, and the away is green.</p> <p>The outfield away strip is much more interesting. Officially in the colours of “Phantom” (that’s white to you and me), and “Galactic Jade” (otherwise known as green) and red (red), the design is a nod to the club’s 1974-75 Magnificent Magyars-era <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQELg6UWDrxTOojEYrN8Hsfc5HbTcMz3llxtA&amp;s">away look</a>. There are also some centralised pinstripes to add flair. The third kit is yet to be released, but is rumoured to feature the <a href="https://www.footyheadlines.com/2024/11/chelsea-25-26-third-kit.html">1990s club crest</a>.</p> <h2>Crystal Palace</h2>    <p>The Italian brand Macron is again producing the Eagles’ fits. The home, of course, features the classic red-and-blue vertical stripes, but this time the stripes include white bands in between them for a refined feel. The cuffs are also white – as are the sleek shoulder panels. It is a classy kit; far nicer than <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjcBERdtrNctIKvqgBrE3lEOAxVSL3J8Xlvc5xRlIMu9o-9G4ZUu4vZ0a6qPasXkfR4P77kUodZ1BqRPPNzB2exJxF55NqV2Zqij4CUF0Fifr8uWe7rcJtVx53COnkdFHT-r-d_rXwpIhpE2AEP6alqBKN9ULdQ19JJaX1XFi6i2-1-PQ7vszURW2siymn0/s870/palace-25-26-home-kit%20%283%29.jpg">last season’s “experimental” effort</a> which looked for all the world like an 80s pub carpet. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cg5zpvr9739o?xtor=AL-72-%5Bpartner%5D-%5Bnewsbreak.com%5D-%5Bheadline%5D-%5Bsport%5D-%5Bbizdev%5D-%5Bisapi%5D">keeper kit</a> is a light green.</p> <p>The away kit, complete with Mandarin collar, is a <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgX38SfDj_2G7SZlyneChK_NNkhvkYTbaJJGDtrEiKF24tmfsavH-Wk3nQJTQWNMLyJFbdeFdMv8M0b_q3Od_YGia9p_4H3-ma5szX57Fl4zWNW-j6iEowTwFTFIHCuSpFiQ0KQS-npktmyKHXsk5KMm6aH9s_FGzOVmhMSIkv0WjsVNQPBV9ji4ORiQhU9/s1086/palace-25-26-away-kit%20%289%29.jpg">bold, gold affair</a> to celebrate the club’s jubilant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/18/crystal-palace-fa-cup-final-victory-wembley-fans">2025 FA Cup win</a>. The PR people are calling it the “Golden Eagle” kit, which is a pun I can 100% get behind. No update, at the time of writing, on the third look.</p> <h2>Everton</h2>    <p>Despite the Toffees finishing unexpectedly rather well last season (given the inauspicious start, anyway); being reunited with beloved manager David Moyes; and moving into a brand new stadium, the club has <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/45857888/everton-transfer-news-david-moyes-preseason-tour">struggled to secure</a> quality additions during the transfer window. But should they materialise, the new signings will have the privilege of wearing an attractive and intelligent Castore strip.</p> <p>Both the body and sleeve of the home shirt – in a familiar Everton blue – feature a prominent wave pattern to represent the River Mersey and the club’s new waterfront ground. The socks, paired with white shorts, showcase the silhouette of local landmark, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_Lock-Up">Prince Rupert’s Tower</a> (also an integral part of the club crest).</p> <p>The <a href="https://footballfashion.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/everton-2025-2026-kit.jpg">away strip</a> is a pale yellow for shirt and socks, with blue shorts. The cuff features a design that mirrors the railway line which used to serve Liverpool’s docklands. The third kit is rumoured to have a black base and Prince Rupert’s Tower on the chest instead of the club’s full badge. Meanwhile, Jordan Pickford will either be in a green jacquard number (<a href="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0KFIyu8UZC3e0y4z6rPnVzxbYlvu81QY57QjA7JpcXFz1KGPJSqTRrf3SMB_wlM2CyEcG0eEokUp2d3wCaysp2tCxdt6a8FIEuHcC6Vu9aEinYxrZYLvp">home</a>) or black (<a href="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcQN-9XpUtq94jHtLQsvNLogptMNey8i35vFSziewUYmUbivb_N8GXqW4N3YkppZ4VpCqEIoL-ytgBGrQBhANtt4eG4QFQLFXDs3BoSeH7e_gmsOU55klw8">away</a>).</p> <h2>Fulham</h2>    <p>Fulham have announced their “clean and contemporary” 2025-26 home strip; and clean and contemporary is an accurate description of the v-necked, zero-red, all-white fit (with piping, Adidas logo, and the brand’s famous stripes on the shoulder all in black). The aesthetically agreeable home jersey also features a <a href="https://images.webapi.fulhamfc.com/fit-in/1400x1400/0a7dab30-6955-11f0-a36c-3717dfe67213.jpg">rubber emblem</a> of Craven Cottage <a href="https://images.webapi.fulhamfc.com/fit-in/1400x1400/0a7dab30-6955-11f0-a36c-3717dfe67213.jpg">balcony’s wrought ironwork</a>. Compensating for the white-domination of the outfield look, the keeper will wear <a href="https://shop.fulhamfc.com/kit/goalkeeper-kit/adult/6445_fulham-2526-adult-home-gk-shirt.html">all red with metallic detail</a>.</p> <p>The away strip is also a looker, and heavily reminiscent of the club’s 1999-20 <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRKwQ_foypgiLSfjzoAQDE8dhOxvEl1ERoCSA&amp;s">lime green away </a>threads. It shows off an oversized retro collar and the club crest of the same era. Back in the day the club sponsor was an internet service provider called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Internet">Demon Internet</a>; a company which no longer exists, but turns out had a very prophetic name. No news yet on the third kit.</p> <h2>Leeds United</h2>    <p>The Leeds Adidas-made home kit stays traditional with the main colourway of white, blue, and yellow. But, consistent with a popular concept in kit design this year, there is a cute pattern inspired by the mosaic tile of the Lowfields Tunnel – the route Whites fans often take to Elland Road – which adds pizzaz to what is otherwise a simple but gratifyingly polished, attractive look for the club’s return to the top tier.</p> <p>The <a href="https://cdn.footballkitarchive.com/2025/07/17/vaU1hY58851vjqb.jpg">away strip</a> is predominantly blue with multiple yellow touches, including an all-yellow twist on sponsor Red Bull’s logo. The goalkeeper kits are in a lighter blue (<a href="https://shop.leedsunited.com/en/leeds-united-adidas-goalkeeper-shirt-2025-26/p-352246961059158562+z-95-1797426160">home</a>) and orange (<a href="https://images.footballfanatics.com/leeds-united/leeds-united-adidas-goalkeeper-shirt-2025-26_ss5_p-202794482+u-lki3lk33mmcqurh8qtgf+v-kvhjme1zdx7f6dheu1rq.jpg?_hv=2">away</a>), as well as <a href="https://images.footballfanatics.com/leeds-united/leeds-united-adidas-goalkeeper-shirt-2025-26_ss5_p-202794479+pv-1+u-eicsf63jgu5tdzcd9dkv+v-kjoiauviqass6hqnw8a0.jpg?_hv=2&amp;w=1018">deep purple</a>. The <a href="https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0807%2Fr1528867_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&amp;w=1140&amp;cquality=40&amp;format=jpg">third kit</a> is a few alcopops down; a dizzying, chaotic mishmash of the traditional three colours. But I rather like it; it is everything but dull.</p> <h2>Liverpool</h2>    <p>Liverpool start their season dealing with a maelstrom of emotions. There is the triumph of last season’s title win and plenty of exciting new faces – Florian Wirtz<strong> </strong>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremie_Frimpong">Jeremie Frimpong</a> among them<strong>. </strong>But there is tragedy too: the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/03/diogo-jota-obituary">death of Diogo Jota</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/26/man-arrested-car-crowd-liverpool-fc-football-fans">the incident</a> at the title parade that left scores of fans injured.</p> <p>Joining Wirtz et al is another addition to the club: Adidas. The brand has signed a <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/lfc-and-adidas-start-10-year-partnership-and-reveal-new-home-and-away-kits">10-year deal</a> with the club after Liverpool ended their five-year Nike stint. And a brand responsible for some of the club’s most iconic strips has hit the ground running: the home outfit is an all-red affair (officially “Strawberry Red”) with a white crewneck collar and cuff. The simplified <a href="https://www.liverpool.com/liverpool-fc-news/features/liverpool-badge-change-premier-league-29722526">Liver Bird emblem</a> remains instead of the full crest (which personally I wish would make a comeback …)</p> <p>The away effort is also beautiful: an off-white jersey complemented by red and dark green accents. The shirt is paired with a choice of either a black short and white sock, or the reverse. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://thenewkits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/25-26-Liverpool-Third-1.jpg">third kit</a> is a mint green, which calls to mind the <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/announcements/265260-a-brief-history-of-liverpool-s-green-and-white-kits">early 90s away </a>drip.</p> <h2>Manchester City</h2>    <p>Well done to Puma, who have designed a lovely home uniform here. It is the standard sky blue (with navy blue accents), but a sash features for the first time on a City home shirt (it has been a frequent away design element). The collar shade is the same as the body, creating a clean, smooth aesthetic.</p> <p>The <a href="https://footballfashion.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/manchester-city-2025-2026-puma-away-kit-1.jpg">away kit</a> is an all-black number referencing the club’s earliest known strip. Either that or they are going through their Johnny Cash era/a severe depression. It is dashing, though, and if one were to attempt to enter a Michelin-starred restaurant in a footie top, this is the one I would probably go for (see also: a funeral). The <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpa_tx6LPmBXM1NVL466THDwHU0Jg94AznQY2pQRkgC-Cht3XGYC1ATWigMUeyjoeO1tK3jExz7q8sjEIs-f_Qyr7wRg6LxSHNojZ-5CLY65-GLYI5tNBuRqwty_21vNSjWwJH3Gl6c-Sv0np1XirmDTN-V8nstXMYxkVH68IaAlrMa9fufyMzWv0Er4yf/s600/man-ctity-25-26-third-kit%20%285%29.jpg">third kit</a> is causing quite the reaction online – none of it good. The neon green accents are proving especially unpopular, but for my money* the raindrops-inspired main design on a drizzly-grey jersey for a club located in the soggy north-west is a stroke of genius. <a href="https://media.mutualart.com/Images/2017_03/19/09/090310090/57704bbc-4fc4-4334-a74c-c91d9d362afe_570.Jpeg">LS Lowry would be proud</a>. The <a href="https://www.mancity.com/news/club/man-city-puma-goalkeeper-kit-25-26-63882651">goalie kits</a> are available in many loud colourways, including fuchsia.</p> <p>*But not literally because YNWA.</p> <h2>Manchester United</h2>    <p>The Red Devils have been promoting their new home strip with the strapline: “United, wherever we go.” Bold, given that the club has five players <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/17/problems-piling-up-for-ruben-amorim-as-manchester-united-struggle-to-rebuild">hankering for a move</a>, all of whom are only allowed to train at Carrington after the rest of the squad has gone home.</p> <p>The Adidas kit ostensibly pays homage to Old Trafford – a slightly odd decision now that Jim Ratcliffe has <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/13326081/man-utd-to-leave-old-trafford-as-sir-jim-ratcliffe-announces-plans-for-new-100-000-seater-ground">announced</a> the 115-year-old stadium is to be replaced with a Norman Foster-designed behemoth (currently assigned the Ronseal-esque name of “New Trafford”). The back of the collar reads “Theatre of Dreams” – if the dream is to finish 15th – while the sleeve incorporates an “abstract” pattern referencing the stadium. After close inspection, I can report that this is a very, very abstract reference indeed.</p> <p>The <a href="https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt1ef6cd6be685a399/GOAL%20-%20Blank%20WEB%20-%20Facebook.jpg?auto=webp&amp;format=pjpg&amp;width=1200&amp;quality=60">away kit</a> is white with plum accents and a lavender snowflake motif inspired by the <a href="https://i.redd.it/hykgv3rxs8s51.jpg">1990-92 strip</a>. The colour scheme brings to mind the Jenny Joseph <a href="https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/warning/">couplet</a>: “When I am old / I shall wear purple”; just a thought in case the 40-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo fancies a hat-trick of United stretches. The third kit is the best of the three; a black and yellow strip reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.le7sorelle.it/42918-large_default/1993-1994-manchester-united-away-jersey.jpg">1993-94 away kit</a>.</p> <h2>Newcastle United</h2>    <p>Despite the Magpies’ extremely feelgood <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c05njjpp75yo">Carabao Cup win</a> last season – marking a first domestic triumph in 70 years for this storied and well-loved club – it still pains me somewhat to compliment a team majority-owned by a regime whose greatest hits include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/10/alleged-saudi-hit-squad-linked-to-jamal-khashoggi-disappearance">dismemberment by bone-saw</a>.</p> <p>But kit manufacturer Adidas continues its (for the most part) good summer run here. Clubs with traditional monochrome colours can sometimes struggle to distinguish themselves, but Adidas has introduced a serrated edge to those classic, thick black stripes. The border pattern is officially known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_tartan">Shepherds’ plaid</a>, although it actually reminds me of <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/thmb/aJKtEYhBDUFutvFUlPrNyQiTRhA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/car-windshield-black-dots-CARDOTS0622-6bd98290541249f499144c6c915d9e56.jpg">frits</a> (those little black dots at the bottom of windscreens). Other elements include blue piping and an “HOWAY THE LADS” inscription on the back of the collar.</p> <p>The <a href="https://footballfashion.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/newcastle-united-2025-2026-adidas-jersey-1.jpg">away kit</a> is not as much reminiscent of a Saudi national team kit as could quite literally be a Saudi national team kit of before.

late 90s away piece</a>. It has the Adidas trefoil logo to maximise the retro feel. The <a href="https://www.footballkitarchive.com/newcastle-united-2025-26-kits/">goalie </a>garms come in yellow, blue, purple, and pink, respectively.</p> <h2>Nottingham Forest</h2>    <p>Forest’s new home kit is a throwback to its <a href="https://yourfootballshirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Photoroom-20241127_111829_6.jpg">favoured early 90s strip</a>, sharing the same polo-style collar and a wide pinstripe body. It is an extremely classy affair from Adidas, with a nice added detail being the also 90s-inspired shield crest. The keeper will <a href="https://shop.nottinghamforest.co.uk/collections/goalkeeper-kit?srsltid=AfmBOor8Uq2HmNNS12-x5Dur8-4L0fIs6xekunZv2nC1tvgeLnqxlDAP">wear yellow, orange</a>, or blue. When the club, after its successful last season, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6536764/2025/08/06/nottingham-forest-shirt-sponsor-who-worth/">initially released</a> the new home shirt it was yet to feature a front sponsor – and was all the more handsome for it. But now, just in time for the team’s opening game, it advertises … a betting company. Surprise, surprise.</p> <p>The <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhJdODSnFlTKRww6II1kjfPxfdZeaRehSDhN1ZVyU2UyzmEPHcteMC3fGx-1_oyyh50LIj7SCoojZ8PODASv38iEmNYJpN0SoWsfVU4ObmDXtQEpSQyt3rfMi8CQqtUyjG05KbEyTbbrxzoWV0N3glevHWpFdN1_IP2uW-4uJwAKvaI8zxzRtC1uDqPQzVr/s1000/nottingham-25-26-away-kit%20%282%29.jpg">away fit</a> is primarily cream and features a neat detail: a weave replicating the lace designs the city is famous for. No third kit news at the time of writing.</p> <h2>Sunderland</h2>    <p>Danish brand Hummel frequently punches above its weight, and this smart new effort for Sunderland’s return to the top flight is no different.</p> <p>But not everybody is happy: the back of the players’ home shirt (but not the fan replica) is <a href="https://www.footyheadlines.com/2025/08/sunderland-25-26-home-kit-back.html">catching flak</a> from supporters for the number placement – a white panel has been introduced to abide by Premier League legibility rules. The rest of the shirt is an elegant creation; a black v-neck with thin bands of the traditional red-and-white is a key characteristic. Also eye-catching is the crest placement; centrally aligned for the first time since the 1990s. And why shouldn’t the Black Cats show it off when it is one of the prettiest around?</p> <p>In a similar move to Leeds, Sunderland’s snazzy <a href="https://images.footballfanatics.com/sunderland/sunderland-hummel-goalkeeper-shirt-2025-26-kids_ss5_p-202504017+pv-2+u-kq7dkseitrd0tgl4qm79+v-1q1pvdwwcqokvxhibcwk.jpg?_hv=2&amp;w=900">goalie kits</a> allude to the <a href="https://www.sunderlandecho.com/jpim-static/image/2024/10/24/14/47/462539322_562737426419792_7848675477164964252_n.jpg?crop=3:2,smart&amp;trim=&amp;width=640&amp;quality=65">patterned tiles</a> of a city landmark (in this case, the Bridge Hotel); while the gorgeously retro royal-blue <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhGLAHpzC4g5OLjXKXJ2BOBUh0GmcKOIAo1AbuZQ4R5ZOBn8XvHUoKWFePTCkHxJ4v1as0yy8zmIg7dWmkRGa6WTttCUC5EMLaNgxYnN6-iZKLy_yvcdZ9gGQMWsdLpT6UwLzobNDtUPb_j8ycFK7yn0Fx9hr2Fl0eOpQjLz13jPHipRWBt7NVb4SNu91h8/s1000/sunderland-25-26-away-kit%20%289%29.jpg">away outfield</a> threads are further livened by a chequerboard weave with a subtle Roker Beach lighthouse motif.

As with Sunderland, the new Spurs home shirt has a centrally aligned brand logo and club badge. The sleeve and underarm panels incorporate “Iron Ore” as an accent colour (Nike is at it again; they are grey), which is a departure, and ribbing on the body provides texture.</p> <p>Fans and players will also be wearing navy shorts with white socks. It is definitely the club’s least insipid home strip for a long time – although it retains a slight whiff of the training ground. More rousing is the luminous pink-and purple-gradient pinstripe <a href="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-5e8c3uvulz/images/stencil/200w/products/31353/36826/vicario__25777.1748882060.png">keeper’s kit</a>.</p> <p>The Lilywhites go all black with <a href="https://footballfashion.org/wordpress/2025/06/26/tottenham-hotspur-2025-jersey/">their away look</a> – a prevalent choice this upcoming season. The Spurs kit in particular reminds one of Roger Federer’s <a href="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/F5wpXHpWLqYSexPMPQIr6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTEzMzg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://66.media.tumblr.com/cfc788ab48bffc2f2856860ee69b9b75/tumblr_inline_o98v79Nhra1rpqds5_1280.jpg">iconic 2007 US Open drip</a>. Nike’s blurb describes it as “razor-sharp, engineered for speed and built for stealth”, which unfortunately does sound a lot like club legend Harry Kane in his prime. The <a href="https://cdn.footballkitarchive.com/2024/11/07/iehO9BVRXPG8nwQ.jpg">away keeper’s kit</a> is akin to the home one but in mint-and-forest green. The <a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitOiGv1yGmu8-3x-l5nySxMLvpnvDu4M0FWFUFQOAUcNypEaHU3ZYEKXBINnbMsIYUKwcGFjrmkrpzaSK7OrYdK8_ivmS_c_bT34e3HTa1veuGxhXna3AlrOmePUAr5aeGnc0bfqIsBCuKEwdBw7fQ2Tgh3u7z91FTJ4ZCmkAenOZDv3-ERT6nqp7aeO3h/s1000/spurs-25-26-third-kit%20%282%29.jpg">third ki</a>t is yet to be officially launched, but it looks as though the bright yellow and navy shirt will air the beautiful 90s-era crest.</p> <h2>West Ham</h2>    <p>Umbro has gone back to basics for the Hammers’ fetching new home strip. The traditional claret colour is the majority presence, but it is the dapper taping detail on the ribbed collar and cuff – and discreet underarm blue inserts (the colour is relegated to a smaller role than usual) – that subtly elevate this minimalist take. The applique full club crest is revived here after last season’s hideous variation and the crossed-hammers symbol is also printed on the back of the neck. The socks and shorts are in white.</p> <p>The <a href="https://shop.whufc.com/siteimg/productimages/13783-1098.jpg">away strip</a> is equally nice and calm. Supposedly it is a callback to the <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTvpCvN_lWQ91-EC-k8ORUi8AhQDJGbeis_Bw&amp;s">1996-97 away strip</a>; I would argue that the call is not particularly loud. But it is a satisfyingly soft, creamy ecru with black sleeves and collar. The <a href="https://shop.whufc.com/siteimg/productimages/13783-1098.jpg">third kit</a>, with a fold-over collar and a striking oversized Hammers logo on the breast, is a mix of submarine-deep navy as well as gold.
