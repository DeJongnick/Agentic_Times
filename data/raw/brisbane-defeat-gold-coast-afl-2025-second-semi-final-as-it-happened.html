They’ll be feeling better about the world tonight.</p> <p>That’s enough from us, I think. Brisbane to play Collingwood, back to the rivalry of the early 2000s, and Geelong to play Hawthorn, the best modern 21st century rivalry of all. Don’t miss preliminary final weekend. Until then.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c562b18f086519d32715f7" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-13T12:28:53.614Z">1.28pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>33 touches for McCluggage tonight, 28 for Will Ashcroft, a number surprisingly equalled by Touk Miller for the Suns although his use of the ball didn’t lead to much. Not his fault, just the way the Lions cut off any useful route up the field for Gold Coast, who couldn’t out-think the blockade on the run. </p> <p>14 marks for Harris Andrews, who intercepted with such each. Three goals each for Lohmann and Bailey. </p> <p>But most remarkably, Josh Dunkley laid <em>18 tackles</em> tonight. Eighteen! Breaking the record for any final: that record was 16, set by Jimmy Bartel as Geelong won the flag in 2009.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c5622f8f084b3c85a4e1aa" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-13T12:23:38.402Z">1.23pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Lachie Neale is all smiles in the changing room, despite that injury.

He was there at the beginning in 2011, and stayed the course after so many left. How he would have loved to reach game 250 with a preliminary final next week, but those numbers don’t make his career any less admirable, with 111 goals and almost 5000 touches of the football.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c55ff38f084b3c85a4e18f" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-13T12:20:15.388Z">1.20pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Brisbane win by 53 points</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>That, my friends, is that. Brisbane got doused last week, but they’ve bobbed back up and made another prelim final. By rights they should be hosting it, having finished above Collingwood on the ladder, but the AFL isn’t going to turn down the chance to get 90,000 in at the MCG two days running. </p> <p>Brisbane were terrific in their approach tonight, despite having Lachie Neale watching on injured: they hassled and harassed and gave the Suns no space. There was a lack of polish in the forward line when it came to finishing off some moves, so that’s the main area that Brisbane need to fix up.</p> <p>As for Gold Coast, this is clearly their best season after being the punching bags of the comp for so long. It’s really not surprising that they were flat, after making the longest trip in football the previous week, Brisbane to Perth, and not just that but beating Fremantle, winning their first final, and doing it in the dying seconds of the game. That’s a huge emotional experience to process. Hopefully they’ll come back better for the run next year.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c55e7a8f0880bae9c52e1d" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-13T12:10:07.458Z">1.10pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Q4: 4 minutes remaining: Brisbane 14.16.100 – Gold Coast 6.9.45 </strong></p> <p>Cruising to the finish, Brisbane.

Six goals the difference. Haven’t seen a polished Suns passage of play for a long, long time, Brisbane too good at breaking them up.

And again the Lions punish them, again through the middle, again Rayner breaking a tackle in the centre square, Ah Chee across the face of goal, and Bailey marks at the far side and puts through his kick around the corner!

Nothing is working for them tonight. Lions back the other way. Charlie Cameron runs Jeffrey off his feet, turns this way and that so many times that Jeffrey’s boots give out underneath him. Long kick finds Ashcroft but his flying shot at goal misses.

To Berry, McCluggage, inside 50, Berry pumps it out of bounds by the behind post along the ground. Two ball-ins, and eventually those are too hard to defend. Will Ashcroft grabs the crumb, and a sensation snap on the move!

On reflection, it would actually be better if these clubs were on opposite sides of the draw so they could end up in the first all-Queensland grand final, but we’ll settle for a dual-knockout final to see who goes into the prelim final against Collingwood at the MCG.</p> <p>Brisbane and Gold Coast matches have not, let’s be honest, had much riding on them for most of their history given that at least one and often both clubs have been down the wrong end of the ladder. But now the Lions are reigning premiers, and the Suns, after so many years of being belted around the league, are not only playing finals for the first time, but won their first ever knockout despite taking the lead with nine seconds to go.</p> <p>It was fun.
