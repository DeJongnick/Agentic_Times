<p>A global study of 130,000 people in 125 countries found that<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/22/89-percent-project-climate-change"> 80 to 89% of people around the world</a> want more to be done about the climate crisis – but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/22/spiral-of-silence-climate-action-very-popular-why-dont-people-realise">mistakenly assume their peers do not.</a></p> <p>More than two-thirds said they were willing to give 1% of their income to fight the climate crisis. Crucially, however, they thought only a minority of other people – 43% – would be willing to do the same.</p> <p>People in China, the world’s biggest polluter, were among the most concerned, with 97% saying the Chinese government should do more to fight the climate crisis and four out of five willing to give 1% of their income.</p> <p>The world’s second biggest polluter, the US, was near the bottom, but still had about three-quarters of its citizens saying its government should do more with almost half willing to contribute.</p> <p>We’re interested in finding out why climate action matters to you and if anyone has inspired you to take action. Would you give 1% of your income to help the climate? How can political obstacles be overcome?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="a013d8e0-888b-47c0-97cc-5468c85aec64" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p><em><strong>If you’re having trouble using the form click <a href="https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/the_89_project">here</a>.
