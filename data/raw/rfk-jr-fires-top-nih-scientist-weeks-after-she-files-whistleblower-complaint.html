<p>The US health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, has fired a top scientist at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) just three weeks after she had filed a whistleblower complaint against the Trump administration relating to its hostility towards vaccines, according to a report.</p> <p>Jeanne Marrazzo has been removed from her NIH job, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/02/health/kennedy-marrazzo-nih.html">New York Times</a> reported. She had already been demoted in March from her senior position as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p> <p>Last month, Marrazzo filed a whistleblower complaint saying that her removal from the top position had been an act of retribution after she had protested about moves taken by the Trump administration to undermine vaccine research.</p> <p>She also alleged in the complaint that Trump officials had been flouting court orders and politicizing decisions over grants.</p> <p>Kennedy fired Marrazzo in a letter on 26 September that failed to give any explanation for the move. “In my capacity as secretary, I have decided to terminate your appointment as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease,” he wrote, according to the newspaper.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/trump-tylenol-autism-expert-analysis">How the White House spun ‘weak’ and ‘inconclusive’ studies to tie Tylenol to autism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Marrazzo’s dismissal is part of sweeping firings that have been introduced under Kennedy across the federal health operation. The secretary has indicated that he wants to see at least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/maternal-child-health-cuts">10,000 jobs</a> eliminated as part of “restructuring” of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).</p> <p>That comes on top of a similar number of positions shed under Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge).

Since joining the administration, he has scrapped $500m in research grants into mRNA vaccines that are credited with saving millions of lives during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid-19</a> pandemic.</p>
