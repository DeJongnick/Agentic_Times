<h1>The Guardian view on Nigel Farage: not even Donald Trump is as damaging to Reform as its own leader</h1>

<p>One constant of British political life is that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage">Nigel&nbsp;Farage</a> never stays out of the spotlight for long. Having built a political career on railing against the establishment – while, paradoxically, embedding himself within it – Mr Farage finds himself embroiled in yet another melodrama. This time, however, the threat comes not from the usual suspects – remainers, the BBC or “woke” elites – but from his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/09/nigel-farage-rupert-lowe-reform-uk-feud-escalates">own side</a>.</p> <p>The affair revolves around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/09/reform-uk-power-struggle-rupert-lowe-nigel-farage">Rupert Lowe</a>, a little‑known businessman, elected as one of Reform&nbsp;UK’s five MPs in 2024 under Mr Farage’s leadership. That should have been the beginning of a forgettable contribution to British public life. Yet, thanks to the <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2025-01-06/who-is-rupert-lowe-the-mp-elon-musk-thinks-should-be-reform-uk-leader">intervention</a> of Elon Musk – the world’s richest man and Donald Trump’s “government efficiency” tsar – Mr Lowe has a starring role in Mr&nbsp;Farage’s latest soap opera.</p> <p>Earlier this year the tech billionaire was so annoyed&nbsp;by Mr Farage’s decision to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7ve4m1q42vo">distance</a> himself from the imprisoned far-right agitator Tommy Robinson that he touted Mr Lowe as a possible replacement. Relations between Mr Farage and Mr&nbsp;Lowe have deteriorated since. Their feud burst out into the open this month, culminating this weekend with Reform UK alleging misconduct by Mr Lowe, which he denies. Mr Lowe, who has been suspended from the party and lost its whip in parliament, derides it as a vanity&nbsp;project driven by one man’s ego. He has <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/nigel-farage-rupert-lowe-reform-uk-allegations-explained-123925537.html">threatened</a> to sue Reform UK for libel.</p> <p>Mr Farage’s reaction, however, is telling. For all his bravado about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/jan/16/nigel-farage-reform-labour-workers-rights-bill-pub-banter">free speech</a>, the moment a rival emerges – however minor – his instinct seems to be to cut them down. This is not the first time. His political parties – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47934021">Ukip</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/three-meps-quit-brexit-party-to-back-conservatives">Brexit party</a>, Reform UK – have operated more like personality cults than democratic organs, and loyalty to the leader has eclipsed ideological purity. Challenging Mr&nbsp;Farage doesn’t end well for those who dare. The difference this time is that Mr Musk’s intervention gives the affair an absurdly transatlantic flavour.</p> <p>This illuminates a larger problem. If Mr Farage’s goal is to broaden his electoral appeal, association with Trumpism is a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poll-britain-like-elon-musk-less-nigel-farage/">hindrance</a>, not a help. While Mr Trump retains a firm grip on the Republican party, the US president remains deeply <a href="https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/britons-on-trump/">unpopular</a> in&nbsp;Britain, where even Tories see him as a <a href="https://www.lincsonline.co.uk/stamford/news/mp-calls-for-trump-s-state-visit-to-be-blocked-9406965/">liability</a>. The perception that Mr Farage is too <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14477667/Nigel-Farage-rating-Reform-Zelensky-Oval-Office-Trump.html">close</a> to Mr&nbsp;Trump and too sympathetic to Vladimir Putin is hurting him in the polls. The opportunist in Mr&nbsp;Farage knows this. His strategy has been to present himself as the plebeian face of rightwing populism – foregrounding his love of pints over his attendance at <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/trumps-mara-a-largo-election-night-party-as-musk-farage-and-ufc-boss-kick/">Mar-a-Lago</a> banquets. Yet the contradictions are piling up.</p> <p>Mr Farage seeks to appear an insurgent, yet he operates like an autocrat. He wants to court the support of Trumpian <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/viktor-orban-nigel-farage-right-wing-fiesta-go-ahead-brussels-big-court-win/">figures</a>, yet he knows their influence is more likely to repel than to attract British voters. He wants Reform UK to grow – but only under him. For all the bluster, this latest episode only highlights that Mr Farage, like Mr Trump, has always been far better at breaking things than building them. That ought to be a warning to mainstream parties seeking to emulate Trumpian talking points around cutting <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/starmer-puts-hard-power-over-060000948.html">foreign aid</a> or sacking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/mar/09/labour-promises-radical-shake-up-of-uk-civil-service">bureaucrats</a> – especially with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/10/mike-amesbury-resigns-as-mp-triggering-byelection">an upcoming byelection</a> in a Labour stronghold. If Reform UK eventually ends up on the scrapheap of history, it won’t be because of Mr Lowe or Mr Musk, or even Mr Trump. It will be because, in the end, Mr&nbsp;Farage is his own biggest problem.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
