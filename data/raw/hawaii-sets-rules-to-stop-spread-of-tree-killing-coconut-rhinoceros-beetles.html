<p>Hawaii is doubling down in its fight against invasive coconut rhinoceros beetles, with state authorities greenlighting rules to prevent the damaging insects from spreading across the Pacific archipelago.</p> <p>The Hawaii agriculture board on Tuesday approved regulations, including a ban on moving infested soil and compost between islands and an increase of insect inspections, to thwart an influx in pests, <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2024/10/as-rhinoceros-beetles-spread-state-board-bolsters-pest-control-powers/">according to Honolulu Civil Beat</a>.</p> <p>These rule changes, which are not yet finalized, come after an approximately 20-month delay. Coconut rhinoceros beetles were first spotted in Hawaii about a decade ago, but “multiple populations” were <a href="https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/hisc/info/invasive-species-profiles/coconut-rhinoceros-beetle/">found</a> on Kauai in May 2023, indicating the problem had worsened, state officials said.</p> <p>Coconut rhinoceros beetles consume, hurt and sometimes kill palm trees. The beetle can also result in the death of pineapple, bananas, papaya, sugarcane and taro, <a href="https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/local-news/2024-10-23/invasive-species-rules-boa-approval">per Hawaii Public Radio</a>.</p> <p>“This is about an all-hands-on-deck approach to managing, preventing – and hopefully eradicating – the ongoing cycle of invasive species,” Dianne Ley, a Big Island board member, reportedly said.</p> <p>These beetles, which are black and approximately 2in long, with a horn, do not bite. But, “they may carry disease because they live in dirt and mulch,” authorities said.</p> <p>The rules are also meant to stop the spread of little fire ants, another invasive species that <a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2023/11/state-ag-agency-on-track-for-stricter-control-of-invasive-pests/">puts local agriculture and native flora at risk</a>, and can cause harm to humans and pets. While these aggressive ants have afflicted the Big Island for years, they have recently spread to Oahu, prompting renewed calls for action, <a href="https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/local-news/2024-10-23/invasive-species-rules-boa-approval">Hawaii Public Radio reports</a>.</p> <p>Conservationists in Hawaii are also increasing efforts to find breeding sites, which could help prevent the beetles’ population from rising. <a href="https://www.conservationdogshawaii.org/">Conservation Dogs of Hawaii</a> has trained scent-detection canines to detect these insects.</p> <p>One three-dog team found more than 80 coconut rhinoceros beetles during a training session in June, <a href="https://www.kitv.com/news/kauai-detection-dogs-find-coconut-rhinoceros-beetles/article_2e77e642-3696-11ef-86e4-5354b23bfafb.html">according to Island News</a>.</p>
