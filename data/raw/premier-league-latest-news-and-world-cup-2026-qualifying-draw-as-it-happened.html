  <p><strong>Pep Guardiola</strong> has lamented the recent form of his injury-hit Manchester City side, and suggested he may seek to build a bigger squad to keep up with their schedule.</p> 
  <p>“I’m sad for the players because the way they run and they fight with the circumstances they have,” he said. “Maybe with this calendar you need a squad with 25, 30 players. The problem is the schedule. Sooner or later it will happen for all clubs.”</p>

  <p><strong>Fulham </strong>head to Anfield on Saturday hoping to upset the Premier League leaders – and Marco Silva has credited hard work for the team’s strong season so far.</p> 
  <p>“I don’t see success in football without hard work, that is the first thing,” Silva said. “It’s been one of the reasons why everything has been going well the last three or four seasons. Everybody works really hard, it’s the demands from ourselves in the football club – they are high.”</p> 
  <p>I know it’s the beginning of December with a lot of fights and big games ahead of us – but it has been really good to see the way the team is responding,” added the Fulham manager, who will be without five players against Liverpool.</p> 
  <p>Joachim Andersen and Harrison Reed are sidelined with injury, Tom Cairney and Calvin Bassey are both suspended, while Reiss Nelson is set to be out for around 10 weeks.</p>

  <p><strong>Manchester City </strong>are waiting on the results of Alex Greenwood’s scan on a knee injury suffered in the Women’s Champions League on Thursday. The England defender was taken off on a stretcher after an awkward collision with St Polten’s Melanie Brunnthaler in City’s 2-0 victory.</p> 
  <p>“[Alex] was OK but we are awaiting the results of her scan and are continuing to assess her,” said the City manager, Gareth Taylor. “Hopefully she is alright, because she has been crucial to what we have done not just this season, but seasons past. Our thoughts are with Alex and we hope it’s a speedy one.”</p>

  <p>The <strong>Leicester</strong> manager, Ruud van Nistelrooy, has admitted he may need to get creative in covering for midfield shortages against Newcastle on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>With Boubakary Soumaré suspended, Wilfred Ndidi injured and Harry Winks doubtful, Oliver Skipp and Hamza Choudhury are expected to start the match but Van Nistelrooy has few options in reserve and has been casting around for possible solutions this week.</p> 
  <p>Henry Cartwright, a 19-year-old midfielder, has been training with the first team, while the Dutch manager also said he had been looking at some senior defensive players who might be able to play out of position if needed. “It’s something we have to be prepared for,” Van Nistelrooy said.</p>

  <p>Li Tie, the former Everton player who subsequently became coach of the China national team, has received a 20-year prison sentence for bribery. Chinese state media reported Friday that Li was found guilty of “leveraging his positions” as head coach to receive bribes of more than 50 million yuan (about £5.5m), by a court in the city of Xianning.</p> 
  <p>Li coached the Chinese men’s team between January 2020 and December 2021, having coached Hebei China Fortune and Wuhan Zall after returning to China following injury-hit spells with Everton and Sheffield United. His sentencing is the latest in a series of high-profile corruption cases involving Chinese football figures. <strong>Reuters</strong></p>

  <p>The Arsenal defender has not played for England since he left the 2022 World Cup in Qatar early. “I will reach out to him,” Tuchel said. “It should be a clean start and a clear narrative.” Tuchel will take a break over Christmas but added: “I will be in the stadiums from January. The players should know: ‘Okay, the boss is there from January’.”</p>

  <p>In the <strong>Women’s Super League</strong>, Chelsea visit Leicester on Saturday looking to set a new record. Sonia Bompastor’s side have won all 14 matches so far this season in all competitions, after thrashing Twente 6-1 at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>Victory at the King Power Stadium against the side second-bottom of the table would be their 10th WSL win in a row since the start of the season, beating Arsenal’s record. “It is part of our DNA to just want to win every game, but also making sure we perform in all the game from the beginning until the end,” said Bompastor.</p> 
  <p>“We expect a tough game,” added the Chelsea manager. “Leicester will be fighting to put us under trouble. I know [Leicester manager] Amandine [Miquel] and she will give everything – that is also their mentality. She always tries to surprise me with something [in] the game, so I am ready for that.”</p>

  <p><strong>Celtic face Rangers in the Scottish League Cup final on Sunday,</strong> and Brendan Rodgers has hit back at Philippe Clement’s claims that Celtic are “financially out of our league”.</p> 
  <p>“Where Celtic has come over a number of years, this is a club that’s been organically grown,” said Rodgers. “We haven’t been handed money. The leadership from the very top of this club to the bottom is why we have had the successes that we’ve had. We’ve developed that, and that has allowed us then to win, [and] that brings more success.”</p> 
  <p>“Everyone has the possibility, certainly teams up towards the top, will have the possibility to earn the finances. And if they don’t, then OK. We have to worry about ourselves and that’s my only interest, really.” I wonder if the likes of Aberdeen would agree with that assessment.</p> 
  <p>Sunday’s match at Hampden could carry huge historical significance. Celtic’s trophy tally is currently on 118, level with Rangers’ all-time haul (which is, of course, disputed by rival fans). Victory would put Celtic ahead in the overall count, but Rodgers insisted: “For me, it’s about the game. We want to win as many trophies as we can … we don’t necessarily have to tell everyone.” <strong>PA Media</strong></p>

  <p>As for Chelsea, <strong>Enzo Maresca</strong> has said he is “very proud and privileged” to work with <strong>Cole Palmer</strong>, who is leading his side’s title tilt in trademark languid style, as shown by the panenka penalty that ultimately earned victory at Spurs.</p> 
  <p>“Many top players have that way,” Maresca said. “They look like they almost don’t care but it’s just their way and … gives them more freedom, they can relax and you can see Cole is the same way. Cole was this way five years ago and he’s still the same.”</p> 
  <p>“England are lucky because there are so many good players and Cole is one of them. There are so many good players in the Premier League. Absolutely he can be [world class] but he is only 22 and there are many things he can improve.”</p>

  <p><strong>Brentford go to Chelsea on Sunday evening</strong>, and Thomas Frank has backed Enzo Maresca’s side as the Premier League’s best team.</p> 
  <p>“They are maybe the best team in the Premier League right now. They are maybe even more in-form than Liverpool, even though they are top of the league,” said Frank. “They are playing incredible football and are well-coached. [Enzo] Maresca has done a top job so far with his coaching staff and they look extremely dangerous.</p> 
  <p>“They have so many threats going forward and have top-quality players all over the pitch,” added the Brentford manager. “I expect an unbelievably difficult game. They are massive favourites but of course, we believe that we can compete against anyone and we believe we can win.”</p>

  <p><strong>Mikel Arteta</strong> has insisted <strong>Arsenal</strong>’s search for a new sporting director will have no impact on their January transfer business. Jason Ayto, who has been at Arsenal for a decade, has assumed the post on an interim basis but Dan Ashworth’s shock exit from Manchester United has seen him linked with a move to north London. </p> 
  <p>“Jason Ayto is our interim sporting director. He has got the full capacity and support of the football club right now,” Arteta said. “I never expect January to be super busy, but we have to wait and see where we are. There might be some opportunities … hopefully the availability of the squad will be better in a few weeks. We have to wait and see.”<br><br>Riccardo Calafiori, Ben White, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Takehiro Tomiyasu are all currently sidelined, while centre-back Gabriel is set to return against Everton. Teenager <strong>Myles Lewis-Skelly</strong> is likely to keep his place at left-back after impressing against Monaco in the Champions League.</p> 
  <p>“He certainly deserves to be in contention to be selected because he performed and competed really well,” said the Arsenal manger. “At his age to show that maturity and personality is strange. Off the pitch, it is the same. He’s a person that continuously surprises all the staff with the kind of questions that he’s capable of asking.”</p>

  <p><strong>Ange Postecoglou</strong> is standing by his criticism of Timo Werner – although he called it an “assessment” of the <strong>Tottenham</strong> forward’s performance against Rangers.</p> 
  <p>“With Timo it wasn’t about whether he played well or not. It was a difficult game last night. I’m asking 18-year-olds to do some massive jobs and you want senior players, and he’s an international and he’s won the Champions League, there’s a level of application and performance you need to rise to to help the team. He didn’t reach that.”</p> 
  <p>“I think me taking him off at half-time was a statement enough,” the Australian added. “The same way I won’t be hiding behind poor team performances, the same with and no different for the players or anyone else. We’re in a fight here, collectively we’re in a fight. I’m not going to go around worrying about people’s bruised egos.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Ruben Amorim will face Manchester City</strong> for the first time as United manager on Sunday – and insists he had no discussions with City about replacing Pep Guardiola. The former Sporting head coach was linked with City after his director of football in Portugal, Hugo Viana, agreed to join the champions next summer. </p> 
  <p>Asked if he ever had a conversation about the prospect of joining Viana at City, Amorim said: “Never. This was my only option. When Manchester United talked to me, I had no doubts because I had already something in my mind, it could be a possibility. With Manchester City or Hugo Viana? Nothing about that.”</p> 
  <p>Amorim also brushed off suggestions that this could be a good time for his first Manchester derby, with City’s poor run of form including a 4-1 Champions League defeat to Sporting while he was still in charge. </p> 
  <p>“I never think about these things,” he said. “The great teams can respond in any moment, and I think they are in a better place than us in the type of understanding the game, the way they play, the confidence they have. Even in these kind of moments.</p> 
  <p>“We will face a great opponent and I’m more focused on our problems, so we have a lot of issues here. I’m more focused on what we should do on Sunday to win the game, so I’m really focused on my team.” <strong>PA Media</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Mario Lemina has been stripped of the Wolves captaincy</strong> after grappling with West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen at the end of Monday night’s game at the London Stadium.</p> 
  <p>Lemina wrestled Hammers captain Bowen to the ground when the pair went to shake hands as tempers boiled over after West Ham’s 2-1 win. The midfielder apologised earlier in the week but Gary O’Neil has revealed Nelson Semedo will take the armband going forward, starting with Saturday’s crunch clash against Ipswich.</p> 
  <p>“The discussions with Mario were good. We get on very, very well. He’s been a big part of what we’ve been able to do here and we have a large amount of respect for each other. Sometimes you can come out of these discussions in a really good spot and I think that we have,” the Wolves manager said.</p> 
  <p>“He’ll still be around the senior group that leads the team, but at this moment we feel it’s best for Nelson to lead the group. The most important thing is us getting the best out of everybody. We dealt with it earlier in the week and the focus since has been purely on Ipswich, Mario’s ready, Nelson’s ready and the rest of the players are ready.”</p> 
  <p>João Gomes will miss the clash through suspension, while Jose Sá and Pablo Sarabia remain out along with long-term absentees Yerson Mosquera, Sasa Kalajdzic, Enzo González and Bouba Traoré.</p>

  <p><strong>Harry Kane is set to make his return for Bayern Munich</strong> next week following a muscle injury, coach Vincent Kompany has said. The England captain hasn’t played since he went off in Bayern’s 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund on 30 November.<br><br>Kane has missed three games since then with a thigh muscle issue and Kompany said the forward wouldn miss Saturday’s Bundesliga game at Mainz, either, but could return next week before next week’s match against Leipzig.<br><br>“It’s actually gone really quickly and well for Harry. It was tight for this game, but it looks good for Leipzig,” Kompany said. “I’m obviously only focused on Mainz now but regarding Harry, it’s great. It’s not the case that we’ve had a setback or something. It looks good.”</p> 
  <p>With goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, left back Alphonso Davies and midfielder João Palhinha also injured, Kompany is looking forward to the winter break, which will run from 20 December (when they play Leizpig) to 11 January, when Bayern host Mönchengladbach.</p> 
  <p>“Right now I’m happy that we have a winter break, because there isn’t even a summer break if you look at the schedule that we have,” said Kompany, who will take this team into the Club World Cup this summer. “It’s important that you have a certain number of days to recover, not just physically but mentally.”</p>

  <p>While Steve Clarke plots a path for the men’s team to the 2026 finals, <strong>Scotland</strong>’s <strong>women’s team</strong> are seeking a new manager. <strong>Pedro Martínez Losa</strong> has left his post after failing to lead the team to Euro 2025, losing in the qualification playoffs to Finland.</p> 
  <p>The Spaniard, who took over as head coach in July 2021, also missed out on the 2023 World Cup via the playoffs. Scotland last reached a major women’s finals under Shelley Kerr’s leadership in 2019, when they qualified for the World Cup. The search for a new manager will begin immediately, with the Nations League resuming in February.</p> 
  <p>Martínez Losa said: “I am immensely proud of the journey we have undertaken as a group and it has been a privilege to lead the Scotland women’s team. Watching young talent flourish alongside our experienced players has been a highlight of my time here.”</p> 
  <p>“I leave with fond memories and gratitude to my squad, backroom staff, and the passionate supporters, who have been unwavering in their backing,” he added. “Scotland will always hold a special place in my heart, and I wish the team every success in the future.”</p> 
  <p>Ian Maxwell, the SFA chief executive, said: “I would like to thank Pedro for his efforts over the past three and a half years. While we shouldn’t lose sight of the recent unbeaten run, and winning promotion from Nations League Group B, the primary objective was to qualify for a major tournament again.”</p>

  <p><strong>Eddie Howe</strong> has admitted he faces a challenge to persuade both his current players and new recruits that the slowing <strong>Newcastle United</strong> project remains on track.</p> 
  <p>Spending rules have hampered the Saudi-backed club’s efforts to build upon the fourth-place finish they achieved two seasons ago, and there is little sign of significant spending in January. Howe has also shrugged off any talk of pressure before Saturday’s match with Leicester, with his side having won just two of their last 11 league games.</p> 
  <p>“Players are very astute human beings. I always say players feel everything at a football club,” Howe said. “They are the most perceptive people because they are on the front line. They are the ones delivering for us, so whatever is going on at a football, they’re the ones absorbing it.</p> 
  <p>“Naturally, PSR has had an effect on the club and we haven’t been able to strive and reach as quickly as we wanted to initially. Of course they have felt that and been aware of that. The challenge for me is for that not to affect performances and mood and belonging to the club,” the Newcastle manager added.</p> 
  <p>“The best players we have, they’re like gold dust, and I’ve said that many times. They’re difficult to find, you’re not going to pick them up off the street. When you have them, you’ve got to cherish them and really care for them, and try to make the environment as strong as you can, so they want to stay as part of that.”</p> 
  <p>Asked if he had sought assurances from the board over his position, Howe said: “I don’t seek it, I’m not that type of person. I don’t know if it’s the right word, but I’m not needy, I don’t seek assurances, or engage in conversations to see how the land lies. That’s not me. My future will be dictated by results on the pitch, not seeking anything.”</p> 
  <p>Howe is keeping his fingers crossed over goalkeeper Nick Pope, who was seeing a specialist on Friday over a knee problem, but will be without luckless striker Callum Wilson for up to eight weeks after he damaged a hamstring at Brentford. <strong>PA Media</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Thomas Tuchel </strong>has given his thoughts on England’s World Cup qualifying group, and played down any notions of a favourable draw. “[Serbia and Albania] are always very talented individual players, a very emotional group, a very emotional crowd. So they can always surprise,” said the new manager.</p> 
  <p>“We have to take this very seriously. It’s a first fixture with Latvia, so a new challenge for all of us. And then we are clear favourites, of course, against Andorra, but qualification is key now. Qualification is top priority. We have to be serious. We have to be determined, and we have to show what we’re up for in this group of five.”</p> 
  <p>“I don’t see [finishing top] as a given. The gap closes more and more between the big nations and the small nations. You see it in the Euros lately,” the German added. “There are no such thing as results that are already done before the match is played. The smaller nations have become stronger and stronger. So we have to earn our place.”</p>

  <p><strong>Brighton manager Fabian Hürzeler</strong> will oversee his first derby game against Crystal Palace on Sunday – but the German was at Selhurst Park for last December’s match.</p> 
  <p>“I experienced it on my own, how the rivalry is, how the mood is between the two clubs,” Hürzeler said. “It is a game, in the end it is only about three points, but on top of that, it is about the meaning of the game.</p> 
  <p>“I know that the meaning, especially for the fans, is high, and also for the club it is very high and that is why we need to give everything on the pitch to win this derby. Everyone in the building knows the meaning, so I don’t have to emphasise it and that is not my way of working. It is to prepare the team like every other game.”</p>

  <p>There should be more reaction to come, but let’s move lanes over to the Premier League. Earlier, <strong>Liverpool</strong> manager Arne Slot offered his backing to under-fire forward <strong>Darwin Núñez</strong>. The Uruguayan has scored only one goal in his last 10 appearances and Slot admitted he kept him on against Girona in the hope he would find the net again.</p> 
  <p>“I made it clear to him that he is not only judged on the goals he scores, he is also judged on the team performance and he adds something as well with his work-rate and how much he does winning the ball back high up the pitch,” Slot said.</p> 
  <p>“Ideally he would have scored a few goals more. Maybe in a few weeks you will ask me [why] Mo [Salah] is not scoring any more and Darwin is scoring one goal after another. It is the life of a No 9, sometimes you score, sometimes you don’t.</p> 
  <p>But what should always be there is work-rate and I think that is what he has, apart from two games: the first one against Las Palmas [a pre-season friendly], and the last half-hour against Girona wasn’t of the standard he should have. That had a lot to do with him being disappointed at missing a few chances.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>There will be 12 qualifying groups – six with five teams, and six with four teams – with teams playing each other home and away, and only the group winner going through automatically. The runners-up (plus four teams with the best Nations League records) will go into the playoffs for the final four European spots at the 48-team finals.</p> 
  <p>Teams are seeded in five pots (details of those to follow) – one slight wrinkle is that teams who reach the Nations League semi-finals must go into a four-team group. As the quarter-finals have not been played yet, those teams can’t be fully allocated today. For instance, Italy play Germany in the last eight, so both teams will be pencilled in to a four- and five- team group, with the winner of the tie going into the four-team group.</p> 
  <p>The games will be held across five international breaks, on 21-25 March, 6-10 June, 4-9 September, 9-14 October and 13-18 November 2025.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Manchester City posted record revenues last season but profit dropped from the previous 12 months, the club’s annual report has revealed. In 2023/24, revenues increased from £712.8m to £715m for the year to 30 June as City won their fourth consecutive Premier League title.</p> 
  <p>However, profits dipped from £80.4m in City’s treble-winning season to £73.8m, with a drop in broadcast income due to Pep Guardiola’s side missing out on the Champions League final. City’s current investments include a £300million expansion of the north stand of the Etihad Stadium.</p> 
  <p>The club’s chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, said: “Our constant ambition to target and achieve the unprecedented is a mark of the organisation that we have become. Our focus remains on further evolution and growth and therefore further value creation in all aspects of our business.”</p> 
  <p>City are awaiting a decision on more than 100 charges of alleged breaches of financial rules brought against them by the Premier League, of which only brief mention was made in the financial report. The club have denied the charges.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Preamble</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The 2026 World Cup will be the first to feature 48 teams, and 16 of them will come from Europe. Friday’s draw in Zurich will set up the Uefa qualifying groups – 12 in total – with Thomas Tuchel discovering the path he has to lead England to the finals. His side are in pot one, Wales in pot two, and Scotland in pot three alongside Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. That draw gets under way at 11am (GMT) today.</p> 
  <p>Elsewhere, there are plenty of press conferences as the Premier League continues this weekend. Newcastle’s Eddie Howe and Liverpool’s Arne Slot are both talking this morning, with Ange Postecoglou, Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta coming up later. We’ll also try to keep you updated on all the day’s developing football news.</p>
