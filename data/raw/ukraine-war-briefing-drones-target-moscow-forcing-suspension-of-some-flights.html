Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former prime minister and president, responded: “I only know of one really bad thing – WWIII. I hope Trump understands this!” As Trump makes no progress on his promise to end the war in as little as a day, the Kremlin has also said the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/russia-targets-ukraine-with-more-drone-strikes-as-trump-says-putin-has-gone-crazy">US president is suffering “emotional overload”</a>.
