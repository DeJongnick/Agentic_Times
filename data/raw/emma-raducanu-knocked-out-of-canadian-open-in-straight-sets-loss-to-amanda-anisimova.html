Her dominance continued in the second set as Raducanu won just eight points on her own serve, avoiding the whitewash after losing the first five games.</p> <p>Anisimova served it out to book a place in the fourth round, where she will face 10th seed Elina Svitolina, who stormed past Anna Kalinskaya 6-1, 6-1 on Friday night.</p> <p>Iga Świątek needed little more than an hour to complete a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Germany’s Eva Lys. The Wimbledon champion next faces Denmark’s Clara Tauson, who beat Yuliia Starodubtseva 6-3, 6-0.</p> <p>Jessica Pegula’s bid for a third straight Montreal title was ended by thew orld No 386 Anastasija Sevastova.
