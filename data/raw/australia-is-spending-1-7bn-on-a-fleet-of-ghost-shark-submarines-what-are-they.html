<p>The Australian government has committed $1.7bn to acquire a fleet of “dozens” – the exact number is classified – of Ghost Shark submarines for the Royal Australian Navy.</p>  <h2>What is a Ghost Shark submarine?</h2>  <p>A Ghost Shark is an extra-large autonomous undersea vehicle (XL-AUV), essentially an uncrewed submarine. They are designed and built in Australia.</p> <p>The government says the Ghost Shark will provide the Royal Australian Navy with a “cost-effective, stealthy, long-range, trusted undersea capability that can conduct persistent and disruptive intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike” operations. It can undertake long-range, long-duration missions without surfacing.</p> <h2>How many Ghost Sharks is Australia getting and what can they do?</h2>  <p>The government is being deliberately opaque about how many it will buy, how they will be deployed and the Ghost Shark’s capabilities.</p> <p>Ministers are only saying the navy will have “dozens”, and that the Ghost Sharks have a “very long range”. They can be deployed from warships, or launched off the coast.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>“This is a world-class capability that has the capability to conduct intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and strike at extremely long distances&nbsp;from the Australian continent,” said the defence industry minister, Pat Conroy, emphasising the final point. “Let me repeat that: we will have the ability to strike at extremely long distances from the continent of Australia.”</p>    <p>The government has also emphasised that this is a capability that has undergone significant testing, and is available more or less immediately.&nbsp;</p> <p>Unlike Australia’s planned nuclear submarine fleet, which will not come into service until next decade at the very earliest (and the Australian-built Aukus subs not until the 2040s), the Ghost Sharks will be in the service of the navy from January 2026.</p> <p>The $1.7bn price is also a fraction of the forecast cost of Aukus, which stands at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/aukus-will-cost-australia-368bn-what-if-there-was-a-better-cheaper-defence-strategy">$368bn to the 2050s</a>.</p> <h2>Why is Australia buying these drone submarines?</h2>  <p>The future of warfare, on land, in the air, and at sea, will be increasingly autonomous.</p> <p>Militaries around the world are pouring vast resources into autonomous technologies: they are far cheaper to build and run than crewed platforms, can be deployed at scale, and without human crew, are expendable.</p>    <p>A terrestrial example is the revolutionary use of <a href="https://smallwarsjournal.com/2025/06/11/ukraines-battlefield-drone-innovations/">cheap but lethal armed drones by Ukraine</a> to counter Russia’s invasion. Small armed drones worth a few hundred dollars are disabling tanks that cost tens of millions, halting entire offensives.</p> <p>Countries are also dedicating intense effort to improving submarine detection technologies, undermining the stealth capability that has been crewed submarines’ decisive advantage for decades.</p> <h2>Is there geopolitics involved here?</h2>  <p>Undoubtedly.</p> <p>The Australian government’s announcement comes a week after China held a massive military parade in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, showcasing a vast array of hardware and technology, a global flexing of PLA military muscle.</p> <p>And the announcement comes just weeks ahead of the prime minister, Anthony Albanese’s, visit to the US, for the UN General Assembly, but also a hoped-for meeting with Donald Trump.</p> <p>Behind closed doors and publicly, the Trump administration has been insisting that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/01/anthony-albanese-responds-to-us-pete-hegseth-push-for-huge-rise-in-defence-spending-as-it-stokes-china-fears">Australia nearly double its defence spending</a> to about $100bn a year, “as soon as possible” in the words of US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, citing what he said was a “real and potentially imminent” threat from China. The Ghost Sharks will be designed and built in Australia by Anduril Australia: its parent is a US company.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
