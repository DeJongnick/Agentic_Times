class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> has said it is “extremely disappointing” that it took the ITV drama about the Post Office scandal to get the government to accelerate compensation payments for wrongfully prosecuted post office branch owners, the inquiry into the Horizon scandal has heard.<br><br>Badenoch, the leader of the opposition who held the post of business secretary for 17 months until the general election, said she and then postal minister <strong>Kevin Hollinrake</strong> had been battling behind the scenes to get Treasury to sign off on funding to more rapidly and generously pay subpostmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal.<br><br>The inquiry was shown a letter sent last August by Badenoch to <strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, the then chancellor, asking for funding and a plan to increase payments to improve the compensation schemes.<br><br>Hunt rejected the request and “encouraged” Badenoch “to explore the full breadth of other options”. Badenoch, giving evidence on Monday, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I was not expecting the documentary [ITV Bates vs the Post Office drama] in January which helped speed things along. It suddenly turned it from a value for money question to a public perception question. This is the point I have been talking about. It is not enough to do the right thing, you have to be seen to be doing the right thing. Many people had not known the arguments [already] taking place behind the scenes at Whitehall. Work was being done by no one was seeing what was taking place.</p> </blockquote> <p>Badenoch said that the TV drama “changed the priority of the [Horizon] issue which was behind the NHS and security and so on to something we needed to solve now. It raised the prioritisation”.<br><br><strong>Jason Beer</strong>, counsel for the inquiry, said that it is disappointing to hear that it took a TV drama to get the government to change its priorities in relation to the scandal. Badenoch said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is extremely disappointing. If you look at it in the context of what is happening in government. There are 1000 things money is being requested for. After a while decision makers become very dispassionate, it becomes another line in the ledger. It is not irrational but it has to change, it is not helpful either. There is an absence of common sense in a lot of Whitehall. They don’t trust their judgement. People want legal cover.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-11-11T13:53:51.928Z">at 1.53pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6731e8e18f08f47b74dc68f9" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-11T11:26:40.561Z">11.26am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Bitcoin breaks through $82,000; dollar rises to four-month high</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Bitcoin has broken through $82,000 on so-called ‘Trump trades’ – with investors betting that a second <strong>Donald Trump</strong> administration will be more favourable towards the cryptocurrency.</p> <p>Bitcoin, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, touched $82,413 this morning, and is now trading at $82,105.</p> <p>AJ Bell investment director <strong>Russ Mould</strong> said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Bitcoin always seemed a likely beneficiary of a Trump victory and so it is proving as the cryptocurrency hits a new record high.</p> <p>It’s not just the incoming occupant of the White House which has helped bitcoin, there have also been down-ticket victories for candidates who have a positive stance on the asset class.

Cutting costs is one angle of attack to try and bring performance back on track, the other angle must come from stabilising the customer base, especially in the all-important motor division.</p> <p>The good news is that the rate of decline in customer numbers is slowing, as insurance prices are now starting to come down after some mammoth hikes were put through earlier in the year.</p> <p>It’s no secret that Direct Line has struggled over the past few years to deal with a challenging motor insurance market, and operational missteps have weighed on performance.

The pound lost by 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2894 while the euro slid by 0.35% versus the US currency, to $1.0680.</p> <p><strong>Ricardo Evangelista</strong>, senior analyst at ActivTrades, explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Despite the Federal Reserve’s recent 25-basis-point rate cut, the greenback is benefiting from market speculation that incoming US policies could spark inflationary pressures, potentially altering the Fed’s future rate trajectory.</p> <p>Donald Trump has announced plans for a protectionist trade agenda, including significant tariffs on imports. If implemented, these measures could drive consumer prices higher, potentially limiting the Fed’s options for future rate cuts. Against this backdrop, financial markets are responding by offloading Treasuries [US government bonds], which is pushing yields higher.</p> <p>This shift is also creating greater demand for the dollar as investors seek yield advantage, which in turn strengthens the greenback’s position. As a result, the dollar has been gaining momentum across major currency pairs, supported by expectations that US interest rates may remain elevated for a longer period.</p> </blockquote> <p>Traders see a 65% chance of another 25 basis-point rate cut from the Fed in December, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.
