<p>A bill that would accomplish <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s goal of abolishing the federal Department of Education has been introduced into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">US Senate</a>.</p> <p>The Republican senator Mike Rounds of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-dakota">South Dakota</a> introduced <a href="https://www.rounds.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/returning_education_to_our_states_act.pdf">the bill</a>, called the Returning Education to Our States Act, on Thursday. If passed, the bill would see $200bn in funding and the work of the education department redistributed to other federal agencies and states.</p> <p>“The federal Department of Education has never educated a single student, and it’s long past time to end this bureaucratic department that causes more harm than good,” Rounds said in a<a href="https://www.rounds.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/rounds-introduces-legislation-to-eliminate-us-department-of-education"> statement</a> announcing the bill.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/19/trump-nominates-linda-mcmahon-education-secretary">Trump picks former WWE executive Linda McMahon for education secretary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He added: “For years, I’ve worked toward removing the federal Department of Education. I’m pleased that president-elect Trump shares this vision, and I’m excited to work with him and Republican majorities in the Senate and House to make this a reality. This legislation is a roadmap to eliminating the federal Department of Education by practically rehoming these federal programs in the departments where they belong, which will be critical as we move into next year.”</p> <p>Major responsibilities of the Department of Education would be rerouted to other offices: the administration of federal student loans would become the responsibility of the treasury department; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which enforces protections for the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=64">7.5 million students</a> with special needs, would fall under the Department of Health and Human Services; the Fulbright-Hays Program would be overseen by the Department of State.</p> <p>The bill would require a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2024/10/24/trump-republicans-education-department-shut-down/">supermajority of 60 votes</a> in the soon-to-be Republican-controlled Senate to get passed. Notably, Rounds believes he can pass the bill with 50 votes, according to the <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2024/11/26/south-dakota-senator-mike-rounds-thinks-has-votes-to-cut-us-department-of-education/76600801007/">Argus Leader</a>. That feat would happen through reconciliation, a congressional loophole which allows the enactment of legislation on taxes and spending with only a majority. Despite Rounds’s ambition, reconciliation does not look promising as Democrats and some independents who oppose eliminating the department are still in control of the Senate and White House.</p> <p>Rounds could reintroduced the bill next term, when Republicans take control, but it would still require 60 votes to pass the Senate.</p> <p>Education and policy experts have expressed their concerns should the bill pass and for what else is ahead in another Trump administration.</p> <p>David DeMatthews, a professor in the University of Texas’s department of educational leadership and policy, said he did not think the education department “will be abolished ultimately, but I do have a lot of fears”.</p> <p>Education is one subject that “really cut[s] across the political divide”, he said.</p> <p>“People who are Republicans who voted for Trump, they may have a child with a disability or a traumatic brain injury that is in a special program that would cost that family $50-60,000. They want their child to be in a high-quality program that’s evaluated by the state. They want rights if the state is not doing a good job, and all of that comes from the federal special education law ‘Idea’ [the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act], and all of that is monitored and enforced by the US Department of Education.”</p> <p>It has long been a key objective of the Republican party to abolish the Department of Education since it was launched in 1980 by then president Jimmy Carter. Within that same year, Carter’s successor, Ronald Reagan, even campaigned on eliminating the newly formed department – though that desire was quashed after Reagan’s first education secretary, Terrel Bell, penned a report that “advocated for a strong federal role to ensure students received a high-quality education”, according to<a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2024/08/24/if-trump-abolished-the-department-of-education-what-would-happen/"> ChalkBeat</a>.</p> <p>Since then, the department has seen a push and pull depending on the party in office. Under Democratic administrations, the department has leaned more progressive. A recent example was the Biden administration issuing new Title IX rules in April that offered more protections for LGBTQ+ students, victims of sexual misconduct and pregnant students; in July, <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/maga-house-republicans-pass-resolution-to-undo-title-ix-rule-protecting-lgbtq-students-pregnant-parenting-students-and-survivors-of-sexual-assault-harassment">House Republicans blocked it</a>.</p> <p>In his campaign, Trump repeatedly <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-deliver-promise-ax-department-education/story?id=115871847">emphasized</a> that one of his education policies was to shutter the Department of Education and “create a new credentialing body that will be the gold standard anywhere in the world to certify teachers who embrace patriotic values support our way of life and understand that their job is not to indoctrinate children”.</p> <p>He has also pledged to return school choice to the states and cut federal funding for any school or program that teaches “critical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content”.</p> <p>Shortly after winning the 2024 presidential election, Trump baselessly claimed the education department was staffed by many people who “in many cases, hate our children” and said “we want states to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it” in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TqMek9evXs&amp;ab_channel=NowThisImpact">video</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Trump chose the former World Wrestling Entertainment executive Linda McMahon to serve as his as secretary of education, tasked with running the department he has vowed to close – a move DeMatthews calls “concerning”.</p> <p>“Across the board, what we’re seeing is already people in the Trump administration and some Republicans really trying to walk back some basic civil rights victories that happened in the 60s and 70s to support students with disabilities, low-income families, English learners,” DeMatthews said. <br><br>“I think if the public understood it and knew about it, they wouldn’t be for taking away supports to help some of the most marginalized children in our country.”</p>
