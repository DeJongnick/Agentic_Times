<p>A number of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/03/military-reveals-and-bold-messaging-five-key-takeaways-from-chinas-big-parade">world leaders gathered in Beijing</a> at a second world war commemoration parade on Wednesday, in a display designed to show off China’s military strength and geopolitical might. The presence of leaders such as Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un at the event has led to some western political and economic analysts describing it as a meeting of the “axis of upheaval”.</p> <p>After the parade, Russian state agency Sputnik released a group photo, featuring some expected – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/03/dan-andrews-china-military-parade-poses-with-kim-jong-un-vladimir-putin">and unexpected – faces</a>.
