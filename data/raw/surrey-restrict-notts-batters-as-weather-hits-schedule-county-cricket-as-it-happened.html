<h1>Surrey restrict Notts batters as weather hits schedule: county cricket – as it happened</h1>

It was only in a small pocket of south London that play was possible, a full day’s worth in the big title battle at The Oval.</p> <p>Division One leaders Surrey, who had a one-point lead over second-placed Nottinghamshire coming into the game, sent their East Midlands visitors in and had bowled them out after tea. It was a disciplined and, at times, fierce display of bowling led by Matt Fisher (five for 61) and Gus Atkinson (four for 41).</p> <p>Atkinson, who is almost sure to play his first Ashes series this winter, was particularly slippy. He made the first breakthrough, sending Haseeb Hameed on his way for nine. The Notts captain was caught in the slips, where he’d been dropped a few overs before. Freddie McCann (34) and Ben Slater (50) then batted fluently until Fisher removed them both after lunch.</p> <p>As the wind continually buffeted the flags on top of the pavilion, and scattered leaves and sticks from the poplar trees around the concourse, Surrey’s relentless bowlers pressed on. A boundary-laden cameo from Joe Clarke (29) and an unbeaten 30 from Brett Hutton apart, the visiting batsmen struggled to assert their authority.</p> <p>Fisher enjoyed his first five-wicket haul for Surrey since he moved from Yorkshire last winter. “We did what we usually do, hunt like a pack,” he said after play. “I felt like I’ve put in decent areas all season, sometimes I’m lacking that little bit of nip but I had it today.” And on watching his bowling partner: “I’m purring at mid-on watching Gus.” Ben Foakes finished with five catches.</p> <p>As the shadows spread over the ground like a rash, Rory Burns and Dom Sibley did what they do, playing a straight and steady bat. Then from nowhere, Dillon Pennington made one spit off the pitch and Sibley got a lick as it passed by. The batter threw his head back in frustration as he had to trudge back to the pavilion, out for 14 with just nine balls left.</p> <p>The high winds which delayed play around all the grounds (except the Riverside, which was affected purely by rain) did so because of the risks to ground staff and spectators in handling flat covers, including the covers lifting staff off the ground, or blowing loose and hitting the crowd.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c84c678f0807088ffe7346" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-15T17:29:03.828Z">6.29pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>From a chilly and quickly</strong> darkening Oval, good night!
