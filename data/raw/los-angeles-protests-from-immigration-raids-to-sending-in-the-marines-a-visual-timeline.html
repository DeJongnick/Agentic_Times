<p>After a series of immigration raids across the city of Los Angeles on Friday inspired mostly peaceful protests involving a few hundred people, the situation escalated on Saturday when the US president,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump"> Donald Trump</a>, took the unprecedented step of mobilizing the national guard – the country’s military reserve units – claiming the demonstrations amounted to “rebellion” against the authority of the US government. The governor of California, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom">Gavin Newsom</a>, called the decision “purposefully inflammatory”. Here’s a look at what actually happened on the streets.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/lafriday-zip/giv-325547mABIt31hCBw/" data-alt="map of LA showing where events took place"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/lafriday-zip/giv-325547mABIt31hCBw/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Most of the events took place in downtown Los Angeles, in a fairly localized area.

Footage shows the 58-year-old head of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) being knocked down by a masked agent. He was taken to a hospital, then transferred to the Metropolitan detention center in downtown LA. “What happened to me is not about me; this is about something much bigger,” he says in a statement from the hospital. “This is about how we as a community stand together and resist the injustice that’s happening.” In a <a href="https://x.com/usattyessayli/status/1931156650968088931?s=46&amp;t=qXzB4Zbfs9Z2M8I6JtOLEA">statement</a>, US attorney Bill Essayli claims Huerta “deliberately obstructed their access by blocking their vehicle” and says he was arrested on suspicion of interfering with federal officers.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F09%2FLA_loop3.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F09%2FLA_loop3.mp4" data-alt="footage of protests on a street"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F09%2FLA_loop3.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F09%2FLA_loop3.mp4">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Friday 6 June, afternoon.</strong> Demonstrators gather outside the federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles, where Huerta and others are being held.

Ice officers and other federal agents use teargas and pepper balls in an attempt to disperse the crowds. Throughout the afternoon, there are isolated episodes of vandalism – graffiti sprayed on buildings and vehicles, and a protester who damages the side mirror of a parked car. A line of spray-painted Waymo driverless cars, one with a smashed windshield, are later set on fire.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/ladowntown3dview-zip/giv-32554F5lOtm5hqEn0/" data-alt="satellite map of downtown LA"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/ladowntown3dview-zip/giv-32554F5lOtm5hqEn0/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Downtown Los Angeles</strong></p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F09%2FLA_loop9.jpg&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F09%2FLA_loop9.mp4" data-alt="footage of protesters on an empty freeway"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F09%2FLA_loop9.jpg&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F06%2F09%2FLA_loop9.mp4">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Sunday 8 June, afternoon.</strong> Hundreds of protesters block the 101 Freeway.

Newsom and the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, double down on their plea to protesters to stay peaceful. “Protest is appropriate to do, but it is just not appropriate for there to be violence,” Bass says, while the LAPD chief, Jim McDonnell, calls the violence “disgusting” and says officers have been pelted with rocks, and shot at with commercial grade fireworks. Crucially, he notes that those engaging in violence were not among the people demonstrating against the immigration raids, but are “people who do this all the time”.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/lamonday-zip/giv-32554Y5wPZdbwNK0X" data-alt="Map showing incidents in relation to immigration raids and protests on Monday, 9 June"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/lamonday-zip/giv-32554Y5wPZdbwNK0X">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Monday 9 June, morning. </strong>After a relatively calm night, Los Angeles sees more immigration raids carried out in the morning across the wider metropolitan area.
