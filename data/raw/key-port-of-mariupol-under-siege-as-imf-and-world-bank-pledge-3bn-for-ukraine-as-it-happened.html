 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It is 6.30am in Ukraine. Here’s where we stand right now:<br></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Russian troops have reportedly landed in Kharkiv</strong>, Ukraine’s second most populous city, according to the security service of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Russian partatroopers reportedly landed at around 3am local time (1am GMT) and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces.</li> 
   <li><strong>Kyiv and other cities in Ukraine are coming under more bombardment</strong> in the early hours of Wednesday morning as the Russian military steps up its offensive and moves forces closer towards the capital.</li> 
   <li><strong>Joe Biden’s used his State of the Union address</strong> to warn Vladimir Putin that he cannot divide the west and that dictators should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/joe-biden-ukraine-state-of-the-union">“pay a price for their aggression”</a>. He won a standing ovation for his praise of the Ukrainian resistance against what he called Russian “tyranny”.</li> 
   <li><strong>Biden also announced that the US is closing American airspace </strong>to all Russian flights, “further isolating Russia”.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>Four people have been killed </strong>after homes in the city of <strong>Zhytomyr</strong> west of Kyiv were hit by a cruise missile apparently aimed at a nearby airbase, Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the interior minister, <a href="https://t.me/s/Pravda_Gerashchenko/">said</a> on his Telegram channel.</li> 
   <li><strong>The southern cities of Kherson and Mariupol are likely now encircled by the Russians, </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/DefenceHQ/status/1498689670581997569?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">according to the UK Ministry of Defence.</a></li> 
   <li><strong>Thousands of Ukrainians are trying to leave Kyiv, </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/01/it-might-be-the-last-chance-to-get-out-citizens-flee-kyiv-as-assault-intensifies">our correspondent in Kyiv reported,</a> as Russia’s defence ministry warned residents to leave as it plans to strike targets in the Ukrainian capital. The UN says more than 680,000 people have already fled the city.</li> 
   <li><strong>The IMF and the World Bank have condemned the Russian action in Ukraine</strong> and the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/03/01/pr2252-joint-imf-world-bank-group-statement-on-the-war-in-ukraine">“horrifying” suffering </a>of people there. The organisations pledged a $3bn package of support for the country.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>Apple has said it will pause all product sales in Russia while </strong><strong>Boeing is suspending “major operations”</strong> <strong>in Moscow</strong>, as well as “parts, maintenance, and technical support services for Russian airlines”. Ford and the British carmaker<strong> Jaguar Land Rover </strong>have also suspended operations, along with Nike.</li> 
   <li><strong>Brent crude oil has soared 5.8% to $110.09 a barrel, its highest since 2014. </strong>The Russian rouble has fallen again in early trading on Wednesday to hit 109.2 to the dollar.</li>

  <p><strong>Governments across Southeast Asia are trying to urgently evacuate their citizens from Ukraine. </strong></p> 
  <p>A group of 53 Thai nationals are expected to leave Ukraine today, while 23 remain in several cities and have been unable to travel “due to lockdowns and other conditions”, according to the spokesman of Thailand’s ministry of foreign affairs, Tanee Sangrat. As of 1 March, 1,143 Thai nationals had departed the country.</p> 
  <p>Similar efforts are underway across the region, including in Indonesia, which said on Monday that it had evacuated 31 citizens, according to the Jakarta Post. On Tuesday night, a group of 13 Filipinos, including three students and a baby, arrived in Manila, after travelling from Kyiv to Lviv in Western Ukraine, and then to Poland. Six others were repatriated last month. </p> 
  <p>Southeast Asian governments’ response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has mostly been muted. A statement released by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations did not mention Russia by name, but called on “all relevant parties to exercise maximum restraint”. </p> 
  <p>However, Singapore made a rare announcement this week that it would impose sanctions on Russia, which it said were prompted by the “unprecedented gravity” of the situation. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Oil price surges past $110</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Brent crude soared 5.8% on Wednesday to stand at $11i.09 per barrel</strong>, its highest since early July 2014, as the rising cost of energy showed no sig of easing.</p> 
  <p>The rise came despite a global agreement <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/01/oil-reserve-release-barrels-price-surge-crisis">to release 60m barrels of crude reserves </a>to try to rein in price increases.</p> 
  <p>“We think that there is some room still for oil prices to continue to climb,” said Carlos Casanova, senior Asia economist at UBP in Hong Kong told Reuters.</p> 
  <p>“So much of it depends upon political factors and making sure that some of the supply coming out of Russia is offset with (not just) more oil from U.S. shale, but also Iran.”</p>

  <p>Russia president Vladimir <strong>Putin has signed a decree to prohibit Russians from leaving the country with more than $10,000 in foreign currency</strong>, Russia state media outlet <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1414529">TASS</a> reports.</p> 
  <p>Citing the decree, the news agency reported:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The export of foreign currency cash and foreign currency instruments over $10,000 calculated based on the official exchange rate set by the Russian Central Bank on the day of export will be banned starting on March 2.” </p>

  <p>The move is an attempt to “ensure Russia’s financial stability” according to a statement from the Kremlin press office. </p> 
  <p>It comes in response to the crippling sanctions western nations have imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Russian troops land in Kharkiv - reports</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Russian troops have reportedly landed in Kharkiv</strong>, Ukraine’s second most populous city, according to the Security Service of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Ukrainian authorities said at approximately 3am local time, Russian airborne troops landed and engaged in heavy fighting with Ukrainian forces.</p> 
  <p>“A Russian landing party landed in Kharkiv,” an <a href="https://t.me/s/dsszzi_official">alert</a> from Ukraine’s State Special Communications agency read just before 3am.</p> 
  <p>The agency said the soldiers attacked the military medical clinical centre hospital, adding that a “battle broke out between the invaders and the Ukrainian defenders.”</p> 
  <p>The city, with a population of about 1.5 million, has been encircled for days and saw at least six people killed when the region’s administrative building on Freedom Square was hit with what was believed to be a missile.</p> 
  <p>The attack on Freedom Square — Ukraine’s largest plaza, and the nucleus of public life in the city — was seen by many Ukrainians as brazen evidence that the Russian invasion wasn’t just about hitting military targets but also about breaking their spirit.</p> 
  <p>The bombardment blew out windows and walls of buildings that ring the massive square, which was piled high with debris and dust. </p> 
  <p>“People are under the ruins. We have pulled out bodies,” said Yevhen Vasylenko, an emergency official.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskiy pronounced the attack on the square “frank, undisguised terror” and a war crime. “This is state terrorism of the Russian Federation,” he said.</p>

  <p>The US president detailed economic sanctions, such as the decision to cut off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system and “choking off” Russia’s access to technology that will “sap its economic strength and weaken its military” for years to come. </p>

  <p>Biden’s State of the Union speech promised an “unwavering resolve” that “freedom will always triumph over tyranny”.</p> 
  <p>Read some of the key excerpts below: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p> Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. </p> 
   <p>He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. </p> 
   <p>He met the Ukrainian people. </p> 
   <p>From President Zelenskiy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. </p> 
   <p>Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland ... </p> 
   <p>Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos. They keep moving. </p> 
   <p>Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. He thought the west and Nato wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. </p> 
   <p>Putin was wrong. We were ready. Here is what we did. We prepared extensively and carefully.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p> Biden then said the free world will hold the Russian president accountable. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>We are inflicting pain on Russia</strong> and supporting the people of Ukraine. <strong>Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever. </strong></p> 
   <p>Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. </p> 
   <p>When the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger. </p> 
   <p>In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security. </p> 
   <p>This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people. </p> 
   <p>Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people. </p> 
   <p>He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>US president <strong>Joe Biden says Russian president Vladimir Putin must “pay a price” </strong>for his actions in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>In his State of the Union speech, held at Capitol Hill 9.30pm EST, Biden said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – <strong>when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos</strong>. They keep moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising.</p> 
   <p>That’s why the Nato alliance was created to secure peace and stability in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> after World War 2. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters.</p> 
   <p><strong>Putin’s war was premeditated and unprovoked.</strong> He rejected efforts at diplomacy. He thought the west and Nato wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us here at home. <strong>Putin was wrong. We were ready.</strong></p> 
   <p>Putin has unleashed violence and chaos. But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run. <br></p>

  <p>Mariupol, an industrial center, is seen as a key target and has been the scene of fierce fighting since the invasion began. Its capture would help Russia establish a land corridor between Crimea and its mainland.</p>

  <p>A <strong>Ukrainian cyber guerrilla warfare group </strong>plans to <strong>launch digital sabotage attacks against critical Russian infrastructure </strong>such as railways and the electricity grid, to strike back at Moscow over its invasion, a hacker team coordinator told Reuters.</p> 
  <p>Officials from Ukraine’s defence ministry last week approached Ukrainian businessman and local cybersecurity expert Yegor Aushev to help organise a unit of hackers to defend against Russia.</p> 
  <p>On Monday, Aushev said he planned to organise hacking attacks that would disrupt any infrastructure that helps bring Russian troops and weapons to his country.</p> 
  <p>“Everything that might stop war,” he said. “The goal is to make it impossible to bring these weapons to our country.”<br></p> 
  <p>Aushev said his group has already downed or defaced dozens of Russian government and banking websites, sometimes replacing content with violent images from the war. He declined to provide specific examples, saying it would make tracking his group easier for the Russians.<br></p>

  <p>Overnight strikes on multiple Ukrainian cities have resulted in deaths and damage to residential neighborhoods, according to reports and government sources. As my colleague Samantha Lock continues our live coverage, here’s a summary of what’s happened in the past few hours: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Ukraine is expected to be a focus of tonight’s State of the Union address</strong> in the United States, where Joe Biden will condemn “Putin’s war” as “premeditated and unprovoked,” and tout the importance of NATO and American diplomacy. </li> 
   <li><strong>At least two people were reported dead and three injured in a strike on a military base in Zhytomyr</strong>, in northwest Ukraine, which also reportedly affected nearby homes, with ten private homes damaged, and some of them on fire. </li> 
   <li><strong>There were reports of heavy bombing in Kharkiv and strikes on residential neighborhoods in Kyiv. </strong></li> 
   <li><strong>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund released a joint statement saying that they “stand with the Ukrainian people”</strong> and condemning the “horrifying” attacks they have endured. They promised hundreds of millions of dollars in rapid support to Ukraine, and billions over the next months. </li> 
   <li><strong>The list of American companies that announced in recent hours they were suspending sales of their products </strong>or other operations in Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine includes Apple, Nike, Ford Motor Company, and Boeing. </li>

  <p>After pausing to regroup and draw new assets into place around the capital, the ISW expects Russian forces to relaunch their attack on the capital, Kyiv. The new phase is thought to play out over several days.</p>

  <p><strong>Polish nationalists attempt to attack African and Middle Eastern students fleeing Ukraine </strong></p> 
  <p>Dozens of Polish nationalists gathered on Tuesday evening near the train station in Przemyśl, where refugees from Middle East and Africa fleeing the war in Ukraine are being sheltered, and attempted to attack them. The attackers, linked to the local football team’s ‘hooligans’, approached groups of African and Middle Eastern students who had just arrived in Poland from cities in Ukraine that have been invaded by the Russians, and harassed them, shouting slogans and anti-immigrant chants.</p> 
  <p>“Around 7 pm, these men started to shout and yell against groups of African and Middle Eastern refugees who were outside the train station,” two Polish journalists from the press agency OKO, who first reported the incident, told me. “They yelled at them: ‘Go back to the train station! Go back to your country!’”</p> 
  <p>Polish police reacted by chasing some of the nationalists and dispersing the crowd.</p>

  <p>“I was with my friends, buying something to eat outside,” says Sara, 22, from Egypt and a student in Ukraine. “These men came and started to harass a group of men from Nigeria.

 <h2 class="block-title">Biden speech preview: ‘Putin’s war was premeditated and unprovoked’</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The White House has released some key lines from <strong>Joe Biden’s State of the Union address</strong> tonight, including the warning that dictators should “pay a price for their aggression” and the assertion that “American diplomacy matters.” </p> 
  <p>You can follow more developments on the American political response to Ukraine on our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/mar/01/joe-biden-state-of-the-union-address-putin-russia-ukraine-live-latest">US politics liveblog, which will have full coverage of tonight’s speech</a>. </p> 
  <p>From Biden’s planned remarks: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson – when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos. They keep moving. And, the costs and threats to America and the world keep rising.</p> 
   <p>That’s why the NATO alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2. The United States is a member along with 29 other nations. It matters. American diplomacy matters.</p> 
   <p>Putin’s war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected efforts at diplomacy. He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us here at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.</p> 
  </blockquote>

   <p>From his bunker in Kyiv, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/03/01/europe/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-cnn-interview-intl/index.html">urged Biden</a> to make the State of the Union speech a “useful” act for the besieged country. Ukraine has been urging the west to impose a “no-fly zone” over “significant parts” of the country, which Nato has refused for fear of being dragged into direct war with Russia.</p> 
   <p>Ukraine’s ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, will watch the speech <a href="https://twitter.com/JesseRodriguez/status/1498727976627838976">as a guest</a> of the First Lady, Jill Biden, sitting alongside her in her viewing box.</p>

  <p><strong>Thousands of Ukrainians are currently in the capital city Kyiv, trying to escape as fears of large-scale attack loom, Shaun Walker reports from Kyiv:</strong> </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The piercing screams of children mingled with the barking of traumatised dogs and the shouts of soldiers desperately trying to maintain order, as the 14.07 to Ivano-Frankivsk pulled into Kyiv’s central station.<br></p> 
   <p><strong>There was a crowd of thousands on platform one</strong>, surging towards the blue carriages and desperate to secure a prized place on a ride westwards out of the Ukrainian capital.<strong> Most people would not be able to board.</strong></p> 
   <p><strong>“Look at these faces around us, they are exactly the same as in the photographs from the second world war, and it’s just five days. Can you imagine what will happen in a month?”</strong> asked Tanya Novgorodskaya, 48, an art historian who arrived at the station on Tuesday afternoon with her 15-year-old daughter.</p> 
   <p>She had bought tickets for six different trains, but <strong>soon realised they counted for nothing.</strong> Instead, there was a boarding algorithm: first mothers with children, then women, then old people. <strong>Others were kept away by the police and soldiers standing guard.</strong></p> 
   <p>Quickly, the train was crammed full. <strong>Families had to make split-second decisions, as mothers and children were allowed to board but grandparents told to wait behind.</strong></p> 
   <p>This was the sixth day of Vladimir Putin’s war on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, <strong>and by now fear had taken over.</strong> In the first days, there was a sense of shock and disbelief. Then came pride and inspiration, at the surprisingly resilient Ukrainian response and the unity of Ukrainian society.</p>

  <p>The company also laid off all of its employees, noting US sanctions as the reason for the company’s collapse. </p> 
  <p>Here are more details on the bankruptcy from the Financial Times’s Sam Jones: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p> Speaking to SRF on Tuesday evening, the economic director for the canton of Zug, where Nord Stream is based, said the cantonal authorities have been informed today that the business was unable to continue its operations. <br></p> 
   <p>“The head of the office for economic affairs and labour was on site today and was informed in detail about the situation,” said Silvia Thalmann-Gut.</p> 
   <p>Nord Stream 2 did not immediately respond to inquiries. Numbers listed for its press spokespeople in Switzerland were disconnected. </p> 
   <p>Around 106 employees — the company’s entire local workforce — have already formally received termination notices, Thalmann-Gut said, citing an imminent deadline of US sanctions against the company as the cause of its collapse today. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Russia has blocked two independent media organisations for spreading “deliberately false information” about Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, AFP reports.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>The death of a 21-year-old Indian medical student who was killed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Tuesday, one of the first foreign nationals to die in the conflict, has thrown a spotlight on the tens of thousands of Indian students who remain trapped in the country since Russia’s invasion began.</strong></p> 
  <p>According to the Indian foreign ministry, there were initially 20,000 Indian citizens in Ukraine, mostly students. So far around 12,000 have been successfully rescued but another 8,000 remain in heavy conflict areas or are still making their way to the borders.</p> 
  <p>Ukraine is a popular destination for Indian students, who flock to Ukrainian universities for the less competitive admission and low cost to study subjects such as medicine and engineering.</p> 
  <p>The student who died was identified as Naveen Shekharappa Gyanagoudar, 21, from the southern Indian state of Karnataka. He was a fourth year medical student at Kharkiv National Medical University.</p> 
  <p>According to classmates who were with him, Gyanagoudar died when there was an air strike and shelling as he was lining up for food outside of a shop in the city.</p> 
  <p>A friend told the Indian Express:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Naveen was shot dead around 10.30 am Ukrainian time today. He was standing in the queue before a grocery shop when the Russian army fired at people. We have no information about his body.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Many other Indian students remain in bunkers in Kharkiv, said his friend. </p> 
  <p>His death was confirmed by a spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External affairs who tweeted: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>With profound sorrow we confirm that an Indian student lost his life in shelling in Kharkiv this morning.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a background briefing, the Indian government said India had repeatedly taken up the issue of safe passage of Indian nationals with both Russia and Ukraine, and an Indian evacuation team was positioned in the Russian city of Belgorod, close to the Ukrainian border.</p> 
  <p>Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said that in his call with Putin a few days ago, he had raised the issue of the safety of Indian students.<br></p>

  <p><strong>The EU is looking at cutting Russia’s second largest bank, VTB, from the Swift bank messaging system, along with six others that play a vital role in the Russian economy,</strong> our Brussels correspondent, Jennifer Rankin, reports. </p> 
  <p>An EU source confirmed reports that the EU is seeking to ban VTB and six other banks from Swift, the messaging system that underpins much global trade, pending a final decision by EU member state senior officials later on Tuesday. </p> 
  <p>The other banks that could be excluded from Swift include three already sanctioned by the EU last week: Rossiya Bank, believed by EU and western officials to be the personal bank for Vladimir Putin and many of his officials; Promsvyazbank and Vnesheconombank (VEB), both considered by EU officials to be instructed personally by the Russian president, with a key role in financing Russia’s defence sector.</p> 
  <p>The EU has already sanctioned the VTB chair and deputy prime minister, Dmitry Grigorenko, as well as the VEB chair, Igor Shuvlov, in an earlier round of sanctions adopted on the eve of the Russian invasion.</p> 
  <p>Earlier in the day, the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said EU sanctions would take “a heavy toll on the Russian economy and the Kremlin”. </p> 
  <p>She said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We are disconnecting key Russian banks from the Swift network. We also banned the transactions of Russia’s central bank, the single most important financial institution in Russia. This paralyses billions in foreign reserves, turning off the tap on Putin’s war.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>EU officials are also likely to finalise a decision<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/27/eu-ban-russian-state-backed-channels-rt-sputnik"> announced on Sunday to ban Russia’s state-backed channels RT and Sputnik</a>. The two outlets and all their subsidiaries are likely to be added to an EU sanctions list, making it impossible to do business with them.</p> 
  <p>Some EU officials are also interested in granting passports to qualified Russian nationals, seeking to emigrate from Putin’s Russia.</p> 
  <p>In her speech to the European parliament, Von der Leyen referred to the thousands of Russians who have been arrested in anti-war protests, saying: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is another Russia besides Putin’s tanks. We extend our hand of friendship to this other Russia.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But the idea has yet to be put to EU member states that are responsible for decisions on visa policy. Diplomats pointed out that many countries already run schemes to attract skilled workers that could be used by talented Russians, while stressing that visas were national, rather than EU competences.</p>

  <p><strong>The Russian advance on Kyiv has “stalled” as its forces face logistical challenges, including a shortage of food for some units, according to a senior US defence official. </strong></p> 
  <p>The official claimed the Russian advance on the Ukrainian capital remains “basically … where it was yesterday” and cited a number of possible reasons, including Ukrainian resistance.</p> 
  <p>They said it was also possible the Russians were pausing their advance by choice:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>One reason why things appear to be stalled north of Kyiv is that the Russians themselves are regrouping and rethinking and trying to adjust to the challenges that they’ve had.</p>

  <p>But the official also noted that the Russian military had shown evidence of “risk-averse” behaviour when it came to its own troops.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You’ve seen it on the ground, where units are surrendering, sometimes without a fight. And they’ve got, a lot of these soldiers are conscripts, never been in combat before, some of whom we believe weren’t even told they were going to be in combat. </p>

  <p>“China is trying to juggle a balanced position to support Russia’s ‘reasonable concerns’ and at the same time not to burn all the bridges,” said Yun Sun of Stimson Centre in Washington DC. </p>

  <p>An EU ban could also result in the station being blacked out in the UK but this depends on whether Brussels can instruct the Luxembourg satellite company, SES/Astra to drop RT services, which are then distributed in the UK on Sky and Freesat platforms. </p> 
  <p>Sources say neither Sky or SES can legally drop RT without regulatory or legal intervention. </p> 
  <p>In the UK RT is now subject to 15 investigations by the national regulator, Ofcom which could result in its licence being revoked. </p> 
  <p>The EU decision to block RT comes after Google, Facebook and YouTube all took measures to restrict access. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The time is 1.10pm in Kyiv. This is a round-up of the main headlines from Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine so far today:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>More than 70 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed </strong>after Russian artillery hit a military base in Okhtyrka, a city between Kharkiv and Kyiv, the head of the region wrote on Telegram.</li> 
   <li><strong>Russian forces </strong>have <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/russian-rocket-strikes-kill-dozens-in-kharkiv-as-ukraine-russia-talks-begin">launched rocket attacks that killed “dozens” of civilians</a></strong> in Ukraine’s second city of <strong>Kharkiv,</strong> and began a renewed assault on the capital <strong>Kyiv</strong>. At least nine people have been killed, including three children, and 37 wounded in one day after the shelling in the city, its mayor said.</li> 
   <li><strong>Russia’s advance on Kyiv has made little progress in the past 24 hours due to logistical difficulties</strong> and the army has increased its use of artillery north of the capital, a British military intelligence update said.</li> 
   <li><strong>The southern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> city of Kherson </strong><strong>is “surrounded” by Russian soldiers</strong>, according to accounts by a Ukrainian journalist, Alyona Panina, and the city’s mayor.<br></li> 
   <li>The <strong>European parliament is set to call for EU-wide restrictions on imports of Russian oil and gas to the bloc</strong>, as it urges even tougher sanctions aimed at the ‘strategic weakening’ of Russia’s economy and ability to wage war.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>Western sanctions will never make Russia change its position on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, the Kremlin said. </strong>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that while direct negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv had begun, there were no plans for talks between the two countries’ presidents.</li> 
   <li><strong>Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has called for further international sanctions against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a></strong> after what he said was a “barbaric” attack on the city of Kharkiv.</li>

  <p><strong>Western sanctions will never make Russia change its position on Ukraine, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.</strong></p> 
  <p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that while direct negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv had begun, there were no plans for talks between the two countries’ presidents.</p> 
  <p>Peskov dismissed as fakes allegations of Russian strikes on civilian targets and the use of cluster bombs and vacuum bombs as fakes, Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p>He declined to give an assessment of the military situation on the ground on the sixth day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin describes as a special operation to demilitarise and “denazify” the country.</p> 
  <p>Peskov declined to comment on whether the Kremlin considers the capital Kyiv to be under the control of Nazis, referring the question to the Russian military.</p>

  <p><strong>Boris Johnson has said there is an “unfolding disaster in our European continent”.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking in Warsaw, the UK prime minister said the Polish government and people were doing an “amazing job, an inspirational job” in addressing the humanitarian crisis.</p> 
  <p>“We in the UK stand ready to help you, we have humanitarian supplies already coming in – I think two planes of medical supplies have already landed, there is more to come,” Johnson said.</p> 
  <p>The UK government has come under pressure from Conservative and opposition MPs to do more to take in Ukrainian refugees.</p> 
  <p>Johnson told his Polish counterpart, Mateusz Morawiecki: “We stand ready, clearly, to take Ukrainian refugees in our own country, working with you, in considerable numbers, as we always have done and always will.”</p> 
  <p>The prime minister also paid tribute to the “leadership and courage” of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president.</p> 
  <p>“I think he has inspired and mobilised not only his own people. He is inspiring and mobilising the world in outrage at what is happening in Ukraine,” Johnson added.</p>

  <p><strong>Millions of artworks and monuments are at risk from Russia’s military onslaught in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, with one museum already burned to the ground, the global arts organisation Getty has said.</strong></p> 
  <p>Ukrainian scholars are warning of an “unfolding cultural catastrophe”, Getty said in a statement from James Cuno, the president and chief executive officer of the J Paul Getty Trust.</p> 
  <p>Fedir Androshchuk, the director of the National Museum of the History of Ukraine in Kyiv, said he was attempting to safeguard the museum from attack or looting alongside two colleagues and two armed police.</p> 
  <p>“The museum is located in the middle of a rich cultural heritage area near three fine churches, but also close to some possible targets (the Ukrainian security service and border forces),” he wrote in an email to a Swedish academic.</p> 
  <p>Getty said Russian forces had begun destroying Ukraine’s cultural heritage, including the Ivankiv museum, about 50 miles north of Kyiv, which housed “precious Ukrainian folk art”.</p> 
  <p>Monuments at risk represent “centuries of history from the Byzantine to the baroque periods” and Unesco world heritage sites.</p> 
  <p>Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs <a href="https://twitter.com/MFA_Ukraine/status/1498218345832882177">tweeted</a> on Monday that 25 works by the folk artist Maria Prymachenko held by the museum had been lost. “She created world-famous masterpieces. Her special gift and talent captivated Pablo Picasso,” said the ministry.</p>

  <p><strong>The European parliament is set to call for EU-wide restrictions on imports of Russian oil and gas to the bloc, as it urges even tougher sanctions aimed at the ‘strategic weakening’ of Russia’s economy and ability to wage war.</strong></p> 
  <p>The text will be voted on after an address to MEPs from Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is expected to address the assembly in Brussels via video link. </p> 
  <p>MEPs are arguing for more severe sanctions as a response to Russian attacks on civilian areas and infrastructure. </p> 
  <p>In a resolution likely to be adopted by a large majority on Wednesday, MEPs also call on the EU to close ports to Russian ships and refuse access to vessels bound for Russia, with the exception of those carrying vital humanitarian supplies. It also proposes measures to “restrict the import of the most important Russian export goods, including oil and gas”, although stops short of calling for a ban.</p> 
  <p>Other demands include a halt to all new EU investment into Russia, which is unlikely in reality, as well as a definitive ban on Nord Stream 2, beyond the suspension of the approval process already done by the German government.</p> 
  <p>MEPs also want all proposed Russia sanctions mirrored for Belarus, which has been a launchpad for the Russian attack.</p> 
  <p>After Ukraine’s government filed an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/feb/27/russia-ukraine-latest-news-missile-strikes-on-oil-facilities-reported-as-some-russian-banks-cut-off-from-swift-system-live?filterKeyEvents=true">application for EU membership</a> on Monday, the resolution calls on EU institutions towork towards granting EU candidate status to Ukraine as part of a “merit based” process, while continuing to integrate Ukraine into the EU single market.</p> 
  <p>Such words may seem irrelevant or fanciful, as a 40km invading Russian convoy approaches Kyiv and civilians are killed in heavy shelling, but are intended to send a signal of support. The reference to “merit based”, however, also keeps in check membership hopes. A group of western Balkan countries have been in the EU membership queue for eight-to-17 years and senior officials have long said there would be no shortcuts in tackling corruption and judicial reform.</p> 
  <p>More immediately, the EP resolution calls for “multibillion euro assistance” for Ukraine, while stating Russia bears responsibility for the significant losses and should be required to compensate Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>The European parliament has almost no powers to set EU foreign policy, but often puts pressure on EU decision-makers in national capitals to go further and faster.</p>

  <p><strong>Turkey is calling on all sides in the Ukraine war to respect an international pact on passage through the Turkish straits to the Black Sea, defence minister Hulusi Akar said after Ankara closed access.</strong></p> 
  <p>Nato member Turkey borders Ukraine and Russia in the Black Sea and has good ties with both. Under the 1936 Montreux convention, Ankara has the right to limit transit through its straits during wartime.</p> 
  <p>This allows it to curb Russian warships going to the Black Sea. The pact grants exemption to ships returning to their home bases, Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p>Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was cited by state media as saying that Turkey had demanded all Black Sea and non-Black Sea states to halt passage through its straits.</p> 
  <p>“Eroding Montreux or disrupting the status quo in any way is to nobody’s benefit. We see a benefit in preserving Montreux. We tell all sides that it would be beneficial to abide by Montreux,” Akar told reporters after Monday’s cabinet meeting, his ministry said.</p> 
  <p>In a call on Monday, US secretary of state Antony Blinken “expressed his appreciation” to Cavusoglu for Turkey’s implementation of the accord, state department spokesperson Ned Price said. </p> 
  <p>At least four Russian ships are waiting to cross from the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>He told Sky News: “Those that engage in war crimes will be held to account.”</p>

  <p><strong>Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven said they would contest the “spurious and unfounded basis” of European Union sanctions imposed for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p>The EU on Monday sanctioned both Fridman and Aven, along with dozens of other prominent Russians, Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p>The EU said “Aven is one of Vladimir Putin’s closest oligarchs” and that Fridman had been “referred to as a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin’s inner circle.”</p> 
  <p>“Mikhail Fridman and Petr Aven … are profoundly shocked by the demonstrably false allegations made in the EU regulation purporting to justify the basis on which they have been sanctioned,” the businessmen said, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Mr Fridman and Mr Aven will contest the spurious and unfounded basis for the imposition of these sanctions – vigorously and through all means available to them to reverse unwarranted and unnecessary damage to the livelihoods and prosperity of their many employees, customers, partners and stakeholders and the businesses that they and their partners have built up over the past 25 years.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Aven said it was wrong of the EU to say that he was an “especially close personal friend” of Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin. Fridman said it was untrue that he had ”cultivated strong ties” to the administration of Vladimir Putin.</p> 
  <p>They both said it was untrue to state they “were unofficial emissaries for the Russian government” or that they had supported or benefited from Russian decision-makers responsible for the destabilisation of Ukraine.</p>

  <p><strong>Russia’s advance on Kyiv has made little progress in the past 24 hours due to logistical difficulties</strong> and the army has increased its use of artillery north of the capital, a British military intelligence update said.</p> 
  <p>“The Russian advance on Kyiv has made little progress over the past 24 hours probably as a result of continuing logistical difficulties,” the British defence ministry said in a military intelligence update.</p> 
  <p>“Russian forces have increased their use of artillery north of Kyiv and in vicinities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv. The use of heavy artillery in densely populated urban areas greatly increases the risk of civilian casualties.”</p> 
  <p>“Russia has failed to gain control of the airspace over Ukraine prompting a shift to night operations in an attempt to reduce their losses,” it said.<br></p>

  <p>“This is turning into a much much more perilous misadventure for Putin than I think he realised,” Dominic Raab told Sky News. “I think we’ve been very clear that those that engage in war crimes will be held to account.”</p> 
  <p>Raab added that Britain would not seek to enforce a no-fly zone over Ukraine, and said that the conflict would not be over even if Russia managed to occupy Kyiv.</p>

  <p>More on the Kharkiv missile attack from our correspondent Luke Harding:</p> 
  <p>Ukraine’s operational command says Russian forces have <strong>fired a rocket at the regional administration building</strong> in Kharkiv. Video shows a massive explosion with the building hit directly. Several civilian cars were passing at the time.</p> 
  <p><strong>The strike was an attempt to kill Kharkiv’s governor</strong> and his team leading the defence of the city, Ukraine’s second largest, Kyiv says. Residents say Kharkiv was targeted again last night and this morning.</p> 
  <p>A second video showed extensive damage from the strike to a private flat across the road Kharkiv’s administration building.</p>

  <p><strong>The rise of Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong> from comic actor to the figurehead of a heroic pushback against the brutal might of the Russian military is the subject of our Today in Focus podcast.</p> 
  <p>Luke Harding, one of our correspondents in Ukraine, tells Michael Safi how Zelenskiy was considered a bit of a joke candidate when he ran for president in 2019 but prevailed in the election, and now personifies the defiance and dignity of Ukraine’s embattled population.</p>

   <li><strong>Russia has assembled a military convoy north-west of Kyiv that stretches for 40 miles</strong>, according to satellite images taken by a US company. A major assault on the Ukrainian capital has been expected for days.</li> 
   <li><strong>The invasion has fallen behind schedule</strong> thanks to fierce Ukrainian resistance, and multiple equipment and logistics failures, according to a classified US briefing. The US also expects a “long and bloody battle” for Kyiv, US senator Chris Murphy said.</li>

   <li><strong>Disney has called off all upcoming theatrical releases in Russia</strong>, including Pixar film Turning Red, as international businesses continue to withdraw from Russia. Warner Bros and Sony <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/01/disney-and-warner-bros-pause-film-releases-in-russia-over-ukraine-invasion">are pulling The Batman and Morbius respectively.</a></li> 
   <li><strong>Ukraine’s ambassador to the UN</strong> read aloud a text message exchange said to be between a Russian solider in Ukraine and his mother shortly before he was killed.</li>
