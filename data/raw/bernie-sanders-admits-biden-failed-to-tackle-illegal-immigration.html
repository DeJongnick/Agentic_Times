<p>Liberal US senator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> has praised <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> drive to clampdown on illegal immigration and fentanyl in an admission that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>’s administration failed to adequately tackle the issues.</p> <p>Sanders, the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, made the surprising concession in an interview with <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/bernie-sanders-admits-trump-right-about-cracking-down-at-border-says-democrats-shouldve-done-much-better-job-last-4-years/">ABC’s Jonathan Karl</a> on Sunday that was otherwise noteworthy for his threat to end it prematurely after the host asked him about the political future of progressive congresswoman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</a></p> <p>Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/bernie-sanders-aoc-arizona-rally-trump-musk">addressed mass audiences</a> in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/23/bernie-sanders-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats">joint “fight oligarchy” tour</a> that saw them try to tap into popular opposition to Trump’s policies in the first two months of the Republican’s second presidency.</p> <p>Asked if there was anything Trump had done right, Sanders replied: “Yeah. I think cracking down on fentanyl, making sure our borders are stronger.”</p> <p>He went on: “Nobody thinks illegal immigration is appropriate, and I happen to think we need comprehensive immigration reform, but I don’t think it’s appropriate for people to be coming across the border illegally, so we’ve got to work now on comprehensive immigration reform.”</p> <p>Challenged by Karl to explain why illegal immigration had “exploded under Biden” but “nothing was really done until his last year in office”, Sanders replied: “Yes. Should have done better. No argument.”</p> <p>Sanders implicitly criticised Trump’s attempt to carry out mass deportations of undocumented immigrants – a process that has already begun with flights of deported immigrants to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/27/trump-deportations-panama">Panama</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/16/deportation-alleged-gang-members-el-salvador">El Salvador</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/colombia-gustavo-petro-trump-deportation-flights">Colombia</a>. He warned that a mass exodus of undocumented workers could devastate the US economy.</p> <p>“The idea that Trump has … he says he wants to deport 20 million people who are in this country who are undocumented,” Sanders said. “Well, you do that, you destroy the country, because I got news for you – Trump’s billionaire friends are not going to pick the crops in California that feed us. They’re not going to work in meat packing houses. That’s what undocumented people are doing.”</p> <p>He said the situation called for “a variety of programs”, including “guest worker” schemes. But he said it should be ultimately tackled through “comprehensive immigration reform”.</p> <p>Sanders’s guarded endorsement of Trump’s stance represents a significant hardening of his past position. His 2020 presidential campaign <a href="https://berniesanders.com/issues/welcoming-and-safe-america-all/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">platform </a>called for the breaking up of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) as well as US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agencies as well as pausing deportations pending an audit.</p> <p>The platform also called for “a humane policy for those seeking asylum” and extolled the image of the US as “a nation of immigrants”.</p> <p>“We now have a president who is a racist, a xenophobe, and a demagogue,” the platform said, referring to Trump, who lost re-election that year to Democratic challenger Biden before retaking the presidency in November. “The Trump administration’s treatment of immigration exclusively as a criminal and national security matter is inhumane, impractical, and must end.”</p> <p>Sunday’s interview was also marked by a testy response from Sanders after Karl asked him if he would like to see Ocasio-Cortez, a US House member from New York, run for the Senate.</p> <p>Sanders called the question “nonsense” and stood up to end the interview after saying: “I don’t want to talk about inside-the-Beltway stuff.”</p> <p>He relented and completed the interview after Karl told him he had one more question.</p>
