<p>The French call it <em>la rentrée</em>. But more than panic-buying school shoes and booking emergency haircuts, early September’s “return” in France signifies a broader reset for everyone.</p> <p>Not all of us are lucky enough – or French enough – to have the summer off. Regardless, there’s something in the air at this time of year, whether you’re young or old, have kids or don’t: that delicious new-pencil-case feeling. For me, it’s a welcome return to order after the freewheeling anarchy of the summer holidays, a time to re-establish routines.</p> <p>The traditional start of the school year (in England at least; Scottish kids have been back for a few weeks now) is the perfect time, as summer eases into autumn, to set <em>new</em> intentions – from getting in shape to spending less time on screens. Paddy Maddison asked Guardian readers for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/28/budget-friendly-fitness-hacks">the thing that actually helped them get fitter</a>. From a <a href="https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/cardio-fitness-trampoline-fit-trampo-100/_/R-p-147480">mini trampoline</a> to a dog, the answers were surprising – and inspiring.</p>    <p>It’s also, let’s be honest, the perfect excuse to indulge your stationery fetish. As Kate McCusker says in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/sep/04/back-to-the-grind-buys-men-women-kids">her piece on getting back to the grind</a>, a gorgeous notebook, such as <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.leuchtturm1917.co.uk%2Fnotebook-classic.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Fsep%2F05%2Fseptember-is-the-real-new-year">this from Leuchtturm</a>, is the perfect way to kick off the new (school) year. My personal favourite is from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hoxtonminipress.com%2Fcollections%2Fnotebook%2Fproducts%2Fbad-ideas-notebook&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Fsep%2F05%2Fseptember-is-the-real-new-year">Hoxton Mini Press</a> – not cheap at £17.95, but mine has lasted almost two years and meets my strict requirements: unruled paper, lies flat, great design. As Kate points out, pricey notebooks are probably unsustainable for most of us: these <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.muji.eu%2Fproducts%2Fset-of-5-planted-tree-paper-notebooks-a4-16023&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Fsep%2F05%2Fseptember-is-the-real-new-year">sustainably minded notebooks</a> from Muji are a more affordable alternative.</p> <p>September is a great time to refresh your own basics, as well as your kids’, from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblack-blum.com%2Fproducts%2Flunch-bag&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Fsep%2F05%2Fseptember-is-the-real-new-year">a stylish lunch bag</a> and a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.withnothingunderneath.com%2Fcollections%2Fshirts-all-fabrics%2Fproducts%2Fthe-classic-fine-poplin-royal-blue-stripe&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Fsep%2F05%2Fseptember-is-the-real-new-year">classic striped shirt</a> to a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ryman.co.uk%2Funi-ball-ub-150-rollerball-pen-plastic-free-packaging-pack-of-5-black&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Fsep%2F05%2Fseptember-is-the-real-new-year">fresh pack of pens</a>, writes Kate.
