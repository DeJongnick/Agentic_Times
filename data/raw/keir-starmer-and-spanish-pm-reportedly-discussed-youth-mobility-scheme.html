<p>Keir Starmer has discussed the possibility of a youth mobility scheme with the Spanish prime minister, according to reports.</p> <p>Pedro Sánchez is said to have put the proposal to Starmer in a private meeting during the European Political Community summit at Blenheim Palace earlier this month.</p> <p>Starmer did not reject the idea and told Sánchez he would consider it, the Sunday Telegraph reports.</p> <p>Recent years have seen growing calls for a scheme that would allow young people to live, study or work in the EU for a limited period.</p> <p>In April, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/apr/19/sunak-rejects-offer-of-mobility-scheme-for-young-people-between-eu-and-uk">Rishi Sunak rejected an offer</a> from the European Commission that would have granted people aged 18 to 30 free movement for up to four years.</p> <p>At the time, Labour said it had no plans for such a scheme but that it would “seek to improve the UK’s working relationship with the EU within our red lines”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/25/uk-post-brexit-scheme-eu-citizens-courts">Courts place UK’s post-Brexit scheme for EU citizens at risk, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The manifesto on which Labour won the election earlier this month said there would be “no return to … freedom of movement”. A bilateral deal with Spain would not in itself break that pledge.</p> <p>The UK already has some form of youth mobility scheme with 13 non-EU countries, including Australia, Canada and New Zealand as well as Japan, Iceland and Uruguay.</p> <p>The existing schemes differ from freedom of movement in that they typically still require applicants to get a visa, provide evidence of sufficient funds to support themselves and pay a health service surcharge.</p> <p>A government spokesperson told the Telegraph: “We have been clear that we won’t rejoin the single market, customs union or reintroduce freedom of movement, and we are not considering a youth mobility scheme.”</p> <p>In January, London mayor Sadiq Khan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/jan/20/sadiq-khan-free-young-people-from-brexit-work-and-travel-ban">called for a deal</a> that would allow young people to move freely to and from the EU, saying it would help lessen the economic and cultural damage caused by Brexit.</p> <p>He said the current Brexit deal had “done damage right across London and it is young people who have been hardest hit in so many ways”.</p>
