<p>Zoe Williams calls the debate on obesity “toxic” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/13/the-toxic-debate-about-obesity-rages-on-but-at-least-we-know-if-mounjaro-or-wegovy-is-better-for-weight-loss">13 May</a>), but hits the nail on the head by saying that even scientists with opposing views are united by the same goal of helping people live long and healthy lives. The crux of the problem is that obesity is incredibly complex. It’s influenced by people’s local environments and their socioeconomic circumstances, alongside genetics.</p> <p>Increases in obesity have largely emerged over the past century, coinciding with major environmental changes, particularly since the 1980s. We see this when observing successive generations taking part&nbsp;in the <a href="https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/">UK’s birth cohorts</a>. Early&nbsp;in the 20th century, childhood obesity was largely nonexistent, but for <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001828">cohorts&nbsp;born after the 1980s</a>, the likelihood of being overweight or obese at age 10 was two to three times higher than those born before. Similar patterns are seen in adults – the later in the 20th century you were born, the more likely you were to become overweight, and at younger ages.</p> <p>This sits in a wider trend called the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/07/baby-boomers-living-longer-but-are-in-worse-health-than-previous-generations">generational health drift</a>”, which sees higher prevalence of chronic health conditions at earlier&nbsp;ages among younger generations. This points to the role&nbsp;of people’s local environments&nbsp;and socioeconomic circumstances, rather than being the fault of individuals.</p> <p>As Williams rightly points out, environmental forces have the biggest impact on low-income households. Recent developments in weight-loss medication shows great promise, but only if they stay affordable for everyone. </p> <p>Crucially, there remains a need to address the social, economic and environmental factors driving obesity through bold public health and anti-poverty policies.<br><strong>Dr Charis Bridger Staatz</strong><br><em>Senior research fellow, </em><em>UCL Centre for Longitudinal Studies</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
