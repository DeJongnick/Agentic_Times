<p>China’s ruling Communist party (CCP) has replaced the head of its powerful international department two months after he disappeared from public life.</p> <p>Liu Jianchao, an influential official who had been widely tipped to be the next foreign minister, was reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/11/liu-jianchao-china-diplomat-detained-beijing">detained</a> while returning from an overseas trip in late July. He has not been seen publicly since.</p> <p>Liu’s profile on the CCP’s international department website has been replaced by one of Liu Haixing, a former director of the foreign ministry’s European department. The change was apparent on Tuesday but was not accompanied by any official announcement. Liu Jianchao’s personal profile page has been taken offline.</p> <p>The CCP’s international department handles relations with foreign political parties and socialist states.</p> <p>Liu Jianchao frequently met foreign dignitaries and had recently visited the UK. He is fluent in English and studied international relations at Oxford University, served in China’s mission to the UK and was widely tipped to be the next foreign minister.</p> <p>He is the most high-level diplomat to go missing since China ousted its former foreign minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/26/rumours-swirl-over-dramatic-fall-of-xi-loyalist-qin-gang-china">Qin Gang</a> in 2023. Qin, who has not been heard from since, was replaced by his predecessor, Wang Yi.</p> <p>Liu Haixing may now be a more likely candidate to replace Wang as China’s top diplomat in the next reshuffle.</p> <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Liu Jianchao had been placed under investigation for alleged corruption and violations of party discipline, citing people briefed on the matter. Liu himself has previously worked for the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, China’s graft-busting agency.</p> <p>One of Liu’s deputies, Sun Haiyan, was reportedly taken away for questioning in August but she has since appeared at public events and represented China in meetings with foreign countries.</p> <p>In recent years a string of senior Chinese officials have been removed from public life without explanation. The former defence minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/27/chinese-communist-party-expels-two-ex-defence-ministers-for-corruption">Li Shangfu</a> was sacked in 2023 and later expelled from the CCP, along with Wei Fenghe, another former defence minister. Their punishments were officially confirmed to be related to a corruption investigation in the People’s Liberation Army.</p> <p>People purged from the senior ranks of the CCP may be left to live their remaining years in political and social exile or they may face harsh criminal penalties.</p> <p>CCP inspectors have punished more than 6 million people for corruption and other disciplinary offences since Xi Jinping became China’s leader in 2012.</p>
