<p>The fossilised remains of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/17/montana-fossilized-dueling-dinosaurs-skeletons-dino-cowboy">two dinosaurs locked in combat</a> have unleashed a fresh drama, suggesting diminutive specimens thought to be Tyrannosaurus rex teenagers could instead be separate, smaller species.</p> <p>The “duelling dinosaurs” fossil, which reveals a triceratops in battle with a medium-sized tyrannosaur, was unearthed in Montana by commercial fossil hunters in 2006 and dates to shortly before the asteroid strike that ended the reign of the dinosaurs 66m years ago.</p> <p>It only became available for scientific research after <a href="https://duelingdinosaurs.org/">it was acquired</a> by the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS) in recent years.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/23/dinosaurs-asteroid-struck-research">Dinosaurs were thriving until asteroid struck, research suggests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now researchers say a detailed analysis of the fighting tyrannosaur reveals it is not a juvenile T rex as many had thought but an adult of a different species, <em>Nanotyrannus lancensis.</em></p> <p>“Our specimen is a fully grown <em>Nanotyrannus</em> weighing only 1,500 pounds after two decades of growth,” said Dr Lindsay Zanno, a co-author of the study from North Carolina State University and the head of palaeontology at NCMNS.</p> <p>“The anatomy of <em>Nanotyrannus</em>, from its higher tooth count, enlarged hands, shorter tail, unique pattern of cranial nerves and sinuses and smaller adult body size, is incompatible with the hypothesis that this skeleton is a teenage T rex,” Zanno said.</p> <p>The name <em>Nanotyrannus lancensis</em> was previously given to a small skull that was reported in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana in 1946. However, experts later argued that specimen, known as the Cleveland skull, was actually a juvenile T rex<em>.</em></p> <p>Now the study by Zanno and colleagues, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09801-6">published in the journal Nature</a>, reveals <em>Nanotyrannus lancensis</em> was indeed a species in its own right that lived at the same time and<em> </em>inhabited the same ecosystems as T rex.</p> <p>What’s more, the team say the skeleton of a juvenile dinosaur named Jane found in the Hell Creek Formation in 2001 is not a young T rex either but a new species of <em>Nanotyrannus</em>.</p> <p>“Our study suggests some specimens previously argued to represent juveniles of T rex<em> </em>are instead <em>Nanotyrannus</em>,” Zanno said.</p> <p>She said the results had important implications. “For decades, palaeontologists have unknowingly used <em>Nanotyrannus</em> specimens as a model for teenage T rex to understand the biology of Earth’s most famous dinosaur – studies of its locomotion, growth, diet and life history. Those studies need a second look,” she said.</p> <p>Prof Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the work, said that for many years in his research on tyrannosaurs he had considered a set of smaller skeletons found in the same rocks as T rex fossils to be T rex juveniles.</p> <p>“I think new evidence from this exquisite new specimen in the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences shows that I was wrong – at least in part,” he said, adding that the analysis of the duelling tyrannosaur offered “solid evidence” <em>Nanotyrannus</em> was real.</p> <p>But Brusatte said he was not convinced there were multiple species of <em>Nanotyrannus</em>, while he also pointed out that the multitude of fossilised T rex adults that had been unearthed suggested there should be fossilised juveniles too.<em> </em></p> <p>“So I’m not yet ready to proclaim every smaller tyrannosaur skeleton to be <em>Nanotyrannus</em>,” he said. “Some of these must be juvenile T rexes, and I think it is ultimately going to be very hard to tell apart adult or near-adult <em>Nanotyrannus</em> from teenage T rex<em>.</em>”</p>
