<p>Several people have died, including the co-founder of a music agency, after a small aircraft crashed in a neighborhood in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/san-diego">San Diego</a> early on Thursday morning, clipping one home and damaging several vehicles.</p> 
<p>Sound Talent Group, which has represented artists such as Sum 41 and Vanessa Carlton, confirmed on Thursday that three of its employees died on the private plane. Among those who died was the agency’s co-founder Dave Shapiro, who was listed as the owner of the plane and has a pilot’s license, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</p> 
<p>Six people were onboard the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, but the total number of deaths is unknown.</p> 
<p>Several people on the ground were injured as they tried to flee, including five people from a family who were treated for smoke inhalation and another person who was injured as they attempted to climb out of a window.</p> 
<p>Dan Eddy, the assistant San Diego fire chief, said at a news conference that the crash had killed the plane’s passengers.</p> 
<p>The incident was reported in the Murphy Canyon community, near the Montgomery-Gibbs executive airport, around 3.47am local time. Amid foggy weather, the plane reportedly struck at least one home, charring the structure and causing the roof to collapse, and damaged several vehicles. Authorities said the crash damaged about 10 homes, and left jet fuel throughout the area.</p> 
<p>Media reported the area was covered in glass and an extensive debris field as a thick black smoke lingered.</p> 
<p>“I can’t quite put words to describe what the scene looks like, but with the jet fuel going down the street, and everything on fire all at once, it was pretty horrific to see,” said Scott Wahl, the San Diego police chief.</p> 
<p>Christopher Moore, who lives near the crash site, told the Associated Press that a loud bang woke him and his wife and that when they looked out their window they saw smoke.</p> 
<p>The couple grabbed their two young children and ran out of the house, seeing a car in flames as they fled the neighborhood.</p> 
<p>At least 100 residents of the neighborhood evacuated. Meanwhile, authorities closed nearby roads, diverting drivers on northbound Interstate 15.</p> 
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration <a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/small-plane-crashes-into-murphy-canyon-neighborhood-sdpd/3831213/">reported</a> a Cessna 550 aircraft crashed at about 3.45am local time near the Montgomery-Gibbs executive airport, with an unknown number of people onboard.</p> 
<p>The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.</p> 
<p>Officials said they will investigate whether the plane may have hit a power line.</p> 
<p>Sound Talent Group has not yet shared the names of the other two employees who died.</p> 
<p>“We are devastated by the loss of our co-founder, colleagues and friends. Our hearts go out to their families and to everyone impacted by today’s tragedy,” the agency said in a statement.</p>
