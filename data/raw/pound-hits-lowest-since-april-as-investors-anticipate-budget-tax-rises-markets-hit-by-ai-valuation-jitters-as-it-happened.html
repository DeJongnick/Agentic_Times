 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Time to recap</p> 
  <p><strong>The pound has weakened, and UK government bonds have strengthened, after chancellor Rachel Reeves appeared to clear the way for tax rises in this month’s budget.</strong></p> 
  <p>In an early morning speech, <strong>Reeves</strong> declined to reiterate Labour’s manifesto commitment against broad-based tax hikes, warning that the public finances were in a worse state than expected after “years of economic mismanagement”.</p> 
  <p><strong>Reeves</strong> told reporters her Budget priorities were to bring down borrowing costs, NHS waiting lists and the cost of living, while also citing predictions that weak UK productivity would create a large fiscal black hole.</p> 
  <p>Reeves explained:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“As chancellor, I have to face the world as it is, not the world that I want it to be. And when challenges come our way, the only question is how to respond to them, not whether to respond, or not.”</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>Reeves also stated her ‘iron clad’ commitment to her fiscal rules.</p> 
  <p><strong>The City took the speech as a clear signal that taxes will rise on 26 November.</strong></p> 
  <p>Gilt prices rose, pushing down the yield (or interest rate) on UK debt. Currently, the yield on UK 10-year bonds is down 3 basis points (0.03 percentage points) at 4.4%, while long-dated 30-year bonds are also down 3bps at 5.18%.</p> 
  <p>Some economists predicted that a tough budget packed with fiscal tightening measures could encourage the Bank of England to cut interest rates more quickly. In response, the pound has dropped by almost a cent today to $1.3044, a near-seven-month low.</p>

  <p>Rachel Reeves could create a “virtuous feedback loop” by raising taxes to bring down public borrowing, and prompting lower interest rates, argues <strong>Andrew</strong> <strong>Wishart</strong>, economist at <strong>Berenberg</strong> bank.</p> 
  <p>In an upbeat take on this morning’s speech, <strong>Wishart</strong> writes:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ commitment to inflation and public debt reduction at the expense of the Labour party’s manifesto commitment to not raise certain taxes in an unusual pre-budget speech this morning is encouraging. </p> 
   <p>A major tightening of fiscal policy at the budget announcement on 26 November could create a virtuous feedback loop to lower interest rates and public borrowing, even if it is delivered by tax hikes rather than spending cuts.</p> 
   <p>By making “cutting the national debt” one of the guiding principles of the budget, the Chancellor hinted that she would tighten fiscal policy more aggressively than markets anticipated so far. Existing plans to run a current budget surplus of £9.9bn in fiscal year 2029-30 would only have stabilised the debt-to-GDP ratio. Reeves confirmed that her totemic government investment plan totalling 2% of GDP per year will remain in place, leaving her the options of cutting day-to-day spending or raising taxes. Although the Chancellor mentioned welfare reform and public sector productivity, the prioritisation of health and defence spending suggests that spending cuts will make a marginal contribution to the tightening of fiscal policy in the 26 November budget at best.</p> 
   <p>The Chancellor as good as abandoned the Labour party’s manifesto commitment not to raise any of the main taxes on income and consumption (income tax, value added tax and national insurance) by avoiding restating it. This paves the way for a broad-based tax hike at the budget.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Analysis: Reeves aims to prepare voters and markets for possible budget tax rises</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>It is extremely rare for chancellors to haul in journalists for a formal speech less than three weeks before a budget.</strong></p> 
  <p>But Reeves and her team are acutely conscious of how difficult a communications challenge they have ahead of them.</p> 
  <p>Reeves had hoped to stick to Labour’s manifesto pledges not to touch income tax, VAT or national insurance, reaching instead for progressive “reforms” of the tax system that would raise more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/rachel-reeves-says-those-broadest-shoulders-should-pay-fair-share-tax">from those with the “broadest shoulders”</a>.</p> 
  <p>But some in Labour were always sceptical about the politics of that – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/04/rachel-reeves-urged-to-break-manifesto-pledges-to-avoid-pasty-tax-budget">fearing a botched “pasty tax”-style budget </a>– and an OBR forecast at the worse end of the Treasury’s fears has put the manifesto promises back in play.</p> 
  <p>Amid a maelstrom of speculation about individual tax rises, then, the team at No 11 were keen to haul back control of the narrative….</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">China commits to further EU talks over rare earths</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>China has committed to further talks with the EU about easing the restrictions on the global exports of rare earths critical to the car industry, the European Commission has said.</strong></p> 
  <p>While <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/11/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-strikes-deal-on-economic-and-trade-relations-with-china/">the White House said</a> Beijing would “eliminate China’s current and proposed export controls” on rare earths and critical minerals following a summit between Donald Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping in Korea last week, the EU is still subject to some restrictions.</p> 
  <p>China agreed a global 12-month pause on new restrictions it threatened on 9 October as part of the deal hashed out with Trump in Korea last week.</p> 
  <p>However restrictions on rare earth exports imposed by China in April still apply to the EU, impacting everything from car assembly lines to the production of wind turbines and computer servers.</p> 
  <p>Ahead of a briefing of EU ambassadors on Wednesday, an EU spokesperson said progress had been made at a meeting of senior officials from both sides like Friday in Brussels.</p> 
  <p>Trade spokesperson <strong>Olof</strong> <strong>Gill</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“The EU and China also discussed how to making supply chain stability in relation to other rare earths [notably those for which China imposed export controls in April 2025], and commited to further engage on licensing facilitation measures, including discussing general licences.” </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>A new licensing system, he added would “facilitate stable exports”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">RSM: Budget likely to be deflationary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Rachel Reeves’s approach to the budget suggests there’s an increased chance of a cut to UK interest rates in December, argues <strong>Thomas Pugh,</strong> chief economist at audit, tax and consulting firm<strong> RSM UK.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Pugh</strong> says this morning’s speech is unlikely to move the dial for this week’s Monetary Policy Committee decision, though:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“We didn’t learn anything new from Rachel Reeves speech this morning. But the emphasis on cutting the cost of living and bringing down interest rates gives us more confidence that this budget will be deflationary rather than a repeat of the stagflationary budget of last year.</p> 
   <p>“We doubt that the speech will have had much impact on the outcome of the MPC meeting on Thursday. It will be a close call, but we think the majority of the MPC will want to see the actual policies contained in the budget before committing to another rate cut. However, it does raise the chances of a rate cut in December if the budget is as deflationary as the Chancellor hinted at this morning.</p> 
   <p>“Our current estimates suggest that Rachel Reeves will have to engage in a fiscal consolidation of between £35bn - £40bn, depending on how much she wants to increase the fiscal headroom by. Slower growth in spending can bear some of the burden, but not much given spending envelopes have already been set, and the government has shown it cannot get even minor changes to welfare spending through parliament. That means the bulk of the consolidation will have to come from increased taxes.</p>

  <p><strong>Simon French, </strong>chief economist at investment bank <strong>Panmure</strong> <strong>Gordon</strong>, says Rachel Reeves gave a “fair speech” allocating blame, attribution, and the principles guiding her upcoming decisions on tax.</p> 
  <p>He has three takeaways: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Firstly, that the Chancellor wishes to broaden the base of who pays any additional tax beyond businesses and those with high value assets/incomes.</p> 
   <p>Secondly, that she wishes to boost headroom beyond the £10bn she left herself in her first two fiscal events. </p> 
   <p>Thirdly, the Chancellor wants to bear down on inflation through the fiscal choices she makes - in a clear confession that this was a policy failure in her October 2024 Budget. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>All three of these conclusions are sensible, French adds, cautioning that the politics however are “toxic”. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Unless the Chancellor - backed by her PM - goes far further and faster on deregulatory supply side reforms to energy, housebuilding, labour and financial markets she will find herself forced into considerable public spending cuts later in the Parliament.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Reeves urged to tax super-rich more</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves is facing fresh calls for a wealth tax, after delivering her early morning speech to prepare the ground for tough tax decisions in the budget.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Green Party</strong> leader <strong>Zack</strong> <strong>Polanski</strong> has criticised the chancellor for not spelling out how her government will tackle the cost of living or address inequality. </p> 
  <p><strong>Polanski</strong> is urging <strong>Reeves</strong> to “tax wealth fairly” to address inequality, reduce the burden on the poorest and help fund frontline government services, insisting:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“Any measures that look to balance the books on the backs of some of the most vulnerable – and those struggling to pay their rent; their food and energy bills – instead of taxing the assets of multimillionaires and billionaires will be the mark of economic, social and environmental failure. </p> 
   <p>“This must be a cost-of-living budget. That’s a moral imperative. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Caitlin Boswell, </strong>head of advocacy and policy at <strong>Tax Justice UK, </strong>is also encouraging Reeves to “tax the super-rich” to improve living standards at the Budget, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There’s no excuse for sticking-plaster solutions or cuts to vital social security support when millions around the UK are still struggling to make ends meet.</p> 
   <p>Reeves was right to focus on the cost of living crisis. Clearly people need to see the cost of essential items and bills come down and investment in public services go up. This country doesn’t have a shortage of money, just a shortage of fairness. Rewiring the tax system to tax wealth the same as work can help the government build an economy that works for everyone.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><a href="https://taxpolicy.org.uk/2025/07/22/uk-wealth-tax-anti-growth/">Critics of wealth taxes, though</a>, argue that the revenue is highly uncertain, and predict the tax would lower long‑run growth, employment and investment.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Markets hit by correction fears</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>There’s some exciteable talk today that Rachel Reeves has wiped billions of the UK stock market today, but the reality is more nuanced.</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>FTSE 100</strong> did fall during and after the speech, amid expectations that tax rises might dampen consumer spending and economic growth.</p> 
  <p>But it’s clawed back some losses since, with housebuilders’ shares rising </p> 
  <p>Also, other country’s stock markets are deeper in the red today in a general selloff. Germany’s <strong>DAX</strong> is down 1.3%, France’s <strong>CAC</strong> <strong>40</strong> has lost 1.2% and Spain’s <strong>IBEX</strong> has fallen by 1%.</p> 
  <p>Wall Street is heading for losses too, with the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> share index down 1% in pre-market trading and the tech-focused <strong>Nasdaq</strong> off 1.2%.</p> 
  <p>The selloff is being partly attributed to a cooling in the artificial intelligence boom, despite data intelligence company Palantir reporting up rapid quarterly growth last night.</p> 
  <p>Another factor is fading optimism that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates as soon as December.</p> 
  <p>A third reason is fears that markets have risen too high, and are vulnerable to a correction.</p> 
  <p><strong>Kathleen Brooks, </strong>research director at <strong>XTB, </strong>explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Wall Street CEOs have also put investors on notice for a correction in the next 1-2 years. The Goldman Sachs CEO said that tech stock valuations are ‘full’, and the Citadel CEO also warned that stock markets are irrational at the highs of bull markets. With the S&amp;P 500 trading at a price to earnings multiple above its 5-year average, it is no wonder that the wisest on Wall Street are concerned about the future.</p> 
   <p>It seems like the investment community has taken heed of this message, and European stocks are falling.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>There are three principle takeaways from Rachel Reeves’s speech this morning, reports <strong>Michael Brown, </strong>senior research strategist at brokerage <strong>Pepperstone</strong>, namely:</p> 
  <ol> 
   <li><p>The Chancellor all-but-confirmed that the OBR will be downgrading its trend productivity growth forecasts</p></li> 
   <li><p>Reeves noted that she is seeking a greater degree of fiscal headroom (&gt;£9.9bln that was left in the spring) to protect against future shocks</p></li> 
   <li><p>Reeves refused to repeat the manifesto promises not to raise income tax, national insurance, or VAT</p></li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>He reckons this means Reeves will deliver a larger fiscal tightening than had been expected, to address a black hola of perhaps £35bn, due to:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>£20bln from the OBR’s productivity downgrade</p></li> 
   <li><p>£5bln from the failure to cut welfare spending</p></li> 
   <li><p>£3bln from measures to cut consumer energy bills</p></li> 
   <li><p>Between £5bln - £10bln in seeking to build a buffer larger than the £9.9bln in the ‘Spring Statement’</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>That means an income tax hike is now “incredibly likely”, Brown suggests, in two ways:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Firstly, the freeze on income tax thresholds, in place since 2022, and currently due to expire in 2028, looks set to be extended once more. This, over time, causes an effect known as ‘fiscal drag’, whereby an increasing number of employees are dragged into higher tax thresholds as earnings increase, but the thresholds remain unchanged. Freezing these thresholds is likely to raise around £10bln a year.</p> 
   <p>Secondly, an outright increase in income tax rates is likely to be delivered. Increasing the higher rate of income tax, likely an easier ‘sell’ to Labour MPs and voters, would raise around £1.5bln per annum, barely a ‘drop in the ocean’ in the grand scheme of things. Consequently, the balance of risks increasing tilts towards the Chancellor increasing the basic rate of income tax, where a 1p increase would raise between £6bln - £7bln a year.</p> 
   <p>For context, no Chancellor has raised the basic income tax rate since all the way back in 1976*. That same year, the UK was forced to go ‘cap in hand’ to the IMF for a bailout, so here’s hoping history doesn’t repeat.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">AJ Bell: Reeves should be clearer about her plans</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>“Rachel Reeves’ unusual stance of giving a big speech on the eve of the Budget has left investors with more questions than answers, and done nothing to remove uncertainty around taxes,” says <strong>Dan Coatsworth, </strong>head of markets at <strong>AJ Bell</strong>.</p> 
  <p> <strong>Coatsworth </strong>points out that the bond market would be happy if the chancellor raises taxes as it would help to improve public finances and make the UK less risky from an investment perspective. </p> 
  <p>He adds that Reeves needs to be clearer about what she is planning: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“The chancellor said the speech was about giving context to the challenges facing the government, but she batted away questions about taxes faster than an Olympic table tennis player.</p> 
   <p> “Many people are fed up with this game. There are growing calls for the chancellor to be crystal clear in her plans and make bolder decisions. No-one will be shocked at tax rises and many people believe it is better to sort the situation out once and for all, rather than keep tinkering at the edges. This feels like Reeves’ last chance to fix the house, otherwise her days could be numbered.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">City Index: pound falls as Reeves has little choice but to hike taxes.</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The pound has now dropped to $1.3064, a new six-month low, as City traders anticipate tax rises in this month’s budget.</strong></p> 
  <p>Sterling has lost more than 0.5% today, or around three-quarters of a cent, with analysts pointing to Rachel Reeves’s promise of an “iron clad” commitment to her fiscal rules, and her failure to rule out tax rises.</p> 
  <p><strong>Fiona Cincotta, </strong>senior market analyst at <strong>City Index,</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In a rare pre-budget speech, Reeves reiterated her commitment to budget goals and what many are considering as weaves, paving the way for more tax hikes and tough decisions in the Budget that would come close to breaking the party’s manifesto pledges.</p> 
   <p>Reeves is increasingly expected to lift income tax by 2p at the same time as lowering National Insurance by 2p as part of the measures that she will take to plug a fiscal black hole of over £20 billion. This means that working people won’t be affected, but pensioners will.</p> 
   <p>High spending, weak growth, and a productivity downgrade mean Reeves is now in a position where she has little choice but to hike taxes.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">News story: Rachel Reeves avoids ruling out tax rises as autumn budget looms</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out tax rises in this month’s budget, insisting she must “deal with the world as I find it, not the world as I might wish it to be”.</strong></p> 
  <p>The chancellor foreshadowed an income tax increase, a breach of Labour’s manifesto commitment, as a result of the public finances being in a worse state than expected after “years of economic mismanagement”.</p> 
  <p>In an early morning Downing Street press conference, she said that “each of us must do our bit” for the country’s future. “If we have to build the future of Britain together, we will all have to contribute to that effort,” she said.</p> 
  <p>“As chancellor, I have to face the world as it is, not the world that I want it to be. And when challenges come our way, the only question is the how to respond to them, not whether to respond, or not,” she told reporters.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Saxo: Sterling on back foot after Reeves hints at tax rises</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The market reaction to Reeves’s speech thus far is to sell sterling, reports Neil Wilson, UK investor strategist at Saxo Markets.</strong></p> 
  <p>He tells clients:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>GBPUSD dipped to retake the 1.30 handle, hitting its weakest since April. It’s the pressure valve and Reeves wouldn’t like to see that kind of reaction coming directly from her speech.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Wilson</strong> reckons that this morning’s speech suggests ‘panic’ in the Treasury, writing:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Panic stations at Number 11 by the looks of it - offering a speech 3 weeks before the Budget that was only announced last night. The market is doubting credibility…</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He adds that the message from the speech is that tax hikes are coming, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This could well be a manifesto-breaking hike to income tax - she refused to say she would stick to the manifesto pledge to not raise income tax, NI or VAT. Lots of messaging around values and doing what’s right, not what’s popular. </p> 
   <p>Reeves is caught between various stools – the country (manifesto pledges), the party (spend more, protect the NHS), and the markets (gilts selling off just narrows the headroom). So, it’s a very tricky line to walk but ultimately, it’s the lack of political leadership from the top that is the making of this situation. </p> 
   <p>However, a bold tax hike should lower gilt yields and could allow the BoE to go further with cuts. This will be a contractionary fiscal blow to the economy. But the bet is that you get the market onside, generate confidence from certainty, which gives you more flexibility later. The risk is that you deal a big blow to confidence in the real economy and hit growth, which makes it all for nought. Either way, fiscal tighter, monetary looser suggests sterling remains on back foot.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Lydia Prieg</strong>, chief economist at the <strong>New</strong> <strong>Economics</strong> <strong>Foundation</strong>, has responded to this morning’s speech from Rachel Reeves:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“Rachel Reeves is right to say the economy isn’t working - but the challenges we face can’t just be solved by cutting regulation and making small tweaks to the tax system. We have a country that’s been ravaged by austerity, as well as an ageing population meaning spending on health and pensions is only set to increase. The scale of spending the country requires to get our public services and living standards up to scratch is significant. </p> 
   <p>Two things needs need to happen. Taxes will need to go up - and the chancellor should focus on those who are most able to contribute. To start with this government needs to equalise capital gains tax with income tax and get to grips with taxing land.</p> 
   <p>Secondly, this government will need to invest more - to do this they need to reassess the fiscal rules and the OBR’s position in assessing them. This is how we will achieve long term stability.”</p>

  <p><strong>During her speech, Rachel Reeves pointed to the record highs seen on the London stock market last week as a sign of the UK’s positive economic performance.</strong></p> 
  <p>Unfortunately, the UK stock market has extended its earlier losses, with the <strong>FTSE</strong> <strong>100</strong> now down 97 points, or 1%, at 9604 points.</p> 
  <p>Although that’s part of a wider global selloff today, there may also be concern about the impact of higher taxes on consumer spending.</p> 
  <p><strong>Daniela</strong> <strong>Hathorn</strong>, senior market analyst at <strong>capital.com</strong>, explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Overall, her [Reeves’s] comments framed a pragmatic approach to rebuilding fiscal resilience while managing public expectations ahead of the next Budget.</p> 
   <p>The market reaction has been limited, with gilt yields dropping marginally as investors welcome the emphasis on prudence. However, the FTSE 100 has extended the losses into the European morning as Reeves’ comments highlight a difficult fiscal situation in the UK, which could have a negative effect consumers and business in tax increases are announced on November 26th.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Quilter: Reeves prepared the ground for higher personal taxes</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Rachel Reeves’s pre-Budget speech this morning was all about preparing the ground for some painful measures later this month, says Rachael Griffin, tax and financial planning expert at Quilter:</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>She knows this Budget will define her credibility, and her message today was clear that Britain’s finances are in a worse state than many realise, and everyone will be expected to play their part in putting them back on track.</p> 
   <p>Reeves was at pains to distance herself from the politics of austerity, arguing that deep cuts and short-term fixes are what weakened the country’s economic foundations in the first place. But while her argument against renewed austerity will appeal to many scarred by the last decade, it also lays the groundwork for a different kind of pain, which is higher personal taxes to rebuild public finances. She’s made it clear she is happy to be unpopular if it helps secure public finances.</p> 
   <p>Her insistence that ‘easy answers’ are off the table is a warning that there will be few giveaways in this Budget. The Chancellor is trying to convince both markets and the public that fiscal discipline can coexist with fairness, but for households already facing high borrowing costs and squeezed budgets, the idea of contributing more will still be a tough sell.</p> 
   <p>This was a speech designed to project authority and honesty, not to win popularity. The real challenge for Reeves will come when she has to translate that rhetoric into decisions that feel credible to investors but also tolerable for working families.</p>

  <p>It’s also weaker against the euro, down 0.3% this morning.</p>

  <p>If Rachel Reeves succeeds in sticking to her fiscal rules, and raises taxes, that could encourage policymakers at the BoE to lower borrowing costs to protect the economy.</p> 
  <p><strong>George Vessey, </strong>lead foreign exchange &amp; macro strategist at <strong>Convera,</strong> explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“The pound has weakened notably over the past month, driven by a combination of softer UK data, heightened fiscal uncertainty, and a dovish recalibration of interest rate expectations.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">UK Politics Live: Reeves to roll pitch for budget tax rises</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>There’s obviously huge interest in Westminster, as well as in the financial markets, in Rachel Reeves’s speech – due to start at 8.10am GMT.</strong></p> 
  <p>My colleague <strong>Andrew</strong> <strong>Sparrow</strong> will be tracking events here.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>He writes:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>David Cameron is credited with popularising the term “pitch rolling” in Westminster, to describe the process whereby politicians prepare the public for difficult announcements by shaping the argument in advance. It is a metaphor with connotations of a gentle game of cricket, and pleasant summer afternoons.</p> 
   <p>Today <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> is engaged in a classic piece of “pitch rolling”. But her task is more daunting. She won’t be flattening the odd bump; she has to shift some colossal PR obstacles, which is more a task for a fleet of JCB diggers.</p> 
   <p>That is because, when she delivers the budget three weeks tomorrow, she will have to fill fiscal gap reportedly as high as £30bn. That means tax rises, which are never an easy sell. But it also means going back on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/nov/25/uk-politics-live-assisted-dying-bill-labour-conservatives-starmer-reeves-badenoch?page=with%3Ablock-6744a71c8f086501868e96dd#block-6744a71c8f086501868e96dd">the promise she made to the CBI last year</a> when she said she would not need to raise taxes again on the scale she did in autumn 2024. And there seems to be a very real chance that she will also decide to raise income tax, which would be a direct breach of a promise Labour made in its election manifesto.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Goldman Sachs also expect tax rises</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Analysts at Goldman Sachs have predicted that Rachel Reeves’s budget could push down government borrowing costs, if she reassures the bond markets that she’s committed to tackling the deficit.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a research note released to clients last Friday, <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> predict that the chancellor’s budget measures – and pre-budget hints about what’s to come – could knock up to 0.2 percentage points off the cost of borrowing (the ‘yield’ on a 10-year bond) for a decade.</p> 
  <p>They explain:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Given the modest downside impact on growth and inflation, plus the potential for increased credibility in the deficit path, we expect the budget measures to lower 10y Gilt yields by around 10-20bp, although given budget expectations are already forming we see this as a tailwind for Gilts into the budget more than the on-the-day reaction.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> also point out that UK bond yields remain the highest in the G10.</p> 
  <p>They also expect tax rises in the budget, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The upcoming budget is set to tighten fiscal policy by around £30bn, which our economists expect will mainly comprise tax increases, including freezing income tax thresholds from 2028, broadening the NI [national insurance] tax base, pensions and property taxes.</p> 
   <p>We expect limited spending cuts, but that the budget delivers a modest increase in headroom at the end of the forecast horizon.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Tax rises at Budget ‘inevitable’, thinktank warns</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>This month’s UK budget will include significant spending cuts and tax rises to tackle “a significant deterioration in the public finances”, thinktank the Resolution Foundation has predicted.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a new report issued this morning, the <strong>Resolution</strong> <strong>Foundation</strong> predicts that Rachel Reeves’s fiscal headroom (the £10bn margin to keep within her fiscal rules) will have been more than wiped out by changes in the economic outlook, and government u-turns since March.</p> 
  <p>That will create “a bleak picture for the public finances”, they say, as the independent <strong>Office for Budget Responsibility</strong> is expected to downgrade the UK’s ‘trend’ productivity growth by 0.3 percentage points, creating a £20bn shortfall.</p> 
  <p>That downgrade will be partially cushioned by other changes, including stronger than forecast wage growth.</p> 
  <p>The think tank says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The upcoming Budget is a make-or-break moment for the Government. It seems clear that this month’s fiscal event will include significant spending cuts and tax rises spurred by a significant deterioration in the public finances.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The <strong>Resolution</strong> <strong>Foundation</strong> urge Reeves to take steps to increase her headroom, to as much as £20bn, to send a clear message to markets that she is serious about fixing the public finances.</p> 
  <p>They have calculated that doubling the fiscal headroom to £20bn and allowing for cost of living support would require £31bn of fiscal consolidation. And with limited scope for spending cuts, tax rises of £26bn are therefore likely to be needed.</p> 
  <p>Avoiding touching the three big taxes – VAT, Income Tax and National Insurance (NI) – “risks doing more harm than good”, they argue (even though Labour promised in their manifesto not to raise them).</p> 
  <p><strong>Resolution</strong> also argue that the chancellor could offset a 2p rise in Income Tax with a 2p cut in employee National Insurance, raising £6bn while protecting workers from these tax rises.</p> 
  <p>Their report concludes:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>So, although tax rises are inevitable, there is a way to do them which comes with a boost confidence in the economy and the public finances, while also reducing child poverty and the cost of living.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>James Smith, </strong>research director at the <strong>Resolution Foundation,</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“The Chancellor should look to make sensible tax reforms to car taxes, dividends and capital gains. Switching 2p of employee National Insurance onto Income Tax would raise £6 billion while protecting workers’ wages</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Introduction: Reeves to lay groundwork for budget tax rises</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.</strong></p> 
  <p>With just over three weeks until the UK budget, speculation is mounting that <strong>Rachel</strong> <strong>Reeves</strong> will rip up the government’s manifesto promises and raise income taxes.</p> 
  <p>The chancellor will deliver a speech this morning which is widely expected to pave the way for a tax-raising budget on 26 November.</p> 
  <p>Downing Street says <strong>Reeves</strong> will lay out the economic choices she will take at the Budget later this month to cut hospital waiting lists, cut the national debt and cut the cost of living.</p> 
  <p>The Chancellor is expected to say she will take the necessary choices to deliver “strong foundations”, and explain:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“It will be a budget led by this government’s values, of fairness and opportunity and focused squarely on the priorities of the British people:</p> 
   <p>“Protecting our NHS, reducing our national debt and improving the cost of living.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Reeves</strong> faces a choice between tax rises, spending cuts, or breaking her fiscal rules through higher borrowing because of a black hole in the budget – partly caused by a productivity downgrade would leave her with a £20bn gap to fill.</p> 
  <p>Last night, Keir Starmer told MPs the government would take “tough but fair decisions”, promising a “Labour budget built on Labour values” that would protect the NHS, reduce debt and ease the cost of living.</p>

  <p><strong>Mujtaba</strong> <strong>Rahman</strong>, managing director for Europe at consultancy <strong>Eurasia</strong> <strong>Group</strong>, says Reeves faces “an agonising choice” on whether to prioritise politics or economics.</p> 
  <p>He told clients:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The economics increasingly points to what Whitehall insiders are calling a “go big” strategy: another large tax hike, including on income tax, to close a gap of about £30bn to meet Reeves’s goal of balancing government spending and revenue by 2029-2030; however, abandoning the Labour manifesto promise not to raise income tax would leave the party wide open to Tory and Reform attacks.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Yesterday, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage rowed back on his party’s previous promise to deliver tax cuts, arguing it wasn’t realistic in the current economic climate.</p>
