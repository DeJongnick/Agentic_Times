<h1>Golf for them, grind for us: Trump, Vance and the hellish US holiday divide</h1>

<p>You know what the problem is with the US? <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/10/entertainment/kim-kardashian-work-backlash">Nobody wants to work any more</a>. People feel entitled to cushy jobs with fat salaries and unlimited holiday time. And by “people” I mean American politicians, who seem to treat public office as an excuse for <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/18/ted-cruz-cancun-power-outage/">endless vacations</a>. Because the president and vice-president are technically always on duty, there’s no official holiday policy – and it rather feels as if they are taking advantage of this.</p> <p>Take the vice-president, JD “OOO (out of office)” Vance. When he’s not <a href="https://gizmodo.com/notes-on-a-meme-the-grotesque-pleasure-of-bloated-jd-vance-pictures-2000572683">inspiring memes</a> or threatening to deport <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/jd-vance-deport-derek-guy-menswear">menswear influencers</a>, he always seems to be off on a jolly. So far this year, the man has been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c2ljkny0j00o">skiing in Vermont</a>, shut down bits of <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-disneyland-protest-b2787969.html">Disneyland for his family’s use</a> and apparently raised the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/06/jd-vance-ohio-lake-water-levels">water level of a river in Ohio for a kayaking trip</a>. Now, the Vances are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/26/cotswolds-jd-vance-summer-holiday">summering in the Cotswolds</a>.</p> <p>Vance, who unsuccessfully tried out for his <a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/hillbilly-elegy-how-the-author-a-hillbilly-at-heart-found-golf">high school golf team</a>, can also occasionally be found <a href="https://stjosephpost.com/posts/1046842f-f997-4c6d-b5b4-ccdfde067a42">hitting balls</a> with his boss. Which is actually pretty hard work, since we all know Trump is a gifted sportsman; in April, the White House doctor cited the president’s <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/13/trump-frequent-victories-golf-white-house-doctor/83070773007/">“frequent victories in golf events”</a> as evidence of Trump’s excellent health. And Trump <em>should</em> be good, considering he’s so far spent 25% of his second term golfing, according to the online tracker <a href="https://didtrumpgolftoday.com/">Did Trump Golf Today?</a>. Lovely for him; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/17/trump-golf-taxes">expensive for the taxpayer</a>.</p> <p>Trump was once <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-obama-golf-235217">very critical</a> of Barack Obama’s numerous golf outings. “I’m going to be working for you, I’m not going to have time to go play golf,” <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/trump-obama-golf-235217">Trump said in 2016</a>. He managed to find the time: a 2021 Washington Post analysis found that Trump probably played <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/20/trumps-presidency-ends-where-so-much-it-was-spent-trump-organization-property/">261 rounds of golf</a> in his first term – a round every 5.6 days. This term, he’s on track <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/trumps-term-2-corruption-by-the-numbers-more-golf-trips-more-foreign-visitors-and-more-profits/">to surpass that number</a>.</p> <p>Trump has also <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/return-to-in-person-work/">complained about work-from-home policies</a>, saying that people will take advantage and <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/11/trump-work-from-home-federal-employees-not-working-golf/">“play golf”</a> instead. It’s different when <em>he</em> plays golf, though. A workhorse like Trump can be productive anywhere! <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/10/trump-homeless-golf-course-washington-dc">On Sunday</a>, for example, while being driven from the White House to his golf club in Virginia, Trump (or one of his minions) snapped a few photos of homeless people, which he <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115005075016157889">posted on social media</a> with his typically nuanced analysis. “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump stated. “Be&nbsp;prepared! There will be no ‘MR. NICE GUY.’” Not everyone is capable of crafting complex policy proposals on how to reduce homelessness while being chauffeured to a tee time. It’s a skill set such as this that separates the wheat from the chaff.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/05/how-did-john-oliver-become-the-moral-compass-of-the-us">How did John Oliver become the moral compass of the US? |  Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Speaking of the chaff: guess how much paid time off (PTO) normies in the US are entitled to? The answer, if you’re looking at federal law, <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/vacation_leave">is none</a>; it’s up to your employer. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average amount of vacation private sector workers get <a href="https://www.bls.gov/charts/employee-benefits/paid-leave-sick-vacation-days-by-service-requirement.htm">after one year</a> at a company is 11 days. For government workers, it’s 13 days. (PTO often increases over time, but median job tenure in the US is <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/tenure.nr0.htm">less than five years</a>.) What happens if you get sick and need more time off? You’d better hope that your colleagues are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45214174">nice&nbsp;enough</a> to&nbsp;<a href="https://abc7.com/post/nurses-front-line-workers-personal-time-off-coworkers-give-pto/8778094/">donate their sick days</a> to you. By contrast, in the UK, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/holiday-entitlement-rights">most full-time workers</a> are entitled to 28 days of paid annual leave from the get-go.</p> <p>While US vacation policy may seem miserly to outsiders, Trump thinks it’s far too generous. On Juneteenth, a holiday commemorating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/jun/19/juneteenth-other-emancipation-celebrations">the emancipation of enslaved people</a> in the US, the president complained that, despite the fact that private-sector companies don’t have to give employees the day off for federal holidays, there were too many holidays in the US and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/20/economy/trump-too-many-holidays-economy">“workers don’t want it”</a>. </p> <p>Like many things the president says, this is nonsense. On the contrary: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/breaking-down-infinite-workday">Microsoft’s 2025 work index report</a> found that, because of the always-on nature of technology, many workers are struggling with “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/22/young-professionals-infinite-workdays">infinite workdays</a>” and burnout. How is Microsoft combating that? Glad you asked! They recently teamed up with Mercedes-Benz to bring <a href="https://group.mercedes-benz.com/innovations/digitalisation/connectivity/microsoft-collaboration.html">“in-car productivity to a new level”</a> by making it easier to <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/766631/mercedes-microsoft-teams-integration-technology/">take meetings while driving</a>. Behold the American dream: nonstop work for the masses and endless golfing vacays for the guys at the top. </p> <p>• Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
