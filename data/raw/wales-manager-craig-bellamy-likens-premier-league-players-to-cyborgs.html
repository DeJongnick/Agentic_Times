<p>Craig Bellamy compared Premier League players to “cyborgs” as he discussed the growing physicality in the game after Thomas Tuchel said long throws and direct tactics were in vogue.</p> <p>The Wales manager said he handpicked friendlies against Canada on Tuesday and England next month – two higher-ranked nations – to provide a barometer of his team’s progress and believes facing the latter at Wembley will be the perfect warm-up for hosting Belgium in a crunch World Cup qualifier four days later.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/03/wales-fan-kazakhstan-trains-buses-world-cup-qualifier">17 trains, 11 buses and a stag do: one Wales fan’s five-week venture for Kazakhstan qualifier</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tuchel said long throws were “back” and that England must <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/07/thomas-tuchel-tactics-england-2026-world-cup-qualifiers-serbia-andorra">consider adding long balls</a> to their attacking weaponry. Bellamy, who was assistant manager to Vincent Kompany in the top flight at Burnley, was asked whether he had detected a recent shift in styles.</p> <p>Bellamy said: “I think the physicality is clear and it has been for a few years … It has become a running game. It has become beyond extreme with the physical capabilities. We found it with Burnley – we built a Championship team that could come out of small spaces. Then go to the Premier League: cyborgs, that’s what you’re up against. It was unreal. They just run you but also have ridiculous ability … that’s why you pay £80m for that type of profile. Then you look around the team and see £40m, £50m, £60m [players].”</p> <p>Wales host Canada, coached by the former Leeds manager Jesse Marsch, in Swansea. Bellamy said of selecting challenging opposition: “I was like: ‘Give me the toughest.’ Look, I’m fully aware I could get beaten and – can I say this? – get my ass kicked but what would I gain from playing a lesser team, where we know where we are? This is a tough game. We’ll see where we are. It gives us a good opportunity to be able to get better.”</p> <p>Bellamy hopes the Canada match, the first men’s home game to be held in Swansea since November 2020 and outside Cardiff since July 2023, will be a sell-out. “I believe national teams, countries like us, should be playing in front of full stadiums,” he said. “I might be pushing it, but I expect that.”</p> <p>Bellamy was informed that as of Monday afternoon the Football Association of Wales had sold about 15,000 tickets. “So, we push again,” he said with a smile. “It’s not a meaningless friendly, [it is an] important game.”</p>
