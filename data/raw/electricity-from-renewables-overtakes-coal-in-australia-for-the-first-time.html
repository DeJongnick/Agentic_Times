<p>According to <a href="https://reneweconomy.com.au/renewables-overtake-coal-for-first-time-on-monthly-basis-in-australias-main-grid/">Renew Economy</a>, the monthly record for renewables was in part due to strong electricity production from windfarms in Tasmania, and strong electricity production from solar farms around Australia.</p> 
<p>Electricity generation from renewables <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/07/global-renewable-energy-generation-surpasses-coal-first-time">also surpassed coal globally in the first half of 2025</a>.</p>
