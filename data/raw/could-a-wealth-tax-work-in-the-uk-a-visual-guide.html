<p>A rise in taxation at the autumn budget looks inevitable, as Rachel Reeves grapples with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/06/tax-rises-budget-deficit-rachel-reeves-niesr">£40bn hole</a> in the public finances.</p> 
<p>That figure comes from a recent report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), which blames the deficit on higher-than-expected borrowing levels and a weaker growth outlook for the UK economy.</p> 
<p>The question now facing the chancellor is: who should pay more?</p> 
<p>A growing chorus of voices across the Labour party say a wealth tax is the answer.</p>

<h2>So how would a wealth tax work?</h2> 
<p>Politicians from across the divide have the habit of talking about wealth taxes in vague terms, often perpetuating misconceptions.</p> 
<p>Here’s a visual breakdown of the key elements of a wealth tax system. The analysis uses figures from the most in-depth study of a potential UK wealth tax so far, produced in 2020 by the Wealth Tax Commission, a panel of leading economists assembled by tax experts Arun Advani, Emma Chamberlain and Andy Summers.</p>

<p>Summers, director of CenTax and co-author of the 2020 study, said: “Given the limited information HMRC currently hold on wealth, a wealth tax would be difficult to deliver any time soon. A better way to raise money from wealth would be to reform Capital Gains Tax (CGT). This is not just about raising rates. The Government should introduce an investment allowance and close gaps that currently allow some business gains to go completely untaxed. Doing this would be good for investment and growth, and raise over £13bn annually by the end of the Parliament.”</p> 
<p>The Institute of Fiscal Studies has similarly argued that an annual wealth tax would be a “poor substitute for properly taxing the sources and uses of wealth”. Treasury officials are understood to favour the latter.<br><br>Critics say a wealth tax would be too difficult and costly to implement, and that wealthy individuals would be able to move their holdings or to simply leave the country. They point to countries such as Austria, Denmark and Germany’s decision to scrap similar taxes in the past.</p> 
<p>However, other countries including Spain and Switzerland have been successfully using wealth taxes to raise significant sums for generations. In their letter to the government the economists in favour of a wealth tax argue that the UK can overcome these difficulties – by leveraging digital technology and studying previous attempts to tax wealth – and pioneer a progressive tax system “fit for the 21st century”.</p>
