<p>The UK economy grew at a faster rate than expected in the second quarter, official figures show, despite a slowdown from a strong start to the year amid pressure from tax increases and Donald Trump’s global trade war.</p> <p>Figures from the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/gdpfirstquarterlyestimateukapriltojune2025">Office for National Statistics (ONS)</a> showed growth in gross domestic product slowed to 0.3% in the three months to the end of June, down from a rate of 0.7% in the first quarter.</p> <p>Although it beat forecasts for a slowdown to 0.1% made by City economists and the Bank of England, the latest snapshot underscores the challenge for the chancellor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rachel-reeves">Rachel Reeves</a>, as she considers options for boosting the economy and raising revenues at her autumn budget.</p> <p>Liz McKeown, an ONS director of economic statistics, said: “Growth slowed in the second quarter after a strong start to the year. The economy was weak across April and May, with some activity having been brought forward to February and March ahead of stamp duty and tariff changes, but then recovered strongly in June.”</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/yez7e/1/" data-alt="Quarterly GDP graphic"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/yez7e/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The latest snapshot showed the economy grew 0.4% in June, a faster rate than expected after two consecutive months of shrinking output. The ONS also revised its initial estimate for April’s GDP contraction from -0.3% to -0.1%.</p> <p>Reeves said the quarterly figures were positive as they showed Britain had recorded a strong start to the year and continued growth in the second quarter, “but there is more to do to deliver an economy that works for working people”.</p> <p>She said: “I know that the British economy has the key ingredients for success but has felt stuck for too long.” </p> <p>According to the latest figures, growth in the second quarter was led by the country’s dominant services sector expanding by 0.4%, with computer programming, health and vehicle leasing driving activity.</p> <p>Construction output rose by 1.2%, supported by large infrastructure projects. Manufacturing grew by 0.3%, after growth of 1.1% in the first quarter when companies had rushed to beat the introduction of Trump’s tariffs.</p> <p>Despite the second-quarter slowdown, the latest figures show the UK currently remains the fastest-growing G7 economy over the first half of the year, pending data from Japan.</p> <p>However, the economy faces headwinds from Trump’s trade war and a sluggish domestic outlook. “We expect growth to slow in the second half,” said James Smith, an economist at ING. </p> <p>The chancellor is preparing for a difficult autumn budget amid mounting speculation over tax rises, as a weaker growth outlook, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/03/rachel-reeves-balancing-backbenchers-and-bond-markets-analysis">higher debt interest payments</a> and a series of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/02/where-does-the-welfare-bill-climbdown-leave-the-uk-public-finances">U-turns on welfare cuts</a> contribute to a yawning deficit in the government finances that is estimated to be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/06/tax-rises-budget-deficit-rachel-reeves-niesr">more than £40bn</a>.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/yaVRU/1/" data-alt="GDP graphic"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/yaVRU/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Reeves has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/13/rachel-reeves-uk-productivity-economy-growth-autumn-budget">pledged to use the set-piece fiscal event</a> to prioritise fixing Britain’s dismal productivity record, using an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/aug/13/rachel-reeves-uk-productivity-economy-growth-autumn-budget">exclusive article</a> in the Guardian to downplay speculation over tax rises.</p> <p>Business leaders said the economy had been dented by the chancellor’s £25bn increase in employer national insurance contributions and said more tax rises would cause further drag.</p> <p>“Without thriving firms the economy will continue to struggle,” said Stuart Morrison, the research manager at the British Chambers of Commerce.</p> <p>“Tax burdens at home, alongside uncertain global trading conditions, created a very challenging environment for the UK’s small- and medium-sized enterprises in the second quarter.”</p> <p>The latest figures showed business investment fell by 4% in the second quarter, although it was 0.1% higher than a year earlier.</p> <p>Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: “Any economic growth is welcome, but with business leaders saying that all indicators are flashing red, and key economists warning that Rachel Reeves has created a £50bn black hole in the public finances, Rachel Reeves’s economic vandalism is clear.”</p> <p>The stronger-than-expected second quarter could complicate the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/bankofenglandgovernor">Bank of England’s</a> path to cutting interest rates further. The pound rose slightly against the US dollar.</p> <p>Threadneedle Street had forecast a slowdown to 0.1% in the second quarter. Last week it warned that continued growth and rising inflationary pressures driven by the soaring price of food could force it to delay further cuts to borrowing costs.</p> <p>Nicholas Hyett, the investment manager at the broker Wealth Club, said the figures raised “some interesting questions” for the Bank after it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/07/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-quarter-point-4#:~:text=In%20one%20of%20its%20closest,widely%20expected%20in%20financial%20markets.">cut its key base rate from 4.25% to 4% last week</a>.</p> <p>“Better leave the economy sputtering into life than risk turbocharging price rises with further interest rate cuts,” he said.</p>
