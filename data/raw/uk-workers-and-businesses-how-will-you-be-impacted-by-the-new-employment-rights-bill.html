Will you get statutory sick pay, paternity or parental leave, and holiday pay? Are there other ways in which your employment could be affected?</p> <p>If you have concerns for your business because of these proposals, tell us about it.</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="0963888e-aef6-4cd7-ba2a-8164d83ac2d8" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>
