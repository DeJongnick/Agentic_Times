<p><strong>I’m one of millions whose smart meters have gone “dumb” and stopped relaying readings to the supplier.</strong></p> <p><strong>British Gas cancelled the first appointment to fix it and failed to show for the second. They’ve since fallen silent. It’s now been five months and I am concerned that, at some point, I will be getting an estimated bill </strong><strong>that I will be unable to challenge.</strong></p> <p><strong>WTW, </strong><em><strong>Sunderland</strong></em></p> <p>It is thought that 4m smart meters are malfunctioning, although the consumer campaigner Martin Lewis reckons<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/09/a-mess-energy-suppliers-face-scramble-to-install-smart-meters-in-uk-homes"> twice as many households are affected </a>and at risk of inaccurate bills. </p> <p>British Gas managed to rustle up an appointment within two weeks of my intervention. To show its contrition, it will not bill you for the six months when the meter was not functioning. </p> <p>Since then the regulator for Great Britain, Ofgem, has announced <a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/press-release/ofgem-sets-out-new-rules-boost-smart-meter-standards-and-compensation">new rules governing the installation and repair</a> of smart meters. Resolutions should be agreed within five working days of a problem being reported and compensation is due if repairs are not completed within 90 days.</p> <p><em>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
