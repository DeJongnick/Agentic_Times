<p>Frankie (Harris Dickinson) is adrift. “I don’t know what I like,” he mumbles. But perhaps it’s more the fact that he doesn’t want to – or can’t – admit to himself that, while he toys with the idea of a girlfriend and tools around with his delinquent buddies, he is drawn, time and again, to gay hook-up websites in search of older men.</p> <p>The Brooklyn summer of Eliza Hittman’s superb second feature is an endless fairground ride of cheap highs and long, dragging, wasted moments. Escape comes in pill form, filched by Frankie from the stock of prescription medication intended to take the sharp edges off his dying father’s pain. Frankie and his boys bask like lizards, shirtless and heavy-lidded as they eye the girls on the beach. Hittman shares something of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/04/claire-denis-white-material-interview">Claire Denis</a>’s gift for finding vulnerability in a chiselled male body and a kind of bruised poetry in the tough-guy swagger of these teenage kids.</p> <p>But it’s to Dickinson that the watchful camera always returns. British by birth, but utterly persuasive in the skin of this Brooklyn-born lost boy, he is undoubtedly one of the discoveries of the year. There’s a wounded beauty to his performance; he captures the kind of tortured inarticulacy that speaks volumes. Frankie’s fumbled attempt to reconcile his two worlds unfolds with a casual savagery at <em>Beach Rats</em>’ climax. Understated throughout, the film boldly concludes while Frankie is still processing the fact that his life just changed for ever.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U2npU0tVs0"                                                                        > <iframe width="460" height="259" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7U2npU0tVs0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U2npU0tVs0">Watch a trailer for Beach Rats.</a></figcaption> </figure>
