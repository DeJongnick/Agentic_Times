<p>Doctors, scientists and researchers have shared new findings on ways to tackle heart conditions at the 2025 European Society of Cardiology annual meeting, the world’s largest heart conference.</p> <p><a href="https://www.escardio.org/Congresses-Events/ESC-Congress">The event in Madrid</a> was attended by 33,000 health professionals from 169 countries. More than 1,100 sessions featured “gamechanger” research, new guidelines and groundbreaking trials.</p> <p>“This year’s ESC congress marks a turning point: cardiology has never been more dynamic, interdisciplinary, and patient-centred,” said Prof Felix Mahfoud, chair of the ESC communications committee.</p> <p>“Never before have we seen such a high number of late-breaking trials from across all fields of cardiology presented and simultaneously published in top journals, informing clinical decision-making and improving patient care.”</p> <p>Here is a roundup of the key takeaways.</p>  <h2>Medicine</h2>  <p>Doctors in Madrid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/drug-baxdrostat-gamechanger-high-blood-pressure-hypertension">hailed a new pill</a> for patients with high blood pressure resistant to existing medication as a “gamechanger” and a “triumph of science”.</p> <p>Globally, 1.3 billion people have hypertension and in half of cases, their high blood pressure is uncontrolled or resistant to existing treatments. They face a much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disease and early death.</p> <p>A new drug – baxdrostat – can significantly lower blood pressure in these people whose levels remain dangerously high despite taking several medicines.</p> <p>The results of the BaxHTN study showed that after 12 weeks, patients taking baxdrostat saw their blood pressure fall by about 9-10 mmHg (millimetres of mercury, the unit of measurement of blood pressure) more than the placebo – a reduction large enough to cut cardiovascular risk.</p> <p>There were also exciting discoveries about existing drugs that could help heart patients, delegates were told.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/doctors-find-drug-that-is-better-than-aspirin-at-preventing-heart-attacks-clopidogrel">In one trial</a>, researchers found a drug that is better than aspirin at preventing heart attacks and strokes. A new analysis of seven clinical trials showed patients taking clopidogrel had a 14% lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events compared with those taking aspirin.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/weight-loss-drugs-can-halve-heart-patients-risk-of-early-death-study-finds">A second study showed</a> weight loss drugs may halve the risk of heart patients being hospitalised or dying early.</p> <h2>Diet and exercise</h2>  <p>Eating foods rich in potassium, such as avocados, bananas and spinach, could reduce your risk of heart conditions, hospitalisation and death by 24%, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/29/potassium-rich-diet-may-cut-risk-of-heart-failure-by-24-per-cent-study">Danish researchers told the conference</a>.</p> <p>Previous research had shown that cutting out salt from meals can slash your risk of heart problems. A new study showed just how much potassium, which increases the amount of salt your body removes from the bloodstream, could help to ward off cardiovascular problems.</p> <p>Not a fan of spinach? Pulses, fish, nuts and seeds are also good sources of potassium, experts said.</p> <p>Exercise is also key to a healthy heart. It can lower your resting blood pressure and heart rate, improve your cholesterol levels, and help you maintain a healthy weight, which in turn reduces your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p> <p>In Madrid, doctors heard about another potential benefit of getting active: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/30/exercise-therapy-mend-broken-heart-syndrome-takotsubo-study">mending a broken heart</a>.</p> <h2>Artificial intelligence</h2>  <p>Doctors have developed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/30/doctors-ai-stethoscope-heart-disease-london">an artificial intelligence-led stethoscope</a> that can detect three heart conditions in 15 seconds.</p> <p>Two centuries after the invention of the humble stethoscope, a team at Imperial College London and Imperial College healthcare NHS trust have designed a hi-tech upgrade. It analyses tiny differences in heartbeat and blood flow undetectable to the human ear, and takes a rapid ECG at the same time.</p> <p>The tool’s AI capabilities mean it can spot heart failure, heart valve disease and abnormal heart rhythms almost instantly.</p> <p>Early diagnosis of these three heart conditions is critical. The AI stethoscope enables patients who need life-saving treatment to be spotted sooner, before they become dangerously unwell.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a revolutionary AI scanning system is increasing the number of stroke patients avoiding serious disability, tripling the rate of recovery, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/stroke-centres-in-england-given-ai-tool-that-will-help-50-of-patients-recover">delegates were told</a>.</p> <p>And a new generative AI tool – ESC Chat – is <a href="https://www.escardio.org/Congresses-Events/ESC-Congress/Congress-news/ai-innovations-in-cardiology-navigating-the-path-to-wider-integration">transforming the work</a> of cardiologists worldwide. The chatbot responds immediately to questions about clinical guidelines, saving time and providing doctors with access to recommendations, diagnostic criteria and treatment solutions.</p> <h2>Children</h2>  <p>Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), which is typically genetic, is responsible for more than 10% of sudden cardiac deaths in children.</p> <p>Now a simple cheek-swab test can identify children with the condition, five years before they would normally be diagnosed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/cheek-swab-test-children-heart-condition-arrhythmogenic-cardiomyopathy-acm-study">according to research presented in Madrid</a>.</p> <p>Experts at Great Ormond Street hospital and City St George’s, University of London are now developing the two-minute test into swab kits that can be used at home and sent away for analysis.</p> <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/01/vaping-may-be-causing-irreversible-harm-children-health-doctors">doctors raised the alarm</a> about high levels of vaping among children, saying they were convinced e-cigarettes were causing irreversible harm to their health.</p> <p>Cardiologists, researchers and health experts said they were “extremely concerned” about the harmful effects of e-cigarettes on millions of teenagers and young people, including exposure to toxins and carcinogens – some of which are still unknown.</p> <h2>Vaccines</h2>  <p>Vaccination has increasingly been seen as an effective measure not only against specific infections, but also for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or events.</p> <p>Delegates at the conference were briefed about the world’s first global systematic review and meta analysis of the shingles vaccine. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/28/shingles-vaccine-heart-cardiovascular-medical-research">The results showed</a> the jab could lower risk of a heart attack or stroke by as much as 18%.</p>
