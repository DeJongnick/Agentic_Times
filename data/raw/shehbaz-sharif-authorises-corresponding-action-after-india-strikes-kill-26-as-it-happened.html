   <li><p><strong>At least 26 people, including several children, have been killed and 46 injured after India launched attacks on what it claimed were nine sites of “terrorist infrastructure” inside Pakistan</strong>, in a sharp escalation of hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Pakistan called the strikes an “act of war”</strong> and claimed it had shot down several Indian air force jets. The office of the prime minister of Pakistan, <strong>Shehbaz Sharif</strong>, said the country’s armed forces had been authorised to undertake “corresponding actions”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Pakistan has authorised its military to take “corresponding” retaliatory action against India after an overnight missile attack. </strong>In a strongly worded statement, Pakistan accused India of “igniting an inferno” in the region after it carried out targeted strikes on nine sites in Pakistan-administered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/kashmir">Kashmir</a> and the Pakistani province of Punjab in the early hours of Wednesday</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Pakistan</strong> said another five people were killed in artillery fire near the <strong>Line of Control</strong>, the de facto border between the two countries.

   <li><p><strong>Since India carried out its strikes early on Wednesday morning, heavy artillery fire has been reported by locals living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides the disputed region of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/kashmir">Kashmir</a>. </strong>Indian officials said that at least 12 civilians had been killed in the shelling since Wednesday morning and 42 injured.

  <p><strong>Pakistan has authorised its military to take “corresponding” retaliatory action against India after an overnight missile attack by the Indian air force killed 26 across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan">Pakistan</a>, raising fears of an escalating conflict between the two nuclear-armed countries.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a strongly worded statement, Pakistan accused India of “igniting an inferno” in the region after it carried out targeted strikes on nine sites in Pakistan-administered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/kashmir">Kashmir</a> and the Pakistani province of Punjab in the early hours of Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>India said the strikes were a direct retaliation for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/tourists-killed-by-suspected-militants-in-kashmir-attack">militants targeted and killed</a> 25 Hindu tourists and their guide.</p> 
  <p>India had accused Pakistan of direct involvement in the attacks, through Islamist militant organisations it has long been accused of backing. After its airstrikes on Wednesday, which killed 26 people including several children, and left 45 injured, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/india">India</a> jubilantly claimed victory over Pakistan.</p>

  <p><strong>The uneasy calm that had settled over India and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan">Pakistan</a> in the past two weeks was swiftly shattered in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</strong></p> 
  <p>In the days that followed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/tourists-killed-by-suspected-militants-in-kashmir-attack">deadly attack</a> that killed 25 Indian tourists and a guide in Kashmir in late March, the Indian government made it clear it held Pakistan responsible – and it intended to avenge the deaths.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, the Indian public – horrified by accounts that tourists had been targeted and shot for being Hindu – was baying for blood. Newspaper columns and nightly discussions on TV news channels rang with calls for the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to take decisive action against Pakistan and “teach them a lesson” once and for all.</p> 
  <p>But a fortnight after the attack, with no clear impending action or military mobilisation in sight, some had wondered whether India really intended to retaliate. “What is going on?” asked one senior military analyst on Tuesday. By 1am on Wednesday, that question was answered.</p> 
  <p>In highly coordinated air and drone strikes, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/pakistan-vows-to-retaliate-after-wave-of-indian-missiles-hit-country">Indian missiles hit nine targets</a>, both in the part of the Kashmir region administered by Pakistan and in Pakistan’s Punjab province. It was the first time since the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war that India had fired missiles into Punjab.</p>

  <p><strong>Since India carried out its strikes early on Wednesday morning, heavy artillery fire has been reported by locals living along the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border that divides the disputed region of Kashmir.</strong></p> 
  <p>Indian officials said that at least 12 civilians had been killed in the shelling since Wednesday morning and 42 injured. The victims included a woman and her three children. </p> 
  <p>Thousands of residents living near the LoC were forced to evacuate to safer areas.</p> 
  <p>Poonch, located in the south-west of Indian-administered Kashmir near the Line of Control, suffered the heaviest damage from the shelling.</p> 
  <p>Local residents described living in terror amid what they called a “rain of artillery fire” that damaged homes, a Sikh temple, agricultural fields, and vehicles.</p> 
  <p>“I’m confined to a concrete bunker in my basement with six family members,” Abdullah Khan said by phone. “Mortar shells have been landing around us since last night. While many have managed to flee to safer areas, we haven’t found an opportunity to escape.”</p> 
  <p>The shelling has devastated Poonch town, with multiple locations hit, according to local residents. Although cross-border firing along the LoC has continued for 13 days, witnesses reported intensification following India’s military strike against Pakistan.</p> 
  <p>“Two of my relatives were seriously wounded when a mortar shell hit their home this morning,” said Safeer Abdullah, a Poonch resident who expressed anger over rising India-Pakistan tensions. </p> 
  <p>“We’ve endured this violence for generations; our ancestors suffered, and now we do too. Every hour here feels like it could be our last. The shelling has been so intense that no one within 150 kilometres of the border can sleep or eat properly.”</p> 
  <p>Mohammad Mashooq, another Poonch resident, reported that numerous homes had been destroyed and warned the entire town could burn if shelling persists.</p> 
  <p>“We beg the Indian and Pakistani governments to stop this madness,” Mashooq said by phone, with artillery explosions audible in the background. “Innocent people are being brutally killed. They should let us live in peace – there’s been enough destruction and loss of life.”</p> 
  <p>As he prepared his family for another perilous night in their bunker, Mashooq added: “My children are terrified. I fear these earth-shaking explosions might kill them. I just hope we survive this hell tonight.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The office of the prime minister of Pakistan, Shehbaz Sharif, has said that the country’s armed forces have been authorised to undertake “corresponding actions” after India’s strikes, Reuters reports.</strong></p> 
  <p>India attacked Pakistan and Pakistani Kashmir on Wednesday night, in the worst fighting between the two nuclear-armed nations for decades. Pakistan claimed to have downed five Indian planes during the attack. Indian defence ministry officials have not confirmed the figure.</p> 
  <p>India claimed to have hit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/may/06/pakistan-india-attacks-kashmir-live-updates?page=with%3Ablock-681b1d058f08145062c51ee9#block-681b1d058f08145062c51ee9">nine targets</a> it described as “terrorist infrastructure”. Two Indian military spokespersons told a briefing in New Delhi that Islamist militant groups Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) were the targets.</p> 
  <p>Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri, the top official in its external affairs ministry, told a briefing “Intelligence and monitoring of Pakistan-based terror modules showed that further attacks against India were impending, therefore it was necessary to take pre-emptive and precautionary strikes.”</p> 
  <p>Islamabad said six Pakistani locations were targeted, and that none of them were militant camps. At least 26 civilians were killed and 46 injured, a Pakistan military spokesperson said. JeM said in a statement on Wednesday that 10 relatives of its leader Masood Azhar were killed in an Indian attack.</p> 
  <p>Indian police and medics have said at least seven civilians were killed and 30 others wounded by retaliatory Pakistani firing and shelling overnight.</p> 
  <p>The attacks come weeks after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/22/tourists-killed-by-suspected-militants-in-kashmir-attack">26 tourists, mostly Indian, were killed by militants in Kashmir</a>.</p> 
  <p>Countries including Russia and China have called for calm and de-escalation between the two nations. A UK minister has said his government is ready to help both sides to de-escalate.</p> 
  <p>Control of Kashmir, in the foothills of the Himalayas, has been disputed since India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain in 1947. India and Pakistan have twice gone to war over the territory, most recently in 1999.</p>

  <p>It’s 11.30am in Delhi and 11am in Islamabad. Here’s where things stand:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>India has conducted what it has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/06/pakistan-vows-to-retaliate-after-wave-of-indian-missiles-hit-country">described as “precision strikes”</a> in neighbouring Pakistan and Pakistan-</strong><strong>administered Kashmir</strong>, days after it blamed Islamabad for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/indian-security-forces-hunt-militants-after-tourists-killed-in-kashmir-attack">deadly attack</a> on the Indian side of the contested region that killed 26 people.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Twenty-six people, including a child, were killed in the overnight missile strikes and 46 others have been injured</strong>, according to a Pakistani military spokesperson.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Indian government said in a statement that nine non-military targets had been hit</strong> <strong>in the strikes, in what it called “Operation Sindoor.” </strong>India said it struck nine Pakistani “terrorist infrastructure” sites, some of them linked to the attack by Islamist militants in Indian Kashmir last month. Pakistan has refuted this, saying none of the targets were militant camps.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>New Delhi </strong><strong>said its actions had </strong><strong>been “focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature”</strong>. It had displayed “considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution”, it added. The Indian army, in a video on X, said “justice is served.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Both countries also exchanged intense shelling and heavy gunfire across much of their de facto border in the Himalayan region of Kashmir</strong>, police and witnesses told Reuters. Indian police and medics have said at least seven civilians were killed and 30 others wounded by Pakistani firing and shelling overnight.</p></li>

  <p>Control of Kashmir, in the foothills of the Himalayas, has been disputed since India and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pakistan">Pakistan</a> gained independence from Britain in 1947.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated rapidly after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/24/india-pakistan-summons-kashmir-attack">the massacre of 25 Indian tourists and a Nepalese citizen</a> in the disputed Himalayan Kashmir region on Tuesday, prompting warnings of a return to conflict.</p> 
  <p>A previously unknown Islamic militant group calling itself the Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the attack, which India immediately linked to Pakistan, although it did not publicly produce any evidence. Pakistan has denied any involvement.</p> 
  <p>Among a string of punitive measures announced since Tuesday, India has downgraded diplomatic ties, suspended a crucial water-sharing treaty and revoked all visas issued to Pakistani nationals.</p> 
  <p>In retaliation, Pakistan has closed its airspace for all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines, and suspended all trade with India, including to and from any third country.</p> 
  <h2>Why is Kashmir so sensitive?</h2> 
  <p>The region, in the foothills of the Himalayas, has been disputed since India and Pakistan came into being in 1947. Both claim it in full, but each controls a section of the territory, separated by one of the world’s most heavily militarised borders: the “line of control” based on a ceasefire border established after the 1947-48 war. China controls another part in the east.</p> 
  <p>India and Pakistan have gone to war a further two times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999.</p>

  </figure> 
  <p>The dispute stems from the partition of colonial India in 1947, when small, semi-autonomous “princely states” across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan, and the local ruler chose to become part of India despite the fact the area had a Muslim majority.</p> 
  <p>Armed insurgents in Kashmir have resisted Delhi for decades, with many Muslim Kashmiris supporting the rebels’ goal of uniting the territory either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India accuses Pakistan of backing militants – a claim Pakistan denies.</p> 
  <h2>What has happened in recent years?</h2> 
  <p>In 2019 Narendra Modi’s government launched a severe security crackdown in Indian-administered Kashmir and revoked the region’s special status, which had granted it limited autonomy since 1949.</p> 
  <p>The move fulfilled a longstanding Hindu-nationalist pledge and was widely welcomed across <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/india">India</a>, but angered many in the territory itself. Against a backdrop of widespread repression, insurgent violence tapered off and tourists returned to the region.</p> 
  <p>New rules were implemented that allowed outsiders to buy land in Kashmir for the first time, which many saw as an attempt by the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) to dispossess them from their land and change the Muslim demography of the region.</p> 
  <p>Under its special status Kashmir had been able to define who its permanent residents were, preventing incomers from other parts of India from applying for jobs, scholarships or buying land.</p> 
  <p>With the new domicile rule, India widened who was eligible to live and work in Kashmir, leading to accusations that it was trying to change the demographic make-up of the region. The Resistance Front cited this claim when it claimed Tuesday’s attack. </p> 
  <h2>Why has India reacted so forcefully to the Kashmir attack?</h2> 
  <p>The attack – in the midst of a visit by the US vice-president, JD Vance – was highly embarrassing for Modi and his BJP party, which has been boasting since 2019 about the success of its security policies in Kashmir.</p> 
  <p>The anger in India has been exacerbated by the sectarian nature of the attack, during which some of the male tourists were reportedly asked to recite Islamic verses to determine who would be killed</p>

  <p>Modi did not mention Islamabad specifically, but his speech came after Delhi suspended its part of the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty, which governs water critical to Pakistan for consumption and agriculture.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Indian armed forces have confirmed it targeted nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir as part of “Operation Sindoor”.</p> 
  <p>A statement from the Indian armed forces reads:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A little while ago, the Indian Armed Forces launched ‘OPERATION SINDOOR’, hitting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir from where terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed.</p> 
   <p>Altogether, nine (9) sites have been targeted.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It said its actions have been “focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature” and that no Pakistani military facilities were targeted, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The statement says the strike comes in the wake of the “barbaric” attack in which dozens of Indians were murdered in Pahalgam in Kashmir.</p>
