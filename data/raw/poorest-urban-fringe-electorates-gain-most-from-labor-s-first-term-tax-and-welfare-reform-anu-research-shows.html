<p>Households in the poorest outer suburban electorates are among the biggest winners from the social welfare <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2025/mar/25/federal-budget-2025-chalmers-delivers-speech-spruiking-tax-cuts-and-energy-relief-video">and tax policies</a> pursued by the Albanese government during its first term in power.</p> <p>Analysis by the Australian National University’s Centre for Social Policy Research has revealed how a highly progressive Labor agenda will boost incomes among the least well-off households by an average of $1,672 in 2025-26.</p> <p>At the other end of the spectrum, the wealthiest households on average will be nearly $800 worse off, the modelling shows, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/26/labor-to-push-tax-cuts-through-parliament-in-apparent-attempt-to-wedge-coalition">the rejigged stage-three tax cuts</a> leave them worse off than they would have been without the change.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The high cost of living has consistently rated as the No 1 issue cited by voters before the 3 May election, and the new research suggests that Labor’s policy changes have been targeted towards helping those most in need.</p> <p>This is reflected in the breakdown of winners and losers by electorate, where lower socioeconomic suburbs have done the best, at the expense of richer areas – most often in inner-city regions.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/xdJqI/4/" data-alt="Impact on average annual household income ($) in 2025-26 from policy changes through Albanese government’s first term"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/xdJqI/4/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Households in the safe Labor seat of Spence in outer Adelaide are the biggest winners, with an average annual income gain of $1,360 in 2025-26, the ANU modelling shows.</p> <p>This is followed by a $1,240 gain for households in the marginal far-north Queensland electorate of Leichhardt, where Labor hopes to win the seat held for decades by the retiring Liberal MP, Warren Entsch.</p> <p>Households in the marginal seats of Fowler in western Sydney (held by independent Dai Le) and Brisbane’s Blair (Labor) will also be more than $1,200 better off.</p> <p>Treasurer Jim Chalmers’ seat of Rankin in Brisbane is among the top five. In contrast, households in Anthony Albanese’s now wealthy inner-Sydney electorate of Grayndler will be $200 worse off in the next financial year as a result of the modelled changes enacted during the 47th parliament.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--showcase" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframeable/2019/03/choropleth_map_maker/v1/html/index.html?location=docsdata&amp;key=1bm1AnJ8UkOtw7sSkAjVsqujSl_3dXWtRi6-g7aw0g94" data-alt="Map showing how households in different electorates will benefit (or not) from Labor’s policy changes.
