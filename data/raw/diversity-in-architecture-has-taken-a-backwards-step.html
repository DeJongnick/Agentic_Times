<p>Up to the 1990s, local authorities and public sector design services provided positive opportunities for women and ethnic minorities to flourish in departments of architecture (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/20/stark-displays-of-sexism-driving-women-out-of-architecture-report-finds">‘Stark displays of sexism’ driving women out of architecture, report finds, 20 October</a>).</p> <p>For example, in Haringey’s building design service, which developed ideas from the New Architecture Movement that aimed to involve tenants and users in the design of their buildings and to democratise public architecture, 20% of the senior management team were women and 20% ethnic minorities – this was 30 years ago. </p> <p>Privatisation of the public sector, which was supported by New Labour, saw the demise of all council public design services and, with it, the conditions of employment required to support social change. <br><strong>John Murray</strong><br><em>Former Haringey borough architect,&nbsp;London</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
