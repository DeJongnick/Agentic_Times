<p>The flu season could be coming early this year, public health experts in England have said, adding that those who are eligible for a free vaccination should take up their offer.</p> <p>According to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), an increase in flu levels in England is being driven by cases among younger adults and schoolchildren.</p> <p>It comes as Japan’s health authorities <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03367-z">declared an influenza epidemic</a>, with a higher than usual number of infections for the time of year.</p> <p>A report by the UKHSA suggests that while flu levels are rising in England, they remain within baseline – or typical – seasonal ranges. But it added that the levels were similar to those seen when the flu season came early in 2022-23.</p> <p>Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, said: “It looks like flu cases are going up early this year. Seasonal epidemics often get going in children first and then spread through the adult population.”</p> <p>According to the latest <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-reports-2025-to-2026-season/national-flu-and-covid-19-surveillance-report-16-october-2025-week-42">report by the UKHSA</a>, which covers 6-12 October, influenza-like-illness consultations in primary care rose to 5.4 per 100,000 people, compared with 4.2 per 100,000 in the previous week.</p> <p>There has also been a rise in influenza hospitalisations, increasing to 1.27 per 100,000 people in the most recent week, compared with 0.73 per 100,000 the week before.</p> <p>Dr Conall Watson, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA, said: “This week’s data is showing a rise in positive tests for flu, particularly in children and younger adults, as well an increase in GP and A&amp;E attendances. It is relatively early in the autumn to be seeing these increases and we will be monitoring this closely in the coming weeks.”</p> <p>Watson added that it was “absolutely crucial” for everyone eligible for a flu vaccine to book their appointment. “It could make all the difference in avoiding severe illness and hospitalisation,” he said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/flu-vaccine/">Among those eligible for a free flu jab</a> are people aged 65 or over, pregnant women, people with certain long-term health conditions and people who live in a care home. A nasal spray vaccination is also available for children.</p> <p>“Parents should complete school flu consent forms or arrange an appointment for eligible preschoolers at the GP,” Watson said, adding that the vaccine not only stops children from getting very unwell but can help avoid them passing flu to others, including grandparents.<em> </em></p> <p>Finn also stressed the importance of vaccination, adding that those not eligible for a free dose could buy one at a pharmacy.</p> <p>“Don’t make the mistake of assuming flu is always a mild disease. Even among children we see severe cases admitted to hospital every winter,” he said. “Vaccination reduces the risk of getting flu and of getting seriously ill with it.”</p>
