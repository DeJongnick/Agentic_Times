This action was taken on 20 February.”</p> <p>Channel 4 News said the boy’s appearances represented “a handful of minutes across hundreds of hours of Channel 4 News output covering the Israel-Hamas war” and “appeared alongside other voices, including Israeli voices, as part of wider packaging and reporting for Channel 4 News and in line with our principles of due impartiality”.</p> <p>On Monday, the regulator Ofcom warned it has “ongoing concerns” about the “nature and gravity” of the BBC documentary on Gaza.</p> <p>In a letter to the BBC, Ofcom chair Michael Grade also warned the regulator could “intervene” to handle a complaint if it is not satisfied with the corporation’s internal investigation.</p>
