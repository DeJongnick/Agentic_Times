<p>A Canadian deep-sea mining firm <a href="https://investors.metals.co/news-releases/news-release-details/metals-company-apply-permits-under-existing-us-mining-code-deep">has revealed it has been negotiating</a> with the Trump administration to bypass a UN treaty and potentially gain authorisation from the US to mine in international waters.</p> <p>The revelation has stunned environmentalists, who condemned the move as “reckless” and a “slap in the face for multilateralism”.</p> <p>It comes at a time when calls for a pause in deep-sea mining are intensifying. <a href="https://deep-sea-conservation.org/solutions/no-deep-sea-mining/momentum-for-a-moratorium/governments-and-parliamentarians/">More than 30 governments are calling for a moratorium, arguing</a> that there is not enough data for exploitation of the seabed to go ahead, and scientists have warned industrial mining could cause irreversible loss of biodiversity.</p> <p><a href="https://investors.metals.co/news-releases/news-release-details/tmc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-results">In a statement on its website</a> on Thursday, Gerard Barron, chief executive of The Metals Company (TMC), said: “We believe we have sufficient knowledge to get started and prove we can manage environmental risks.</p> <p>“What we need is a regulator with a robust regulatory regime, and who is willing to give our application a fair hearing. That’s why we’ve formally initiated the process of applying for licences and permits under the existing US seabed mining code.”</p>    <p>Leticia Carvalho, the secretary general of the International Seabed Authority, a UN body set up to govern deep sea mining, has expressed “deep concern” over TMC’s announcement.</p> <p>At a meeting of delegates on Friday, Carvalho said: “All exploration and exploitation activities in the Area must be carried out under the Authority’s control.</p> <p>“Any unilateral action would constitute a violation of international law and directly undermine the fundamental principles of multilateralism, the peaceful use of the oceans and the collective governance framework” set up under the treaty.</p> <p>Countries have been meeting in Jamaica this week at the UN-affiliated International Seabed Authority (ISA) to decide rules governing the extraction of metals such as copper and cobalt from the seabed. </p> <p>They also discussed actions to take if a mining application was submitted before regulations were set. The ISA council has said no application should be considered before its rules are finalised, which is a long way off.</p> <p>The Metals Company said it had initiated a process under the US Department of Commerce to apply for exploration and permits to extract minerals from the ocean floor. It plans to apply under the 1980 <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title30/chapter26&amp;edition=prelim">Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act</a> instead of the ISA, and is moving forward “with urgency”.</p> <p>TMC has already carried out extensive exploratory work in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/25/more-than-5000-new-species-discovered-in-pacific-deep-sea-mining-hotspot">Clarion-Clipperton Zone</a>, an area of the Pacific Ocean seabed between Mexico and Hawaii that is rich in polymetallic nodules but also a wealth of newly discovered species. </p> <p>The ISA, established in 1994 under a treaty ratified by 169 member states plus the EU, has jurisdiction over mining in international waters and decides how extraction should proceed. However, the US has never ratified the treaty.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/jan/09/deep-sea-mining-why-is-interest-growing-and-what-are-the-risks">Deep-sea mining: why is interest growing and what are the risks?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Louisa Casson, a campaigner for Greenpeace International, said: “This announcement is a slap in the face to international cooperation,” adding that it was “an insult to multilateralism”.</p> <p>Duncan Currie, legal adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, said: “TMC appears to want to pivot from seabed mining without regulations to seabed mining entirely outside of all international frameworks. A moratorium is needed to prevent this kind of international conflict, discord and chaos.”</p> <p>Georgina María Guillén Grillo, a representative from Costa Rica at the ISA talks, told the New York Times: “This seems a totally improper move by the Metals Company.”</p>
