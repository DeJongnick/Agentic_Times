But the 35-year-old is yet to lead a side to the promised land as captain of a premiership side. He went a long way to doing just that this evening against the Hawks with an incredible preliminary final performance.</p> <p>Dangerfield turned back the clock to take control of the stoppages and regularly give the Cats territory advantage with six centre clearances. His masterclass ended with 32 disposals, eight clearances, three goals and surely best afield honours in <strong>one of the all-time great finals performances</strong>.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-19T12:55:24.094Z">at 1.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68cd4d0b8f0816a4522be0a9" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-19T12:34:05.091Z">1.34pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Bailey Smith is understandably pretty pleased with his move to Geelong</strong> for this season and has nothing but positive things to say about Patrick Dangerfield after the Cats skipper pulled out a stunning finals performance to lead his side to another grand final. </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I’m grateful to be here, but I mean… I set myself high expectations.

He is a leader, accomplished everything in the game and still takes time out of his day to look after me through some dark periods throughout the year. I’ll never forget it, forever in debt to him.

But the win has come at a cost with gun defender Tom Stewart subbed out of the game at the first break with concussion and now set to miss the next decider against Collingwood or Brisbane next Saturday.</p> <p>The Hawks opened up a promising lead twice in the early exchanges but were unable to pile enough pressure on the Cats before they gradually got the game back on their own terms. Patrick Dangerfield helped turn the contest with a powerful performance across all parts of the field and a masterclass at stoppages. The Cats skipper finished with 32 disposals, eight clearances and three goals, while Jeremy Cameron and Tyson Stengle also booted three majors. Bailey Smith finished with a game-high 36 disposals and Max Holmes (25) was influential after a slow start.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe">During finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Mitch Lewis was lively early with three early goals and Jack Gunston capped off a fine season with the just as many.

But an all-time shock grand final result, goals and behinds kicked after the siren to win games, the “Kennett Curse”, and a shot sprayed wide that cost the Hawks the game the last time they took on the Cats in a final are all in the past. This match is all about the future and earning a spot in the 2025 grand final against Collingwood or Brisbane.</p> <p>The Cats are rightly the favourites after putting together a six-match winning streak to finish off their home and away campaign, then extending that with a masterful display against the Lions in their qualifying final. But no Geelong supporter will be pleased with again meeting Hawthorn in a final, especially when there are no second chances. The Hawks have won all four cut-throat finals between the sides since the Cats took out the first of their three grand finals way back in 1963.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/17/from-the-pocket-newsletter-afl-weekly-footy-email-from-jonathan-horn-guardian-australia-sign-up-subscribe">During finals sign up for our free weekly AFL newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The Hawks return to the preliminary final stage for the first time in a decade and since they completed their premiership three-peat in 2015. Hawthorn might have finished in eighth place this year but have since shown they have the personnel and game plan built for finals as they outgunned GWS Giants and dismantled Adelaide for back-to-back wins on the road. Back at the MCG, the Hawks will like their chances against a Cats outfit that they pushed all the way in their only other meeting this year on Easter Monday. </p> <p><strong>First bounce will be at 7.40pm local time / AEST</strong>.
