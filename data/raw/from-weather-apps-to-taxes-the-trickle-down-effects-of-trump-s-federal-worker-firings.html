<p>You wake up to dark clouds outside, so you check the weather on your phone: a storm is coming.</p> <p>That weather app uses data from the National Weather Service, a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a small organization which <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/18/federal-workers-layoffs-noaa-nasa">could see</a> as much as 10% of its workforce cut this week.</p> <p>You grab food to make breakfast: eggs, meat, formula for your baby. The safety of your food is regulated and inspected by a host of federal employees, who flag and investigate when items shouldn’t be eaten.</p> <p>The former head of the Food and Drug Administration’s food division <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/18/fda-food-head-quits-trump">resigned this week</a> because he thought firings and layoffs at the agency would hinder its work. “I didn’t want to spend the next six months of my career on activities that are fundamentally about dismantling an organization, as opposed to working on the stated agenda,” he <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/18/fda-foods-division-jim-jones-interview/">told Stat News</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/19/education-department-trump">Department of Education workers brace for Trump to shut agency down: ‘Everybody is distraught’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You check your flight reservations for an upcoming trip to a national park. The safety of that flight is overseen by the Federal Aviation Administration, which <a href="https://apnews.com/article/doge-faa-air-traffic-firings-safety-67981aec33b6ee72cbad8dcee31f3437">experienced layoffs</a> this month despite recent high-profile aviation accidents. The national park <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/15/us-forest-service-national-park-service-layoffs">will probably see</a> its staff gutted, leaving it more vulnerable to wildfires and without search and rescue capabilities. “I honestly can’t imagine how the parks will operate without my position,” a park ranger who was cut <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGIfyW3NUdE/?igsh=X3BnTFhMUEJk&amp;img_index=1">wrote on Instagram</a>. “I mean, they just can’t. I am the only EMT at my park and the first responder for any emergency. This is flat-out reckless.”</p> <p>You keep an eye on the bird flu levels and a measles outbreak – the winter has been punishing for illnesses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were hit with a first round of layoffs <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/17/nx-s1-5300052/federal-employees-layoffs-cdc-nih-fda">this week</a>, which could affect outbreak response and reporting. The Epidemic Intelligence Service, a disease-detective training program, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/14/trump-cdc-cuts-include-epidemic-intelligence-service-outbreak-investigators/">could be</a> on the chopping block.</p> <p>Oh, and you’re working on your taxes – while thousands of Internal Revenue Service probationary employees are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/irs-treasury-layoffs-doge-tax-season-2be8db11fdd510b7ce6ac0db56f9a503">expected to be laid off</a> during tax season.</p> <p>The government certainly has room for improvement – backlogs that should be cleared, investigations that should be more thorough, communication that should be sharper, actions that should be more transparent. But all of this work is done by the federal government and its millions of workers and contractors, whose daily jobs touch the lives of all Americans and many around the globe.</p> <p>In the first weeks of the Trump administration, the president and the billionaire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, tasked with cutting government through the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), have waged war against federal workers. Musk and his team have moved from agency to agency, indiscriminately firing probationary employees and those whose work they say doesn’t align with the administration’s priorities, including many who work on diversity initiatives or in international development.</p> <p>The result is a hobbled and terrified federal workforce that is just at the beginning of the expected cuts – and an American public that is starting to experience the repercussions.</p> <p>“We’re playing Russian roulette, and basically you’re putting a whole bunch of more bullets in the chambers,” said Max Stier, the CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a non-profit that advocates for a strong civil service. “You can’t prevent all bad things from happening, but our federal government is, in a lot of ways, a manager of risk, and it does a pretty darn good job of managing that risk, even though it can be improved.”</p> <p>An email went out in January to millions of federal employees offering a deferred resignation, which the White House says about 75,000 people have accepted, although it’s unclear how many of the people who accepted are actually eligible.</p> <p>Joel Smith works at the Social Security Administration and is the president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3184, which covers more than 90 agency offices in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Louisiana. He said the office of management and budget, which has coordinated the buyout program it’s calling a “fork in the road”, hasn’t communicated with the agencies about which employees accepted the buyout. Some employees didn’t show up the first day the program’s leave was supposed to begin, and the agency had to call them to figure out where they were, he said.</p> <p>“It’s just chaos on top of chaos, on top of terror, on top of employees that want to leave are being told they can’t leave. I’m trying to think of a good word for it. I don’t know if there is one, other than clusterfuck,” Smith said.</p> <p>Those that remain in their jobs worry about whether they’re next as they add to their workloads to cover for those who lost their jobs or quit. People eyeing next career moves will avoid civil service, previously seen as a stable career, to stay out of the current chaos.</p> <p>Many people take core functions of the federal government for granted, as it protects them from disasters or national security concerns, but might not otherwise affect them. But that could change after widespread firings. For example, layoffs in the Environmental Protection Agency mean that those remaining in their positions have less capacity to do their jobs.</p> <p>“That could come in the guise of someone not being able to respond to an environmental disaster,” said Nicole Cantello, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704. “Or what about if there’s a facility illegally flaring air pollutants? We might not be as able to respond to something like that which could have health effects. There could be devastating effects to the American people.”</p> <p>If you or your loved ones use any direct services such as benefits programs, you could see the effects of a beleaguered federal workforce up close.</p> <p>Let’s say you’re helping your parents sign up for social security. The Social Security Administration is already understaffed, so losing any positions will make wait times longer for people who need to access benefits, Smith said.</p> <p>Smith’s father filed for retirement benefits in November to begin in February, but by February, his case hadn’t been processed – it was stuck in somebody’s backlog. A member of Congress had to intervene to bring attention to the delay, a frequent tactic to overcome stalled claims.</p> <p>“What people think they’re witnessing now and they’re complaining about now, in terms of delays, is going to be considered the good old days here in a year or two if this continues,” he said. “We already don’t have the people to do the work.”</p> <p>For federal workers and their families, the impact is heavy and immediate if they lose their livelihoods. </p> <p>“The way it’s working now is that the career civil servants are viewed as the villains,” said Rob Shriver, former acting director of the US office of personnel management who now works at Democracy Forward. “They’re viewed as people who are to be worked around and not worked with. They’re being deprived of the thing that’s most important to them, which is to contribute to the agency’s mission and bring their skills and expertise to the table to help inform decision makers.”</p> <p>Though many have focused on the disruption caused in Washington, federal workers live throughout the US and, in some cases, other parts of the world.</p> <p>“There’s a human aspect of it, which is these people are not just being fired, but they’re being fired in the worst way. No notice, no nothing. This is true across the board. There is zero humanity being demonstrated,” said Stier, of the Partnership for Public Service. “It is unbelievably costly to the individuals involved, and it’s costly to the system and to the American taxpayers. It’s going to cost the American taxpayer a ton of money. It is not going to save any money.”</p> <p><strong>Send us a tip</strong><em><strong><br></strong>If you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs or the federal workforce, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761.</em></p>
