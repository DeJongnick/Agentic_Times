<p>As Iran and Israel exchange missile attacks for a fourth day, Democrats in Washington are moving swiftly to reassert congressional authority over US military engagement in the region amid fears of American involvement in a broader conflict.</p> <p>Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator of Virginia, on Monday introduced a war powers resolution that would prohibit US armed forces from taking direct action against Iran without explicit authorization from Congress or a declaration of war. The measure, like other attempts to claw back power from the executive branch, faces a steep climb in the GOP-controlled Congress, where Republicans have been mostly unwilling to challenge Donald Trump’s authority.</p> <p>“I am deeply concerned that the recent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Iran could quickly pull the United States into another endless conflict,” Kaine said in a statement. “The American people have no interest in sending service members to fight another forever war in the Middle East. This resolution will ensure that if we decide to place our nation’s men and women in uniform into harm’s way, we will have a debate and vote on it in Congress.”</p> <p>Later on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who votes with Democrats, introduced a separate piece of legislation that would bar the use of federal funds for any use of military force “in or against Iran” without congressional authorization. Several progressive Democrats, including senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland joined as sponsors.</p> <p>“Another war in the Middle East could cost countless lives, waste trillions more dollars and lead to even more deaths, more conflict, and more displacement,” Sanders said in a statement. “I will do everything that I can as a Senator to defend the Constitution and prevent the US from being drawn into another war.”</p> <p>Sanders has accused Israel of timing its attack on Iran to “<a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-statement-the-u-s-must-not-be-dragged-into-netanyahus-war-against-iran/">sabotage</a>” the latest round of talks between the US and Iran over the future of Iran’s nuclear program that had been scheduled for Sunday but were cancelled.</p> <p>Trump on Monday said Iranian officials would “like to talk” about de-escalating hostilities with Israel, while Israel indicated its attacks on Iran were not yet finished. Trump – along with Democrats and Republicans – have issued stark warnings to Iran not to strike US targets as it launches retaliatory attacks.</p> <p>“If we are attacked in any way, shape or form by Iran, the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces will come down on you at levels never seen before,” Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/15/israel-hits-iran-energy-defence-ministry-conflict-escalates">wrote</a> on Truth Social.</p> <p>War powers resolutions are considered “privileged” under Senate rules, guaranteeing a floor debate and vote. Even if Kaine’s measure ultimately fails, it will compel lawmakers to confront pressing questions about the US role in the rapidly escalating Middle East conflict – and, more broadly, about presidential war powers and Congress’s constitutional authority over decisions of war and peace.</p> <p>Kaine’s resolution would not prevent the US from defending itself against imminent threats but would require congressional approval for offensive action. Sanders’ bill contains an exception for self-defense.</p> <p>On matters of foreign policy, Trump’s coalition includes Iran hawks like Senator Lindsey Graham, as well as “America First” subscribers who share the president’s longstanding opposition to US involvement in foreign conflicts.</p> <p>Graham on Sunday said he preferred a diplomatic solution, but barring that, he urged the president to “go all in”.</p> <p>“Make sure that, when this operation is over, there’s nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program,” he said in an interview on CBS’s Face the Nation. “If that means providing bombs, provide bombs.”</p> <p>Kaine’s move is part of a long-running effort to rein in presidential war powers, which has in the past brought together unlikely partnerships between Democrats and a growing faction of far-right anti-interventionists.</p> <p>During Trump’s first term, Kaine led a similar effort to limit Trump’s ability to strike Iran without congressional approval, following the president’s decision to order the killing of Iranian Gen Qasem Soleimani, which brought the US and Iran to the brink of war. Though both chambers of Congress approved the resolution, Trump vetoed it.</p> <p>That veto followed an earlier one in 2019, when Trump blocked a separate bipartisan War Powers resolution aimed at ending US support for Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen’s civil war – an effort that drew support from Democrats and a small group of anti-interventionist Republicans.</p>
