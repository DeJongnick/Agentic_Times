<h1>When a sick possum showed up in my garden my heart overtook my head. Is it ever OK to feed urban wildlife?</h1>

<p>Chopping vegetables in my kitchen on a winter afternoon, I was startled by the sound of rustling branches and loud coughing coming from my back yard.</p> <p>I walked outside tentatively, prepared to face a fence-hopping intruder. Instead, after a few minutes of listening to evenly timed wheezes, I spotted it – a small brushtail possum, tucked behind lilly-pilly branches bowing over my fence.</p> <p>Through the leaves, two black eyes peered desperately into the afternoon sun, eyelids dotted with pus. Its pink nose was swollen and its body and limbs were a patchwork of rashes, with pieces of fur missing across its torso.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F06%2Fpossum.png&amp;mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F06%2F250806PossumLoops_article.mp4" data-alt="Looping video of possum eating slices of apple and carrot"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/looping-video/index.html?poster-image=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F06%2Fpossum.png&mp4-video=https%3A%2F%2Fuploads.guim.co.uk%2F2025%2F08%2F06%2F250806PossumLoops_article.mp4">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Feeding native wildlife is a divisive topic; Phoebe Loomes started leaving her visiting possum slices of apple and carrot</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Huffing and bloodied, the possum looked like a once-loved teddy bear – greying, losing its stuffing and left to decay in the garden.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/01/this-elusive-possum-was-thought-to-be-extinct-outside-victoria-now-ecologists-have-made-an-amazing-discovery">This elusive possum was thought to be extinct outside Victoria.

As the sun set it put its head into its chest, wheezing itself to sleep.</p> <p>Feeding native wildlife is a divisive topic. While some throw mince to kookaburras with wild abandon, others tut tut, insisting it’s best to let them fend for themselves.</p>    <p>I called the wildlife rescue organisation Wires, which advised us to capture the possum so it could receive veterinary care. As my husband slowly approached with an old bath towel, in a scene not dissimilar from <a href="https://youtu.be/rD5uUWhjiNY?si=tenIOzOL2G54KLo3&amp;t=49">the 1931 film Dracula</a>, the possum suddenly reanimated, screeched loudly then scampered into the night.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IR0Yw0pzM0M"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IR0Yw0pzM0M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>Should you feed wild animals?</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Despite its terror it was clearly tempted by the prospect of more thawed-out berries because a few days later it returned. But I was not keen on trying to catch the possum again. After seeing it thrash around in fear, I worried that the stress of the ordeal might actually hasten its death. Diligently, and against best advice, I began leaving food for it.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>I wake to lilly-pilly fruits strewn like confetti across our concrete back yard</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> Providing slices of apple and carrot seemed like a neighbourly thing to do. But regular offerings might harm an animal more than they help.</p> <p>Brushtail possums in a natural environment eat native shrubs, plants and leaves. This is why a professor of behavioural ecology at the University of Sydney, Clare McArthur, says feeding brushtail possums should largely be avoided: “What are we doing to their gut flora? How good is [the food] we’re feeding them?</p> <p>“If they become reliant on us, what happens when we go away?”</p> <p>John Grant from Wires says feeding poses other risks, too. “They can also become ‘humanised’ and lose their natural fear of potential predators including domestic pets,” he says.</p> <p>“Possums (and native birds) are best fed with native foliage, so planting native trees and shrubs endemic to your area helps provide them with a natural food source.” </p> <p>Male possums being routinely fed can also become stressed when other males, keen for an opportunistic meal, encroach on their territory, which they naturally want to defend, according to a Taronga veterinary nurse, Annii Downing.</p>    <p>McArthur says giving a brushtail the odd piece of healthy food might not be a cardinal sin. “Now and then, it would be OK, because one of the virtues is that we start to value the wildlife around us. So it’s not a yes or no thing. It’s a fine line.”</p> <p>While official advice on wild animal feeding skews negative, Prof emeritus Darryl Jones from Griffith University agrees that responsibly interacting with urban wildlife can increase people’s compassion for animals.</p> <p>“No wild animals in Australia need extra food,” Jones says. “The reality is, millions of people every single day are feeding birds, and can’t find any information.”</p> <p>Compelled to counter this information void with facts, the behavioural ecologist, bird feeder and author of 10 books wrote a popular Australian field guide to urban birds, Feeding the Birds at Your Table<em>.</em></p> <p>“If you Google ‘What should I feed my magpies’ you’ll get inundated with huge amounts of negativity,” he says. “That’s my thing … to reconnect people with nature.</p> <p>“Only when people care about, look for, observe and just try and understand the wildlife around us will they care enough to protect them.</p> <p>“That’s the big philosophical side to this.”</p> <p>Just under a year on, I still see the possum on our fence. Its wounds have healed, it no longer wheezes or wobbles.</p> <p>Instead it has taken to chewing my veggie patch, gnawing rainbow chard and parsley down to the mulch line every few days. While I used to enjoy my own harvest, I now laugh at what the picky possum has chosen and wonder why it doesn’t like lemon thyme.</p> <p>Some nights, it seems as though there’s been a possum party. I wake to lilly-pilly fruits strewn like confetti across our concrete back yard.</p> <p>And every so often my husband still leaves out an apple slice for the possum. Even though we know we shouldn’t. Philosophically, though, I think it is sound.</p>
