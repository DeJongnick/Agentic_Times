<p>The<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration"> Trump administration</a> has ordered US states to suspend a $5bn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/electric-cars">electric vehicle</a> charging station program in a further blow to the environmental movement since the president’s return to the White House.</p> <p>In a memo <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/resources/state-plan-approval-suspension.pdf">issued</a> on Thursday to state transportation directors, the transportation department’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) ordered states not to spend any funds allocated to them under the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/biden-administration">Biden administration</a> as part of the national electric vehicle <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/infrastructure">infrastructure</a> (NEVI) program.</p> <p>“The new leadership of the Department of Transportation … has decided to review the policies underlying the implementation of the NEVI Formula Program,” Emily Biondi, the FHWA’s associate administrator for planning, environment and realty, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, the current NEVI Formula Program Guidance dated June 11, 2024, and all prior versions of this guidance are rescinded,” Biondi added.</p> <p>“As result of the rescission of the NEVI Formula Program Guidance, FHWA is also immediately suspending the approval of all State Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Deployment plans for all fiscal years. Therefore, effective immediately, no new obligations may occur under the NEVI Formula Program until the updated final NEVI Formula Program Guidance is issued and new State plans are submitted and approved,” she wrote.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/elon-musk-transformation-trump-climate">Elon Musk’s journey from climate champion to backing EV-bashing Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biondi added that until new guidance is issued, reimbursements of existing obligations for designing and building charging stations will be allowed in order to prevent the disruption of current financial commitments.</p> <p>According to an existing <a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12744">page</a> on the energy department’s website, the NEVI program provides funding to states to strategically deploy EV chargers. Funding is available for up to 80% of eligible project costs including the acquisition, installation and network connection of EV chargers, proper operation and maintenance of EV chargers, and long-term EV charger data sharing.</p> <p>Politico <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/06/trump-administration-ev-charger-program-00203011">reports</a> that as of Thursday, the FHWA removed several website pages that provided information on the NEVI program.</p> <p>In a statement to Politico, Andrew Rogers, a former deputy FHWA administrator under the Biden administration, said that the memo “appears to ignore both the law and multiple restraining orders that have been issued by federal courts”.</p> <p>The outlet further reports Roger saying that the memo appears to be “in direct violation” of the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, a law that <a href="https://www.citizensforethics.org/news/analysis/why-trumps-confusion-about-the-impoundment-control-act-is-a-problem-for-him-for-congress-and-for-everyday-americans/">restricts</a> presidents from withholding congressionally approved funding.</p> <p>Currently, 14 states have at least one operational EV station, <a href="https://evstates.org/awards-dashboard/">according to</a> EV States Clearinghouse. As of last November, there are 126 public charging ports in operation across 31 NEVI stations in nine states, marking an 83% increase in open NEVI ports since last quarter, <a href="https://driveelectric.gov/news/q4-2024-nevi-quarterly-update">according to</a> a NEVI report.</p> <p>It added that a total of 41 states have released at least their first round of solicitations, with 35 having issued conditional awards or put agreements in place for more than 3,560 fast-charging ports across more than 890 charging station locations.</p> <p>Throughout his campaign, Trump railed against EVs, at one point saying that supporters of the vehicles should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/elon-musk-transformation-trump-climate">“rot in hell” </a>and that Biden’s support of EVs would bring a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/05/trump-endorses-electric-vehicles-elon-musk">“bloodbath”</a> to the US’s automotive industry.</p> <p>Last month, as part of a flurry of executive orders he signed during his first days back in office, Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/trump-executive-order-electric-vehicles">revoked</a> a Biden-era order from 2021 that had aimed to make half of all new vehicles sold in the US in 2030 electric.</p>
