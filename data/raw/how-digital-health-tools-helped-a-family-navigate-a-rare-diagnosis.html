<p>When Tim and Jeannie Kirkland’s son, Oskar, was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder at just two years old, they began a seven-year journey through the Australian health system. Oskar has immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a condition that causes unusually low platelet counts and can result in severe bruising and bleeding. While the initial prognosis was reassuring – most childhood cases of ITP resolve within weeks – Oskar’s condition didn’t follow the typical script.</p> <p>“Weeks passed and he was still getting irregular bruising in soft spots you wouldn’t expect to see: under his eyes and on his belly and back,” Jeannie says. Blood tests revealed consistently low platelets, which are essential for blood clotting.</p> <p>Oskar’s treatment included regular blood tests – at times daily – as well as steroid courses and, eventually, immunoglobulin therapy when he was flown to Perth after falling and hitting his head. The Kirklands coordinated care across multiple providers and locations, regularly making the seven-hour drive from Kalgoorlie to Perth with Oskar and their three other children for what was often just a 20-minute specialist appointment.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Oskar has immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a condition that causes unusually low platelet counts and can result in severe bruising and bleeding.</p></li> </ul> <p>They juggled hospital stays, test results, different pathology services, prescriptions and follow-ups with multiple specialists, who frequently couldn’t access previous test results from other providers and needed Oskar to endure repeat testing.</p> <p>Tim says: “Doctors love data and so they were always wanting to do more tests on Oskar – they’ve got a case they’re trying to solve.”</p> <p>Tim and Jeannie became concerned about subjecting their little boy to so many tests, some of which were invasive, while also wanting the best possible care for him.</p> <p>This changed when their GP suggested they make use of My Health Record to access Oskar’s key health information in one place. They could now better track Oskar’s health and were more easily able to show doctors a record of test results to reduce the need to have them done again. Access to My Health Record and, in particular, the test results, gave Oskar’s parents the opportunity to review his results and be informed of early warning signs that could be a red flag for changes in his health.</p> <p>This information proved even more useful for Oskar’s parents when the family moved from Western Australia to Tasmania in 2023.</p> <p>“It was a huge benefit to move to Tasmania, find a GP here, and be able to say, ‘here’s everything that’s happened in the last five years’,” Tim says. “It was just really, really great to have all that history and information in one place.”</p> <h2>A tool for empowerment and efficiency</h2> <p>Dr Amandeep Hansra, a GP and the chief clinical adviser (medicine) at the Australian Digital Health Agency, says the system is designed to empower Australians to manage their health.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Dr Amandeep Hansra, chief clinical adviser (medicine), consulting with a patient.</p></li> </ul> <p>“Knowledge is power,” Hansra says. “Having access to information about your own healthcare helps you be more proactive about it, helps you be more involved and, ultimately, feel more in control.”</p> <p>My Health Record also makes Hansra’s work as a GP easier. “Digital records accelerate the diagnostic process,” she says. “If I can actually access the information that I need about a particular patient at the point that I’m seeing them, ultimately it’s going to lead to better health outcomes.”</p> <p>A new patient from interstate came to see Hansra recently, needing antibiotics for an infection. The patient told Hansra she was allergic to an antibiotic but couldn’t remember which one. It was a public holiday, so Hansra couldn’t reach the patient’s regular GP clinic to find out. Instead, she checked My Health Record and saw that the patient had been hospitalised recently. She could see not just the hospital discharge summary, but the antibiotic listed in the allergies section.</p> <p>My Health Record also gives doctors instant access to a patient’s immunisation history, including tetanus, on the Australian Immunisation Register, to which reporting on all vaccinations has been mandatory since 2024.</p> <p>If a patient has come in after cutting themselves at the beach, for example, and can’t remember when their last tetanus shot was, a doctor would usually err on the side of caution and give them the shot. “Now we can go to just one place, My Health Record, look at their immunisation history, and see the list along with other important health information,” Hansra says.</p> <p>More than 24.3 million Australians have a My Health Record. Almost every GP and pharmacy in the country is connected. More medical specialists are registering for My Health Record by the day, as are allied health professionals such as physiotherapists, who are seeing the value in multi-disciplinary teams accessing the same information.</p> <p>Legislation introduced early in 2025 means it will soon be mandatory for pathology and imaging reports to be uploaded to My Health Record by default. With consistent access to this central source of information, patients and health professionals alike can make more informed decisions, reducing unnecessary tests and improving the safety and speed of care.</p> <p>When an unconscious or seriously unwell patient arrives in hospital by ambulance, for example, emergency department medical teams can now check a patient’s My Health Record to see, at a glance, their health history, any medications they’re on and whether they’re allergic to anything. “It helps take the guesswork out of the assessment they’re doing on that patient,” Hansra says.</p> <p>It’s also proving invaluable for people with complex health conditions and chronic diseases, who may take multiple medications and see a series of medical specialists and allied health practitioners. “It really helps having that central point where they can keep that information,” Hansra says.</p> <p>She encourages everyone to take advantage of My Health Record, seeing it as a win-win for patients and health professionals alike.</p> <p>“Everybody should jump on board, use it, get familiar with it. Having all your health information in one spot makes it so much easier for you and for the healthcare team that supports you.”</p> <h2>Health information at our fingertips</h2> <p>The my health app makes it easier for people to access key information about their health on their phones. It offers a secure and convenient way for people to view information that they, their healthcare providers or representatives have uploaded to My Health Record. It also provides access to electronic prescriptions and the active script list for those juggling multiple scripts, and has other features, such as the “Find and book a health service” tool.</p> <p>“It’s the digital front door for health services,” Hansra says. “They can go into the app and see their key health information, and that allows them to have control over their own health journey.”</p> <h2>A family in control</h2> <p>Oskar turns nine this year and his condition has stabilised. Jeannie says: “He’s just thriving. He’s such an amazing little kid.”</p>    <ul> <li><p>Tim and Jeannie Kirkland and their four children</p></li> </ul> <p>His dad agrees. “From the age of two, he’s just taken it in his stride,” Tim says. “From time to time he’ll talk about his ‘dodgy blood’ but he does all the things that a boy his age would do: he plays soccer, rides his bike and this year he’s started running. It doesn’t limit anything he does but we keep an eye on him and are aware this might be something that’s with him for the rest of his life.”</p> <p>Tim is grateful that all four of their kids will have access to their own complete and accurate health record when they grow up and leave the nest. “It’s really great for their future,” Tim says. “They’ll have their whole medical history available to them.”</p> <p>Jeannie, a nurse by training, also likes the reassurance of knowing Oskar’s records are accessible when they travel as a family, with the my health app installed on their phones. “On holidays, we like knowing that no matter where we go, if we need to we can access that history,” she says. “It’s very empowering.”</p> <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.digitalhealth.gov.au/myhealth" rel="nofollow">Get started with digital health by downloading the my health app today.</a></strong></em></p>
