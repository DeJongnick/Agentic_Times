<p>A Democratic lawmaker in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona">Arizona</a> who is facing calls for expulsion for resharing an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram">Instagram</a> post warning of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> enforcement activity near an elementary school said that state senate Republicans “absolutely are trying to make an example out of me”.</p> <p>Analise Ortiz, a Democratic state senator in Arizona, shared an Instagram post from a community organization that warned, in text only, that immigration enforcement agents were near a local elementary school.</p> <p>“Alert/Alerta: ICE activity near Southwest Elementary,” the post in early August said, adding the cross streets of the school. “ICE is present. La migra esta presente.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/28/immigration-ice-los-angeles-teen-detention">‘Nightmare’: family in shock after Ice moves LA teen out of state without their knowledge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That post is at the center of an ethics complaint filed this week against Ortiz and a viral rightwing campaign against her.</p> <p>“The ethics complaint very clearly says that they want to stop other people from sharing this type of information,” she said, calling it “a stunning escalation of intimidation”. </p> <p>The controversy began when Libs of TikTok, the X account known for going after liberals online, posted about Ortiz’s reshare, claiming she was “actively impeding and doxxing ICE by posting their live locations on instagram” and that law enforcement officials should “charge her”.</p> <p>No photos of agents were shared, nor were names or other identifying information about agents.</p> <p>“I was not there,” Ortiz said. “There were no pictures of anybody taken. It was simply a post that said Ice presence is possible outside of an elementary school. And I think that the fact that they are outside of sensitive locations where kids should be able to learn in peace is something that people should know about. They should know how the government is acting on their behalf.”</p> <p>The Libs of TikTok post went viral, leaving Ortiz with an inbox full of harassing and threatening messages. The mischaracterization that she “doxed” agents had led to the vast majority of the threats she had received, she said.</p> <p>Jake Hoffman, a Republican state senator, and a handful of other Republican leaders in the chamber <a href="https://www.azsenaterepublicans.gov/post/senator-jake-hoffman-files-ethics-complaint-against-democrat-lawmaker-for-endangering-public-safety">filed</a> a formal ethics complaint that seeks to expel Ortiz from the chamber or, failing a vote to expel, remove her from all committees and take away her office and administrative staff. The ethics committee chair also <a href="https://www.azsenaterepublicans.gov/post/senate-ethics-committee-chairwoman-takes-action-on-complaint-against-senator-ortiz-refers-to-u-s-a">referred</a> the complaint to the US attorney’s office in Arizona for a potential investigation, saying Ortiz’s actions “may implicate federal law”.</p> <p>After the ethics complaint was filed, Libs of TikTok egged on Arizona senate Republicans. “Make an example out of her! Enough is enough,” the account tweeted.</p> <p>“What surprised me about the ethics complaint was the level of punishment they want to inflict upon me for simply exercising my first amendment right,” Ortiz said.</p> <p>As immigration enforcement agents have ramped up activity across the country, activists have shared locations where they see raids or Ice agents as a way to warn people to avoid the area. In Arizona, a southern border state, fear of deportations – and of detaining people who are in the US legally – is a facet of daily life in the second Trump administration. Ortiz said she had heard from constituents who are terrified to drive without a passport on hand because they fear law enforcement won’t believe they are US citizens if they are pulled over.</p> <p>Ortiz said she would not be intimidated by the ethics inquest or attempts to criminalize her sharing of information.</p> <p>“If the United States of America is going to continue as a free and fair democracy, it demands that people speak out against constitutional violations,” she said. “It demands bravery, so I am going to continue to be brave in this moment.”</p> <p>Hoffman claimed Ortiz’s reshare was “reckless” and “dangerous”, saying that “by publicly posting alerts about federal law enforcement activity, she actively tipped off individuals being pursued by Ice, jeopardizing the safety of officers and law-abiding citizens”. He wanted the committee to investigate her for “behavior unbecoming of an elected official and embarrassing to the entire Arizona legislature on a state and national stage”.</p> <p>Hoffman was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/24/arizona-trump-fake-electors-charged-2020-election">charged for his role</a> as a fake elector after the 2020 election. Earlier this year, he was <a href="https://www.kait8.com/video/2025/06/07/new-video-shows-sen-jake-hoffman-getting-pulled-over-speeding-clipped-version/">pulled over</a> for driving 89mph in a 65mph zone in his Tesla Cybertruck emblazoned with the word “Freedom” on the back, though he <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/queen-creek/2025/02/17/arizona-state-senator-jake-hoffman-didnt-get-speeding-ticket-heres-why/78890894007/">was not cited</a> because of a legal provision called legislative immunity.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.azsenaterepublicans.gov/_files/ugd/2f3470_d028fb20dfa24b1eb26998509f8d6958.pdf">ethics complaint</a> details how Ortiz did not back away from her reshare after Libs of TikTok posted about it. Instead, she wrote that she would alert her community to stay away when Ice is around and that she was “not fucking scared of you nor Trump’s masked goons”. After Hoffman wrote on X that he would bring an ethics complaint and wanted her expelled, she said: “Bring it on, Jake.”</p> <p>Warren Petersen, the Republican state senate president, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2025/08/07/warren-petersen-analise-ortiz-federal-investigation-ice-alerts/85546494007/">previously asked</a> for a federal investigation into Ortiz’s reshare, claiming she may have broken a federal law that prevents “assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers or employees”.</p> <p>The US attorney’s office in Arizona did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Ortiz said Republican lawmakers want to deprive her legislative district of its voice in the senate and silence her and others who want to stand against deportations.</p> <p>“The fact they are trying to escalate it and are blatantly lying about my actions proves that this is really about authoritarianism and wanting to have a system where masked men carry out police operations in secret, and that should really concern anyone who cares about the United States constitution,” Ortiz said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2025/08/19/first-amendment-protections-senator-ortiz-ice-location-posts/85710936007/">Free speech experts</a> and other elected officials, including the state’s Democratic attorney general, have spoken out against the attacks on Ortiz for her post, which they say is well within her first amendment rights.</p> <p>“Senator Ortiz’s post is clearly protected speech under the first amendment,” Arizona’s attorney general, Kris Mayes, said in a statement. “This ethics complaint is nothing more than a pathetic attempt to intimidate and silence a democratically elected legislator. Warren Petersen and Jake Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves for weaponizing the ethics process just because they disagree with Senator Ortiz politically.”</p> <p>The ethics committee has not met yet this year and does not have operating rules in place, but will consider the complaint once those are established, said its chair, Shawnna Bolick, a Republican. An expulsion would require a two-thirds vote of the chamber, an unlikely prospect.</p> <p>Ortiz previously faced an ethics investigation after she and another Democratic lawmaker shouted “shame” and protested on the state house floor against their Republican colleagues over an abortion vote in 2024. She was found to have <a href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/060524_dems_abortion_ethics/ethics-panel-concludes-2-dems-broke-az-house-rules-by-yelling-republicans-amid-abortion-uproar/">violated</a> house rules for conduct, but no official action was taken against her.</p>
