Sportsbet during the AFL finals series in an apparent attempt to entice him to gamble more.</p> <p>More than two years ago a bipartisan parliamentary inquiry led by the late Labor MP Peta Murphy recommended all online gambling inducements be banned “without delay”, citing evidence of harm to customers.

“went out of her way to greet me, discuss relevant matters and made no mention of any problem whatsoever with me being on-course”, he added in a series of posts on social media.</p> <p>Latham said he

<strong>Henryon</strong>, a volunteer with Birdlife Western Australia, said there was a clear choice that would decide whether the endangered Baudin’s black cockatoo would survive. “Baudin’s or bauxite – we can’t have both,” he said.</p> <p>Henryon has spent years advocating for better protection of what he describes as the state’s “forgotten” black cockatoo.</p> <p>The dark-feathered, white-cheeked bird with a call like a squeaky gate is endemic to the state’s south-west.</p> <p>Compared with the higher profile Carnaby’s black cockatoo, the Baudin’s has a longer, narrower bill, which Henryon said it used like a surgical tool to extract the seeds from the marri nuts it fed on, without destroying the whole nut.</p> <p>BirdLife WA nominated the species for “uplisting” to critically endangered in 2023 under the state’s laws after research found the species’ population had declined by 90% in 40 years.</p> <p>The proposal would have brought the state conservation status into line with international bodies such as the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which lists the Baudin’s as critically endangered.</p> <p>But the state’s threatened species
