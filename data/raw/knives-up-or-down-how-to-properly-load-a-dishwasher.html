<p>The debate over the best way to load a dishwasher is one that seemingly will never be fully resolved. Some people take a laissez-faire approach to loading, while others are a little more careful about the correct etiquette. It’s even often cited that how to load the dishwasher is one of the top reasons couples fight, with a study from cleaning brand Ecover finding that 51% of respondents have clashed with their significant other over stacking strategy.<br><br>But even if you’re the type who likes to squeeze whatever you can on to the bottom shelf and play fast and loose with the pans and cutlery, there are a few rules it pays to follow if you’re conscious of your carbon footprint and want to get the most out of your dishwasher. So here are some handy tips to help you get those dishes sparkling clean.</p> <h2><strong>To wash, or not to wash?</strong></h2> <p>Before you begin, make sure everything you’re cleaning is dishwasher safe. If you’ve ever squinted helplessly at a glass measuring jug’s washed-off numbers, you’ll know that some things require the delicacy afforded by hand washing.</p> <p>Fragile and valuable items, anything with designs that might wear off (think: your World’s Best Boss mug), and wooden utensils at risk of warping are all destined for the kitchen sink.</p>    <p>Similarly, to keep them in tip-top shape, cast-iron and non-stick cookware and anything that relies on staying sharp – such as your good kitchen knives, mandoline, blender blades and throwing stars – should be washed by hand.</p> <p>You might wonder whether it’s a good idea to use your machine at all. Instinctively, it feels more eco-friendly to get busy with the rubber gloves than to turn on a machine – but modern dishwashers generally waste less water than a sinkful of suds (although there are certain factors to consider), even when they’re on a longer programme, such as the eco mode, which is designed to use less energy.</p> <p>The better you stack, the less you have to rewash. So no more throwing everything in there willy-nilly.</p> <h2><strong>Be a savvier stacker</strong></h2> <p>Crucially, all items should be loaded with their dirty sides facing downwards and towards the middle, so the spraying arms can do their thing and so your dishes don’t fill up with water. The upper rack is where mugs, glasses and smaller items of crockery (such as your favourite tiny olive bowl) are happiest, while the lower rack is for larger plates and bowls.</p> <p>Stacking plates on top of each other is a criminal offence – or should be – so make sure they’re evenly placed in the dish rack. Real pros alternate dishes and bowls, to ensure they all get an even wash.</p> <p>Bulkier items such as pans should go on the bottom, at the back – after stacking, make sure you give your spray arms a quick spin to make sure they’re not restricted. Then, there are those items you might not realise can be cleaned in the dishwasher: your microwave turntable, kids’ plastic toys and bathroom accessories (we’re talking soap dishes, not the loo brush). Although where those should go is anyone’s guess.</p> <h2><strong>The great cutlery basket debate</strong></h2>    <p>Things get a bit more complex when it comes to cutlery. In households across the land, battles have been waged over whether everything should go into the basket faced up or down (especially since Chantelle’s untimely death by dishwasher on Eastenders!). But if your machine lacks a utensil shelf, you need to decide which path you’re going to follow – and each way has its advantages and disadvantages.</p> <p>Place your cutlery pointing upwards, and it’s fully exposed to your dishwasher’s water jets and you can check that items are evenly spaced (clustering being the enemy of a thorough clean) – but there’s a risk you could accidentally cut yourself. Put them pointing downwards, and they’re easier to unload and you won’t be grappling with the “eating” and/or sharp ends, but the results aren’t always the cleanest. Some manufacturers even recommend the evil-chaotic approach of mixing things up, with knives facing downwards and everything else alternated, up and down, throughout the basket.</p> <p>But however you decide to load, make sure you only start a cycle once your dishwasher is full. That way, you’re lending a hand to both your wallet and the planet!</p> <p><em><strong>Perfectly packed dishwasher tablets</strong><br>The ideal companion for your dishwasher has to be Ecover’s perfectly packed <a href="https://uk.ecover.com/products/dishwashing/wrapper-free-all-in-one-power-dishwasher-tablets/" rel="nofollow">Power dishwasher tablets</a> with no plastic wrapper.
