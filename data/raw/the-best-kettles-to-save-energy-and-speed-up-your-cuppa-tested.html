<p>Despite the march of progress, the humble kettle remains a kitchen staple. It’s what we turn to in times of strife, when spirits are flagging, or to start our day. And when a visitor calls, one of the first things we do is put the kettle on.</p> <p>While many small appliances have evolved beyond their original form, the kettle’s basic principles remain largely unchanged. Water goes in and heats up until a thermostat switches it off; the water then pours out, and we enjoy a cuppa. However, the technology that goes into a kettle has been slowly improving: better insulation to keep water hotter for longer and reduce reboils; different temperature settings to suit every drink from green tea to herbal brews; and more features such as filters and concealed elements to keep scale out of our cups.</p> <p>When your existing kettle makes its last brew and must be taken to the big recycling centre in the sky, it pays to check out what’s on offer to replace it. The next one you buy may make more of a difference to your day than you might think.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Best kettle overall:</strong><br>Bosch Sky kettle<br><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bosch-TWK7203GB-Kettle-Cordless-Silver/dp/B088FYWDGX"><sub>£76 at Amazon</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best budget kettle:</strong><br>Kenwood Ripple kettle<br><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kenwood-ZJP06-000BK-Indicator-Protection-removable/dp/B0F2FQLC7S/"><sub>£29.99 at Amazon</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>The forever kettle</strong><br>Dualit Classic kettle<br><a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/dualit-classic-72796-jug-kettle-polished-stainless-steel-10243862.html"><sub>£140 at Currys</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best quiet kettle:<br></strong>Zwilling Enfinigy Pro kettle<br><a href="https://www.zwilling.com/uk/zwilling-enfinigy-electric-kettle-pro-15-l-silver-53006-003-0/53006-003-0.html"><sub>£139 at Zwilling</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best budget variable temperature kettle:</strong><br>Lakeland Digital double-walled kettle<br><a href="https://www.lakeland.co.uk/27578/lakeland-digital-double-walled-kettle"><sub>£44.99 at Lakeland</sub></a></p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>When a friend heard I was writing this, she asked me, “Aren’t all kettles the same? They all boil water, don’t they?” And while she’s right about the second part, it took me at least 15 minutes to explain why she was wrong about the first. I’ve been testing kettles for years and they vary greatly – in design, weight, ease of maintenance, ease of use and build quality. Some will last for decades while others will barely make it past the basic guarantee period. In short, yes, all kettles boil water – but they are far from being all the same.</p> <h2>How I tested</h2>    <p>As you can imagine, I boiled a lot of water. Litres upon litres of the stuff. Enough to turn my kitchen into the steamiest hammam and clear my pores of blackheads I’ve had since I was a teenager.</p> <p>But testing wasn’t just about making gallons of tea and having a deep skin cleanse on the cheap. I also brought a lot of gadgets to the party: a power meter to assess electricity use for each kettle when boiling exactly one litre of water from cold; a timer to measure how long that took; and a probe thermometer to gauge how long it took for the kettle to click off once it had reached boiling point.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/22/everything-i-learned-testing-kettles">Fancy a cuppa? My epic kettle showdown – and what I learned</a> </p> </aside>  <p>External temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer and the highest reading noted, while maximum noise levels were recorded with the Decibel X app. After boiling, water temperature was checked at the 30-minute, one- and two-hour points to see how much it had cooled.</p> <p>I tested 12 kettles in total. Those we tested but haven’t included are <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/essentials-c17jkw17-jug-kettle-white-10156975.html">Currys Essentials C17JKW17 jug kettle</a>, which is a snip at £8.99 but lacks durability, and the <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/4821261">Russell Hobbs Travel Light white small kettle 23840</a>, which is probably one of the best travel kettles you can buy at £20, but took almost six minutes to boil its 850ml.</p> <p>The ones that made the cut were selected on the basis of good energy efficiency or low minimum fill, plus ease of use or maintenance. Value for money has also been considered, as have longer guarantees and durable build quality that should translate into a lengthy lifespan for the appliance.

It boasts a low minimum boil (300ml), a keep-warm setting and touch controls.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>I found it difficult to select a best kettle from so many that performed well, but the Bosch Sky clinched it because it’s such a good all-rounder that will suit most people. It pours well, has a button that’s within easy reach of the handle so it’s simple to open the lid without touching it, and it’s insulated so the exterior doesn’t become too hot to touch. From a design perspective, it has a more industrial feel than many others – no frippery here – but not too modern that it wouldn’t fit into most kitchens. Its display is thoughtfully designed, easy to keep clean and lights up as it heats. </p> <p>The exterior doesn’t get too hot (up to 40C), and while it wasn’t the fastest to boil in testing, it was only seconds behind the Dualit below. It clicked off at boiling point, and the water was still a toasty 78C 30 minutes later. At the hour point, it was 66C, and two hours 52C, meaning you’ll spend less time and energy reboiling.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>its premium look ends at the handle, which seems cheap and plasticky next to the sleek aesthetic of the rest of it.</p> <p><strong>Time to boil one litre:</strong> 2mins 22secs<br><strong>Minimum fill:</strong> 300ml<br><strong>Power us</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>:</strong> 0.112kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWh<br><strong>Matching toaster? </strong><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/bosch-sky-compact-2-slice-toaster-black/p111267447">Yes</a><br><strong>Maximum</strong> <strong>noise recorded: </strong>59dB<br><strong>Temperature settings: </strong>70C, 75C, 80C, 85C, 90C, 95C, 100C, keep warm<br><strong>Warranty: </strong>two years</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em><strong>Best budget kettle:<br></strong></em><strong>Kenwood Ripple </strong><strong>kettle</strong></h2>    <p><a href="https://www.kenwoodworld.com/en-gb/ripple-midnight-black-kettle-zjp06-000bk/p/ZJP06.000BK"><sub>£29.99 at Kenwood</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kenwood-ZJP06-000BK-Indicator-Protection-removable/dp/B0F2FQLC7S/"><sub>£29.99 at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>Available in four “ocean-inspired” shades – eggshell blue, storm blue, pure white and midnight black – Kenwood’s Ripple kettle has a subtle design that belies its affordable price tag. It’s practical, too: there’s a 3kW element, a wide pouring spout to prevent drips, and two water windows showing cups on one side and litres on the other (making it left-hander friendly).</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>More affordable kettles tend to demand a higher minimum fill – usually 500ml – but the Ripple enables those on a budget to boil a single cup (200ml), providing excellent energy economy. There’s even a plastic marker inside for one and two cups and max, so you don’t need to watch the water window as you’re filling. It’s lightweight at 950g without feeling flimsy, has a pull-off lid for easier filling, and it boiled quickly in testing, retaining its heat well for the first 30 minutes (72C) and hour (60C).</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>the lightweight plastic body meant that the external temperature was very hot after boiling (80C). Its two-hour temperature (44C) was also much cooler than the one-hour point, meaning more energy is needed to reboil.</p> <p><strong>Time to boil:</strong> 2mins 30secs<br><strong>Minimum fill: </strong>200ml<br><strong>Power us</strong><strong>e:</strong> 0.118kWh = 3p at 25.73p per kWh<br><strong>Matching toaster? </strong><a href="https://www.kenwoodworld.com/en-gb/ripple-midnight-black-toaster-tcp06-00bk/p/TCP06.000BK">Yes</a><br><strong>Maximum noise recorded: </strong>57dB <br><strong>Temperature settings: </strong>100C<br><strong>Warranty: </strong>one year</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em><strong>The forever kettle</strong></em><em><strong>:</strong></em><strong><br>Dualit Classic </strong><strong>kettle</strong></h2>    <p><a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/dualit-classic-72796-jug-kettle-polished-stainless-steel-10243862.html"><sub>£140 at Currys</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/dualit-classic-kettle/polished-stainless-steel/p1731363"><sub>£149.99 at John Lewis</sub></a></p> <p>Although it comes with a higher initial outlay, Dualit’s Classic kettle is more of a “buy right, buy once” appliance. It’s as robust as they come, with a durable stainless-steel body, hinged lid, anti-wobble feet and non-drip spout. But it’s the repairable nature of this kettle that makes it an eco-friendly buy. The 3kW element is replaceable, so a pro can swap it for a new one or repair it if it wears out, meaning you may never need to buy a new kettle again.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Repairability aside, the Dualit Classic kettle also makes it easy to boil only as much water as you need, with a low minimum fill (250ml) and dual water windows indicating cups and litres via multiple markings. There’s no button to raise the lid, meaning one less thing to go wrong; instead, it has a heatproof plastic handle. It was also the fastest boiling of all the kettles tested and clicked off bang on boiling point.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that … </strong>the exterior gets hot after boiling – our sample reached 71C.

I also appreciated the clear display and choice of temperatures, as well as the reassuring lifetime warranty. It was easily the quietest when boiling and didn’t grow hot on the exterior, reaching a cool-touch 31C.

For example, kettles that are dual-walled help to trap heat inside, so the water stays warmer for longer while the outside stays cool to the touch.</p> <p>Those with low minimum fills enable you to boil just enough water for a single cup, so you don’t waste energy heating more than you need. Some kettles also have a keep-warm function that stops the water cooling below a certain temperature, which is ideal for those who become distracted after boiling or drink consecutive cuppas. It’s a good idea to check for safety features too, such as an auto shut-off to prevent it from boiling dry if there’s not enough water.</p> <p>Other features are more “nice to haves”: variable temperature models enable you to choose water heated to lower temperatures than boiling, such as 70C or 80C, for other types of tea or for filling a hot-water bottle. Concealed elements, which are easier to keep scale-free, and removable, washable limescale filters will be useful for those who live in hard-water areas. Then there’s connectivity. While wifi-enabled and voice-controlled kettles can feel a little gimmicky, they can be a gift for busy parents who usually have their hands full.</p> <h2>Are rapid-boiling kettles faster than normal ones?</h2> <p>Rapid-boil kettles don’t have a strict industry definition, so while a rapid-boil kettle should boil water quickly, it may not differ much from one that’s not labelled as such.</p> <p>A more reliable indicator of how fast a kettle will boil is its power rating: this is listed either in watts (eg 3,000W) or kilowatts (eg 2.2kW). The higher the number, the more power its element can use to heat water quickly. However, this isn’t the whole story: boiling times can also be quicker in double-walled kettles (as they lose less heat to their surroundings) and those with concealed or flat elements (which provide more surface area to heat the water than a coil).</p> <h2>How to descale your kettle</h2> <p>Limescale reduces your kettle’s efficiency, costing you more to boil each time, and shortening the appliance’s lifespan. Descale it monthly, especially if you live in a hard-water area. Standing water encourages the buildup of limescale, so try not to leave water in the kettle after use.</p> <p>While you can buy descaler in the supermarket, a lower-cost and more eco-friendly option is to combine a weak food-safe acid, such as white vinegar or lemon juice, with water. Fill the kettle three-quarters with either water and the juice of one lemon or equal parts water and vinegar. Let it soak for an hour, then boil the kettle (once for vinegar, three times for lemon).
