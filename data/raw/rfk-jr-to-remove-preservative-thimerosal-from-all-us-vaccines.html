<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, the US health secretary, will formally require vaccine makers to remove thimerosal from vaccines.</p> <p>The ingredient has been the target of anti-vaccine campaigns and misinformation for decades. Arguments against the preservative <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/20/cdc-vaccine-panel-rfk-jr">culminated in June</a>, when a key federal vaccine advisory panel, remade with Kennedy’s ideological allies, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/rfk-flu-shot-vaccines-panel">recommended against</a> the preservative.</p> <p>The recommendation goes into force upon Kennedy’s signature.</p> <p>There is no evidence thimerosal has caused harm, despite decades of use. The ethylmercury-based preservative was used in only about 5% adult influenza vaccines in the US, helping prevent contamination in multi-dose vials.</p> <p>“After more than two decades of delay, this action fulfills a long-overdue promise to protect our most vulnerable populations from unnecessary mercury exposure,” Kennedy said in a statement announcing the decision.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/rfk-jeans-arizona-hiking-photo">RFK Jr strides into new controversy: hiking in sweltering Arizona … in jeans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Injecting any amount of mercury into children when safe, mercury-free alternatives exist defies common sense and public health responsibility. Today, we put safety first,” said Kennedy.</p> <p>Thimerosal is an ethylmercury-based preservative – different from the kind of mercury found in seafood, called methylmercury. Ethylmercury has a shorter half-life in the body. The amount of ethylmercury contained in a flu vaccine (25 micrograms) is about half of that contained in a 3oz serving of canned tuna fish (40 micrograms).</p> <p>The preservative has been used in vaccines since before the second world war. It was controversially phased out of most childhood vaccines in 1999, physicians associations said as a precautionary measure, and was contained in only a very small number of adult vaccines.</p> <p>Phasing out the preservative in the early 2000s was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/rfk-flu-shot-vaccines-panel">criticized</a> by experts who argued scientific evidence did not support its removal, that it sent mixed messages and that it provided a talking point for anti-vaccine campaigners. Indeed, the preservative was targeted for years to come.</p> <p>That criticism came to a head in June, after Kennedy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/rfk-cdc-panel-vaccines-removed">fired all 17 members</a> of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) advisory committee on immunization practices, a federal panel that was a critical link in the vaccine distribution pipeline.</p> <p>Kennedy replaced the experts with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/eight-new-cdc-vaccine-advisers-robert-f-kennedy">eight hand-picked allies</a>, including one directly from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/05/vicky-pebsworth-vaccine-experts-rfk-jr">anti-vaccine movement</a>. Eventually, one appointee <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/25/rfk-vaccine-advisory-panel">dropped out</a> after a conflict of interest review.</p> <p>The vaccine advisory panel voted in favor of removing thimerosal on a 5-1 vote (with one abstention) after a controversial presentation from Lyn Redwood, a former leader of World Mercury Project, the predecessor to Kennedy’s group Children’s Health Defense, itself a prolific anti-vaccine campaign group.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/21/michael-bloomberg-rfk-jr">Michael Bloomberg urges Republicans to oust RFK Jr, ‘peddler of junk science’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Redwood’s presentation had to be updated after it was found to contain a link to a study that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/24/cdc-vaccine-presentation-autism">did not exist</a>. One of Kennedy’s vaccine advisers said during the meeting that a presentation from career scientists at the CDC, which laid out thimerosal’s safety, was pulled by the secretary’s office.</p> <p>The director of the CDC is required to sign off on the vaccine advisory committee’s recommendations. Because there is not presently a Senate-confirmed CDC director, Kennedy acts as head of the CDC.</p> <p>The decision to remove thimerosal from all vaccines in the US will also probably complicate the global picture for vaccine makers.</p> <p>“With the US now removing mercury from all vaccines, we urge global health authorities to follow this prudent example for the protection of children worldwide,” Kennedy said.</p>
