There may also be news of more transfer targets being hijacked by a club’s fiercest rivals, as we get to less than 10 days before the window closes. Our correspondents will be chipping in with the latest transfer news, while Jamie Jackson will be checking in from the Etihad Stadium, before Manchester City v Tottenham.</p> <p>12pm</p> <p>Australia v Samoa</p> <p>Rugby union</p>  <p>After Friday night’s opener between England and the USA, the Women’s Rugby World Cup continues in Salford. Australia are likely to be too strong for the Pacific islanders, in what is expected to be a warm-up for the Wallaroos’ key Pool A game, against the USA next Saturday. <strong>Daniel</strong> <strong>Gallan</strong> is helming the minute-by-minute blog, while <strong>Aaron Bower</strong> will cover this match and the Scotland v Wales Pool B game that follows, before <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong> reports from York on the day’s other game in that section, Canada v Fiji.</p> <p>12.30pm</p> <p>Manchester City v Tottenham</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>A nice, easy game for Spurs fans to look forward to after Eberechi Eze’s relocation to north London took an unexpected diversion. Tottenham began with a convincing home win over Burnley last Saturday, but the deposed serial champions will surely be tougher opponents. <strong>Billy Munday</strong> brings you minute-by-minute coverage as City look to follow up the 4-0 dispatching of Wolves against opponents who have caused Pep Guardiola a fair deal of angst down the years, last season’s equivalent fixture being a 4-0 win for Angeball. <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong> will provide the match report and the managers’ reactions.</p>   <p>1.45pm</p> <p>Premier League clockwatch</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>Join us for the 3pm team news and updates on the lower-league lunchtime games too, including Charlton v Leicester, from where <strong>Yara El-Shaboury</strong> will be sending us a report. <strong>John Brewin</strong> is at the helm for the live afternoon, which includes Brentford v Aston Villa and Bournemouth v Wolves, but perhaps the most critical game of the afternoon was a Championship fixture last season: Burnley v Sunderland. <strong>Will Unwin</strong> is at Turf Moor for the match report (including news of whether Martin Dubravka has learned to count to eight), while <strong>Ben Bloom</strong> is at the Gtech and <strong>Ben Fisher</strong> at the Vitality. We’ll also have all the news through the Championship and Leagues One &amp; Two.</p> <p>4.10pm</p> <p>South Africa v Australia</p> <p>Rugby union</p>  <p>How do the Wallabies follow that? Last Saturday’s epic comeback win in Johannesburg – Australia’s first victory there since 1963 – will live long in the memory whatever happens in Cape Town, but a Springboks backlash is expected. They are not alone in seeking revenge: the Brumbies wing Corey Toole, a sevens star at the Paris Games, makes his 15-man international debut against the nation that denied him an Olympic medal in the bronze playoff last August. Rassie Erasmus has made a number of changes against an Australia side shorn of their captain, Harry Wilson, by a knee injury. <strong>Daniel</strong> <strong>Gallan</strong> will guide you through.</p>   <p>5.30pm</p> <p>Arsenal v Leeds</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>It’s going to be second playing first from last season two weekends in a row, as before Arsenal travel to Liverpool they host the winners of the Championship. The Gunners’ hard-fought victory at Manchester United was followed up by the transfer window win over Tottenham, so the home crowd at the Emirates Stadium should be buoyant. But Leeds fans are on a double high of their own, back where they feel they belong and with three points under their belts, too; they will hope new keeper Lucas Perri will cope better with Arsenal’s set pieces than Manchester United’s Altay Bayindir did. <strong>Scott Murray</strong> is your live host, while <strong>David Hytner</strong> and <strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> will have the report, reaction and analysis from the ground.</p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>5.30am</p> <p>Australia v South Africa, third ODI</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p>While Australia claimed the T20 series in a thrilling finish, winning last Saturday’s decider by two wickets with one ball to spare, South Africa have sealed the one-dayers in convincing fashion, winning by 98 runs in Cairns and 84 runs in Mackay. Lungi Ngidi took five for 42, including Josh Inglis for 87, in Friday’s second game to clinch the series, the rest of the home batting not offering much resistance at the Great Barrier Reef Arena. That’s also the venue for Sunday’s dead rubber; <strong>James Wallace</strong> and <strong>Geoff Lemon</strong> are on the over-by-over.</p> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>It’s time to pick over all the controversies from Saturday with <strong>Dominic Booth</strong> – and there will be controversies, because there always are, as evidenced by the split in opinion over James Tarkowski’s handball on Monday. Talking of Everton, their fixture against Brighton is not the biggest match of the day in footballing terms but the first competitive game at Hill Dickinson Stadium is a huge landmark for one of the Football League’s founder members, the venue at Bramley-Moore Dock following on from Anfield and Goodison Park as the Blues’ homes. Our man on Merseyside, <strong>Andy Hunter</strong>, will be on the ground on an historic day, as will one of our news colleagues, the loyal Evertonian <strong>Aaron Sharp</strong>.</p>   <p>2pm</p> <p>Crystal Palace v Nottingham Forest</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>Just as those new students of football lore have to have the misty origins of the Palace-Brighton rivalry outlined to them, so will future generations need to listen to “Marinakis” and “Textor” being darkly muttered by their still-bitter elders. After Thursday night’s demonstrations, Uefa executives may be thin on the ground at Selhurst Park but there will be extra police and stewarding, not least in case Evangelos Marinakis turns up. It is to be hoped that protests tied to Forest’s intervention in Palace’s demotion from Europa League to Conference League are limited to chants and banners, but the authorities will be prepared. On the pitch, both sides made promising starts, with Palace drawing at Chelsea and Forest dispatching Brentford, though the hosts will be Eberechi Eze, scorer of their disallowed Stamford Bridge goal. <strong>Scott Murray</strong> will have all the latest with updates from Everton v Brighton, too, as players vie to be the first official scorer at the new ground. <strong>Ed Aarons</strong> and <strong>Jonathan Wilson</strong> are at Selhurst Park for reports and analysis.</p> <p>4.30pm</p> <p>Fulham v Manchester United</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>Two sides with something to build on meet at Craven Cottage. Fulham deservedly took a last-gasp point at one of their peers, Brighton; while Manchester United put together a promising performance against Arsenal, albeit without reward. Defeat for either, though, would suddenly leave them at risk of an anxious international break, with only the Carabao Cup and one more league game in which to earn some credit. <strong>Tim de Lisle</strong> will have the highs and lows as they happen, while <strong>John Brewin</strong> and <strong>Barney Ronay</strong> are by the Thames.</p>   <p>4pm</p> <p>US Open day one</p> <p>Tennis</p>  <p>Well, it’s day one if you don’t count the novel version of mixed doubles with which some of the big names warmed up for the main event. The singles gets under way at 11am or noon local time and while home hopeful Ben Shelton kicks off action on Arthur Ashe, Emma Raducanu gets the honour on Louis Armstrong. Both are up against qualifiers, while the women’s No 1 seed, Aryna Sabalenka, against Rebeka Masarova, Britain’s 2021 winner is followed by the US’s Taylor Fritz, seeded four, against his compatriot Emilio Nava. <strong>Taha Hashim</strong> will follow the action live, while <strong>Tumaini Carayol</strong> will be reporting from Flushing Meadows on the pick of the action.</p>
