in the 2026 Eurovision song contest if the participation of Israel goes ahead,</strong> and the final decision regarding Ireland’s participation will be made once the EBU’s decision is made,” the broadcaster said in a statement.</p> <p>“RTÉ feels that <strong>Ireland’s participation would be unconscionable given the ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza.</strong> RTÉ is also deeply concerned by the targeted killing of journalists in Gaza, and the denial of access to international journalists to the territory, and the plight of the remaining hostages.”</p> <p>The <strong>decision will raise questions about its duty to be impartial as a public service news organisation.</strong></p> <p><strong>Slovenia’s national broadcaster, RTVSLO, has also said it will participate in next

<div class="block-elements">  <p>Pushed again on the Polish incident, Supreme Allied Commander Europe <strong>Grynkewich</strong> offers a bit more operational detail.</p> <p>He says <strong>“we do not yet know if this was an intentional act or an unintentional act” from Russia.</strong></p> <p>He also cautions against focusing too much on the reported numbers of drones involved, saying:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“I would also <strong>have low confidence in any numbers that that you’ve heard of the number of drones.</strong> …</em></p> <p><em>As we try to account for that and go into the technical details, will get a better understanding of how many there were, but <strong>I would not be able to tell you with any confidence today that it was 20 or that it was 10.</strong> We just have to get into the technical details to figure that out, to debrief the crews that were up see what they saw.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>He also offers a bit more detail on thinking when it comes to intercepting these drones, as he says:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Anytime you’re using aircraft to defend against the drone attack like this, and I’ve got a fair amount of experience from this, from my time in the Middle East, <strong>you have to make choices about which drones to intercept and which ones not to</strong>, based on the number of aircraft you have airborne.</em></p> <p><em>If something is going out into a field, you might let it go, versus it’s heading toward an airfield that’s critical to your combat operation.</em></p> <p><em>So <strong>I’m confident that the aircrew and the forces made the right decisions about what they could do</strong> with the resources that they had.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Grynkewich also gets pushed on whether Nato’s response would be the same if it faced a “swarm” of drones to which he replies:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“There’s no doubt in my mind, <strong>if we experience a drone swarm of hundreds, that is not an accident, that is not an incursion, that would be an attack against Alliance territory.</strong></em></p> <p><em>In that case, you’re looking at the activation of plans and the flow of additional capabilities into Allied Command operations, and under Saceur that we would deploy forward to help manage that.</em></p> <p><em>I won’t get into the details of what our strengths and weaknesses are with that, but <strong>in
