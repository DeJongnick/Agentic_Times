<p>Chris Wilder’s future as Sheffield United manager is in doubt, with the club’s American owners set to discuss his position at a board meeting.</p> <p>It is thought the recruitment strategy has been a significant factor in pushing Wilder’s future towards a crossroads. The US-based consortium COH Sports, led by Steven Rosen and Helmy Eltoukhy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/dec/23/sheffield-united-takeover-completed-as-coh-sports-buys-championship-leaders">completed a takeover</a> last December.</p> <p>The 57-year-old, in his second spell in charge of his boyhood club, led United to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/24/sunderland-promoted-to-premier-league-championship-playoff-final-sheffield-united">Championship playoff final</a> last month, which they lost to Sunderland, after missing out on automatic promotion.</p> <p>United are keen to press ahead with more “data-driven” recruitment, which includes the use of artificial intelligence. This week United signed the Nigerian winger Ehije Ukaki from the Bulgarian club Botev Plovdiv, a move made by the winger Christian Nwachukwu, 19, in January.</p> <p>In the same window United signed Jefferson Cáceres, 22, from the Peruvian club FBC Melgar but neither Nwachukwu nor Cáceres has made a first-team appearance.</p> <p>The Blades are one of several Championship clubs searching for a manager, with Middlesbrough, Queens Park Rangers and Bristol City also seeking to fill vacancies.</p> <p>On Wednesday Hull City appointed Sergej Jakirovic as their head coach on a two-year contract, and this month <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/02/ryan-mason-leaves-tottenham-to-become-head-coach-at-west-brom">West Brom appointed</a> the former Tottenham coach Ryan Mason on a three-year contract.</p>
