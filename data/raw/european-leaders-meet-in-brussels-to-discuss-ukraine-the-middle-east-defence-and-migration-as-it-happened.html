<p>“That there have been clear expressions of antisemitism and support for National Socialist ideas in my party’s history <strong>I think is disgusting and reprehensible,”</strong> <strong>Mattias

says as he pushes for EU accession</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>A <strong>UK plan to send refused asylum seekers to “return hubs”</strong> in third countries shows <strong>post-Brexit Britain is “in a very dark place”,</strong> <strong>Albania’s</strong> prime minister has said.</p>    <p>In his first interview with the international media since leading his socialist party to a historic fourth term in office, <strong>Edi Rama</strong> said <strong>the idea of the UK wanting to “look for places to dump immigrants” would have been inconceivable a decade ago.</strong></p> <p>But it was <strong>in keeping with the shift in public discourse in Britain since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum">Brexit</a>, in which the “totally unacceptable, totally ridiculous, totally shameful” had become normalised,</strong> he said.</p> <p>Announced last month by Keir Starmer during a visit to the Balkan state, the “return hubs” scheme would involve centres in a third country processing the claims of people refused asylum who have exhausted legal pathways in the UK.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p>

[Rishi] Sunak doing something outrageous; it’s because of the country being in a very dark place.”</em></p> </blockquote>    <p>He said:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>“Eighty per cent of the things that are said, or are written, or are accepted as a normal part of the discourse in today’s Britain are things that [before Brexit] would have been totally unacceptable, totally ridiculous, totally shameful.”</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Rama’s stance coincides with <strong>a newfound confidence as the small country</strong>, among Europe’s poorest states, <strong>makes once-unthinkable strides towards joining the EU. </strong></p> <p>With a dramatic change of pace and tone that <strong>he attributes to the new “geopolitically driven spirit” of European policymakers</strong> since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, accession negotiations have accelerated as Brussels finally seeks to embrace the western Balkans. The region has long been viewed by Moscow as falling into Russia’s sphere of influence.</p> <p>Rama, who turns 60 in July, ran his election campaign on the promise <strong>he would push ahead with pursuing accession to the EU.</strong> </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/edi-rama-on-course-win-fourth-term-pm-albania-elections">Edi Rama set to win record fourth term as PM in Albania elections</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He now believes negotiations will be wrapped up by 2027 and <strong>“within 2030 we’ll be an EU member”.</strong> Albania, which joined Nato in 2009, has been an accession candidate for more than a decade.</p> <p>“The whole approach to the process has dramatically changed,” he said. “Now they [the EU] are very eager to go forward … With the Russian aggression everything changed, so <strong>somehow Vladimir Putin also did this, he made Europe much more interested in unifying.”</strong></p> <p><em>Read the full interview:</em></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/third-country-asylum-plan-shows-uk-is-in-a-very-dark-place-says-albanian-pm">Third-country asylum plan shows UK is in ‘a very dark place’, says Albanian PM</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685d418c8f086eb9ab7ccf4f" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-26T12:53:12.077Z">1.53pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Meanwhile, back on Earth, European parliament president <strong>Roberta Metsola </strong>is the first to emerge from the leaders’ meeting in Brussels.</p> <p>On Iran and Israel, she says:</p> <blockquote> <p><em>What we are witnessing, especially between Israel and Iran, is a test for all of us.

<strong>Pedro Sánchez</strong>, has <strong>renewed his outspoken criticism of Israel’s prosecution of its war in Gaza</strong>, saying the territory is in <strong>a “catastrophic situation of genocide”</strong> and calling on the EU to immediately suspend its deal with Israel.</p>    <p>Speaking to reporters before an EU summit in Brussels, Sánchez <strong>mentioned a recent human rights report by the bloc’s diplomatic service</strong> which, he said, addressed “the catastrophic situation of genocide unfolding in Gaza”.</p> <p>The <strong>report published last week found “indications” that Israel was breaching its human rights obligations</strong> under the deal, which forms the basis for trade ties.</p> <p>The text cited Israel’s blockade of humanitarian aid for the Palestinian territory, the high number of civilian casualties, attacks on journalists and the massive displacement and destruction caused by the war.</p> <p>Sánchez said it was <strong>“more than obvious” that Israel was violating its obligations</strong> and that <strong>the bloc should suspend the cooperation deal “immediately”.</strong></p> <p>“It makes no sense” that the bloc has imposed 18 rounds of sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine but, “in a double standard, is not even capable of suspending an association deal”, he added.</p> <p>Last month, Israel said it had summoned the Spanish ambassador for a formal reprimand after Sánchez described Israel as a “genocidal state”.</p> <p>Sánchez made the remarks during an exchange in the Spanish parliament in which his government was accused of continuing to trade with Israel. “I want to clarify one thing,” the prime minister said. <strong>“We don’t trade with a genocidal state. We don’t.”</strong></p> <p>The prime minister has previously e<strong>xpressed “genuine doubts” about whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law</strong> in its offensive in Gaza, while one of Spain’s deputy prime ministers, <strong>Yolanda Díaz</strong>, has said “the genocide of the Palestinian people cannot go unpunished”.</p> <p>— <em>With AFP</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685d25a88f08267f1d55138f" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-26T10:49:43.691Z">11.49am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>And now let’s go to our Madrid correspondent <strong>Sam Jones</strong> for more on <strong>Pedro Sánchez’s </strong>comments at the European Council on Gaza.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685d228b8f086eb9ab7ccd6b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-26T10:43:22.284Z">11.43am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Axiom-4 mission carrying Polish, Hungarian astronauts docks with International Space Station</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>A US commercial mission carrying crew from <strong>India</strong>, <strong>Poland</strong> and <strong>Hungary</strong> has just docked with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/international-space-station">International Space Station</a>, with astronauts from these countries going to space for the first time in decades.</p>    <p>Axiom Mission 4, or Ax-4, launched from Nasa’s Kennedy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/space">Space</a> Center in Florida at 2.31am local time yesterday with a brand-new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule riding atop a Falcon 9 rocket.</p> <p>The vehicle docked with the orbital lab on Thursday and will remain there for up to 14 days.

support the package as it doesn’t directly affect its interests.</p> <p>But talking to reporters this morning, prime minister <strong>Robert Fico </strong>said he would ask for the package to be delayed, and could even veto it completely.</p> <p>Slovak media <a href="https://domov.sme.sk/c/23510181/fico-blanar-rusko-europska-unia-sankcie.html">are reporting</a> that <strong>Fico is frustrated

analysis</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> may like to take the credit for almost all of the 32 allies agreeing to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/25/trump-praises-nato-states-as-summit-prepares-to-lift-defence-spending-target">sharp increase in defence spending</a>, but <strong>the reality is that the dramatic change in the Nato mindset was as much brought on by Vladimir Putin.</strong></p>    <p>The Russian president’s full-scale invasion of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> in February 2022 was the first jolt, but there is a second uncomfortable reality. <strong>If there is a sustainable ceasefire in Ukraine, it will mean the deployment of a European-led peacekeeping force in the country</strong> – and after a while, <strong>Russia’s military might will inevitably recover.</strong></p> <p><strong>Mark Rutte’s sycophantic, but effective, handling of Trump</strong>, certainly helped bring about a positive summit in The Hague, though even the Nato chief had to concede that describing Trump as “daddy” – a father figure who had to tell Iran and Israel to stop fighting – was perhaps “a question of taste”.</p> <p>The <strong>manoeuvres were not subtle, but they were nevertheless effective.</strong> A late schedule change gave Trump a night in King Willem-Alexander’s palace, complete with breakfast, leaving Trump to remark on how well he had slept, though what particularly seems to have hit home was hearing each of the alliance’s other 31 leaders give a three-minute speech, something that might be assumed to have bored him.</p> <p>“I came here because it was something I’m supposed to be doing, but I left here a little bit different,” he said as he reflected on the morning meeting in an upbeat press conference.</p> <p>Make no mistake, after Trump’s re-election and particularly in February, the alarm across Nato was real. That month, Trump started talking to Putin about Ukraine, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war">rowed with Ukraine’s president</a>, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in the Oval Office – while his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/us-no-longer-primarily-focused-on-europes-security-says-pete-hegseth">made a speech</a> that was interpreted as a warning that in the not too distant future Europe might have to defend itself.</p> <p>But <strong>what helped persuade Nato’s other leaders to spend more was a worry about Trump’s commitment.</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato">Nato</a> planners believe that if <strong>Russia</strong> were to agree to a ceasefire, it could quickly, within perhaps three, five or seven years, <strong>pose a serious threat to the alliance’s eastern flank.</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/25/change-in-nato-mindset-was-brought-on-by-vladimir-putin-as-much-as-trump">Change in Nato mindset brought on by Vladimir Putin as much as Donald Trump</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685d00c98f087751affb2a98" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-26T08:12:30.000Z">9.12am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>As we wait to hear from more leaders to arrive, let me jump on Schoof’s comments and bring you our defence and security editor <strong>Dan Sabbagh’s</strong> <strong>analysis of yesterday’s Nato summit in The Hague.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685cfe558f083e0626a9e258" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-26T08:02:43.957Z">9.02am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>German chancellor <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong> is not in the mood for lengthy conversations as he arrives at his first European Council.</p> <p>He lists the topics to be discussed today, and endorses the European Commission’s proposals to improve the bloc’s competitveness globally and “efforts to reach a trade agreement with the US.”</p> <p>And, on a personal note, he says <strong>he hopes to be able to make a contribution to help Europe move forward</strong> successfully.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685cfab98f083e0626a9e224" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-26T07:57:46.181Z">8.57am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Dutch PM 'hopeful' to see new sanctions passed by EU</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Dutch prime minister <strong>Dick Schoof</strong> arrives next, fresh from the successful Nato summit in The Hague.</p> <p>He (not surprisingly) says it was a <strong>“very good summit,”</strong> which “achieved a big result” with the new 5% defence spending target.</p> <p>He also tells reporters it’s clear that the US remains committed to Nato and Article 5, and hopes for a resolution to trade issues soon.</p> <p>On <strong>sanctions</strong> against Russia, Schoof <strong>backs the “strong” package and says he is “hopeful”</strong> that <strong>it will be passed</strong> during today’s meeting. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685cf93f8f08419b3775488b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-26T07:45:50.120Z">8.45am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">'Rebellion is the only way,' Hungary's Orbán criticises EU's migration plans, rejects Ukraine's membership bid</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Hungary’s <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong> is the first leader to arrive.</p> <p>One of the key issues at this summit is whether the leaders will be able to <strong>agree on the 18th package of sanctions against Russia.</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/10/eu-price-cap-russian-oil-sanctions-nord-stream">EU calls for lower price cap on Russian oil in move to tighten sanctions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hungary has been a vocal critic of the proposal, threatening (as usual) to block it.
