<h2>The Great Art Fraud</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>An art gallery wunderkind. A Made in Chelsea girlfriend. An $86m (£64m) art fraud that led to two years in prison. Inigo Philbrick, who was released last year, tells his story in this two-parter that unpicks how he sold the same paintings to multiple people at once. It also speaks to industry insiders and his now wife (Made in Chelsea’s) Victoria Baker-Harber. Here’s hoping he’s not going for Anna Delvey-style scam icon status, because he is quite unbearable. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Saving Lives at Sea</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>The salutary tale of two overambitious amateur kayakers at Crantock in Cornwall is just the warmup this week for scary tales of the south coast when storms are raging. Later in Mudeford, a call comes in from a boy concerned about his windsurfing dad. Out at sea, the man has vanished. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>George Clarke’s Beautiful Builds</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>Another slightly bewildering dilemma: the kitchen and garden will be renovated, but the homeowners need to choose which gets a bigger budget. This time, in Derbyshire, wheelchair user Ben wants better accessibility in both spaces, and a design that works for the whole family. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Destination X</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>So far, the BBC’s reality travel gameshow has varied from wrenching more gripping drama than you’d imagine possible from an, essentially, elaborate geography quiz to absolutely stultifying TV (what was that Venice episode about?). This week, the final four contestants battle it out in the penultimate episode – before Thursday’s final. <em>Alex</em><em>i Duggins</em></p> <h2>Mudtown</h2> <p><strong>9pm, U&amp;Alibi</strong></p> <p>“Model? Richmond fucking sausage lips more like” might be the greatest insult ever hurled across a courtroom. But that’s not even dedicated magistrate Claire’s (Erin Richards) main case. She is taking the investigation of the arson a family friend has been accused of into her own hands – however, it goes much deeper than she realised. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Limbs in the Loch: Catching a Killer</h2> <p><strong>10pm, BBC Two</strong></p> <p>A sensitive six-part documentary about a macabre case: the discovery of human limbs in Loch Lomond in December 1999, and a head that washed up on a South Ayrshire beach just over a week later. The story of the investigation is told here, starting with police doing a routine exercise in the loch with no expectation of finding anything in it. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Thunderbolts* (Jake Shreier, 2025),</strong> <strong>Disney+</strong><strong><br></strong>Calling its supervillain “Bob” suggests this entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has its tongue at least occasionally in its cheek. And, with Florence Pugh and David Harbour reprising their semi-comic roles from Black Widow as Yelena and Alexei, it’s a fun, if breathless, caper. Chuck in Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), disgraced former Captain America John Walker (Wyatt Russell) and Hannah John-Kamen’s Ghost and you have a new set of crime-fighting heroes ready to go. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <p><strong>The Claim (Michael Winterbottom, 2000),</strong> <strong>midnight, Talking Pictures TV</strong></p>    <p>The snow in the Sierra Nevada can bury a lot of things, but in Michael Winterbottom’s weighty version of Thomas Hardy’s The Mayor of Casterbridge, it can’t keep the past covered for ever. Peter Mullan is at his brooding best as Dillon, the benevolent dictator of 1860s gold-mining settlement Kingdom Come. But two arrivals spell doom. There’s surveyor Dalglish (Wes Bentley) who may – or may not – send the railroad through his town; and there’s his wife, Elena, (Nastassja Kinski), and their daughter Hope (Sarah Polley), whom Dillon sold for a gold claim years earlier … <em>SW</em></p>
