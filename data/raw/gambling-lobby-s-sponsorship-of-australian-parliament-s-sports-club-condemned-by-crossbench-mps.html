<p>Crossbench MPs and a transparency group have criticised the gambling lobby’s sponsorship of federal parliament’s sports club, alleging it paid to secure access to decision-makers and entrench wagering’s close association with sport.</p> 
<p>Responsible Wagering Australia has also been accused by the independent ACT senator David Pocock of “shamelessly” trying to claim it was involved with a running group devoted to eliminating suicide, which was hosted by the parliamentary sports club.</p> 
<p>The peak body and the Australian Parliament Sports Club have rejected claims the social games are anything other than a chance for politicians and staff to relax and exercise during parliamentary sitting weeks, alongside sponsors who cover costs.</p>

<p>But the independent MP Kate Chaney, who was a member of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jun/28/ads-for-online-gambling-should-be-banned-in-australia-within-three-years-inquiry-recommends">a parliamentary inquiry that called for a total ban on gambling advertising more than two years ago</a>, said the club and its event provided the RWA with an opportunity to build influence in Canberra.</p> 
<p>Corporate membership of the club begins at $2,500, according to its website, and allows sponsors to access “key opinion leaders” and “over 200 parliamentary members” at social games and functions.</p> 
<p>The club is chaired by the prime minister, Anthony Albanese. Its corporate members include fossil fuel company Ampol, alcohol companies Lion and Diageo, outsourcing company Serco, consultancy firm Canberra Consulting and other companies.</p> 
<p>The RWA’s corporate membership is not disclosed on the club’s website but is listed on emails sent to members. The peak body represents some of Australia’s largest bookmakers, including Sportsbet, Bet365, Betfair and PointsBet. It has lobbied against a total advertising ban on their behalf.</p>

<p>Chaney said RWA’s membership demonstrated “another subtle way lobbyists are making politicians believe gambling is indispensable to sport”.</p> 
<p>“The industry’s influence has become normalised, with no one batting an eyelid at lobbyists turning up at friendly parliamentary sports events,” Chaney said. <br><br>“The prime minister, as the chair of the Australian Parliament Sports Club and a sports lover, must remove RWA’s corporate membership.”</p> 
<p>The Centre for Public Integrity’s executive director, Catherine Williams, said the club offered “an invaluable opportunity for monied interests to build relationships with members of parliament and their staff”.</p> 
<p>“Let’s be real about it: if the access isn’t perceived to be valuable, why is it sold as a benefit of membership?” Williams said.</p> 
<p>RWA’s chief executive Kai Cantwell said it did not use the club to lobby politicians.</p> 
<p>“RWA’s work on regulation and harm reduction happens through the proper parliamentary and regulatory processes, not on the sporting field,” Kantwell said.</p> 
<p>“Like other industries, we occasionally take part simply to enjoy exercise and socialising – something important for all Australians, particularly in high-pressure roles.”</p>

<p>The club’s chief executive, Andy Turnbull, rejected claims its paid corporate members were granted lobbying opportunities.</p> 
<p>“Firstly, there is an unwritten rule that no one talks business on the sports pitches. It’s the only time the parliamentarians get any time to relax and not do business, and I work very hard to ensure this is the case,” Turnbull said.</p> 
<p>“Secondly, I have always been of the view that the larger the organisation involved, the less likely they are to ‘use’ the club in an inappropriate way. This applies to the RWA who spend their whole lives prosecuting the case for their industry.”</p> 
<p>Pocock criticised a LinkedIn post by RWA that highlighted its participation in an event with suicide prevention charity Running for Resilience, which was hosted by the club.</p> 
<p>“At RWA, we’re proud to get involved with initiatives like this that build stronger, more connected communities,” the now deleted post said.</p> 
<p>Running for Resilience has told gambling reform advocates it did not realise the RWA was at the event, that it had no involvement with it and was surprised to see it leverage its work <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/12/gambling-addiction-a-factor-in-184-suicides-in-victoria-over-eight-years-study-finds">given the wagering industry’s link to suicide</a>.</p> 
<p>“It’s pretty shameless given we know that gambling addiction can lead to suicide and they are there trying to associate themselves with a group that’s trying to end suicide in the ACT,” Pocock said.</p> 
<p>In a statement, Running for Resilience’s chief executive, Ben Alexander, did not directly address the RWA but said it was focused on preventing people from turning to “unhealthy coping mechanisms that lead to addiction”.</p> 
<p>The prime minister’s office was contacted for comment.</p>
