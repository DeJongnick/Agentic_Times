<p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york">New York</a> county clerk on Thursday refused to enforce a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas">Texas</a> court fineagainst a New York doctor accused of mailing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion">abortion</a> pills across state lines – a move that tees up a dramatic showdown between states that protect abortion rights and those that have banned the procedure. The clash will probably end up in front of the US supreme court. </p> <p>In December, the Texas attorney general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/13/texas-abortion-pills-lawsuit-ken-paxton">Ken Paxton, sued</a> Dr Margaret Carpenter in a Texas court<strong> </strong>for allegedly mailing abortion pills to the Lone Star state, which bans virtually all abortions. After Carpenter did not show up to a court hearing earlier this year, a Texas judge ruled against her, ordering her to pay a $113,000 penalty and stop sending abortion pills to Texas.</p> <p>New York has, however, enacted a “shield law” that forbids state officials from extraditing abortion providers to other states or complying with out-of-state court orders. In his statement refusing to enforce<strong> </strong>the Texas fine, the acting Ulster county clerk Taylor Bruck cited the law.</p> <p>“In accordance with the New York State Shield Law, I have refused this filing and will refuse any similar filings that may come to our office. Since this decision is likely to result in further litigation, I must refrain from discussing specific details about the situation,” Bruck said in a statement.</p> <p>Paxton’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Texas may challenge New York’s shield law through a lawsuit. Although a number of blue states have passed shield laws since the US supreme court overturned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade">Roe v Wade</a> in 2022, they have never been put to the legal test.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/texas-midwife-abortion-state-ban">Texas midwife arrested for allegedly providing abortions amid state’s near-total ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The case will also probably serve as a bellwether for the future of interstate relations between anti-abortion states and pro-abortion rights states. In the years since Roe fell, anti-abortion activists have grown increasingly frustrated over people’s ability to travel across state lines for the procedure and to undergo medication abortions through telehealth. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/05/alabama-court-hearing-abortion">Alabama has threatened to prosecute people</a> who help others travel for out-of-state abortions, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/31/new-york-louisiana-abortion-pill-charges">Louisiana has issued a criminal indictment</a> against Carpenter for allegedly prescribing an abortion pill to someone in that state.</p> <p>New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, refused Louisiana’s call for<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/13/texas-abortion-pills-shield-laws-new-york-doctor"> extradition</a>. “I will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana – not now, not ever,” she said last month.</p> <p>Carpenter has not publicly commented on the case. However, a group she co-founded, Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine Access, has accused Paxton of “putting women directly in harm’s way”.</p> <p>“Since Roe v Wade was overturned, we have seen attempts to further impede and erode a person’s right to make decisions about their own bodies,” the organization said in a statement after news of Paxton’s lawsuit against Carpenter broke.</p> <p>“Shield laws are essential in safeguarding and enabling abortion care regardless of a patient’s zip code or ability to pay. They are fundamental to ensuring everyone can access reproductive healthcare as a human right.”</p>
