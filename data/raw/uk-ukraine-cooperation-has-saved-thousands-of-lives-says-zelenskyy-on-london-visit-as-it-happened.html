 <h2 class="block-title">Round-up of national reactions to Nato's 5% target</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Let me briefly come back to <strong>the new Nato 5% target</strong> and <strong>the confusion surrounding Spain. </strong>(<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/23/eu-foreign-ministers-meeting-volodymyr-zelenskyy-nato-europe-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-68591b8d8f0808294ac4bd3d#block-68591b8d8f0808294ac4bd3d">11:33</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/23/eu-foreign-ministers-meeting-volodymyr-zelenskyy-nato-europe-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-6859569f8f08e30f42e0e4f6#block-6859569f8f08e30f42e0e4f6">15:31</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/23/eu-foreign-ministers-meeting-volodymyr-zelenskyy-nato-europe-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-685969738f087a952d119d89#block-685969738f087a952d119d89">16:53</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/23/eu-foreign-ministers-meeting-volodymyr-zelenskyy-nato-europe-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-685968c48f08c5412c19783c#block-685968c48f08c5412c19783c">16:55</a>).</p> 
  <p>In the last few hours we have heard from a number of other countries as they publicly stated their position on the target, so let’s give you a quick roundup here.</p> 
  <p><strong>Germany:</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Germany plans to raise its defence budget to 3.5 percent of GDP over the next five years,</strong> government sources told AFP, which would <strong>match a new Nato target</strong> for core military spending.</p> 
  <p>Defence spending will increase from 2.4 percent of gross domestic product this year, the sources said, as <strong>Europe’s top economy takes steps to bolster its armed forces</strong> due to the growing threat from Russia and under pressure from US president Donald Trump.</p> 
  <p>The extra military outlays have been made possible after Chancellor Friedrich Merz pushed changes to Germany’s strict “debt brake” through parliament that largely exempt defence spending from the rules, AFP noted.</p> 
  <p><strong>Italy:</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Italy will fully comply with a new Nato spending target of 5%</strong> of gross domestic product on defence and security, prime minister <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong> said in comments reported by Reuters.</p> 
  <p>“These are <strong>important commitments that Italy intends to honour.</strong> We will not leave our country weak and unable to defend itself,” Meloni told lawmakers ahead of EU and Nato summits.</p> 
  <p>Meloni said Italy had reached the old NATO 2% of GDP target this year, adding it would have 10 years until 2035 to increase the defence spending by a further 1.5 percentage points, AFP reported.</p> 
  <p><strong>Slovakia:</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Slovakia has to reserve the right to decide how fast to raise spending towards Nato’s new targets</strong> for 2035 and <strong>any increase in outlays next year will go to dual-use projects</strong> like roads and hospitals, prime minister <strong>Robert Fico</strong> said.</p> 
  <p>Reuters reported that Fico said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Slovakia has other priorities than armament in the coming years, at a time of healing public budgets and catching up with the average EU living standard …</em></p> 
   <p><em>“Slovakia must, similar to Spain, reserve the sovereign right to decide at what pace and in what structure it is prepared to increase the Defence Ministry budget with the aim of achieving the NATO target in 2035.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Fico’s comments come just days after he suggested Slovakia would benefit from becoming a neutral country, and opening the prospect of leaving Nato.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">EU wants 'standstill clause' to guard industries from Trump surprises, trade commissioner says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <strong>EU is demanding a “standstill clause” in any trade deal with the US</strong> to guard industries against any future threats by <strong>Donald Trump</strong> to improve tariffs on exports from the bloc during this four year term.</p> 
  <p>European trade commissioner <strong>Maroš Šefčovič</strong> told the Berlin conference of the German industry association BDI, that <strong>talks were now centring on general tariff levels, sectoral tariffs and an insurance policy</strong> to protect against Trump whims.</p> 
  <p>“I think it would be clearly desirable that we would come back to the reasonable level of tariffs, that <strong>we would have some kind of stand still clause</strong>, which would kind of prevent a surprise about the sudden spikes and volatility,” he said.</p> 
  <p>The EU had initially spent time going through more than 1,000 tariff lines with the US to “create an avenue” for proper negotiations, after the US initially insisted its proposed 20% reciprocal tariff against the average 2.5% tariff the EU charges on US imports.</p> 
  <p>His remarks came just hours after the German prime minister, <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong>, told the same conference that the EU’s approach to negotiations was too complicated (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/23/eu-foreign-ministers-meeting-volodymyr-zelenskyy-nato-europe-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-685978a28f08c5412c19795f#block-685978a28f08c5412c19795f">17:56</a>).</p> 
  <p>Šefčovič said unity in approach was paramount and the EU was “ready to fight tooth and nail” for the EU’s interests. </p> 
  <p>But he added: “If I have one wish, one wish here, it is “talk to us, criticise us, but support us”. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">EU's approach to US trade talks 'far too complicated,' German chancellor says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>German chancellor <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong> has <strong>criticised the European Union’s approach to trade negotiations with the United States</strong> in the first split in the bloc over the way to eliminate tariffs and a potential trade war.</p> 
  <p>The German prime minister said <strong>the negotiations led by the European Commission were “far too complicated”.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking at a conference hosted by the German confederation of industries, BDI, <strong>Merz suggested the EU’s efforts should be concentrated on “four or five major industries”</strong> including cars, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and machinery.</p> 
  <p><strong>Germany’s trade relationship with the US</strong> in both directions <strong>is worth €253bn</strong> but it sells more to the US, including cars than it imports, making it, along with Ireland and Belgium which have major pharmaceutical exports to the US, among the most vulnerable in terms of tariffs.</p> 
  <p>Trump has already imposed a 10% tariff on all exports from the EU and has threatened tariffs of up to 50% on EU exports unless he gets a deal by 9 July.</p> 
  <p>Last week on his journey back from the G7 summit in Canada, he warned that sectoral tariffs on pharma were coming “very soon”.</p> 
  <p>Irish finance minister <strong>Paschal Donohoe</strong> said US pharmaceutical tariffs are a key concern as they could cost thousands of pharma jobs in Ireland. </p> 
  <p>“The macroeconomic modelling we’ve done for the Irish economy would indicate <strong>that there could be approximately 75,000 jobs that could be affected by it</strong> across the medium term,” he told a Bloomberg conference in Dublin.</p> 
  <p>The European trade commissioner <strong>Maroš Šefčovič</strong> is talking at the same conference later.</p>

  <p>“That is the main objective today – to save as many lives as possible. <strong>To stop Russian terror.</strong> To force Russia to think about peace, not about expanding the war., he said.</p> 
  <p>In his post, <strong>he called for “maximum political and diplomatic coordination,”</strong> and closer work on “joint defence projects and weapons production.”</p> 
  <p>He also <strong>reiterated his call to introduce further sanctions on Russia</strong> “to make it really impossible to scale up the Russian weapons production.”</p> 
  <p>He says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>“All companies and individuals engaged in this must be sanctioned – at the very least – in the key jurisdictions of the world.</p> 
   <p>Currently, most of the companies involved in the production of the “Oreshnik” system are not under sanctions. We will correct that.</p> 
   <p>Cooperation with Russian weapons manufacturers is a crime against peace.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Guardian’s <strong>Jennifer Rankin</strong> asks about what specific actions will be taken, prompting the EU’s Kallas to say “our main concern is the humanitarian aid distribution.”</p> 
  <p>She adds that the air “does not reach people” that need it.</p> 
  <p>She sidesteps the question on specific measures saying “you can see what are the measures deriving from the association agreement,” and says the key thing is what the member states will be able to agree on.</p> 
  <p>She adds:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Right now, the most important thing is to improve the situation on the ground, improve the lives of people in Palestine, and stop the suffering and also human toll that we see there every day clearly.”</em></p>

  <p>Kallas then also gets asked about <strong>Georgia</strong>, and that concludes the press conference.</p>

  <p>Asked further about Israel, Kallas says ministers held <strong>“a very extensive and intense discussion”</strong> on that point and they agreed on the need to improve the situation on the ground in the Gaza strip.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“We will contact Israel to… look how we can improve the situation on the ground, because that is the focus of the member states.”</em></p>

  <p>She says the review was “very clear” that Israel has been breaching the Article 2 of the EU-Israel association agreement and it is necessary to push for “concrete improvements for the people and the lives of people in Gaza.”</p> 
  <p>“If the situation does not improve, then we can discuss also further measures and come back to this in July,” she says.</p> 
  <p>Here is <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/archives/delegations/israel/documents/eu_israel/asso_agree_en.pdf">the Article 2</a>:</p>

  <p>In her opening statement, <strong>EU’s Kallas </strong>goes through a number of issues, so let’s cover them briefly.</p> 
  <p>On <strong>Iran</strong>, she says “the new war is dangerous development,” as she stressed that “<strong>the EU has always said that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon</strong> as it would be a threat to international security.”</p> 
  <p>But she adds that <strong>“military actions are always fraught with risks and uncertainties,”</strong> as she says “what matters now is <strong>minimising the risk of further escalation.”</strong></p> 
  <p>She then turns to <strong>Ukraine</strong>, saying it <strong>remains “the top priority,”</strong> as she urged countries to “respond by strength” to Russia’s continued aggression.</p> 
  <p>She also adds a separate <strong>warning on Russia’s “hybrid warfare against European countries.”</strong></p> 
  <p>On <strong>China</strong>, she notes the country’s role as <strong>“the key enabler of Russia’s war against Ukraine,”</strong> its “coercive trade practices” and cyber-attacks on European countries, which all “make it increasingly hard to continue as before” in bilateral relations.</p> 
  <p>On <strong>Israel</strong>, she says ministers discussed the review of Israel’s compliance under the EU-Israel association agreement, stressing “our first goal is to change the situation on the ground.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Spain's view on Nato target 'flexibility'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>According to Spanish government sources, Rutte’s letter to Sánchez has made it quite clear what the position is. The key phrase in all this is <strong>“capability target”</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Here’s the <strong>Rutte</strong> quote in question <a href="https://x.com/sanchezcastejon/status/1936860509829271639">from the letter</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“I can hereby confirm that the agreement at the upcoming Nato Summit will give Spain the flexibility to determine its own sovereign path for reaching the Capability Target goal and the annual resources necessary as a share of GDP, and to submit its own annual plans.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The basis of <strong>Spain’s argument rests on the word “flexibility”</strong> and on the make-up of that 5% proposal. Under Rutte’s proposed scheme, member states would agree to raise defence spending to 3.5% of their GDP and commit a further 1.5% to wider security spending.</p> 
  <p>The Spanish government sources argue that the 3.5% on core defence spending will actually vary from country to country – eg it will cost some countries more than 3.5% of their GDP to meet the capability target and some less.</p> 
  <p>They say <strong>Spain’s military chiefs have been over all this with a fine-tooth comb</strong> and have concluded that Spain can meet the “capability target” and thus <strong>fulfil its Nato responsibilities by spending 2.1% of GDP.</strong></p> 
  <p>The sources point out that Spain has its own defence industry, so, unlike other countries, doesn’t have to pay top dollar when it wants to buy planes or warships, hence that 2.1% figure.</p> 
  <p>Sánchez referenced that point in a speech yesterday afternoon, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Consider, for example, that in some countries the average salary of a soldier is three times higher than in other countries that are also Nato members, or that producing or acquiring these defence capabilities in some countries costs half as much as in others.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The sources stress that Spain isn’t committing to percentages but to the capability target, as per Rutte’s reply letter.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It is worth noting <strong>Rutte’s</strong> comments that <strong>Nato believes Spain must allocate at least 3.5% of its GDP</strong> to meet its capability targets, firmly stating <strong>there would be “no opt-outs” or “side deals.”</strong></p> 
  <p>This rhetoric stands in <strong>sharp contrast to earlier messaging from Madrid</strong>, raising the possibility of emerging tensions or diverging interpretations within the alliance.</p> 
  <p>Expect this to pop up as an issue again during the actual summit.</p>

  <p>“And that is why Nato has said Iran should not and this is a consistent position of Nato,” he says.</p> 
  <p>In a passing comment, he also rejects a suggestion that the US attack on Iranian targets was a violation of international law.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Natos’s Rutte says that all members now meet the 2% target agreed in 2014 at the alliance’s summit in Wales.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>So we have made crucial progress in the last five, six months, but our security environment has changed, and not for the better. </em></p>

  <p>He says the Hague summit will “introduce a new baseline” of 5% of GDP to be spent on defence.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>“This is a quantum leap that is ambitious, historic and fundamental to securing our future.”</em></p>

  <p><strong>Italy</strong> has <strong>frozen Russian oligarchs’ assets valued at around €2.3bn ($2.64bn)</strong> since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, data provided by Italian authorities show, with the most recent seizures occurring at the beginning of the month, Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p>Italy seized assets – including <strong>bank accounts, luxury villas, yachts and cars</strong> – as part of the European Union’s sanctions against the Kremlin and its backers.</p> 
  <p>The Bank of Italy had said that at the end of June 2023 their value amounted to $2.5bn.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Europeans back higher defence spending amid Russia threat, poll finds</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Faced with an unpredictable <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and an aggressive <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>Europeans favour increased spending on defence and, in some countries, compulsory military service.</strong></p> 
  <p>A <a href="https://ecfr.eu/publication/trumps-european-revolution/">survey of 12 countries</a> for the European Council on Foreign Relations showed <strong>majorities for increased defence spending</strong> in <strong>Poland</strong> (70%), <strong>Denmark</strong> (70%) and <strong>the UK</strong> (57%).</p> 
  <p>Support was softer elsewhere, but large minorities in <strong>Germany</strong> (47%), <strong>Spain</strong> (46%) and <strong>France</strong> (45%) also backed bigger military budgets. <strong>Italy</strong> was an outlier: only 17% favoured higher spending, with 57% against.</p> 
  <p>Europeans in several countries <strong>supported reintroducing mandatory military service</strong>, with the crucial exception of 18- to 29-year-olds – those most likely to be called up in any armed conflict. People in France (62%), Germany (53%) and Poland (51%) were the strongest supporters of military service.</p> 
  <p>Opposition to the idea outweighed support in countries including Italy (50% against), the UK (53%), Spain (56%) and <strong>Hungary</strong> (58%).</p> 
  <p>Older people were keenest on the draft. In Germany, for example, a net total of 49% of over-70s supported military service, while a net total of 46% of 18- to 29-year-olds opposed the idea.</p>

  <p>The research also found <strong>the European public divided sharply over Trump</strong>, whose return to the US presidency has scrambled traditional allegiances to Washington. Countries with traditionally strong ties with the US are becoming increasingly sceptical of the US system: in the UK and Germany, majorities of 74% and 67% think it is broken.</p> 
  <p>European far-right parties, which often took inspiration from <strong>Vladimir Putin’s</strong> Russia, now look to Trump’s system as a model, the authors suggest. In contrast, voters for mainstream parties are critical of Trump and the US political system.</p> 
  <p>Far-right and national populist allegiance to Trump exists, despite sizeable minorities of voters for those parties seeing his re-election as bad news for Americans. For instance, 34% of <strong>AfD</strong> voters in Germany, 28% of France’s <strong>National Rally</strong> supporters and 30% of <strong>Reform UK</strong> voters consider Trump’s re-election as “very bad” or “rather bad” for Americans.</p>

  <p><strong>Belgium</strong> said it was <strong>seeking “maximum flexibility” from Nato on ramped-up defence spending targets</strong> to be agreed at a summit this week after fellow laggard Spain insisted it had won an exception, AFP reported.</p> 
  <p>Belgian foreign minister <strong>Maxime Prevot</strong> told local media that while Brussels had to show “willingness to get back in line” after years of underspending, <strong>the target was beyond its “budgetary reach”.</strong></p> 
  <p>“We may not have done so by making a noisy statement like Spain, but I can assure you that for weeks our diplomats <strong>have been working hard to obtain the flexibility mechanisms</strong> … that could help to lighten the burden of the Belgian effort,” he told RTBF radio. “We’re asking for maximum flexibility”.</p> 
  <p>But a Nato diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity told AFP there was “no opt-out”.</p> 
  <p>“It is always the case that allies have the sovereign right to determine how they’ll deliver on their commitments,” the diplomat said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Nato win provides Spain's Sanchez much-needed win at politically perilous time - snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Pedro Sánchez’s</strong> success in negotiating an <strong>exemption for Spain over Nato’s proposal</strong> for member states to increase their defence spending to 5% of their GDP (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/23/eu-foreign-ministers-meeting-volodymyr-zelenskyy-nato-europe-latest-updates-news?page=with%3Ablock-6858fc5d8f08c39b90a6c70d#block-6858fc5d8f08c39b90a6c70d">9:22</a>) <strong>provides the embattled PM with a much-needed win at a perilous time.</strong></p> 
  <p>Faced with an apparently ever-growing list of corruption allegations that threaten his minority coalition government, <strong>Sánchez has been able to demonstrate that he still has the clout to defend Spain’s national interest</strong> and safeguard its welfare state spending.</p>

  <p>The socialist prime minister <strong>has been blunt in his appraisal</strong> of what the 5% commitment would mean for Spain, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Going from 2% to 5% by 2035 would require spending an additional €350bn, which could only be achieved by raising taxes for each worker by approximately €3,000 annually; eliminating unemployment, sickness, and maternity benefits; reducing all pensions by 40%; or halving state investment in education.”</em></p>

  <p>Little wonder, then, that <strong>he was so keen to trumpet the win during a televised “institutional statement” on Sunday evening.</strong> The issue may help reassure his allies in the small, leftwing Sumar alliance that he won’t be dictated to by Nato – or Donald Trump – and that the welfare state will take precedence over defence spending.</p> 
  <p>Unsurprisingly, <strong>Alberto Núñez Feijóo</strong>, the leader of the opposition, conservative People’s party (PP) has hit back over the deal, questioning its true worth. In <a href="https://x.com/NunezFeijoo/status/1936847687476777141">a post on X last night</a>, Feijóo accused Sánchez of propaganda and of making promises he won’t have to keep.</p> 
  <p>“Propaganda aside, <strong>what Sánchez just said is that he’s going to commit to military spending for the next ten years</strong>, without a budget and without going through Congress,” said the PP leader. “In other words, he’s agreed that Spain will pay, but only after he’s gone.”</p> 
  <p>Sánchez <strong>responded with what could be seen as a patronising jibe</strong> at Feijóo’s lack of English skills.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://x.com/sanchezcastejon/status/1936860509829271639">a post in reply</a>, he shared Nato secretary general <strong>Mark Rutte’s</strong> letter, adding:</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Let’s stop for a moment on that <strong>question of the EU-Israel association agreement</strong>, which sees Spain calling for immediate suspension of the deal, while Germany appears to be distancing itself from it.</p> 
  <p>Here’s a good primer on the issue from our Brussels correspondent <strong>Jennifer Rankin.</strong></p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>The EU has said <strong>“there are indications” that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> is in breach of human rights obligations over its conduct in Gaza</strong>, but stopped short of calling for immediate sanctions.</em></p> 
   <p><em>“There are indications that Israel would be in breach of its human rights obligations under article 2 of the EU-Israel association agreement,” states a leaked document from the EU’s foreign policy service, seen by the Guardian.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Couched in the typically cautious language of Brussels, <strong>the document nevertheless represents a significant moment in Europe’s relations towards a longstanding ally.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>The closely guarded paper, which will be presented by the EU foreign policy chief, <strong>Kaja Kallas</strong>, to European foreign ministers on Monday, <strong>cites assessments by the international court of justice, the office of the high commissioner for human rights, and numerous other UN bodies</strong>, while saying that it does not represent “a value judgment” by any EU official.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>The finding has been seen as a foregone conclusion</strong> since a review of the EU-Israel agreement was put on the agenda last month by 17 EU member states, led by the Netherlands, a traditional ally of Israel.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>France’s foreign minister <strong>Jean-Noël Barrot</strong> has <strong>warned against any attempts to force regime change in Iran</strong>, while noting his country’s concern about escalation of the Middle East conflict that he said could be “devastating” for the region with very serious consequences for global stability.</p> 
  <p>Arriving at a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Barrot called on Iran not to take action to aggravate the situation, adding that <strong>Iran’s nuclear programme was “an existential risk” for Israel, the wider region and Europe.</strong> </p>

  <p>She said that <strong>Iran’s</strong> decision to close the Strait of Hormuz “is something that would be extremely dangerous and not good for anybody.”</p> 
  <p>She also said the summit will discuss the association agreement with <strong>Israel</strong>, with the EU’s review ready for discussion, and Israel submitting its response.</p> 
  <p>On <strong>Ukraine</strong>, she said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“… while our eyes are on what is happening in Iran and the Middle East, there are people dying and in Kyiv, because Russia is keeping the bombs and bombing Ukraine every single day.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said the focus was on agreeing further military and ammunition support for Ukraine and “pushing” for the 18th package of sanctions.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Putin is a warmaker,' Ukrainian minister says after attacks on Kyiv</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Ukrainian foreign minister <strong>Andrii Sybiha</strong> is taking part in this morning’s EU foreign affairs council.</p> 
  <p>In his opening comments, he worried about <strong>“another sleepless night in Kyiv”</strong> with another Russian “heavy missile attack on Ukrainian civilian targets.”</p> 
  <p>“<strong>That’s the real response of the Russian side to all peace efforts</strong>, all peace proposals,” he said.</p> 
  <p><strong>“Putin is a warmaker,”</strong> he warned, adding it was the time “to engage all diplomatic instruments to <strong>raise the price for further Russian aggression”</strong> and “to force Russia to peace.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Spain calls for suspending EU-Israel association agreement</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Spain’s <strong>Albares</strong> also called for <strong>an immediate suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement</strong>, saying “the times of words and declarations is behind” and adding that “Palestinians in Gaza have no more time to lose.”</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“If the association agreement is based on human rights, <strong>it’s the most normal thing that we suspend immediately today that association agreement</strong> and that we move forward. </em></p> 
   <p><em>That’s why I will ask for the suspension of the association agreement, <strong>an embargo of selling weapons to Israel</strong>, and enlarging the list of people that are being sanctioned to everyone that wants to be a spoiler of the two-state solution.”</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Spanish minister added that Europe “must show courage in favour of peace, of international law” and defend the values it is meant to stand up for.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Spain reaches agreement with Nato on 5% defence spending, minister says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Spanish foreign minister <strong>José Manuel Albares </strong>is among the first to arrive at the foreign affairs council in Brussels.</p> 
  <p>He says that over the weekend, <strong>Spain has reached an agreement with Nato on the proposed 5% defence spending commitment </strong>to be adopted at this week’s summit, after prime minister Pedro Sánchez harshly criticised it as “unreasonable” and “unproductive”.</p> 
  <p>By the sound of it, the fix relies on <strong>changing the wording to make it sound like Spain agrees with the ambition, but is not bound by the percentage – as long as it meets its obligations in another way.</strong></p> 
  <p>Albares said <strong>Spain remained “fully committed”</strong> on “unity and the European and Euro-Atlantic security,” with “a historic number of Spanish soldiers on the eastern flank” of Nato.</p> 
  <p>But, he said, “we think that the debate must not be around percentage, but capabilities,” and that <strong>Spain can meet its obligations spending less, around 2.1%.</strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: What's Europe's position?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>EU foreign ministers</strong> are meeting this morning in <strong>Brussels</strong> to talk about the bloc’s position on <strong>Ukraine</strong> and <strong>Russia</strong> and the worsening crisis in <strong>the Middle East.</strong></p> 
  <p>The foreign affairs council kicks off what some dubbed a “super week” in European – and not only – politics, with <strong>the Nato summit</strong> in The Hague and <strong>the European Council summit</strong> later this week.</p> 
  <p>And there’s plenty to talk about.</p> 
  <p>Today’s meeting starts with <strong>Ukraine</strong>, after <strong>another night of heavy Russian attacks</strong> with 352 drones and 16 missiles reported by the country’s air force, mostly targeting <strong>Kyiv</strong>. At least six were killed, and over a dozen were injured.</p> 
  <p>Ukrainian president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> said that “preliminary reports indicate that ballistic weapons from <strong>North Korea</strong> were also used.”</p> 
  <p>“Everyone in countries neighbouring Russia, Iran, and North Korea should be thinking carefully about whether they could protect lives if <strong>this coalition of murderers</strong> persists and continues spreading their terror,” he warned.</p> 
  <p><strong>Zelenskyy will be in Britain today</strong> for further talks on “new and powerful steps to increase pressure on Russia for this war and to put an end to the strikes.”</p> 
  <p>The EU ministers will then turn to the <strong>Middle East</strong>, likely calling for a return to negotiations and the need to avoid further escalation.</p> 
  <p>A big discussion is also expected on potentially triggering a review of <strong>the EU-Israel association agreement</strong>, but will they want to do this amid escalating and uncertain situation in the region?</p> 
  <p>Elsewhere, I will be checking on the latest in the buildup to the Nato summit, and other updates from <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>Norway</strong>, <strong>Sweden</strong> and <strong>Romania</strong> among others.</p> 
  <p>It’s <strong>Monday, 23 June 2025</strong>, it’s <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> here, and this is <strong>Europe Live.</strong></p> 
  <p>Good morning.</p>
