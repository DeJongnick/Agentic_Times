<p>Good morning.</p> 
<p>Israel’s defence minister has said he ordered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/israel-attacks-irans-arak-heavy-water-reactor-as-iran-hits-israeli-hospital">increased attacks on government targets</a> in Iran to “undermine the regime”, while an Iranian missile evaded Israeli air defences to hit a hospital in the country’s south.</p> 
<p>Other missiles landed around Tel Aviv, injuring at least 40 people, as Israeli planes bombed a heavy-water reactor and returned to strike the Natanz nuclear complex. The comments from Israel Katz were the first time that regime change had officially been claimed as a goal of the seven-day-old war.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump said he had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/iran-threatens-us-with-irreparable-damage-if-trump-joins-war">not decided whether to take his country into Israel’s new war</a>, as Iran’s supreme leader said the US would face “irreparable damage” if it deployed its military to attack.</p>

 <li><p><strong>How is Israel’s military strategy shifting? </strong>When Israel launched its first strikes, Benjamin Netanyahu said he had ordered a strategic operation targeting Iran’s nuclear programme, although the Israeli prime minister has made no secret of his hopes that the government in Tehran would fall. After the initial focus on military and nuclear sites, Israel recently attacked targets with no links to the nuclear project, but which Katz described as “symbols of the regime”, including the state broadcaster.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>What is the latest on the conflict?</strong> Israel attacked Iran’s Arak heavy-water reactor early on Thursday, Iranian state television reported. In Israel, Soroka hospital in Beersheba was hit by a ballistic missile, Israeli officials said, after Iran launched its latest wave of retaliatory airstrikes. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jun/19/israel-iran-conflict-live-hospital-in-southern-israel-hit-in-iran-missile-strike-say-israeli-officials">Read our live blog here</a>.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Supreme court upholds Tennessee ban on youth gender-affirming care</strong></h2> 
<p>A Tennessee state law banning gender-affirming care for minors can stand, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/18/tennessee-supreme-court-gender-affirming-care-skrmetti">the supreme court has ruled</a>, a devastating loss for trans rights supporters in a case that could set a precedent for dozens of other lawsuits involving the rights of transgender children.</p> 
<p>The case, United States v Skrmetti, was filed last year by three families of trans children and a provider of gender-affirming care. In oral arguments, the plaintiffs, as well as the US government, then helmed by Joe Biden, argued that Tennessee’s law constituted sex-based discrimination and thus violated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment.</p> 
<p>Under Tennessee’s law, someone assigned female at birth could not be prescribed testosterone, but someone assigned male at birth could receive those drugs.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>The ruling is part of wider pushback on trans rights.</strong> In recent years, the question of transgender children and their rights has consumed an outsized amount of rightwing political discourse. Since 2021,<strong> </strong>26 states have passed bans on gender-affirming care for minors, affecting nearly 40% of trans youth in the US. Twenty-six states have also outlawed trans kids from playing on sports teams that correspond with their gender identity.</p></li>
