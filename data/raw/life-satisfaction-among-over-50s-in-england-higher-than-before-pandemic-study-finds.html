<p>People 50 and over in England have greater life satisfaction and sense life is more worthwhile than before the Covid pandemic, although depression is more common, researchers have found.</p> <p>Prof Paola Zaninotto, first author of the research from University College London, said the study showed wellbeing and mental health worsened between the early stages of the pandemic and later in 2020, contrary to some reports. However, this situation subsequently improved.</p> <p>“It is good to see the positive wellbeing has gone back to normal or even better than normal,” Zaninotto said, although levels of depression in older adults still higher than before the pandemic suggest more help is needed, she added.</p> <p>Writing <a href="http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13607863.2025.2450260">in the journal Aging &amp; Mental Health</a>, Zaninotto and colleagues report how they analysed data from the <a href="https://www.elsa-project.ac.uk/">English Longitudinal Study of Ageing</a> – a continuing research project involving a nationally representative group of people aged 50 and older.</p> <p>In particular, they looked at survey data collected before the pandemic, in mid 2020 and then late 2020, and again from late 2021 onwards, allowing researchers to explore the psychological impact of the crisis.</p> <p>The results, based on responses from about 4,000 participants, reveal levels of happiness, life satisfaction and the feeling life is worthwhile all fell as the pandemic began, with a further decrease in late 2020.</p> <p>However these levels bounced back in subsequent surveys, with the average scores for life satisfaction and a sense that life is worthwhile higher than before the pandemic.</p> <p>By contrast the estimated proportion of participants with depression increased in the early stages of the pandemic, climbing from 11.4% to 19.3%, before rising to 27.2% in late 2020. While prevalence fell in subsequent surveys it remained above pre-pandemic levels at 14.9%.</p> <p>The team found rebounds in positive wellbeing and depression were generally less pronounced among those aged 75 and over, while measures of positive wellbeing were consistently lower for participants aged 50–59 at all time points compared with older groups. Participants in their 50s also experienced the greatest increase in the estimated prevalence of depression during the height of the pandemic.</p> <p>“There are lots of midlife stressors for this age group, including, for example, financial responsibilities,” said Zaninotto, adding people in their 50s also often experience work and caring-related pressures.</p> <p>The researchers add the prevalence of depression was consistently higher, and measures of positive wellbeing consistently lower, in the poorest participants, during all waves of the survey.</p> <p>However declines in positive wellbeing during the height of the pandemic were greatest for those in medium- and high-wealth groups, with these groups also showing a greater rebound in later surveys.</p> <p>“We speculated that is probably because they couldn’t do the things that maybe brought them more satisfaction or happiness, such as going to theatre, socialising and all that, whereas the people [who are] less affluent don’t have as much of those things so maybe they, in terms of disruption to their lifestyle, didn’t suffer as much,” said Zaninotto.</p> <p>Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said “It is encouraging, and perhaps unsurprising, that as the pandemic receded, older people felt more psychologically well.”</p> <p>But she said it was concerning that the study suggested the older you are, the smaller the improvements in positive wellbeing and rates of depression, and that, in general, rates of depression in older people were above pre-pandemic levels. She also highlighted a previous Age UK report that your chances of being treated for mental health problems reduces in later life.</p> <p>“This report is a reminder that there is a lot to be positive about in later life, despite stereotypes about decline and misery,” Abrahams said. “However, we must also take mental health in older people seriously, making sure that those that can benefit from treatment are able to access it.”</p>
