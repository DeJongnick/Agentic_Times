    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:A - De Rossi printed those words on his armband when he was made Roma captain. Cobolli is a lifelong Roma fan who spent five years at the club’s academy in his youth before pursuing professional tennis., 2:C - Pavlyuchenkova complained bitterly about the mistake, suggesting that the decision had gone Kartal’s way as “she’s local”. , 3:B - Pete Sampras won the last of his seven titles and Serena Williams won the first of her five. , 4:C - Canada won the tournament in 2000. They were a bit lucky to reach the final; their group finished in a tie and they only made it through to the knockout rounds by winning a coin toss., 5:D - It was a strange game. It was 0-0 after 77 minutes but, by full-time, two PSG players had scored (Désiré Doué and Ousmane Dembélé) and two had been sent off (Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernández)., 6:B - Romelu Lukaku and Kai Havertz scored their goals in a 2-1 win. , 7:B - The 24-year-old signed for Zrinjski Mostar a few weeks ago – in time to play in their Champions League qualifiers. “I just took a risk and I trusted God,” he says. “Any time I’ve watched Champions League football, I’ve always said to myself: ‘I will get there one way or another.”, 8:C - The other three are fictional places., 9:D - McDowell grew up in Portrush, Clarke lives there and McIlroy set the course record at the club when he was 16, but they were all beaten by Lowry at the Open in 2019. , 10:C - Taylor has won their two previous fights, although both were controversial decisions – especially the second., 11:B - The hosts or reigning champions usually kick off major tournaments. Not this one. , 12:C - She has played more games and scored most goals than any other Wales international – male or female. Gareth Bale is second on both counts, with 111 caps and 41 goals. , 13:D - Shankly enjoyed 16 years at the club as a player, winning the FA Cup and the Football League War Cup. , 14:B - The tour was a disaster for the team but Farrell emerged from it with great credit, as Phil Larder, the team’s coach at the time, later recalled: “Andy wasn’t somebody I had identified to be captain but, as the tour developed, it was obvious he was the leader. He was the one they all looked up to and he was playing exceptionally well. He became my captain. Andy has presence. If he walks into a room, he seems to attract people to him. Players latch on to that.", 15:C - When asked why he did not try to beat the record, Mulder replied: “Firstly, I thought we’d got enough and we needed to bowl. And secondly Brian Lara is a legend, let’s be real. He got 400 against England and for someone of that stature to keep that record is pretty special.</p>
