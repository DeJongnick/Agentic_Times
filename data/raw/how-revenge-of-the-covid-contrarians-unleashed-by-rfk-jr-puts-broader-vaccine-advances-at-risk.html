<p>The US health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, entered office with a pledge to tackle the US’s chronic disease epidemic and give infectious disease a “break”. In at least one of those goals, Kennedy has been expeditious.</p> <p>Experts said as Kennedy makes major cuts in public health in his first weeks in office, the infrastructure built to mitigate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid-19</a> has become a clear target – an aim that has the dual effect of weakening immunization efforts as the US endures the largest measles outbreak <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/22/health/measles-southwest-outbreak.html">since 2000</a>.</p> <p>“If his goal is to undermine public health infrastructure, he’s making strides there,” said Dorit Reiss, a University of California Law School professor whose research focuses on vaccine law. “If his goal is combating chronic diseases – he’s not doing very well.”</p> <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been characterized by upheaval since Kennedy and the billionaire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>’s unofficial “department of government efficiency” (Doge) cumulatively axed 20,000 jobs – roughly a quarter of the 82,000-person workforce.</p> <p>And it appears that turmoil will continue: a leaked budget memo shows the administration poised to propose a budget cut of another <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/16/hhs-budget-cut-trump/">$40bn</a>, or roughly one-third of the department’s discretionary spending.</p> <p>Amid the cuts, attacks on Covid-19 infrastructure have proven thematic, and show the administration’s hostility toward work that once mitigated the virus. That’s included attacking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding">promising vaccine platforms</a> and elevating once-ostracized voices to high-level roles.</p> <p>“The Covid-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago,” a spokesperson for HHS told the Guardian in response to questions about its strategy.</p> <p>“HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to address our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.”</p> <p>Gregg Gonsalves, a Yale University associate professor and infectious disease epidemiologist, calls this strategy the “revenge of the Covid contrarians”.</p> <p>“They’re not interested in the science, they’re interested in their conclusions and having the science bend to their will,” said Gonsalves. “They want to create a Potemkin village of their own making that looks like science but has nothing to do with science at all.”</p> <p>Among Kennedy’s changes: attacks on the promising platform that supported Covid-19 vaccine development, delayed approval of a Covid-19 vaccine, the clawing back of grants that provided local immunization support and studied vaccine safety, and elevating one-time critics of Covid-19 policy.</p> <p>“When the new administration came in, we were hearing even within the organization: ‘We can’t say Covid, we’re not allowed to say Covid,’” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials (Naccho), about her members’ conversations.</p> <p>Freeman noted that “we kind of saw the writing on the wall a couple months ago that: ‘OK, they really don’t want anything Covid-related to be pursued any more.’ Everything Covid-related is quite honestly at risk.”</p> <p>In the latest change, Kennedy said this week he may remove Covid-19 shots from the childhood vaccine schedule, which would probably make the shots harder to get by limiting insurance coverage.</p> <p>“The recommendation for children was always dubious,” Kennedy told <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/rfk-jr-questions-universal-covid-shots-for-american-children/">Fox News</a>. Although a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/index.html#:~:text=Estimates%20of%20vaccination%20coverage%20are%20based%20on%20respondent%20self%2Dreport,definitely%20will%20get%20a%20vaccine.">minority</a> of children are vaccinated, the shots <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7126e2.htm">are recommended</a>, especially for immune-compromised children.</p> <p>Freeman believes the desire to erase the government’s Covid legacy led to HHS’s decision to claw back <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/rfk-hhs-layoffs-lawsuit">$11bn</a> in public health funds from states and localities. In effect done overnight, the clawback gave local officials only hours to lay off workers, cancel immunization clinics and even stop construction projects.</p> <p>“That’s why we feel like the drawback of the funding occurred: Covid,” said Freeman.</p> <p>A spokesperson for HHS characterized this as a savings, and said most canceled awards were for Covid-19-related work.</p> <p>The pullback led to the cancellation of more than <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/hhs-layoffs-local-officials-react-rif-impacts-public-health/#:~:text=Just%20last%20week%2C%20the%20leader,Health%20and%20Human%20Services%20employees.">50 measles immunization clinics in Texas</a>, where the measles outbreak has already claimed the lives of two unvaccinated children, to pilot programs such as “Text4Vax”, which sent reminders about pediatric vaccines to parents.</p> <p>Among the canceled grants were also programs that would seem to align with Kennedy’s rhetoric about vaccine safety – among them, a study of the safety and effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in pregnant women in California and global Covid-19 vaccine safety monitoring in New Zealand.</p> <p>“If you start to take away people from health departments – the immunizers, the educators, the clinicians – through some of these other funding cuts , it disables the program naturally,” said Freeman. “You can’t put as many shots in arms.”</p> <p>Larger cancelled grants included a <a href="https://www.naccho.org/blog/articles/funding-opportunity-national-initiative-to-address-covid-19-health-disparities-among-populations-at-high-risk-and-underserved-including-racial-and-ethnic-minority-populations-and-rural-communities">$2.25bn grant</a> program to reduce Covid-19’s impact on the people worst affected, which had been sent to states and localities from South Dakota to Florida and the Virgin Islands to Vermont.</p> <p>Under Kennedy’s watch, HHS has also taken the unusual step of delaying an expected vaccine approval, reportedly under the watch of a Kennedy political appointee.</p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which sits under the umbrella of HHS, <a href="https://www.vaccineadvisor.com/news/fda-delays-final-approval-of-novavax-covid-vaccine/">delayed </a>the expected 1 April approval of the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine. Novavax confirmed to the Guardian that its application remained on hold, and said it would have “no further comments”.</p> <p>Reiss said she doesn’t think “any vaccine that’s in the pipeline is going to go forward under Kennedy” or that “he will let any vaccine go far now”.</p> <p>Dr Tracy Hoeg, a political appointee, was <a href="https://insights.citeline.com/pink-sheet/agency-leadership/us-fda/highly-problematic-acting-fda-commissioner-paused-planned-ok-of-novavax-shot-GUT6LR4X6ZALRMMZAEXYZHY36Y/">reportedly involved</a> in the decision. Hoeg also appeared as the FDA’s representative at a special advisory committee on immunizations in April, where she took the opportunity to <a href="https://insights.citeline.com/pink-sheet/vaccines/fda-special-assistant-hoegs-vaccine-concerns-on-display-at-acip-2JTYPL3VTZG5XGALPTU3QIOGPM/">question the efficacy</a> of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine.</p> <p>An HHS spokesperson told the Guardian: “The FDA’s independent review process for the Novavax vaccine, like all vaccines, is based solely on ensuring safety and efficacy, not political considerations. Any delays are a result of scientific review, not a lack of priority. It’s important to focus on the facts rather than unfounded speculation.”</p> <p>Scientists have also said they fear for the future of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-vaccine-skeptics-research-funding">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA) vaccine technology – the platform that underpinned the fast development of Covid-19 vaccines and that held promise for treating and preventing a wide range of diseases.</p> <p>Hoeg served on Florida’s <a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/about/ssg/public-health-integrity-committee/index.html">public health integrity committee</a>, which served as a platform for Covid-19 criticism during the pandemic. At the time, it was chaired by the Florida surgeon general, Dr Joseph Ladapo, who has also sown doubt about the safety and efficacy of <a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/about/ssg/public-health-integrity-committee/index.html">mRNA vaccines</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/09/health-layoff-future-science-disease">Experts fear rise in diseases as layoffs halt health research: ‘Incredibly bizarre gaslighting’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hoeg could be further buttressed by insiders such as Dr Matthew Memoli, who, <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/115114">Kennedy said</a>, “is going to be running Niaid [National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]”. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/health/nih-interim-director-memoli/index.html">Memoli</a>, whom Kennedy described as “the top flu researcher at NIH”, is known for opposition to Covid-19 vaccine mandates and declined to be vaccinated. <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/nih-grants-mrna-vaccines-trump-administration-hhs-rfk/">In March</a>, Memoli sent an email to NIH grant officials requiring any grant applications that reference mRNA technology to be reported to Kennedy’s office. He also canceled government-backed studies on vaccine hesitancy.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2025/trump-appointee-tracker/">nominee</a> for HHS general counsel, Michael B Stuart, is also well-known for involvement in vaccine fights. Stuart, a former West Virginia lawmaker, in 2023 proposed a bill to exempt virtual public school students from vaccine requirements and allow private schools to set their own requirements, according to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/18/rfk-jr-hhs-who-to-know-series-profiles-eight-key-players-federal-health-policy/c">Stat</a>.</p> <p>“Dismantling the sort of vaccine infrastructure this country relies upon – that’s been in place for several dozens and dozens of years – only impacts the chronic disease front he’s trying to ameliorate as well,” said James Hodge, a professor of law at Arizona State University and a health law expert who said he worries about the future of vaccine advisory committees. “Acquiring infectious diseases leads to chronic conditions later.”</p> <p>Still, some of Kennedy’s most ardent supporters and reported informal advisers, such as the <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/special-reports/features/113624">former cardiologist</a> Peter McCullough, have argued these actions don’t go far enough.</p> <p>“The big threat is that we still have Covid-19 vaccines on the market,” McCullough told <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/robert-f-kennedy-jr-rfk-hhs-maha-trump-tension-mrna-vaccines-chronic-disease/">KFF Health News</a>. “It’s horrendous. I would not hesitate – I would just pull it. What’s he waiting for?” McCullough did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian.</p>
