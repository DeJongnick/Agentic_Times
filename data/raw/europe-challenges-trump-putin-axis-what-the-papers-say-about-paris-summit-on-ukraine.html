<p>Headlines in European newspapers were on Tuesday dominated by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/starmer-urges-trump-to-provide-backstop-to-european-peacekeeping-force-in-ukraine">emergency meeting of leaders in Paris</a> after a week in which the US sidelined Europe and Ukraine from ceasefire negotiations and made it plain the US should not be relied upon for the region’s security.</p> <p>Monday’s meeting came a day before diplomats from the US and Russia were due to meet in Saudi Arabia to discuss ending the war in Ukraine, but ended with little unity on crucial points, including the idea of sending a European peacekeeping force to the country.</p> <p>“Europe in Trump shock”, Germany’s <strong>Handelsblatt</strong> reported, writing that even as Europeans try to find a common strategy for dealing with Russia and the US, there is “no consensus on key questions”.</p>    <p>The <strong>Süddeutsche Zeitung</strong> ran with the headline “Talks over peacekeeping troops for Ukraine”, adding that German chancellor Olaf Scholz said such a debate was “annoying and completely premature”.</p>    <p><strong>Le Monde</strong> led with “Europe challenges the Trump-Putin axis” and also carried a sub story headlined “Zelenskyy’s great solitude”, noting how the US “coup de force” had destabilised the Ukrainian president.</p>    <p><strong>Libération</strong> splashed on “Ukraine: Europe fights back”, reporting that ahead of the US-Russia meeting in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday from which they have been left out, European leaders met at the Élysée Palace in Paris to try to hash out their own peace plan for Ukraine.</p>    <p>In Spain, <strong>El Mundo</strong> headlined its main story “The European ‘urgency’ on military spending traps Sánchez”, reporting that the Spanish prime minister “admits that ‘European security’ is at stake but avoids setting a date for the investment of 2% of GDP”.</p>    <p>In the UK, the <strong>Guardian</strong> splashed on “Starmer: US ‘backstop’ vital to deter future Russian attacks on Ukraine” and reported that European leaders had also called for a “massive boost in defence spending” at the Paris meeting.</p>    <p>The <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong> led with “Germany rejects PM’s Ukraine peace plan” and wrote that “Scholz leaves leaders’ meeting early as splits emerge over deploying European troops”.</p>    <p>The <strong>Metro</strong>’s front page read “The Starm offensive” and reported “PM embarks on mission to seize ‘once in a generation moment’ for thwarting Russia”.</p>    <p>The <strong>Daily Mirror</strong> pictured Donald Trump and Keir Starmer in a face-off around the words “Test of Strength”, subheadlining its main story: “Starmer: No peace if America walks away”.</p>    <p>The <strong>Times</strong> splashed on “Ukraine needs US safety pledges, PM to tell Trump” and reported that Starmer was to say it is “time for Europe to step up on defence as part of peace deal”.</p>
