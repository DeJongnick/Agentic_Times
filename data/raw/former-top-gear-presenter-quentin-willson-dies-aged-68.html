<p>The former Top Gear presenter Quentin Willson has died after a short illness, his family said on Saturday. He was 68.</p> <p>The television presenter and motoring journalist died “peacefully surrounded by his family”, a statement said.</p> <p>Willson was one of the first hosts on the BBC motoring show, alongside Jeremy Clarkson, before he went on to front the Channel 5 programme Fifth Gear.</p> <p>He hosted Top Gear from 1991 until 2001 and went on to create and present shows including Britain’s Worst Drivers and BBC Two’s The Car’s the Star.</p> <p>The statement said: “A true national treasure, Quentin brought the joy of motoring, from combustion to electric, into our living rooms.”</p> <p>The broadcaster was an avid consumer champion, advocating for a number of campaigns including helping to freeze fuel duty with his FairFuel campaign and recently worked to make electric vehicles affordable through his <a href="https://www.faircharge.co.uk/">FairCharge campaign</a>.</p> <p>In April, he criticised the government for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/apr/22/british-motorists-save-electric-car-hybrid">changing EV rules</a> to allow more sales of cars with petrol and diesel engines until 2035, describing it as a “grave misstep”.</p> <p>The family statement added: “Long before it was fashionable, he championed the GM EV1 and the promise of electric cars, proving he was always ahead of the curve.</p> <p>“Much-loved husband to Michaela, devoted father to Mercedes, Max and Mini, and cherished grandfather to Saskia, Xander and Roxana. Quentin will be deeply missed by his family, friends, and all who knew him personally and professionally.</p> <p>“The void he has left can never be filled. His knowledge was not just learned but lived; a library of experience now beyond our reach.”</p> <p>Clarkson paid tribute with a post on X. He said: “I’m far away so I’ve only just heard that Quentin Willson has died. We had some laughs over the years. Properly funny man.”</p> <p>Fellow former Top Gear presenter James May, who appeared alongside Willson on the programme, described him as a “great bloke”. He added: “Quentin Willson gave me proper advice and encouragement during my earliest attempts at TV, back in the late 90s. I’ve never forgotten it.”</p> <p>Tiff Needell, a former presenter on Top Gear and Fifth Gear, said: “Oh Quentin how can you leave us so soon. So many memories of the @BBC_TopGear we built in the nineties that I wanted to remember with you again.</p> <p>“Please upload the film of me with him and Jeremy in the Ford Puma that so wonderfully displays the times we had together … RIP Q.”</p> <p>Willson, who was born in Leicester, wrote weekly columns for the Mirror and Sunday Mirror for 15 years and contributed to Classic Cars magazine. He was named motoring writer of the year at the British Press Awards in 2004.</p>    <p>Willson also made headlines after performing on Strictly Come Dancing in 2004 where he continues to hold the lowest score in the show’s history after receiving an eight for his cha-cha-cha with Hazel Newberry.</p> <p>Ginny Buckley, chief executive of the EV advice site Electrifying.com, said: “Quentin was a true national treasure. I was lucky to get to know him in recent years through his excellent work with FairCharge, where his passion for making electric vehicles accessible to all really shone through.</p> <p>“He was warm, generous with his knowledge and unfailingly kind. He brought the joy of motoring – from petrol to plug – into our homes and hearts, and will be greatly missed.”</p> <p>Lawrence Whittaker, owner of the racing car manufacturer Lister Cars, also paid tribute and wrote on X: “He was the architect of the Warrantywise plan and revolutionised not just the car warranty market but, through his campaigning and journalism, made the entire UK motor trade a better place.</p> <p>“He was the most knowledgeable [sic] person I ever met when it came to cars and was such a pro in front of and behind the camera. We worked closely together for over 10 years and my thoughts go out to his wife and family at this difficult time. He will be sorely missed by all.</p> <p>“God speed Q! You will be missed.”</p>
