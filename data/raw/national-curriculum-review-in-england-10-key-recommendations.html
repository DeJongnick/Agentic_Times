<p>The year-long curriculum and assessment review headed by Prof Becky Francis was asked by the government to look at primary, secondary and aged 16-19 phases of state education in England. It heard more than 7,000 responses from the public, with evidence considered by an expert panel appointed by Francis, leading to the publication of its 197-page report.</p> <p>Key recommendations include:</p>  <h2>Shorten GCSEs</h2>  <p>The length of GCSE exams should be shrunk by 10%, which could shave about three hours off for each pupil. The review found evidence that England is an international outlier in the “excessive” length and number of exams taken by its 16-year-olds, and argues that exams could be shortened without any loss of rigour.</p> <h2>Slim down GCSE content</h2>  <p>Individual GCSE subject content should be slimmed down, particularly in history and sciences, to give pupils more time for non-assessed but mandatory subjects such as PE, citizenship and relationships, sex and health education.</p> <h2>Scrap the English baccalaureate suite</h2>  <p>The English baccalaureate suite of GCSE subjects introduced by Michael Gove, which was designed to steer pupils towards eight core academic subjects but excluded arts or vocational subjects, should be scrapped. The measure has long been opposed by arts and creative educators.</p> <h2>More focus on social diversity</h2>  <p>Stronger representation should be made of “the diversity that makes up our modern society, allowing more children to see themselves in the curriculum”.</p> <h2>Expand RE</h2>  <p>Religious education should be made part of the national curriculum at all stages, taking its content out of the hands of local advisory councils. The review heard evidence that RE provision in many schools “is not good enough and does not prepare pupils adequately for life beyond school”.</p> <h2>New diagnostic test in maths and English</h2>  <p>A new diagnostic test in maths and English to support teachers in identifying gaps in pupils’ knowledge at year 8 should be introduced, ensuring more students are supported to progress successfully. Teaching unions, however, oppose such a move, and the government has recently proposed its own national reading tests to take place in year 8.</p> <h2>Statutory citizenship classes </h2>  <p>The government should introduce a statutory measure to ensure that all children are taught citizenship classes at primary school, which should include elements of financial and media literacy, and climate change and sustainability.</p> <h2>Review primary grammar teaching and testing</h2>  <p>Grammar teaching and testing in primary school should be reviewed to determine what content should be removed entirely to enable a greater focus on grammar and writing rather than grammar in theory.</p> <h2>Replace computing science GCSE</h2>  <p>The current computing science GCSE should be replaced with a broader GCSE in computing that prepares young people “for applying digital technology and data across a wide range of fields”, including the use of artificial intelligence.</p> <h2>Allow students to take ‘triple science’ at GCSE</h2>  <p>The government should introduce an entitlement that allows any student to take “triple science” of individual biology, physics and chemistry courses at GCSE, rather than double science. </p>
