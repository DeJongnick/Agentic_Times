<p>Matt Fitzpatrick’s poor start to 2025 has led the former US Open champion to dramatically part ways with the legendary caddie Billy Foster. A post on Foster’s social media account on Saturday confirmed the split, with the bag man implying the decision was Fitzpatrick’s.</p> 
<p>Rounds of 78 and 72 meant Fitzpatrick comprehensively missed the cut at the Players Championship. On six events on the PGA Tour in 2025, the Englishman has finished no higher than tied 22nd. Foster was only due to caddie at around half Fitzpatrick’s tournaments this year, including next month’s Masters, but now the relationship has ended abruptly.</p>

<p>“Well, after six great years all good things come to an end,” said Foster. “This game never stops to frustrate you and infuriate you! Unfortunately times change and ultimately it is the caddie or the coach that has to accept results are not good enough and when you stop enjoying what you are doing, it is time for a change. Thanks Matt, we had a great run and who knows where the next chapter will go. Onwards and upwards.”</p> 
<p>Foster – who previously worked for players such as Seve Ballesteros, Lee Westwood and Darren Clarke – famously had never been on the bag of a major winner during more than 40 years as a caddie. Fitzpatrick ended that run amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jun/19/matt-fitzpatrick-shows-his-class-to-win-first-major-in-tense-us-open-finish">emotional scenes at the 2022 US Open</a>. Fitzpatrick duly branded Foster as the greatest of all time. “This means the world to Billy,” said Fitzpatrick. “It’s unbelievable for him. I know it’s something he’s wanted for a long, long, long time. To do it is incredible.”</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick has a win each on the DP World and PGA Tours since his glory at Brookline but has not built on that major success in the manner many predicted. He sits 61st in the world golf rankings, with a Ryder Cup return later this year already in serious doubt. It is intriguing that Fitzpatrick does not apparently believe Foster’s experience can assist with an improvement in fortunes, however, Foster is unlikely to be short of new employment offers.</p> 
<p>A chaotic day three at Sawgrass saw JJ Spaun claim a one shot lead over Bud Cauley. Spaun’s 12-under-par aggregate sees him four clear of Rory McIlroy, who birdied the last for a 73. On a leaderboard that is otherwise noticeably short of stardust Patrick Cantlay lurks at seven under. Scottie Scheffler tossed his club away in disgust after over-hitting his approach to the 18th. Yet at minus five, Scheffler cannot be counted out quite yet.</p> 
<p>With storms forecast, final round starting times have been advanced. Competitors will complete the tournament in threes from both the 1st and 10th tees.</p>
