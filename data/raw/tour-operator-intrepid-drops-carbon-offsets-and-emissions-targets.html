<p>One of the travel industry’s most environmentally focused tour operators, Intrepid, is scrapping carbon offsets and abandoning its emissions targets as unreachable.</p> 
<p>The Australian-headquartered global travel company said it would instead invest A$2m (£980,000) a year in an audited “climate impact fund” supporting immediate practical measures such as switching to electric vehicles and investing in renewable energy.</p> 
<p>Intrepid, which specialises in small group tours, said it was stopping carbon offsets and “stepping away” from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), after having committed to 2030 goals monitored by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/11/climate-target-organisation-faces-staff-revolt-over-carbon-offsetting-plan-sbti">the climate-certification organisation</a> five years ago.</p> 
<p>In an open letter to staff, the Intrepid co-founder and chair, Darrell Wade, and the chief executive, James Thornton, said: “Intrepid, and frankly the entire travel industry, is not on track to achieve a 1.5C future, and more urgent action is required if we are to get even close.”</p> 
<p>While Intrepid’s brand focuses on the low impact of its group tours, it has long conceded that its bigger footprint is the flights its customers take to reach them, with Wade also admitting two years ago that its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/21/carbon-offsets-are-not-credible-the-travel-boss-exposing-the-truth-about-the-industrys-sustainability">offsets were “not credible”</a>.</p> 
<p>The letter blamed governments that “failed to act on ambitious policies on renewable energy or sustainable aviation fuels that support the scale of change that is required”, adding: “We are not comfortable maintaining a target that we know we won’t meet.”</p> 
<p>Thornton said the change should build trust through transparency rather than losing customers by admitting its climate pledges had not worked. He told the Guardian: “We were the first global tour operator to adopt a science-based target through the SBTi and now we’re owning the fact that it’s not working for us. We’ve always been real and transparent, which is how we build trust.”</p> 
<p>He said the fund and a new target to cut the “carbon intensity” of each trip had been developed by climate scientists and would be verified by independent auditors.</p> 
<p>Part of that attempt would be to reduce the number of long-haul flights taken by customers, Thornton said, by prioritising domestic and short-haul trips, and offering more flight-free itineraries and walking or trekking tours.</p> 
<p>Environmental campaigners have long dismissed offsets and focused on cutting flying. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/doug-parr">Doug Parr</a>, the Greenpeace UK chief scientist, said offsetting schemes had allowed “airlines and other big polluters to falsely claim green credentials while continuing to pump out emissions”.</p> 
<p>He said Greenpeace backed a frequent flyer levy, with a first flight each year tax-free to avoid taxing an annual family holiday but rising steeply with subsequent flights to deter “the binge flyers who are the main engine of growth for UK flights”.</p> 
<p>Thornton said he had seen “first-hand how important meaningful climate action is to our founders and owners, who see it as part of their legacy”, but added: “We need to be honest with ourselves that travel is not sustainable in its current format and anything suggesting otherwise is greenwashing.”</p>
