<p>Strong winds have been blamed for more than 400 drones falling from the sky into Melbourne’s Yarra River during a light show celebrating the Matildas before the Women’s World Cup.</p> 
<p>The light show, using 500 Damoda drones, was scheduled for the evening of 14 July 2023 over the river in Docklands, in Melbourne’s CBD.</p> 
<p>The drones, part of a show celebrating Australia’s women’s football team, launched at 6.30pm. Less than two minutes later many began showing critical errors indicating an autopilot failure, according to an Australian Transport Safety Bureau <a href="https://www.atsb.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-07/AO-2023-033%20-%20Final.pdf">report into the incident</a>, released this week.</p>

<p>Shortly after, pilots lost connection to the drones and they began colliding with each other, the ATSB chief commissioner, Angus Mitchell, noted in the report.</p> 
<p>The remote pilot attempted to return the drones to the launch site individually, but 427 of the 500 drones were lost, the majority falling into the Yarra.</p> 
<p>Divers were sent in to recover them, but were only able to retrieve 236 out of the 427 that entered the water, with 191 remaining unrecovered.</p> 
<p>The ATSB’s investigation found that the wind conditions at the time exceeded the drones’ capacity shortly after launch, triggering the collisions and errors.</p>

<p>“The wind limit exceedance was not identified by the [remote pilot] as they were unaware that the wind speed affecting the aircraft was displayed on the [ground control station] computer screen,” Mitchell said.</p> 
<p>The report identified the operator did not have a system to ensure all of its pilots could use the ground control station’s software features, increasing the risk of pilots failing to identify potential issues in the lead-up to the show.</p> 
<p>It also found the software did not have the functionality to actively alert a pilot to wind speed exceedances. Damoda has advised the ATSB it is considering an update to enable those alerts.</p> 
<p>“This incident demonstrates the importance of drone pilots being familiar with all functionality and data provided by relevant ground control software,” Mitchell said.</p> 
<p>“It also shows the impact human factors can have on drone operations, and how they should be actively considered and managed.”</p>
