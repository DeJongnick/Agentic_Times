<p>Britain needs to press ahead with a ban on the sale of new hybrid cars with no plug from 2030 or risk taking “a catastrophic misstep” on the road to net zero, ministers have been warned.</p> <p>Cars such as the Toyota Prius, which charge a battery from an internal combustion engine, need to be excluded from the list of vehicles sold in the UK from 2030 or there will be a “profound” fall in confidence in the government’s commitment to electric motoring, according to the representative body Electric Vehicles UK (EVUK).</p> <p>The Department for Transport (DfT) will ban the sale of new cars powered solely by internal combustion engines from 1 January 2030.</p> <p>It is consulting on what other types of new cars – such as full hybrids – can be sold between that date and the end of 2034, after which all non-zero-emission new cars will be prohibited.</p> <p>Ministers have come under huge pressure to delay the date when a full ban on non-electric cars takes place.</p> <p>Full hybrids, including the Toyota Prius, have a petrol or diesel engine as well as an electric motor powered by a battery.</p> <p>The battery is recharged by the engine rather than an external plug, and they can usually only be driven on electricity alone for a few miles and at low speeds.</p> <p>The chief executive of EVUK, Dan Caesar, said he was not opposed to new plug-in hybrids – some of which are capable of zero-emission driving over more than 50 miles – being sold between 2030 and 2035, but called for those without a plug to be banned.</p> <p>“The inclusion of full hybrid technology would be a catastrophic misstep and make a laughingstock of the UK government’s world-leading zero-emission vehicle policy,” he told the PA news agency.</p> <p>“If lobbyists do persuade government to include full hybrids it would be a big backward move.</p> <p>“The ramifications for the nascent EV industry and for fragile consumer confidence could be profound.</p> <p>“Holding the line and creating certainty around EVs has the potential to be a key measure towards revitalising a sluggish economy.”</p> <p>Dr Andy Palmer, a former chief executive of Aston Martin and ex-operating chief of Nissan, described full hybrids as “a better solution” than mild hybrids – which cannot be driven on electricity alone – but said they used “a technology that belongs to the late 1990s”.</p> <p>Under the zero-emission vehicles (Zev) mandate introduced at the start of 2024, manufacturers must sell a minimum percentage of pure electric cars each year. The threshold will rise from 22% in 2024 to 28% in 2025, and is set to reach 80% in 2030.</p> <p>The government’s consultation, which runs until 18 February, will consider more flexible deadlines after some parts of the automotive industry claimed the mandate was putting jobs on the line.</p> <p>In November, Vauxhall owner Stellantis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/26/vauxhall-owner-plans-to-shut-luton-van-factory-putting-1100-jobs-at-risk">announced the closure of its van-making factory in Luton</a>, putting 1,100 jobs at risk, and said the decision was made within the context of the “stringent” Zev mandate.<br></p> <p>A DfT spokesperson said: “We are consulting with industry on which cars, including which types of hybrid cars, can be sold alongside fully zero-emission vehicles from 2030.</p> <p>“Drivers are already embracing electric vehicles faster than ever, and 2024 was a record year for the UK new car market, with the strongest overall growth of any major European market.</p> <p>“Industry will help us shape the transition to zero-emissions vehicles in a way that works for businesses, drivers, and the environment.</p> <p>“Together we can capitalise on the clean energy transition to support thousands of jobs, make the UK a clean energy superpower, and rebuild Britain.”</p>
