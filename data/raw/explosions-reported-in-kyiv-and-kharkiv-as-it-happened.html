 <h2 class="block-title">Russia launches air attacks on Kyiv and Kharkiv hours after Ukraine says it is ready to accept ceasefire</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Ukraine said it was ready to accept an immediate 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia, as the US announced it would immediately lift its restrictions on military aid and intelligence sharing after high-stakes talks in Saudi Arabia.</p> 
  <p>Donald Trump said he now hoped <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> would reciprocate. If the Russian president did, it would mark the first ceasefire in the more than three years since he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p> 
  <p>Hours after Ukraine’s declaration, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> launched an air attack on Kyiv, with mayor Vitali Klitschko saying air defences were engaged in repelling the strikes. Strikes were also reported by the RIA news agency on Kharkiv. RIA cited the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation, which said air raid alerts were issued in Kyiv ten regions. </p> 
  <p>The agreement, announced in a joint statement after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/11/kyiv-ready-achieve-peace-crunch-us-ukraine-talks-russia">talks between senior US and Ukrainian officials</a> in Jeddah, came nearly two weeks after an Oval Office blowup between Trump and the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr<strong> </strong>Zelenskyy, that led the White House to suspend aid to Ukraine over the objections of its European allies.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Suddenly the ball is in Russia’s court. The flow of US intelligence and military aid to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> is to resume – and the Kremlin is being asked to agree to a 30-day ceasefire that Kyiv has already told the Americans it will sign up to.</p> 
   <p>It is a dizzying turnaround from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-aid-war">the Oval Office row between Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump</a> and the apparent abandonment of the White House’s strategy to simply pressurise Ukraine into agreeing to a peace deal. Now, for the first time, Russia is being asked to make a commitment, though it is unclear what will follow if it does sign up.</p> 
   <p>Announcing the peace proposal in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, the US secretary of state, said that he hoped Russia would accept a peace agreement “so we can get to the second phase of this, which is real negotiations”.</p> 
   <p>That may leave plenty of room for interpretation. Russia has also been pushing for a ceasefire, though the Kremlin had wanted that to be followed by elections in Ukraine, before any full negotiation about territory and Kyiv’s future security.</p>

  <p>US president Donald Trump said he wanted to “get this show on the road” and end the war in Ukraine after the countries agreed a plan for a 30-day ceasefire.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said: “Ukraine, ceasefire, Ukraine, ceasefire, just agreed to a little while ago.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary of the day so far</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It’s 11pm in Kyiv, midnight in Moscow and 5pm in Washington. Here’s a recap of the latest developments on the war in Ukraine:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukraine said it was ready to accept an immediate 30-day ceasefire in the war with Russia </strong>following talks with senior US officials in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. “Ukraine expressed readiness to accept the US proposal to enact an immediate, interim 30-day ceasefire, which can be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, and which is subject to acceptance and concurrent implementation by the Russian Federation,” a joint statement by the Ukrainian and US delegation said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US announced it would immediately lift its restrictions on military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. </strong>US officials said they hoped the agreement would help lead to talks to end the war. The decision came more than a week after the US cut off crucial aid to Ukraine, including deliveries of military radars and ammunition, as well as information sharing, which put significant pressure on Ukraine to agree to a US-proposed deal.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked Donald Trump and said Ukraine was committed to seeking a peace “so that war does not return”. </strong>“Ukraine is ready to accept this proposal – we see it as a positive step and are ready to take it,” Zelenskyy said. “Now, it is up to the United States to convince Russia to do the same. If Russia agrees, the ceasefire will take effect immediately.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump said he hoped Vladimir Putin would reciprocate and agree to the ceasefire proposal. </strong>Trump’s special envoy, <strong>Steve Witkoff,</strong> is expected to travel to Moscow in the coming days to propose the ceasefire to <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>. “Ukraine has agreed to it. And hopefully Russia will agree to it,” Trump told reporters. Trump also said he would welcome Zelenskyy back to the White House after their clash last month.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the ball was “now in Russia’s court” after the negotiations concluded. </strong>Rubio told reporters after the talks that he hoped Russia would say yes to the deal. “If they say no, then we’ll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace here,” he said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European leaders welcomed the news of the agreement. </strong>European Council president <strong>António Costa</strong> and European Commission president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen </strong>described the news as a “positive development” and said the EU “is ready to play its full part”. France and its partners “remain committed to a solid and lasting peace, backed by robust security guarantees for Ukraine,” president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>UK prime minister Keir Starmer also welcomed the agreement.</strong> “We now all need to redouble our efforts to get to a lasting and secure peace as soon as possible,” Starmer said in a statement, adding that he would be “convening leaders this Saturday to discuss next steps”.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>In other news in Europe:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukraine launched its largest drone attack on Moscow since the start of the war overnight on Monday. </strong>The Russian defence ministry reported that 337 drones were launched at Russia, including 91 targeting the Moscow region, killing three people, causing fires and disrupting flights and train services.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Portugal’s parliament rejected a motion of confidence in the centre-right government, </strong>whose prime minister Luís Montenegro is embroiled in a controversy over a possible conflict of interest.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Romania’s top court upheld a decision to ban presidential election frontrunner Călin Georgescu from standing in a rerun of the vote in May</strong>, sparking protest in Bucharest and leaving the country’s far right parties four days to find a candidate.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Voters on the vast Arctic island of Greenland are going to the polls after a dramatic election campaign</strong> that the territory’s prime minister said had been “burdened by geopolitical tensions”.</p></li>

An open question, perhaps, is whether peacekeepers could enter Ukraine during a ceasefire period, but this is speculative.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In the background of these talks, <strong>Ukraine</strong> said it had struck an oil refinery near <strong>Moscow</strong> and a facility in <strong>Russia’s</strong> Oryol region that is part of the <strong>Druzhba</strong> pipeline system exporting oil to Europe, Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p>Hungarian foreign minister <strong>Peter Szijjártó</strong> said that crude oil shipment via the pipeline was suspended after a Ukrainian drone attack on a metering station.</p> 
  <p>In comments reported by Hungarian media, Szijjártó urged Ukraine not to attack energy infrastructure and said he spoke with Russian officials who reassured him that <strong>repairs were already under way,</strong> with the flow expected to be restarted later today.</p> 
  <p>“It is clear that peace is needed as soon as possible, because the sooner there is peace, the sooner these attacks will stop, and the sooner we can make the energy infrastructure heading to Hungary completely safe,” he was reported as saying.</p> 
  <p>Hungary imports most of its crude oil via the Druzhba pipeline, which transports Russian crude through Belarus and Ukraine to Hungary and Slovakia.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The Kremlin</strong> warned Russians not to get carried away by what the administration of US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is doing over <strong>Ukraine</strong> even though its actions may sometimes look hopeful for Moscow and to always “prepare for the worst,” Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p><strong>“Don’t rush to put on rose-tinted spectacles,”</strong> Kremlin spokesperson <strong>Dmitry Peskov</strong> told an audience at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics on Tuesday, delivering a reality check to Russians excited by Trump’s apparently friendlier behaviour towards them, which has completely upended the policy of the previous U.S. administration.</p> 
  <p>“We always need to <strong>hope for the best but be prepared for the worst.</strong> And we must always be ready to defend our interests,” said Peskov.</p> 
  <p>His warning came as US and Ukrainian officials held talks in Saudi Arabia that are partly designed to determine whether Ukraine is willing to make material concessions to Russia to end the war. If the talks go well, Kyiv hopes Trump may resume military aid and full intelligence sharing, Reuters noted.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Polish prime minister <strong>Donald Tusk</strong> has just offered more detail on his plans for voluntary large-scale military training of Poland’s adult population as the country scales up its preparedness in the context of continuing Russian aggression in the region and its invasion of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>He said the government’s plans to expand existing training programmes as soon as possible, so that everyone who wants to take part can do so in 2026, and expanding the target to be able to train 100,000 people in 2027.</p> 
  <p>Anyone taking part in the month-long training gets a one-off salary of 6,000 Polish złoty (<em><strong>€</strong></em>1,431), Tusk said.</p> 
  <p>The scheme will be open to all adults between 18 and 60 years old. They will also get additional dual-use training opportunities, for example an expedited course to get a driving licence for larger transport vehicles.</p> 
  <p>Further details of the draft law implementing these plan are expected “by the end of March,” he said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Time for Putin to wakeup to reality; Ukraine needs to be negotiate from position of strength, Dutch defence minister says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Back to <strong>Ukraine</strong>, Dutch defence minister <strong>Ruben Brekelmans </strong>also spoke at the Paris conference this morning, warning that “Europe is standing at the crossroads,” as “the treats imposed by Russia is only growing” and “we don’t have much time to get this right, we only have one shot.”</p> 
  <p>In a <em>very</em> pointed reference, Brekelmans alluded to Trump’s recent comments on Nato’s Article 5:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>Nato was established in 1949 to prevent future wars through unified strength.</em></p> 
   <p><em>And nowadays, when we walk towards the entrance of the Nato headquarters, we pass a large piece of the Berlin Wall on the left side, it’s a symbol of the end of the Cold War, [and] to the right side, we see a twisted and mangled piece of steel from the twin towers, a reminder of 9/11 and a reminder of the impact of terrorism.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It’s also a reminder of our American allies asking for help, <strong>and a reminder of European allies answering that call.</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a stark reminder of what is at stake, he added:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>I cannot help but wonder, <strong>what relics of war will come to stand next to these five to 10 years from now?</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>Will it be a piece of concrete from an apartment building in Kharkiv?</em></p> 
   <p><em>Will it be a section of a internet cable from the North Sea?</em></p> 
   <p><em>It’s impossible to predict, but what I do already know is that our actions in these coming days and coming weeks will be crucial in shaping the next five to 10 years.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>On Ukraine specifically, Brekelmans said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>President Zelensky <strong>should not have to agree to a deal that would result in some sort of interbellum</strong>, with aggression constantly looming on the horizon.</em></p> 
   <p><em>He needs to negotiate from a position of strength.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He then directly warned about Russia’s president <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> saying:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p>Putin has made very clear that Ukraine is not his final stop on his campaign to the imperial past.</p> 
   <p>He will continue his aggressive, aggressive efforts to increase the influence and the territory of the Russian Empire towards his dream to reestablish a <em>Russkiy Mir,</em> or a Russian world.</p> 
   <p>It’s a dream for Putin, and it’s a nightmare for the rest of Europe.</p> 
   <p><strong>It’s time we let Putin wake up to the fact that his dreams do not match reality.</strong></p> 
   <p>…</p> 
   <p>No matter how brutal this war has become, <strong>Ukrainians cannot be silenced.</strong> They cannot be forced into submission.</p> 
   <p>Ukrainians are fighting at the frontline of our freedom and security against Russian tyranny and aggression. It’s the frontline of the freedom and security of Europe.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>• <em>This post was amended on 12 March 2025. Owing to a typographical error, an earlier version misquoted Ruben Brekelmans as saying Ukrainians “can be forced into submission”. This should have said “cannot be forced into submission”.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Greenland's 'most consequential election in history' under way</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Voting is now under way in <strong>Greenland</strong> as the island’s population goes to the poll in a snap parliamentary election overshadowed by questions about its future relations with Denmark and the US.</p> 
  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/01/greenland-zip/giv-4559va4EnwKXAa2f/" data-alt="Map of Greenland"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/01/greenland-zip/giv-4559va4EnwKXAa2f/">Interactive</a> 
  </figure> 
  <p>The vote has attracted global attention after Donald Trump’s repeated assertions about acquiring the autonomous territory, using military and economic force if necessary.</p> 
  <p>Danish prime minister <strong>Mette Frederiksen</strong> posted a social media note “wishing everyone in Greenland a very good election day.” </p> 
  <p>The <strong>polling stations have just opened</strong> at 9am local time (11am GMT) and the voting will continue until 8pm (10pm GMT). There are no exit polls, and we are expecting the results to filter through the night.</p> 
  <p>With an electorate of approximately 40,000 – of a population of 57,000 – the margins are small, and 31 seats in the Greenlandic parliament, Inatsisartut, are up for grabs.</p> 
  <p>There are <strong>six parties</strong> on the ballot. With 12 seats in the Inatsisartut, the biggest party going into the election was Inuit Ataqatigiit (IA), which, led by prime minister <strong>Múte Egede</strong>, ran the governing coalition.</p> 
  <p>Siumut, led by <strong>Erik Jensen</strong>, is the second biggest party with 10 seats. For the last two years the two parties have been in coalition government. Before that, IA was in coalition with Naleraq, which brings us on to another of the key players.</p> 
  <p>With four seats, Naleraq is the largest opposition party going into the election. The party, led by <strong>Pele Broberg</strong>, a former government minister, has been gaining traction with its promise to hold a snap vote on independence. It is the most open of the parties to collaborating with the US.</p> 
  <p>Even with all the external drama around <strong>Trump</strong>, the biggest talking points of the election have been perennial domestic ones: economy, welfare, job creation, healthcare, education, fisheries. </p> 
  <p>Independence and the relationship with Denmark and the US are also normal subjects in Greenlandic elections – but this time voters and politicians have had the additional pressure of the world watching and providing commentary.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Over in Paris, French armed forces minister <strong>Sébastien Lecornu </strong>has just opened the Paris Defence and Strategy Forum, which will see over 30 army chiefs coming together for a chat on what Europe and the west can offer in support of Ukraine as part of a peacedeal with Russia.</p> 
  <p>Lecornu said Europe was facing <strong>"a new period”</strong> in its history, distinctively different from both the cold war and “the period of peace dividends,” with multiple global powers fighting for influence.</p> 
  <p>In a pointed reference to the new US administration, he said that today’s discussions will look at how Nato and the west could defend the eastern flank “if tomorrow the contributions of certain countries – <strong>or one country in particular</strong> – were to decrease” their presence.</p> 
  <p>On Ukraine, he said that more planning was needed to <strong>back any potential ceasefire in Ukraine,</strong> knowing that Russia has a history of not respecting similar arrangements.</p> 
  <p>Crucially, the French minister said that <strong>France would “refuse any demilitarisation of the Ukrainian army,”</strong> considering it an important part of any future security architecture.</p>

   <p><em>A ceasefire in Ukraine will not come through diplomatic gestures alone. A number of conditions are crucial beforehand in order to ensure that peace – when it comes – is lasting. This includes putting political and financial pressure on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> to raise the cost of renewed conflict. …</em></p> 
   <p><em>A stronger, safer and more resilient Europe – militarily, politically and economically – is our shared goal. Securing a meaningful ceasefire is the first step. This requires a Europe that is economically and politically resilient.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>As the talks in Jeddah take place behind the closed doors, let’s catch up with European Commission president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen’s</strong> comments at the European Parliament in Strasbourg earlier this morning.</p> 
  <p>She told EU lawmakers that “<strong>the European security order is being shaken</strong>, and so many of our illusions are being shattered,” with increasingly aggressive posture from Russia and the shift in US defence policy.</p> 
  <p>“Some believed that Russia could be integrated in Europe’s economic and security architecture. Others hoped that we could rely indefinitely on America’s full protection. And so we lowered our guard. <strong>The time of illusions is over,</strong>” she said.</p> 
  <p>Von der Leyen argued that recent decisions by EU leaders were “unprecedented” and previously “completely unthinkable,” showing new urgency to act and rearm Europe. </p> 
  <p>“We need a surge in European defence, and we need it now,” she said.</p> 
  <p>She explained that the first priority was “the urgent need to fill the gaps in Ukraine’s military supplies and to provide <strong>Ukraine</strong> with solid security guarantees,” but Europe also needs to go beyond that.</p> 
  <p>“Putin has proven time and again that he is a hostile neighbour. He cannot be trusted. He can only be deterred,” she said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Create new defence format with EU and close partners, former Italian PM Letta says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Former Italian prime minister <strong>Enrico Letta</strong>, who now leads the French Jacques Delors Institut, is one of the leading voices in the European debate on security and defence in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://x.com/EnricoLetta/status/1899355204765515816/photo/1">In a comment for </a><strong><a href="https://x.com/EnricoLetta/status/1899355204765515816/photo/1">Le Monde</a></strong><a href="https://x.com/EnricoLetta/status/1899355204765515816/photo/1"> this morning</a>, he called for <strong>a new European Common Defence System</strong> comprising of the 27 EU member states (not sure pro-Russian Hungary will be that keen, though), the UK, Norway, Iceland, and the three Balkan candidate states: Albania, Montenegro, and North Macedonia.</p> 
  <p>He praised recent decisions on raising EU defence spending as <strong>“going in the right direction,”</strong> but called for deeper integration “beyond the sole dimension of defence [as] security is a much broader objective than defensive military effectiveness,” pointing to energy independence, connectivity, and European autonomy in terms of financial and economic structures.</p> 
  <p>He said that <strong>a more coordinated response</strong> was needed to <strong>respond to</strong> <strong>“openly hostile to the EU” administration in the US</strong>, and overcome “dramatic weakeness of the EU” in its fragmentation.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Over 30 nations to talk about their support for Ukraine in Paris</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Separately, <strong>senior army representatives from over 30 countries</strong> are meeting in <strong>Paris</strong> to discuss <strong>creating an international force to deter future Russian aggression</strong> once a ceasefire is established.</p> 
  <p>AP notes that the Paris meeting is the most significant culmination so far of French and British efforts to rally nations under a so-called <strong>“coalition of the willing”</strong> to safeguard Ukraine by establishing a reassurance and deterrence force to dissuade Russia from invading again.</p> 
  <p>The list of participating countries includes <strong>almost all Nato member states</strong> – notably, without the US, as it is meant to be a Europe-led mission – as well as some <strong>Commonwealth</strong> countries and <strong>Asian</strong> powers such as Japan and South Korea.</p> 
  <p>The main meeting, part of the <strong>Paris Defence Forum</strong>, will take place in late afternoon, with a keynote speech framing the task ahead by French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron.</strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Ukraine launched 'largest ever' drone attack on Moscow</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>And just hours before the talks were due to get under way, <strong>Ukraine</strong> targeted <strong>Moscow</strong> in what authorities said was its largest ever drone attack on the Russian capital, killing at least one person, sparking fires and forcing the suspension of flights and train travel.</p> 
  <p>The Russian defence ministry said 337 drones were launched at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> over Monday night, with 91 of them targeting the Moscow region. The Moscow city mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said it was the largest Ukrainian drone attack on the city.</p> 
  <p>Russia’s aviation watchdog said flights were suspended at all four of Moscow’s airports. Two other airports, in the Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod regions east of Moscow, were also closed.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: Crunch time</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>US</strong> and <strong>Ukrainian</strong> officials are meeting in <strong>Jeddah</strong>, Saudi Arabia, today to see if they can find a way forward for <strong>Donald Trump’s</strong> push to bring the <strong>Russian</strong> invasion of Ukraine to an end.</p> 
  <p>The key building block seems to be the minerals deal, which the US side expected to be signed either at <strong>Keith Kellogg’s</strong> visit to Kyiv last month, or the now infamous visit of <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> to the White House.</p> 
  <p>Kellogg said last week that he was now expecting the deal to be agreed by US state secretary <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> and his Ukrainian equivalent, and it just so happens that the two take part in today’s talks. </p> 
  <p>Asked on Fox News if he thought Ukraine could sign the minerals deal this week, Trump Middle East aide <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong> said: “I am really hopeful. All the signs are very, very positive.” Could this finally happen today, third time lucky?</p> 
  <p>But we know that both sides are keen to discuss the broader ramification of any deal and what’s next, including the Ukrainian proposal – first floated by French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> – for a limited ceasefire in air and at seas to allow for other talks to progress.</p> 
  <p>Ukraine’s Zelenskyy also repeatedly talked about the importance of exchanging hostages, and of his demand for Russia to return abducted Ukrainian children. Let’s see if he can make progress on these issues.</p> 
  <p>Last night, the Ukrainian president met with Saudi leaders, who are keen to play a mediating role in the process. In a social media post after the meeting, he said he discussed these ideas, and pointedly added that “a significant part of the discussion was dedicated to the formats of security guarantees.”</p> 
  <p>Rubio, on the other hand, said “both sides need to come to an understanding that there’s no military solution to this situation.”</p> 
  <p>He added: “I’m not going to set any conditions on what they have to or need to do. I think we want to listen to see how far they’re willing to go and then compare that to what the Russians want and see how far apart we truly are.”</p> 
  <p>“The most important thing that we have to leave here with is a strong sense that Ukraine is prepared to do difficult things, like the Russians are going to have to do difficult things, to end this conflict or at least pause it in some way, shape or form,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Let’s see if they can make progress today. I will bring you all the latest throughout the day.</p> 
  <p>Elsewhere, we will be keeping one eye on <strong>the historic elections in Greenland</strong>, <strong>the vote of no confidence in the Portuguese government</strong>, and <strong>other stories across Europe</strong>, but our main focus is firmly on Ukraine today.</p> 
  <p>It’s <strong>Tuesday, 11 March 2025</strong>, and this is <strong>Europe live</strong>. It’s <strong>Jakub Krupa</strong> here.</p> 
  <p>Good morning.</p>
