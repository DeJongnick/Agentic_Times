 <h2 class="block-title">Fears over Trump's deregulation push</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>The push to water down financial regulations, particularly under President Trump, is stoking concern across Europe.</strong></p> 
  <p>Asked about the deregulatory drive in the US, the governor of France’s central bank, <strong>François</strong> <strong>Villeroy</strong> <strong>de Galhau</strong>, hinted it could sow the seeds of the next financial crisis. </p> 
  <p>He singled out the lack of regulation on crypto-currencies and the surge in non-bank lending.</p> 
  <p>“There is room for improvement [on financial regulation] on this side of the Atlantic,” he said. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“But the idea that we should not regulate at all non-banks… that we should not regulate crypto… I think this could happen to be dangerous in the future.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“I’m not here to forecast a financial crisis… but we know it can happen and we know it’s due to the regulating cycle: you regulate and you forget the former crisis then you deregulate and you prepare the next crisis. We will see.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">A brief run-in with the police</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Security at Davos is notably tight today – perhaps due to anxiety after Greenpeace protesters got inside the Congress Centre to display a banner calling for taxes on the super-rich.</strong></p> 
  <p>I was just meeting <strong>Marlene</strong> <strong>Engelhorn</strong> of taxmenow and <strong>Phil</strong> <strong>White</strong> of the Patriotic Millionaires, outside the Annual Meeting when the police showed up, asking for ID.</p> 
  <p>That’s even though we’re not within the confines of the WEF (although much of wider Davos has been taken over by the WEF attendees or companies piggy-backing off it).</p> 
  <p>Your humble correspondent, though, was free from suspicion as I was wearing the badge doled out by WEF that’s essential for getting into the Congress centre.</p> 
  <p>A sign of just how odd Davos is this week, as the so-called ‘global elite’ gather for their annual discussions about the state of the world.</p> 
  <p><strong>Engelhorn</strong> and <strong>White</strong> are in Davos lobbying for a wealth tax for the super-rich, warning that the influence of the extremely wealthy is hurting democracy, and trust in the media.</p>

  <p><strong>Herzog </strong>argues the region has a huge opportunity to change for the better, but also warns about the risks posed by Tehran.</p> 
  <p>Israel believes a “a clear message” must be sent to the Iranians, “no more”, <strong>Herzog </strong>says, in the new era that was announced yesterday (eg the inauguration of Donald Trump).</p> 
  <p><strong>Herzog </strong>also says he is very optimistic about the future of Israel, saying its people and the nation have shown great resilience.</p>

  <p>He ponts out that Russia can field rather more than a million soldiers. Ukraine has 800,000, but other European countries have fewer.</p> 
  <p>So, this isn’t a situation where one country can repell Russia alone.</p> 
  <p>We are very grateful for Europe’s support, <strong>Zelenskyy </strong>pledges.</p> 
  <p>But, he warns, Europe must learn to fully take care of itself.</p> 
  <p>That must inclue a United European security and defence policy, <strong>Zelenskyy </strong>says, and all countries must be willing to spend as much as is needed, rather than just what they have got used to.</p> 
  <p><strong>If it costs 5% of GDP on defence, so be it, he says.</strong></p> 
  <p>He adds that Europe needs its own version of the Iron Dome, which can repell any threats, he says (a nod to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/23/israel-iron-dome-hezbollah-war-lebanon">Israel’s defense system</a>)</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Zelenskyy: US are an indispensible ally, but what will Trump do?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Volodymyr</strong> <strong>Zelenskyy</strong> is now addressing Davos, about the future of Europe, and urging leaders to take steps to remain relevent in the current geopolitical situation.</p> 
  <p>The Ukranian president says all eyes are on Washington. But who is actually watching Europe at the moment?</p> 
  <p>20 hours ago, he reminds delegates, Donald Trump was inaugurated, everyone is waiting to see what he does next.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s early executive orders have shown his priorities, <strong>Zelenskyy </strong>points out, now people are watching to see how he will end wars (as he pledged during the election campaign).</p> 
  <p>It is clear that the US are an indispensible ally, <strong>Zelenskyy </strong>says.</p> 
  <p>But he warns that an official under the Biden administration had explained that America’s priorities were the Pacific, the Middle East, and then Europe third.</p> 
  <p>Will President Trump even notice Europe? Will he see Nato as necessary, and will he respect international institutions, <strong>Zelenskyy </strong>asks.</p> 
  <p>He is insisting that Europe must establish itself as a strong global player, an indisensible player.</p> 
  <p>He cautions Davos delegates that there is no ocean separating Europe from Russia.</p> 
  <p>And Europe should remember that battles involving North Korean soldiers are taking place closer to Davos than Pyongyang, he adds.</p> 
  <p>Turning to recent deals signed by Putin with his allies, <strong>Zelenskyy </strong>says they are deals against Ukraine, against Europe, and against US.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Olaf Scholz, Federal Chancellor of Germany, is addressing the World Economic Forum now.</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Scholz</strong> has taken a break from campaigning in the German election to visit Davos.</p> 
  <p>He begins by reminding delegates that the path to prosperity leads through strong and stable institutions.</p> 
  <p>He hit out at “black and white thinking” that promises simple solutions, but cannot deliver them.</p> 
  <p>Scholz says the world needs clarity and steadfastness, particularly on peace and security. We must protect the international order, he says, and the most important element of that order is the inviolability of national borders.</p> 
  <p><strong>This is why President Putin must not be successful in the war he has launched against Ukraine, Scholz says.</strong></p> 
  <p>And Scholz points out that Putin’s hopes of keeping Ukraine away from Europe, of avoiding a stronger NATO, and installing a pro-Russian puppet regime in Kviv have failed.</p> 
  <p>Ukraine is a EU candidate, he points out, Nato has grown, and the Ukraine government stands stronger than ever before.</p> 
  <p>The Ukrainian army is bigger and stronger than before the war, equipt with Western weapons, Scholz points out.</p> 
  <p>He gives much of the credit for this to the strength of Ukrainian people, but also points to international support.</p>

  <p><strong>Cryptocurrency supporters at Davos are optimistic about their prospects under Donald Trump’s second presidential term.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking on a panel here in Davos, Coinbase CEO <strong>Brian</strong> <strong>Armstrong</strong> said crypto had faced a “hostile environment” under the previous administration, which will now change.</p> 
  <p>The new administration should make it easier to agree a path to agree new rules for treatment of crypto, he says.</p> 
  <p>According to <strong>Armstrong</strong>, crypto is still “in its infancy”, as only half the companies on the Fortune 500 have conducted a crypto trial.</p> 
  <p>He cites crypto’s payment growth, and the rise in crypto EFTs, but insists that “the Trump effect cannot be denied” – and probably drove Bitcoin to its record high yesterday.</p> 
  <p><strong>Armstrong </strong>says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>To have the leader of the largest country come out and say he wants to be the first crypto president… this is unprecedented. It’s hard to deny it has had an effect.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Financier <strong>Anthony</strong> <strong>Scaramucci</strong> (who briefly served as Trump’s Communications Director in his first term) predicts that Paul Atkins, who has been nominated as the next chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, would go back to “an old-school framework which will be beneficial for the industry”.</p> 
  <p>Previously, <strong>Scaramucci</strong> says, crypto firms were “shooting in the dark’ when tackling regulation.</p> 
  <p><strong>Scaramucci </strong>also claims that US senator Elizabeth Warren, and former SEC chair Gary Gensler had helped the Democrats lose the presidency, the house and the senate last November, through their concerns about crypto.</p> 
  <p>Scaramucci says he is very hopeful and optimistic about crypto’s prospects.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“This industry is here to stay, and there are companies who are going to accelerate…and unleash uncredible amounts of innovation.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But… South Africa’s central bank governor, <strong>Lesetja</strong> <strong>Kganyago</strong>, warns that crypto needs global rules that are clear and transparent.</p> 
  <p><strong>Kganyago </strong>warns against allowing regulation to be set by the power of money.</p> 
  <p>If an industry decides to use money to knock one candidate out, or another one in, ‘that to me is regulatory capture,” he adds.</p>

  <p>“The cooperative world order we imagined 25 years ago has not turned into reality. Instead we have entered a new era of harsh geostrategic competition,” she told the <strong>World</strong> <strong>Economic</strong> <strong>Forum</strong>. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“We will need to work together to avoid a global race to the bottom.”</p>

  <p>Responding to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/17/the-guardian-view-on-europes-future-spend-big-or-risk-the-consequences">ex-ECB president Mario Draghi’s report on competitiveness last year</a>, she said the Commission will soon propose new policies in three key areas - deepening capital markets integration; allowing big companies to work across the EU under a single set of rules; and creating an “energy union”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“It is time to complete our energy union so that clean power can run freely across our continent .”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In what appeared to be a sideswipe at Donald Trump’s approach, Von Der Leyen said, “with Europe, what you see is what you get. We play by the rules. Our deals have no strings attached.” She said her new Commission would make its first foreign trip to India.</p> 
  <p><strong>Von</strong> <strong>der</strong> <strong>Leyen</strong> also stressed the close trade and economic connections between the EU and the US, however, saying the EU would engage early with the new administration. </p> 
  <p>She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles. We will protect our interests and uphold our values, because that is the European way.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>There’s drama inside the Congress Centre here at Davos, where two Greenpeace International activists have held a protest calling for wealth taxes.</strong></p> 
  <p>Two Greenpeace activists unveiled a banner reading “Tax the Super-rich! Fund a Just and Green Future”, above the main lobby near the WEF Congress Hall (where the big speeches take place).</p> 
  <p><strong>Clara Thompson, Greenpeace </strong>spokesperson in Davos, explains:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“As the world faces increasing threats to democracy through the collusion of wealth and power, the urgency to tax the super-rich is ever increasing.</p> 
   <p>Having billionaires in positions of leadership, governing with impunity, is a stark reminder of the dangerous intersection of extreme wealth and politics, and its impact on democracy, people and the planet.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Introduction</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Good morning from Davos, where the first full day of the World Economic Forum is getting underway.</strong></p> 
  <p>We’ll hear from a slew of global leaders, as the world digests the inauguration of Donald Trump yesterday, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/20/tump-executive-orders-list">the flurry of executive orders from the White House</a>.</p> 
  <p>That includes <strong>Ding</strong> <strong>Xuexiang</strong>, Vice-Premier of China, where there may be relief that Trump has declined to flesh out his plans for taxing Chinese imports.</p> 
  <p>But while the much-feared trade war hasn’t kicked off, yet anyway, there’s anxiety over what the next few years will bring – with escalating armed conflict seen as the biggest risk facing the world economy.</p> 
  <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> 
   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/15/escalating-armed-conflict-is-most-urgent-threat-for-world-in-2025-say-global-leaders">Escalating armed conflict is most urgent threat for world in 2025, say global leaders</a> </p> 
  </aside> 
  <p><strong>Karen Harris</strong>, managing director of <strong>Bain &amp; Company’s</strong> Macro Trends Group, points out that the last five years have been the most “macro-economically shocking in modern history”, starting with the Covid-19 pandemic and followed by the inflation shock.</p> 
  <p><strong>Harris </strong>adds:</p> 
  <p>“As business and political leaders gather in Davos in 2025, one key question dominates: Will this tumultuous five-year period end with a gentle return to normal?</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“The data suggests so. The IMF projects 2024 global growth at 3.2%, slightly below the 2010–2019 median of 3.5%, with 2025 growth at 3.3%. To our 2019 selves, these numbers might imply normalcy: the US and China driving growth, Europe sluggish, global output steady at 3–3.5%.</p> 
   <p>“Yet beneath these numbers sits fragility: alarming unemployment change in the US, deflation in China, stagnation in Europe, and a high degree of equity market concentration**.</p> 
   <p>“Additionally, the change of US administration also challenges this narrative. A focus on reducing trade deficits, primarily affecting China but also Europe, could disrupt the US’s role as a major provider of global demand. If the US undergoes such structural shifts, the EU could face intense competition with China for export market share. This complicates the notion of a back-to-normal soft landing. Instead, normal will be continued uncertainty.”</p>
