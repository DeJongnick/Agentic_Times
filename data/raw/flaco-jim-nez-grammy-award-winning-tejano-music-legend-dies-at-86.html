<p>Flaco Jiménez, master of the accordion and pioneer of tejano music, has died at the age of 86.</p> <p>“It is with great sadness that we share tonight the loss of our father, Flaco Jimenez,” reads a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/flacojimenezofficial/posts/pfbid02sEg9SFtfG71B8AcFvPhwhfEErxtFakkzZMThnz44LvfkUQU95rJvufNPWfhnY46pl?locale=es_LA">post</a> from his family on Facebook. “He was surrounded by his loved ones and will be missed immensely. Thank you to all of his fans and friends – those who cherished his music. And a big thank you for all of the memories. His legacy will live on through his music and all of his fans.”</p> <p>The cause of death is unknown but a January <a href="https://www.facebook.com/flacojimenezofficial/posts/pfbid0o5sKpbbmdwnpenmRHCRCir7apUzUrwEsHoS147DjwYfhCCC6XT8uZ7EwmBVKyCwol">post</a> from his family stated that he was “in the hospital facing a medical hurdle”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.expressnews.com/entertainment/article/flaco-jimenez-obituary-20797259.php">According to his son Arturo</a>, his last words were “<em>Ya estoy cansado</em>”, which translates to “I’m tired.”</p> <p>Jiménez won six Grammy awards in his career, including for country instrumental performance and tejano music performance, and a lifetime achievement award in 2015. “This one, the lifetime achievement, is top of the line,” he <a href="https://www.kens5.com/article/news/local/flaco-jimenez-speaks-on-grammy-lifetime-achievement-award/273-153875841">said</a> at the time. “You can’t go higher than that one.”</p> <p>His sound was instrumental in defining <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jun/22/conjunto-tejano-music-tex-mex-us">tejano and conjunto music</a>. The Guardian’s Piper LeMoine wrote that “the soundtrack of the American south-west would be incomplete” without these two genres.</p> <p>“The way I learned to play the accordion was on the wild and happy side, much like Cajun and zydeco music,” he once said in an <a href="https://www.rootsworld.com/interview/flaco.html">interview</a>. “One of my early idols was Clifton Chenier. The way he played, it was like the accordion was yelling at you: hey, take this. I like to make my accordion yell and scream and make it happy.”</p> <p>After performing in San Antonio in the 1960s, Jiménez went to New York City and worked with artists including Bob Dylan, Carlos Santana, Willie Nelson and the Rolling Stones.</p> <p>His first solo album was released in 1972 and he would go on to record more than 25 in his career.</p> <p>A tribute was paid by Cesar Rosas, a member of Los Lobos who worked with Jiménez on the song Don’t Worry Baby.</p> <p>“Not only was Flaco my musical mentor, but he was also a dear friend to all of us Los Lobos,” Rosas said to the <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/entertainment/article/flaco-jimenez-obituary-20797259.php">San Antonio Express-News</a>. “He was such a musical influence on me that [he] made me run out and buy a bajo sexto and start using it in my band. He will forever be in my heart. What a tremendous loss.”</p>
