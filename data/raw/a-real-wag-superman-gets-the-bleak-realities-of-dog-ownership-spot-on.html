<p>Superman might be one of the most confusing blockbuster films to hit the big screen this year. The tone, as you might expect from a goofball superhero movie that is plainly about the invasion of Gaza, is all over the shop. Too many characters contribute too little to the plot. There are moments when it feels like it was written specifically to provide work for the silly-glasses and ironic-haircut industries. It is a bit of a mess.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/17/superman-movie-krypto-dog-adoption">Puppy power: canine in new Superman movie spurs pet adoption interest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But that said, one thing is demonstrably true: the dog is cool. As shown in the trailer, Krypto the superdog is Superman’s secret weapon. A mile away from his last screen outing, where he was muscular and proud and voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Superman’s Krypto is scrappy and wild. He doesn’t obey commands. He destroys whatever equipment is put in front of him. Whenever he may or may not save the day, it seems like he does it out of accident rather than design.</p> <p>And now everybody wants one. Research by the dog training app Woofz has shown that Google searches for “adopt a dog near me” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/17/superman-movie-krypto-dog-adoption">jumped 513% during Superman’s opening weekend</a>. What’s more, searches for “rescue dog adoption near me” rose by 163%, while “adopt a puppy” rose by 31%. And these searches are specific, too. Krypto is apparently a schnauzer-terrier mix, and “adopt a schnauzer” searches have risen by almost 300% since Superman’s release.</p> <p>There are many potential reasons for this. Perhaps viewers who found themselves confused by Superman’s swampy storytelling latched on to Krypto as a guidepoint. Perhaps they have short attention spans and fail to think things through, as with the boom of dalmatian sales (and subsequent boom in dalmatian abandonments) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/14/us/after-movies-unwanted-dalmatians.htm">after 101 Dalmatians was released in 1996</a>. Or perhaps it’s because Superman is one of the rare films to get dog ownership exactly right.</p>    <p>So often in Hollywood, dogs are either loyal companions or would-be therapists who teach their owners about the meaning of love. Think of Marley and Me, in which a dog helps Owen Wilson to love and then dies. Or Turner and Hooch, in which a dog helps Tom Hanks to love and then gets murdered. Or Old Yeller, in which a dog helps a boy to love and then the boy shoots it with a shotgun. Some mix the formula up a little – in The Call of the Wild a dog teaches Harrison Ford to love, and then Harrison Ford dies – but you get the gist.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Krypto is a bit of a dick. The first time we meet him, Superman has been beaten for the very first time. Bleeding and broken, as a last resort he calls on his faithful pup to help him to safety. In any other film, this is exactly what Krypto would have done. But here he leaps all over Superman instead, doing little but compounding his injuries. He’s excited. He wants to help. But he’s also a dog, so he’s sort of useless.</p> <p>Winningly, there’s no sentimental ending to his story, either. He doesn’t ever really bond with Superman, and he definitely doesn’t die. In the end (and this probably counts as a spoiler), Supergirl comes and picks him up, and Superman barely even notices. There’s no growth. Nobody learns anything. It’s sort of great.</p> <p>It’s telling that Krypto was only written into the script after James Gunn adopted a dog of his own, named Ozu. Last year on Twitter, Gunn wrote that “Ozu, who came from a hoarding situation in a backyard with 60 other dogs and never knew human beings, was problematic to say the least. He immediately came in and destroyed our home, our shoes, our furniture – he even ate my laptop. It took a long time before he would even let us touch him. I remember thinking, ‘Gosh, how difficult would life be if Ozu had superpowers?’ – and thus Krypto came into the script.”</p> <p>And maybe that’s the key here. There were no misty-eyed Marley and Me-style reminiscences about Ozu. Gunn was living through the incredibly annoying part of dog ownership where neither party fully trusts the other, and just lifted it wholesale into the script. And this realistic depiction has apparently translated to the hearts of Superman’s audience, as we will soon see when thousands of schnauzers are definitely not abandoned at shelters four months from now.</p>
