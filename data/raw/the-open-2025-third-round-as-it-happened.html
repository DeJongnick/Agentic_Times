If we’re OK with it, that’s exactly what Scottie Scheffler was today. He navigated his way around Portrush with calm authority, attaining a level of brilliance that meant very little drama. He didn’t panic when the birdies didn’t come early on; he pushed on the accelerator with a quick eagle-birdie burst; he made a couple of staunch scrambles on the back nine; he sent one of the shots of the day into the long par-three 16th to extend his lead from Extremely Comfortable to Almost Uncatchable. He’s not world number one for nothing! Bigger third-round leads have been whittled away … but Scottie Scheffler is cut from different cloth than poor old Jean Van de Velde, who took a five-shot advantage into the final round of the 1999 Open at Carnoustie. Haotong Li, Matt Fitzpatrick, Rory McIlroy et al will probably require Scheffler to have an uncharacteristic off day if they’re to have any chance whatsover.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-687be7928f082b80ee738618" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-19T18:46:19.309Z">7.46pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Scheffler shoots 67</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>His birdie putt never looks like dropping, but Scottie Scheffler doesn’t seem too worried.</strong> He tidies up for his par, and at -14 he’ll take a four-shot lead over Haotong Li into tomorrow’s final round.

Bob MacIntyre has to settle for a 70, that eagle on 7 failing to ignite the round he’d have wanted. English is -8, MacIntyre -6.

He was hitting wedge from the centre of the fairway to an accessible pin. Hey, these are the blades of straw at which the rest of the field have to claw.
