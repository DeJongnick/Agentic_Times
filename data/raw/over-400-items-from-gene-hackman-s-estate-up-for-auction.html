<p>Busts by Rodin and works by Kandinksy and Matisse are among some 400 items belonging to the late actor going up for auction next month.</p> <p>Three Golden Globe statues, a variety of film memorabilia and annotated scripts, posters and an easel are also up for sale in the three-stage auction run by Bonhams.</p>    <p>Prices are relatively low, with the Globes priced between $3,000-$5,000, while starting bids for Hackman’s dartboard are $10 while his Seiko diver’s wristwatch is valued at $600.</p> <p>Hackman retired from acting around 20 years ago, and devoted his time to painting and writing novels. Many of Hackman’s own artworks are also up for grabs, including still lifes and portraits, and a bronze of his wife Betsy Arakawa’s head.</p> <p>The couple, along with one of their dogs, were found dead inside their home <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/27/gene-hackman-dies-wife-dog-95">on 26 February</a>. Authorities later determined that the actor, 95, died around a week after his wife, suffering from heart disease and complications from Alzheimer’s.</p> <p>His wife had died of hantavirus, a rare condition caused by exposure to rodent droppings.</p> <p>Hackman was one of the giants of American cinema, winning two Oscars for his roles in 1971’s The French Connection and 1992’s Unforgiven. The Academy does not allow the resale of their awards, but the Golden Globes have no such restrictions.</p> <p>Hackman’s other key films include Bonnie and Clyde, The Poseidon Adventure, Superman, Hoosiers, The Conversation, The Birdcage and The Royal Tenenbaums.</p>
