<p>Three hundred Foreign Office staff with consciences, and concerns about UK policy on Gaza that they raised in a letter to the foreign secretary, should not be told by their Whitehall superiors that “an honourable course” is to resign from the civil service (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jun/10/foreign-office-staff-told-to-consider-resigning-after-challenging-uk-policy-on-gaza">Report, 10 June</a>). No. The honourable course for the government is to act on these informed concerns and on our complicity, so&nbsp;far, in Israeli war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br><strong>Laura Conyngham</strong><br><em>Crediton, Devon</em></p> <p>• While I bemoan the fall in the number of children’s books featuring ethnic-minority main characters (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/10/childrens-books-should-reflect-the-diverse-world-they-live-in">Letters, 10 June</a>), books featuring children of east Asian origin have been lacking for years, and still are. My 11-year-old granddaughter has mixed British/east Asian heritage, and I don’t think we’ve ever found books with children who look like her. The same applies to children’s birthday cards. A gap in the market that needs to be rectified, perhaps?<br><strong>Barbara Thompson</strong><br><em>Aston, South Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• Thanks to Dr Amy Fulton for using the wonderful word “persnicketiness” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jun/09/minding-our-language-on-the-use-of-americanisms">Letters, 9 June</a>). I’ve only ever seen it in the lining of my Tilley hat (other hats are available). The legend reads: “USA-treated cotton duck, solid British brass hardware, sewn with Canadian persnicketiness.” What a wonderful language we all share.<br><strong>Angus MacIntosh</strong><br><em>Burley in Wharfedale, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• The English language is indeed evolving. Sadly, this appears to have led to the extinction of some present participles. Standing or sitting, for instance. It’s common to hear “I was stood …”. I’ve even heard a teacher praising children with: “Well done, class 5. You’re sat beautifully.” Time&nbsp;for a reintroduction?<br><strong>Celia Rose</strong> <br><em>Abbotskerswell, Devon</em></p> <p>• Jonathan Liew’s piece on the French Open finalists was pure poetry (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/08/jannik-sinner-carlos-alcaraz-french-open-mens-final-tennis">Sinner’s mechanical excellence malfunctions against human ingenuity of relentless rival, 8 June</a>). Congratulations.<br><strong>Ann Kenton-Barker</strong><br><em>(Still playing at 89), </em><em>London</em></p> <p>• I suppose it’s appropriate that a house in Fire Island, notorious for “carnal pleasure”, would have a “shag carpet” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jun/11/made-for-sex-hedonistic-party-palaces-new-york-fire-island-horace-gifford">‘Made for sex’: the hedonistic party palaces of New York’s Fire Island – and the blond bombshell who made them, 11 June</a>).<br><strong>Sharman Finlay</strong><br><em>Portrush, County Antrim</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
