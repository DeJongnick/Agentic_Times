<p>Cat videos, selfies and dad jokes are typical fare for any social media feed but Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta is introducing a new twist: they’re all made by artificial intelligence.</p> <p>The Meta founder and chief executive has announced the launch of Vibes, a new feed on the Meta AI app comprised entirely of AI-made videos.</p> <p>The arrival of powerful video models has led to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/11/cat-soap-operas-and-babies-trapped-in-space-the-ai-slop-taking-over-youtube">further commentary</a> on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/19/spam-junk-slop-the-latest-wave-of-ai-behind-the-zombie-internet">wave of AI “slop”</a> – a term for mass-produced, often bizarre content that clutters up feeds – that has hit the internet. In August the Guardian revealed that almost one in 10 of the fastest-growing YouTube channels globally were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/11/cat-soap-operas-and-babies-trapped-in-space-the-ai-slop-taking-over-youtube">showing AI-generated content only</a>.</p> <p>AI-generated content has become an increasingly prominent feature on consumers’ feeds as the underlying technology has become more sophisticated, with the release of Google’s Veo3 model in May creating a new wave of content, although film-makers are already using the models to create <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-tools-gamechanger-for-film-makers">high-quality material as well</a>.</p> <p>Meta owns Facebook and Instagram, and Zuckerberg said in an Instagram post that Vibes would be a “feed of expressive AI-generated videos from artists and creators”. The feed will be available in the US and in more than 40 other countries but not in the UK.</p> <p>Zuckerberg illustrated the post with an AI-made clip titled “Dad trying to calculate the tip on a $30 lunch”, with a parent – bearing a resemblance to Zuckerberg – stating: “Oh gosh … I think it’s probably to going to be, I dunno, at least $600bn.” One Instagram user commented under Zuckerberg’s video: “Bros posting ai slop on his own app.”</p> <p>Other videos posted by Zuckerberg include an Egyptian princess taking a selfie, a kitten wearing bespoke baker garb kneading dough, cute fluffy characters and a dog running through a waterlogged field.</p> <p>In a statement announcing the Vibes feed, Meta said users can create their own content or “remix” a video from the feed, including new visuals and music. Meta illustrated the statement with videos including a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/oct/19/tell-me-about-the-makeover-mummy-honey-monster-drops-the-sugar">Honey Monster</a>-like cuddly creature riding a bicycle and a moose jumping on a trampoline.</p> <p>Although Meta has its own suite of AI models, called Llama, for Vibes it will be using video-generating models from the AI labs Midjourney and Black Forest, according to a <a href="https://www.threads.com/@alexanddeer?xmt=AQF099QD5RBGrnK-H1gigXRwnOTvtSIZSb0XiEWlAY6nDQ">post on Threads</a> from Meta’s new chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang.</p> <p>The Meta announcement came as Harvard Business Review highlighted the emergence of “workslop”, or low-quality documents and presentations that have been created by AI tools in the workplace. HBR said a survey of more than 1,100 full-time employees found that four out of 10 respondents said they had received workslop over the past month.</p>
