  <p><strong>New Zealand</strong>’s cabinet will meet on Monday to decide the future of the country’s tough but effective lockdown – though Kiwis have been told not to visit their mums this Mother’s Day.<br><br>Next week, Ardern’s government will plot a path back to something close to normality, meeting to decide a timetable for the removal of social and business restrictions. The prime minister has already released what level two restrictions will look like, including the re-opening of restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, cinemas and public facilities like museums and libraries.<br><br>Social restrictions could end immediately, with provisions for schools, business and personal movement more likely to be phased in.<br><br>Any decision will come too late for Kiwi mums to enjoy visits from sons and daughters not already in their household bubbles. Ardern has banned socialising outside of existing households, with few exceptions, and told Kiwis this week to “stick to the plan” ahead of Monday’s review.</p>

  <p><strong>Russia</strong> has registered more than 10,000 new coronavirus cases for the sixth day in a row, after emerging as a new hotspot of the pandemic.</p> 
  <p>A government tally on Friday showed 10,669 new cases over the last 24 hours, fewer than Thursday’s record of 11,231, bringing the total number of confirmed infections to 187,859.</p> 
  <p>The country also recorded 98 new deaths from the virus, for a total of 1,723, and while some officials are considering softening the current lockdown, the WHO warned Russia is going through a “delayed epidemic.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Russia</strong> now ranks fourth in Europe in terms of the total number of cases, according to an AFP tally, behind countries where the epidemic hit considerably earlier: <strong>Britain</strong>, <strong>Italy</strong> and <strong>Spain</strong>.</p> 
  <p>WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said in a virtual briefing that “Russia is probably experiencing a delayed epidemic” and must “learn some of the lessons” which came at great cost in other parts of the world.</p> 
  <p>On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced an extension of a lockdown in the capital, where most cases are concentrated, to May 31.</p> 
  <p>He also brought in a rule that people must wear masks and gloves in public transport and shops and announced that lockdown will be lifted for industries and construction projects.</p> 
  <p>Residents of the capital are only allowed to leave their homes for brief trips to a shop, to walk dogs or to travel to essential jobs with a permit.</p>

  <p>The White House has instituted daily, as opposed to weekly, coronavirus tests of <strong>US</strong> president Donald Trump and vice president Mike Pence, Reuters reports.<br><br>Earlier today, it was confirmed that Pence’s press secretary, the wife of one of president Donald Trump’s senior advisers, had tested positive for the coronavirus, raising alarm about the virus’ potential spread within the White House’s inner most circle.<br><br>The diagnosis of Katie Miller, who is married to White House immigration adviser and speech writer Stephen Miller, was revealed by Trump in a meeting with Republican lawmakers on Friday, a day after news that Trump’s personal valet had tested positive for the virus.<br><br>Earlier on Friday, Trump was asked in a Fox News interview whether those who serve him food would now cover their faces. “They’ve already started,” he said on the network’s “Fox and Friends” morning program.<br><br>Trump told Fox News he has not yet been tested for antibodies to the coronavirus but probably would be soon. Such a test could confirm previous exposure. </p>

  <p><strong>Boris Johnson </strong>will announce on Sunday that all travellers coming to the UK will be quarantined for a fortnight, according to the Times newspaper.</p> 
  <p>“Passengers arriving at airports and ports including Britons returning from abroad will have to self-isolate for 14 days,” the paper said, citing a government source.</p> 
  <p>Travellers from Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man will be exempt, as will lorry drivers bringing crucial supplies. The measures are believed to be coming into force in early June.</p> 
  <p>Authorities will carry out spot checks and hand out to fines of up to £1,000, or possibly deportation, for those found to be breaking the rules, the report said. It added that travellers will have to provide the UK address at which they intend to self-isolate.</p>

  <p>Airline company <strong>Delta </strong>is to suspend services to 10 US airports until at least September, due to the massive drop in air travel caused by the pandemic. </p> 
  <p>Delta Air Lines Inc is halting flights to Chicago Midway; Oakland International Airport; Hollywood Burbank; Long Beach; Providence, RI, Westchester County Airport; Stewart International; Akron-Canton, Ohio; Manchester, NH; and Newport News/Williamsburg. It has chosen these airports as it services other airports nearby. </p> 
  <p>Delta is cutting flights by 85% in the second quarter and seeking permission from American regulators to suspend flights to nine cities that could be served by other airports, including three in Michigan.<br></p> 
  <p>According to the company, between April 1 and April 22, between just one and 14 passengers flew daily on the airline’s planes each way from those nine airports. <br></p> 
  <p>In the last two weeks, demand for air travel has begun to rise again, but is still down approximately 94% compared to last year.</p>

  <p>The <strong>US</strong> has accused<strong> China</strong> and <strong>Russia</strong> of increasing cooperation to spread false narratives about the coronavirus pandemic, AFP are reporting.</p> 
  <p>Lea Gabrielle, coordinator of the State Department’s global engagement centre, which tracks foreign propaganda, said Beijing was increasingly adopting techniques honed by Moscow.</p> 
  <p>“Even before the Covid-19 crisis, we assessed a certain level of coordination between Russia and the PRC in the realm of propaganda,” Gabrielle told reporters. “But with this pandemic the cooperation has accelerated rapidly.</p> 
  <p>“We see this convergence as a result of what we consider to be pragmatism between the two actors who want to shape public understanding of the Covid pandemic for their own purposes.”</p> 
  <p>The global engagement centre said earlier that thousands of Russian-linked social media accounts were spreading conspiracies about the pandemic, including notions that the virus, detected in Wuhan, China, was created by the United States.</p> 
  <p>Tensions have increased recently, as the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, persisted with allegations that coronavirus originated in a Wuhan laboratory – despite the WHO and the US government’s own top epidemiologist saying there was no evidence the virus came from a lab.</p> 
  <p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping discussed cooperation over the pandemic in a phonecall with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Friday.</p> 
  <p>Putin told him that Russia “opposes the attempts by some forces to use the epidemic as a pretext to blame China and will stand firmly by China’s side”, according to China’s state-run Xinhua news agency.</p>

  <p>Peru is extending its lockdown for another two weeks after 54 days of quarantine, Peru’s president Martín Vizcarra announced in a press briefing. </p> 
  <p>“We are in an extreme situation. We all have to work together,” he said on Friday, stressing that the country had been unable to sufficiently cut the rising rate of infections amid several outbreaks in different parts of the country.</p> 
  <p>Covid-19 hotspots have flared up on the country’s northern coast, where social distancing rules have been routinely flouted, and in the isolated Amazon city of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/07/peru-jungle-iquitos-coronavirus-covid-19">Iquitos</a> which suffered from a critical lack of medical supplies, particularly oxygen.</p> 
  <p>Despite one of the most stringent lockdowns in Latin America, Peru recorded more than 58,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 1,627 deaths by Friday.<br></p> 
  <p>Even in the capital Lima, medical attention was on the verge of collapse despite the best efforts of hospital workers who lacked PPE. However, Vizcarra announced an increase in the number of intensive care beds to 937.<br></p> 
  <p> The popular leader pointed out that banks, bus stops, and, most of all, food markets had been the principal points of contagion. He ordered the closure of 36 “critical” markets where spot tests revealed an infection rate of up to 40% among stallholders, and clampdowns in a total of 380 across the country.</p> 
  <p> With Mother’s Day looming on Sunday, Vizcarra issued a stark warning to his family-minded compatriots, as he paid tribute to all the Peruvian mothers working through the pandemic. </p> 
  <p> “The greatest desire is to go to your mother and give her a big hug (…) but we cannot do that, because we are responsible,” he said.</p> 
  <p> “The best way of protecting your mother is to keep her far away. It’s hard but we will beat this [virus].” </p> 
  <p> Amid the growing toll on mental health after close to two months of quarantine, Vizcarra said that children under the age of 14 would be allowed to venture out with an adult up to 500m from their homes from Monday 18 May.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The press secretary of <strong>US</strong> vice-president Mike Pence, who is married to one of President Donald Trump’s senior advisors, has tested positive for coronavirus.</p> 
  <p>The test result of Katie Miller, who is married to White House immigration adviser Stephen Miller, was revealed by Trump in a meeting with Republican members of congress on Friday.</p> 
  <p>“Katie, she tested very good for a long period of time and then all of a sudden today she tested positive,” Trump said. He noted that he had not personally been in contact with her but that she had spent time with the Vice President. “I understand Mike has been tested...and he tested negative.”</p> 
  <p>The news comes a day after it was revealed that Trump’s personal valet had tested positive for the virus.</p> 
  <p>The news of the infections has raised concern about the spread of coronavirus in the White House’s inner circle.</p> 
  <p>However, a senior administration official stressed that Trump and Pence have not been in recent contact with Miller, according to a media pool report referenced by Reuters. </p> 
  <p>White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has sought to defend administration efforts to protect Trump and Pence, including contact tracing and adherence to national guidelines.</p> 
  <p>“We’ve taken every single precaution to protect the president,” McEnany insisted to reporters at a White House news briefing on Friday. </p>

  <p>Here is an update from Will Costa in Asunción on the coronavirus pandemic in <strong>Paraguay:</strong></p> 
  <p>Escalating levels of COVID-19 infection in Brazil are causing concerns in the neighbouring country of Paraguay as large numbers of cases of the disease are being recorded among Paraguayan citizens returning across the border between the two countries.</p> 
  <p>Of 101 new reported cases of COVID-19 in Paraguay on Friday, <a href="https://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/2020/05/08/covid-19-confirman-101-nuevos-casos/">99 were from Paraguayans being held in compulsory quarantine centres after returning from Brazil</a>. This represented by far Paraguay’s largest daily jump in cases of the virus.</p> 
  <p>Paraguay has recorded some of the lowest levels of COVID-19 in South America—currently 563 cases of infection and 10 deaths. It was one of the first countries in Latin America to implement strict containment measures and on Monday also became one of the first countries in the region to <a href="https://www.efe.com/efe/america/sociedad/trafico-y-movimiento-en-el-primer-dia-de-cuarentena-inteligente-paraguay/20000013-4237879">ease total lock-down measures</a>.</p> 
  <p>In contrast, Brazil has the <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/americas/brazil-tops-latin-america-in-confirmed-covid-19-cases/1831928">highest levels of COVID-19 infection in Latin America</a> with 140,023 cases of infection and 9,600 deaths. The handling of the pandemic by the government of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticised.</p> 
  <p>In a press conference on Friday morning, Paraguayan health minister Julio Mazzoleni said, “There is a very high risk that Brazil could drag Paraguay down. That’s why we are taking the necessary measures of implementing holding centres, quarantine and restricted access to the country”.</p> 
  <p>Paraguayan land borders have been closed since March 24.</p> 
  <p>Local press reports that <a href="https://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/2020/05/05/endureceran-protocolo-para-definir-quienes-haran-cuarentena-en-sus-casas/">approximately one hundred Paraguayans</a> are continuing to arrive at the border at Paraguay’s second city, Ciudad del Este, each day in the hope of crossing back into Paraguay from Brazil. According to <a href="http://codehupy.org.py/declaracion-publica-de-la-secretaria-ejecutiva-sobre-la-inaceptable-situacion-humanitaria-en-el-puente-de-la-amistad/">the Paraguayan Human Rights Coordination Group (CODEHUPY)</a>, many of these people have been forced to wait in dire and unsanitary conditions on a bridge between the two countries while waiting to enter Paraguay and be housed in obligatory quarantine centres. </p> 
  <p>While the Paraguayan government has expressed its concerns about the high possibilities of importing the virus from Brazil, videos circulating on social media have also raised large concerns that very <a href="https://www.facebook.com/molimolinas/videos/10158327330034214/">poor conditions</a> within the quarantine centres are contributing to mass transmission among those being held.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.ip.gov.py/ip/abdo-benitez-verifica-mayor-control-en-la-frontera-con-brasil/">President Mario Abdo Benítez travelled to Ciudad del Este</a>, Paraguay’s second city, on Monday to inspect increased military presence along the Brazilian border. The Paraguayan military has also acted <a href="https://www.snt.com.py/actualidad/trincheras-contra-el-covid-19-en-pedro-juan-caballero-72858">to reinforce the famously open border</a> between the neighbouring cities of Pedro Juan Caballero (Paraguay) and Ponta Porã (Brazil) by digging a trench.</p>

  <p>Similar measures have been put in place across Latin America, and have been criticised by LGBT groups and transgender people, who say the restrictions have exposed them to discrimination and violence from people questioning their right to be out.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>US president </strong>Donald Trump has just said coronavirus “will go away without a vaccine”, but there may be “some flare ups next year”. </p> 
  <p>However he has said this may not be until after autumn, or next year, and did not offer any scientific evidence for that prediction.</p> 
  <p>“[Viruses] die too, like everything else,” he said.</p> 
  <p>On that cheery note - Trump is speaking at the moment with Republican members of Congress. I’ll update you with some of the highlights as we go.</p>

  <p>Local authorities in <strong>Germany </strong>are set to reimpose some lockdown measures, after seeing a spike in new coronavirus cases. </p> 
  <p>In North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s most populous state, there has been a rise in cases at a slaughterhouse in the Coesfeld district, with 150 of 1,200 employees testing positive for coronavirus. </p> 
  <p>The spike has caused local officials to postpone the lifting of restrictions, which would have seen restaurants, fitness studios, tourist spots and larger shops, open on 11 May, for one week. </p> 
  <p>However, the gradual reopening of schools and daycare centres will go ahead as planned. The state’s health minister, Karl-Josef Laumann, ordered the closure of the slaughterhouse and testing of all meat processing plant employees in the state. </p> 
  <p>It comes after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Wednesday that Germany could slowly return to normal, after the country’s infection rate slowed and mortality rate remained relatively low. <br></p> 
  <p>Germany’s 16 federal authorities are able to decide on the lifting of restrictions in their own state. <br></p>

  <p>The number of people in intensive care units (ICU) fell by 93, or 3%, to 2,868, the French Health Ministry said in a statement. This is well below half of the peak of 7,148 people in ICU, seen on April 8.</p> 
  <p>The number of people in hospital with coronavirus also fell to 22,724 from 23,208. This marks a continuation of an uninterrupted three-week fall, and is down 30% from an April 14 peak of 32,292.</p>

  <p><em>My colleague Julian Borger, the Guardian’s world affairs editor, has this update from Washington:</em></p> 
  <p>The US has stopped a vote on a UN Security Council resolution to support Secretary General Antonio Guterres’s call for a global ceasefire during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p> 
  <p>After more than six weeks of wrangling, France thought it had achieved a breakthrough last night. But the French underestimated the determination of the Trump administration when it comes to demonising the World Health Organisation.</p> 
  <p>The US mission wanted no references to the WHO in the resolution. So the French watered down the reference in the resolution to “specialised health agencies” of the UN (of which there is really only one - the WHO). </p> 
  <p>The US mission seemed to be on board last night, but this morning they signalled that the wording was still not acceptable, leaving western diplomats at the UN to suspect that someone high up in Washington must have intervened.</p>

  <p>African Americans in parts of New York City are being arrested for violating social distancing rules at a far higher rate than white people, according to data from the Brooklyn district attorney.</p> 
  <p>Adam Gabbatt reports that data showed that between 17 March and 4 May, 40 people were arrested in Brooklyn for breaking social distancing rules. One was white, four were Hispanic and 35 were black.</p> 
  <p>The figures lend weight to anecdotal evidence which suggests that whiter and more affluent areas of the city <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/coronavirus-new-york-police-enforce-social-distancing">are less likely to be targeted by police</a>. More than a third of the arrests were made in the predominantly black neighbourhood of Brownsville, while no arrests were made in the predominantly white neighbourhood of Park Slope.</p>

  <p>He is on a extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine, a form of life support used when a person’s heart or lungs are unable to function fully, the government’s news portal VGP News reported, and is being treated with antibiotics and dialysis.</p> 
  <p>Lung ultrasound scans indicate his right lung has collapsed, according to a Ministry of Health report published on Monday.

 <h2 class="block-title">Madrid denied permission to loosen lockdown</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Spanish government has refused the Madrid region permission to loosen its coronavirus lockdown, saying the area is not yet ready to move to the next phase of de-escalation.<br><br>The area in and around the capital is the region of Spain that has been hit hardest by the virus. More than 13,500 people have died there from Covid-19, or with associated symptoms, while 64,333 cases have been confirmed.</p> 
  <p>The health ministry said that while the region had sufficient care capacity, the detection capabilities of its primary medical facilities needed to be strengthened further.</p> 
  <p>The widely anticipated refusal of permission came 24 hours after the Madrid region’s director of public health resigned in protest at the Madrid regional government’s decision to seek a loosening of the lockdown from Monday.</p> 
  <p>In her resignation letter, Yoland Fuentes said that the bid to relax restrictions “was not based on health criteria”. </p> 
  <p>Spain’s deputy prime minister, the Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, went further, accusing the Madrid region’s conservative president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, of “playing with people’s lives” for political ends.</p> 
  <p>Díaz Ayuso hit back, saying Iglesias had no idea of the situation in Madrid and had “never lent a hand” there.</p> 
  <p>Spain, which has been under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe following the declaration of a state of emergency on 14 March, is easing its way out via a four-phase lockdown aimed at reaching “a new normality” by the end of June.</p> 
  <p>Spain reported 221 deaths on Friday, down from daily totals of more than 900 deaths a month ago. To date, the country has confirmed 222,857 cases and 26,229 deaths.</p>

  <p>Desperate times call for desperate measures and at one care home in Portugal, under severe coronavirus lockdown, that means employing a crane to facilitate meetings between residents and their loved ones, reports AFP.</p> 
  <p>“How are you?” Cremilde Pereira asks her older brother Jose from the crane that has parked her level with his first floor window.</p> 
  <p>“Like a bird in a cage!” replies the 79-year-old who is seated at his window in his wheelchair, flanked by two caregivers wearing clear plastic visors.</p> 
  <p>“When all this is over, you will have rice pudding and cake,” says 68-year-old Cremilde, regretting that she was not able to celebrate Jose’s birthday.</p> 
  <p>This visit marks the first time the pair have seen each other in two months of confinement.</p> 
  <p>“With everything that has happened in retirement homes, I am always worried about him,” says Cremilde, a former grocer.</p> 
  <p>Portugal as a whole has been relatively lightly touched by the pandemic with just over a thousand deaths. That has prompted the authorities to begin the process of loosening the lockdown from Monday but no date has yet been set for when retirement homes can welcome visitors again.</p>

  <p>With far more Indigenous languages than any other country in Central America, Guatemala faces a particular challenge in communicating information on the coronavirus, reports Jeff Abbott in Guatemala City.</p> 
  <p>“It is critical to inform the people in their language,” said Freddy Gálvez, who works with the Academy of Mayan Languages of Guatemala. “If we want to protect the lives of all Guatemalans, it is important that the state tell them what to do in their own languages,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Guatemala’s Indigenous populations - the Xinca, the Garifuna, and the 22 Mayan peoples - have historically faced intense discrimination and racism. Indigenous regions<a href="https://www.paho.org/salud-en-las-americas-2017/?p=3338"> suffer from</a> extreme economic inequalities, resulting in higher levels of poverty, lack of opportunity, and extreme levels of malnutrition, as well as lack of access to essential services such as education and health care.</p> 
  <p>While the 2018 census states that only 44 percent of residents of Guatemala identify as indigenous, according to Gálvez over 60 percent of the Guatemalan population speaks an indigenous language. Many of these people are monolingual or speak little Spanish.</p> 
  <p>The Guatemalan government has reported 832 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 23 deaths since 13 March.</p> 
  <p>The Academy of Mayan Languages of Guatemala is working with local translators to produce videos, radio spots, and materials for social media to provide communities with information and means of prevention.</p> 
  <p>Local mayors, Indigenous ancestral authorities, and activists have also launched campaigns in Indigenous languages in towns across the highlands to inform communities and to provide translations of government decrees through community radio stations, local television, and via social media.</p> 
  <p>Mauricio Méndez, the mayor of the Tz’utujil Maya town of San Pedro la Laguna in the Department of Sololá, is working to provide translations.</p> 
  <p>“The entire message about how to prevent coronavirus is translated to Tz’utujil,” said Méndez. “Our population is indigenous, we have our language, and that is how we communicate within our community.”</p> 
  <p>Critics say the government’s efforts to inform indigenous communities have largely been limited to information on prevention, leading to criticism.</p> 
  <p>“The President’s campaign is very weak,” said Byron Paredes, Indigenous Rights Defender with the Human Rights Ombudsman office.</p> 
  <p>Paredes also points out that there remains limited information about the curfew and other means taken to present the spread of the virus. Added to this, according to Paredes, there exists no state campaign in the Xinca or Garifuna languages.</p> 
  <p>“The Garifuna and Xinca languages are left out,” he said. “They have not received any information.”</p>

  <p>Dr Michael Ryan says that he and his colleagues also long to see and hug their families, but that social distancing is important to “protect those we love and to make sure we end this as quickly as possible”.</p> 
  <p>He says the WHO is looking at the whole selection of measures that have been introduced in different countries and then lifted, and they will examine the epidemiology of each of those. “A careful and measured return of those kind of normal activities of work and school - especially when they are done with density reduction” seems to work, he says, but mass gatherings are much more tricky. </p> 
  <p>We may have to live with a significant change to our lifestyles until we have a vaccine, he says. “But that isn’t necessarily all bad.” He says we have seen benefits to the environment and, in some ways, to our connectedness. Ryan finishes:</p>

  <p>Dr Michael Ryan says Russia is experiencing a “delayed epidemic” and could learn lessons from what has happened in asian countries and countries in western Europe. He says the country has increased its testing and and that that could be part of the reason for the increased number of cases, but that they have also seen increased deaths. </p> 
  <p>Ryan says the Russian government has shifted its approach, introducing strict social distancing rules. He says that the country is struggling, as many countries have struggled, with introducing “systematic contact tracing” when cases begin to rise very rapidly. One of the few countries to manage to do this to get on top of a big outbreak has been South Korea, says Ryan. But you need a “coherent, very well resourced and very well trained public health work force” for that.</p>

  <p><strong>Nemo Kim</strong> reports that a 31-year-old man tested positive on Thursday and a further 14 of his contacts were on Friday confirmed to be infected with the virus.</p> 
  <p>South Korea has won widespread praise for its “track and trace” model of containing the pandemic, which has used rigorous testing and isolation to reduce new cases to a handful a day – mostly from people arriving into the country – but not without privacy concerns.</p> 
  <p>Members of the gay community said they fear efforts to out them after a major media outlet, Kookmin Ilbo, reported that the man had been in gay clubs in the capital’s Itaewon district. Some social media users then posted video footage from its bars and clubs, urging followers for donations “to help put a stop to these disgusting goings-on”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Denmark to reopen theatres and cinemas on 8 June</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Denmark will reopen museums, theatres, cinemas, outdoor amusement parks and zoos on 8 June, the country’s government has said.</p> 
  <p>A restriction on gatherings, currently limited to 10 people, will also be revised to between 30 and 50 people depending on the type of event, AFP reports.</p> 
  <p>The announcement came hours after the Scandinavian country said it would allow shopping centres to reopen from 11 May, while restaurants, places of worship and schools for 11- to 15-year-olds would resume a week later. Bars, nightclubs and smaller concert venues will have to wait until sometime in August to reopen.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, most office workers will be allowed to return to work as soon as their workplace meets social distancing and hygiene regulations.</p> 
  <p>The timeline is the result of an agreement reached by political parties in parliament. “The parties note that the reopening is expected to lead to a rise in infections and hospital admissions,” a statement from the office of the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said.</p> 
  <p>She added that authorities would monitor the situation closely and restrictions would be reimposed in the event of a sharp rise in cases. </p> 
  <p>Denmark was among the first countries in Europe to roll out measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, doing so in mid-March. </p> 
  <p>Since the start of the epidemic, the country has recorded 10,281 cases, with 514 deaths. Deaths and infections are higher than its similarly-sized Nordic neighbours Norway, which has 7,995 cases and 209 deaths, and Finland with 5,673 cases and 255 deaths.</p> 
  <p>Sweden, which is about twice the size but has adopted softer measures than the other Nordic countries, has 24,623 cases and 3,040 deaths.</p>

  <p>Nearly 20,000 prisoners in <strong>South Africa</strong> are to be released to help curb the spread of Covid-19 in jails, the country’s president has announced.</p> 
  <p>Cyril Ramaphosa said around 19,000 low-risk inmates would be freed, following a United Nations call for countries to reduce their prison populations so that social distancing and self-isolation conditions can be observed.</p> 
  <p>South Africa, beset by high crime rates and violence against women and children, has 155,000 prisoners. The country of 58 million people has recorded 8,232 coronavirus cases of COVID-19 and 161 deaths. Ramaphosa said in a statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In South Africa, as in many other countries, correctional facilities have witnessed outbreaks of coronavirus infections among inmates and personnel.”</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>South Africa has registered 172 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and three deaths at its correctional facilities including inmates and staff, Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola said at a briefing outlining details of the release.</p> 
  <p>“We are confronted with a glaring impossibility of maintaining social distancing in our centres due to overcrowding,” said Lamola.</p>

  <p><strong>Italian</strong> opposition parties have filed a motion of no-confidence in <strong>Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede</strong>, who has come under fire over the release of 376 top mafiosi due to the risk of Covid-19 infection.</p> 
  <p>Since the beginning of the ourbreak, It<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/italy-dozens-of-mafia-bosses-set-for-release-due-to-coronavirus">alian judges set free hundreds of ageing mobsters suffering from specific illnesses because they are “at risk of complications in case of Covid-19 infection.”</a></p> 
  <p>Prosecutors, anti-mafia associations and parties have protested against the judges’ decisions, fearing mafia bosses could leverage the coronavirus crisis to secure their release.</p> 
  <p>Although Bonafede clarified last week that the decision to release Mafiosi was not taken by the government and called for a new norm to revise rules on releasing mafia bosses to house arrest, centre-right opposition filed a motion of no-confidence.</p> 
  <p>Bonafede, who is a member of the 5-Star Movement (M5S), told ANSA that the centre right’s move would mean “undermining confidence in the fight against corruption, the fight against the mafias, reforms to make trials shorter and more efficient, and measures to make sure no one goes unpunished”.</p> 
  <p>Mobsters recently released from prison and placed under house arrests include Cosa Nostra’s influential boss Francesco Bonura, 78, who was serving a 23-year sentence, and alleged ’Ndrangheta bosses Vincenzino Iannazzo, 65, and Rocco Santo Flipppone, 72. </p> 
  <p>Judges feared that a Covid-19 infection could be lethal for Filippone since he suffers from serious cardio-vascular disease. Another Cosa Nostra mafia boss, Franco Cataldo, 85, was released on Monday. Cataldo was among those convicted of kidnapping 15-year-old Giuseppe Di Matteo, son of informant Santino Di Matteo. The boy was later strangled and dissolved in acid at the orders of superboss Giovanni Brusca.</p>

  <p>In <strong>China</strong>, tickets for the first days of Shanghai Disneyland’s re-opening, after a three-month shutdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic, have sold out.<br></p> 
  <p>Disney fans have snapped up the chance to go to the park from Monday, with tickets no longer available on the park’s online booking service through to next Thursday. Entry to the attraction is also sold out on the following weekend, on May 16 and 17. </p> 
  <p>But, in a sign there is still some hesitation about large numbers passing in one place, the Chinese government has asked Disney to cap attendance of the re-opened park at 30% of capacity, or roughly 24,000 people, Disney CEO Bob Chapek said on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>The park was first closed on January 25 as the coronavirus pandemic took hold in the country, with the attraction among venues forced to shut to comply with social distancing rules. Disney, which later closed its other resorts worldwide as the coronavirus spread, shuttered its other parks across the globe with executives saying the closures will cost the company roughly $1 billion in profits.</p> 
  <p>In March, Disney re-opened some dining and shopping attractions at its Shanghai site, though its main theme park has remained closed.</p> 
  <p>Disney will restart operations with “far below” that number for a few weeks while it adjusts to new safeguards including social distancing, masks and temperature screenings for visitors and employees, Chapek said.</p>

  <p>Here’s an update on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/08/coronavirus-live-news-trump-cdc-guidance-russia-germany-france-brazil-who-190000-could-die-in-africa?page=with:block-5eb4fc858f08c0a2409b9f00#block-5eb4fc858f08c0a2409b9f00">the terrible news</a> that a group of migrant workers has been killed by a train in India – from our South Asia correspondent <strong>Hannah Ellis-Petersen</strong>.</p> 
  <p>India may have been under the world’s largest lockdown for almost two months but the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/i-just-want-to-go-home-the-desperate-millions-hit-by-modis-brutal-lockdown"> exodus of its tens of millions of migrant workers,</a> who, without any transport or any way to earn money have taken to walking sometimes thousands of miles in baking heat to get back home, has continued unabated.</p> 
  <p>In one of the most tragic incidents so far, it has emerged that 16 exhausted migrant workers, who were attempting to walk the 150 miles home to Bhusaval in the state of Maharashtra, died after falling asleep on the train tracks. According to Virendra Singh, the 22-year-old who was the only one of the group who survived, they had presumed that because trains had been stopped during lockdown, it would be safe to briefly rest on the tracks. They were run over at 5:15am on Friday morning by a train travelling from Mumbai.</p> 
  <p>“We wanted to go back to our village as for the past month and a half there was no work and no money,” said Singh. “We had started walking at 7pm on Thursday and at 4am everyone’s legs were in pain, and so we took a rest on the tracks. When I heard the train sound from the distance I screamed at them to move, but they were asleep and did not hear, and the train mowed them over.” The train tracks were left littered with the meagre possessions they were carrying, including battered shoes and the few <em>roti </em>they were surviving on.</p> 
  <p>India’s lockdown of its 1.3bn people has been described as one of the largest and harshest in the world, depriving the 80% of India’s workforce who work in the informal sector of a way of earning a living. Migrant workers who did not attempt to walk home have been confined to camps and reliant on food donations from government and NGOs.</p> 
  <p>Cases of coronavirus in India currently stand at 56,516, with 1,895 deaths. Experts say the country has not yet reached its peak.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">US unemployment surges to record levels</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>More than 20 million people in the US lost their jobs in April and the unemployment rate more than trebled as the coronavirus pandemic shuttered the global economy, triggering a financial crisis unseen since the Great Depression.</p> 
  <p>My colleagues in New York report an announcement by the Department of Labor that the US unemployment rate rose to 14.7% from just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/us-jobs-report-march-unemployment-coronavirus">4.4% in March</a> and a near 50-year low of 3.5% in February before the US was hit by the virus.</p> 
  <p>A decade’s worth of job gains have now been wiped out in under two months. The latest jobs losses are the worst monthly figure on record. The previous peak for unemployment was 10.8% in 1982 and the largest monthly job loss, close to 2m, came in September 1945 at the end of the second world war, when the country was demobilizing. April’s job losses also easily eclipsed the 800,000 jobs lost in March 2009, the height of the last recession.</p> 
  <p>“These are truly mind-blowing numbers,” said Jason Reed, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “We haven’t seen anything like this since the Great Depression.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Hong Kong eases social distancing measures</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hong Kong has begun to ease major social distancing measures today with bars, gyms, beauty parlours and cinemas reopening their doors, reports AFP.</p> 
  <p>Queues formed outside gyms in the semi-autonomous Chinese city on Friday morning for employees to check temperatures as people celebrated the return of some normalcy to the city.</p> 
  <p>Doris, a 39-year-old yoga teacher, said her first classes were already filled after weeks of teaching online. “I’m excited to share again... and see my students,” she told the news agency.</p> 
  <p>“I was quite impatient to get back to the gym,” added Alexandre, a 26-year-old finance worker after completing a workout in the city’s commercial district. “It shows that life is starting to get back to normal even though we haven’t been locked up like in Europe.”</p> 
  <p>The less health-conscious flocked to watering holes, some of which opened their doors as soon as the clock struck midnight.</p> 
  <p>“Last month we lost a lot of money,” bar manager Nikita told AFP as he received the first punters in four weeks. “But still, we are just super happy to be back open.”</p> 
  <p>Most of Hong Kong’s entertainment venues were shuttered in early April when the city suffered a second wave of infections – primarily residents returning from Europe and North America as the pandemic spread rapidly there.</p> 
  <p>But health officials have made impressive headway against the disease thanks to efficient testing, tracing and treatment programmes with just over 1,000 infections and four deaths.</p> 
  <p>New Covid-19 cases have been in the single digits for the last 18 days - with eleven days showing a zero tally. All new infections are residents returning from overseas who are quickly quarantined.</p>

  <p>The economic fallout from coronavirus has come to Silicon Valley, with major tech firms announcing layoffs in recent weeks, reports <strong>Kari Paul </strong>in San Francisco.</p> 
  <p>On Wednesday, Uber became the latest company to announce cuts, revealing in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will lay off 3,700 workers – roughly 14% of its global workforce.</p> 
  <p>Uber cited the pandemic in its filing, saying Covid-19 had affected its entire business, including financial performance, investments in new products, ability to attract drivers, and corporate strategy.</p> 
  <p>Uber’s announcement came after several other tech companies said they were making cuts amid the crisis.</p>

  <p>The Middle Eastern kingdom Jordan identified 21 cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, a disturbing rise after more than a week in which zero cases were recorded each day.</p> 
  <p>Jordanians had thought they were successfully eradicating the disease thanks to a harsh lockdown that has gradually started to be eased in the past fortnight.<br></p> 
  <p>Mafraq, a town on the Syrian border with a large refugee population, recorded 16 of the new cases and has been sealed off by authorities.</p> 
  <p>Elements of the lockdown that were supposed to be cancelled this week will remain in place as a result of the surge in infections.</p> 
  <p>The new cases have underscored that containing the virus is a long-term challenge and that it may be impossible to completely erase it from the country, especially as its borders to the outside world are reopened over the coming months.</p> 
  <p>Several hundred Jordanians have been repatriated in the past weeks and are being quarantined, including a group of students. They are supposed to be practising social distancing but video footage went viral this week showing them dancing a traditional “dabke” outside their caravans at the Dead Sea.</p> 
  <p>The video sparked outrage and the government announced on Thursday it had come up with a novel punishment for the young men: they have had their heads shaved.</p>

  <p>The Foreign Office has paid tribute to the British Gurkhas who rescued 109 UK nationals and 28 other nationals stranded in remote parts of Nepal.</p> 
  <p>Disclosing details of the mission, which took place last month, the government said they travelled more than 4,000 miles through the Himalayas to 13 different districts, negotiating river crossings and landslides, to reach the tourists scattered across dozens of mountainous towns, villages and national parks.</p> 
  <p>In some instances, the soldiers had to set up camp on the side of the road overnight to reach the tourists.<br></p> 
  <p>One, Sgt Prakash Gurung, drove nine and a half hours solo to Manang in the north-west of the country. The journey was almost aborted due to a landslide.<br></p> 
  <p>“I stepped up to volunteer because I thought it was a part of my job. Helping people in dire situations gives me a sense of satisfaction. The gratitude people expressed in messages has encouraged me to do more of this sort of work,” said Gurung, who is based in a barracks in Folkestone, Kent. <br></p> 
  <p>The UK ambassador in Nepal, Nicola Pollitt, said 700 British travellers were brought home with the help of the Gurkas. </p>

  <p>Israel’s weekly confirmed coronavirus cases have dropped below 500 for the first time following a strict eight-week lockdown that is being lifted in stages, reports the Guardian’s Jerusalem correspondent.</p> 
  <p>The health ministry said the total number of confirmed cases stood at about 16,300, with 42 new infections during the past 24 hours. In total, 240 people have died.</p> 
  <p>In recent days, Israel has reported fewer than 50 new cases a day, with recovers vastly overtaking new infections. Hospitals have begun to close coronavirus wards, although they have been kept on standby in anticipation of a possible second wave of infections.</p>

  <p>The Italian province of Bolzano-Alto Adige, located in the northern part of the country, which enjoys a high degree of autonomy in running its affairs, voted overnight to speed up the reopening of activities in phase two of the coronavirus emergency. Shops will reopen on Saturday and hairdressers, bars, restaurants and museums on Monday.<br></p> 
  <p>Last Monday, Italy, which has endured Europe’s longest lockdown, entered what the government has described as phase two of its coronavirus emergency. </p> 
  <p>Italians are now able to travel within regions to visit relatives, provided they wear masks, but schools, hairdressers, gyms and many other commercial activities will stay closed. Cafes and restaurants will offer takeaways only and all travel between regions will be banned except for work, health or emergency situations. Restrictions on funerals have been relaxed, with a maximum of 15 mourners allowed to attend, but masses and weddings will have to wait. </p> 
  <p>Millions of people were overcome with feelings of anger and disappointment as their hopes were dashed by what many described as a “false reopening”. Expectations had been high for a quick return to normality, especially in the south, where there have been fewer Covid-19 cases than in the north. The mood is sombre, not only because the virus, despite its slackening, continues to claim lives, but also because people are on edge after having been forced to stay at home for more than 50 days. </p> 
  <p>According to the latest decree introduced by the central government, bars, hairdressers and restaurants should fully reopen on 1 June; museums and retailers from 18 May. Factories already geared towards exports and public construction projects resumed activity last Monday.</p> 
  <p>Several regions, including Calabria and Sicily, are working on a plan to speed up the reopening before the date set by the central government. In the Italian autonomous province of Bolzano-Alto Adige, the nationwide rules will still apply for the closure of schools and universities and, so far, the ban on sporting events.</p>

  <blockquote> 
   <p>German exports have suffered the biggest collapse since reunification, as the country is starting to feel the effect of a slowdown in both the Chinese and European economy.</p> 
   <p>In March, German companies exported goods worth €108.9bn, the country’s statistics office announced today – an 11.8% decline from February, the most severe drop since records began in 1990.</p> 
   <p>Compared with March 2019, exports were down 7.9% year on year.</p> 
   <p>“Germany’s exports in March were being ground down by two millstones”, said Andreas Scheuerle, an expert for Germany’s saving banks finance group. “German exporters did not just feel the weakness of the Chinese market, but also the increasingly strong collapse of the European single market.” </p>

  <p><strong>An outbreak of coronavirus</strong> in the top-security Tehran prison housing most of <strong>Iran’s</strong> political prisoners has been confirmed by a jailed British-Iranian dual national, Anoosheh Ashoori. Although there have been rumours of an outbreak before, it is the first time the outbreak has been so directly confirmed.<br></p> 
  <p>Ashoori said inmate Loghman Roozchang showed symptoms of the disease very soon after returning from furlough this week. He and two of his brothers convicted of embezzlement had been placed in Hall 2 of Wing 4 of the prison on their return as part of a supposed 14-day quarantine.</p> 
  <p>But he was taken away on Tuesday to hospital and his brother on Thursday confirmed that he had been tested positive. The three brothers Yadollah, Loghman and Anvar are serving sentences of between 20 to 23 years.</p> 
  <p>Early in Iran’s outbreak in April tens of thousands of prisoners were released on furlough, including as many as half of the political or security prisoners, but with the official figures, until this week, showing a decline in new infections, prisoners have started to be instructed to return to jail.</p> 
  <p>The 66-year-old Ashoori was never released, since his conviction was longer than five years, although in practice this rule has been frequently overridden by the authorities.</p> 
  <p>Campaigners for Ashoori’s release say there is no logic to the quarantine in Hall 2 since the 14-day period is widely ignored and newly arrived prisoners are put in alongside those that have been in the hall for a few days. The campaigners say prisoners are also moving between halls so making the quarantine a largely symbolic exercise designed to satisfy the World Health Organization, the UN body that advises national governments on how to defeat the infection.</p> 
  <p><strong>Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</strong>, the best-known of the jailed British-Iranian dual nationals, had been kept in Evin for four years but was released on furlough in April and has spent the time on release at her parent’s home on a tag in Tehran. She is waiting to hear if she will be granted clemency or instead returned to jail. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has asked the UK ambassador to Tehran to visit her in an act of solidarity.</p> 
  <p>Tehran itself was hit by 5.1 earthquake on Thursday night, leading to civilians to rush into the streets for safety. Two are reported dead.</p>

  <p>The government has loosened the terms this week, with people allowed to take exercise and small businesses such as hairdressers receiving clients with restrictions to allow social distancing. </p> 
  <p>Under the next stage, bars, restaurants and places of worship will be able to open with limited capacity.</p>

  <p>The end to the strict lockdown in <strong>France</strong> does not mean an end to form-filling. </p> 
  <p>Anyone travelling more than 100km after Monday will need to have an “imperative” professional or personal reason and carry sworn declarations to that effect. To enforce the regulations, extra police and gendarmes will be posted on major roads, motorways, service stations and popular holiday destinations.</p> 
  <p>We now have more details on what those “imperative” reasons might be.<br></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Work. If your journey is more than 100km you may – it’s not clear entirely yet – need an <em tabindex="-1">attestation</em> from your employer stating the journey is necessary. There are obvious exceptions to the 100km rule including transport workers. </li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Family emergency. If you need to travel more than 100km to take urgent care of a child or sick relative. Just visiting a family member is not allowed. People can travel to funerals, but there is a limit on gatherings to 10 people.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Moving house. Only if this cannot be postponed and you face being homeless ie, your current lease is ending.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Returning home. Foreign nationals have the right to return to their home country. French people who fled the lockdown to second homes can return to their main residence even if it’s over 100km but journeys in the opposite direction will not be allowed.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Medical appointments, legal and administrative procedures.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The 100km limit is the total length of the journey as the crow flies from your home address but you can travel between departments whatever its colour on the coronavirus map. The government has helpfully put online <a href="https://www.geoportail.gouv.fr/faq">a tool that allows people to calculate the distance</a>. As well as the declarations and <em>attestations</em> you will need something proving your principal address like an utility bill or rental contract.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">UK will take "tentative steps" out of lockdown, says government minister</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Much of the <strong>UK</strong> is on tenterhooks, waiting to see what lockdown measures - if any - will be relaxed on Sunday, when the prime minister Boris Johnson will make an announcement. </p> 
  <p>While the UK government has talked down the extent of any impending changes, this morning the country’s culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said the prime minister would set out <strong>“tentative” steps leading out of the lockdown</strong>. </p> 
  <p>Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We can start to look to the future but we’ll have to do so in a very tentative and cautious way, so people should not expect big changes.</p> 
   <p>If there is any indication that things are starting to get out of control, we won’t hesitate to step back.</p> 
   <p>But people should be able to look forward to the weeks and months ahead to know where we are going and the order in which we are doing it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Northern Ireland’s first minister, Arlene Foster, </strong>reiterated that any changes made to its lockdown measures – extended for another three weeks on Thursday – would be “minor” and “nuanced” in order to keep the “R-rate” of infection below 1.</p> 
  <p>She said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We don’t want to take any chances that it will go above the number 1 again. Everything will stay as it is.</p> 
   <p>We don’t just look at the public health, of course that is the priority, we do have to look at the economic damage that is being done to our country and the societal damage and the wider health issues we have to take into account as well.</p> 
   <p>We will look to see if we can make minor amendments within those three weeks.</p>

  <p><strong>South Korean</strong> health authorities are investigating a small but <strong>growing coronavirus outbreak</strong> centred in a handful of Seoul nightclubs, seeking to keep infections in check as the country moves to less restrictive social distancing measures, Reuters reports. </p> 
  <p>The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said on Friday at least 15 people have confirmed cases of the virus linked to the clubs in Itaewon, a neighbourhood popular with Koreans and foreigners in the city.</p> 
  <p>South Korea has reported only a handful of cases in recent days, the majority of them in people arriving from overseas. The nightclub infections, while still limited, are expected to increase, and come at a time when the country has eased some social distancing restrictions.</p> 
  <p>KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong said:</p>

   <p>These venues have all the dangerous conditions that we were the most concerned about. We think it is necessary to strengthen management for such facilities and we urge you to refrain from visiting such facilities as much as possible.</p>

  <p>You can read my colleague <strong>Andrew Roth</strong>’s report on <strong>Russia</strong> becoming Europe’s coronavirus hot spot below. </p> 
  <p>Here’s an excerpt:</p> 
  <p>Russia has the highest growth rate of infections in Europe and as of Thursday has the fifth highest number of cases in the world, surpassing Germany and France. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/russias-prime-minister-self-isolates-after-covid-19-diagnosis">Mikhail Mishustin</a>, the Russian prime minister, and two other cabinet members have fallen ill.</p> 
  <p>Putin’s approval ratings have dropped to their nominal lowest in 20 years, the independent Levada Centre said, and the IMF has forecast that the country’s economy will contract by 5.5% this year. Russia’s official death toll has remained mercifully low for the number of cases, although medics are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned">dying at worrying rates</a>.</p> 
  <p>In discussions with his subordinates, Putin at times has looked deeply bored. As his health minister discussed regional payouts on Wednesday, the president distractedly rolled a pen back and forth across his desk, lost in a moment of reverie broadcast nationwide.</p> 
  <p>“Putin not only doesn’t control the situation but he cannot even plan how to change the agenda,” said Nikolay Petrov, a senior research fellow at the British thinktank Chatham House. “He cannot adjust … I think partly Putin’s lack of activism is connected to the fact that he is out of his normal position.”</p> 
  <p>[...]</p> 
  <p>The Kremlin’s desire to carry out its political programme has appeared at odds with its response to the epidemic. Putin held off on cancelling the symbolic vote until late March and the Victory Day parade until mid-April, with thousands of soldiers being sent into quarantine as a preventive measure.<br></p> 
  <p>“It appears the Kremlin was too focused on the constitutional and political reforms and not the epidemic,” said Petrov. “The epidemic came later to Russia and it was possible to be better prepared.”</p> 
  <p>One thing is clear: this is not the time to hold a public vote that could backfire over the Kremlin’s response to the epidemic. Analysts have suggested that it could be cancelled entirely, or delayed until the autumn when political conditions are more favourable.</p>

  <p><strong>Over in Greece</strong> this morning news has broken that a former health minister, and respected heart surgeon, has succumbed to coronavirus, writes <strong>Helena Smith in Athens</strong>. </p> 
  <p>Dimitris Kremastinos, 78, was admitted to a hospital in Athens two weeks ago where he was described as having waged an intense battle against the virus. <br></p> 
  <p>Tributes poured in for the British-trained doctor politician, with Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis saying the world of science had lost a respected figure who had worked “with dignity, responsibility and efficacy.” </p> 
  <p>Kremastinos, an MP until last year, had been health minister under the late socialist leader Andreas Papandreou. As the most high-profile casualty of the virus in Greece his death was announced by the current health minister Vassilis Kikilias. </p> 
  <p>Greece has recorded one of the lowest infection rates in Europe to date, after enforcing draconian lockdown measures early on. A total of 2,678 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been recorded and 148 deaths with health ministry officials saying the country, which hopes to open up to tourists in July, has almost “flattened the curve.” </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">WHO: supporting domestic violence victims is not "optional"</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, the WHO Regional Director for Europe</strong> has called for more action from every country that has seen a surge in <strong>domestic violenc</strong>e during the coronavirus pandemic, saying “violence remains preventable, not inevitable”. But if steps are not taken the world could see 31 million cases of gender-based violence, he warned. </p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>WHO is deeply troubled by the reports from many countries, including Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Russian Federation, Spain, UK, and others of increases in interpersonal violence – including violence against women and men, by an intimate partner and against children - because of the COVID-19 response.</p> 
   <p>Although data is scarce, Member States are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year, compared to last. Online enquiries to violence prevention support hotlines have increased up to 5 times. </p> 
   <p>Our UN partner UNFPA has sounded the alarm loud and clear – if lockdowns were to continue for 6 months, we would expect an extra 31 million cases of gender-based violence globally. Beyond the figures, only a fraction of cases is ever reported. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He added that governments and local authorities should consider it to be a “moral obligation” to make sure services are available, while calling on communities to look out for their friends, family and neighbours and speak out. </p> 
  <p>To victims, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Violence against you is <em>never</em> your fault. It is <em>never</em> your fault. Your home should be a secure place. Get in touch -safely- with family, friends, shelters or community groups that have your safety and security at heart.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">German exports see worst month-on-month decline since 1990 reunification</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Moving away from that very sad news now to Germany, where exports plunged by 11.8% in March, their worst month-on-month fall since the country’s 1990 reunification, statistics authority Destatis said Friday.</p> 
  <p>The data illustrated the first monthly impact of the coronavirus epidemic on Europe’s biggest economy. The drop was far steeper than a five percent forecast from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.</p> 
  <p>Some €108.9bn (US$118 billion) of German goods were sold abroad, while the country bought imports worth €91.6bn - down by 5.1% from the level in February. The bigger plunge in exports than imports reduced Germany’s widely-criticised trade surplus to €17.4bn, compared with €22.3bn a year before, Reuters reports. </p> 
  <p>In Germany, late March brought the first shutdowns of much of public life to limit the spread of the coronavirus. But some vital trade partners like Italy and China had already been battling the disease for weeks or months by the time such decisions fell in Berlin and regional capitals.</p> 
  <p>In a geographic breakdown, March brought a bigger fall for exports to Germany’s European Union neighbours, at 11.0% from March 2019, compared with a 4.3%-drop in shipments to the rest of the world.</p> 
  <p>Exports to the eurozone single currency area were particularly hard-hit, falling by 14%. </p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>An Indian train killed 14 migrant workers who had fallen asleep on the track on Friday while they were heading back to their home village after losing their jobs in a coronavirus lockdown, police said.<br><br>Tens of thousands of people have been walking home from India’s big cities after being laid off because of the lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus since late March, Reuters reports. The driver tried to stop the freight train when he saw the workers on the tracks in the western state of Maharashtra, the railway ministry said, adding it had ordered an inquiry.<br><br>Fourteen people were killed and five were injured, said a railway spokesman, CH Rakesh.</p> 
  <p>“I have just heard the sad news about labourers coming under the train, rescue work is underway,” railway minister Piyush Goyal said on Twitter.<br><br>Under the lockdown, all public transport has been suspended so migrant workers heading home often have to walk long distances to get there.

  <h2>Global report: China ‘open to cooperate’ with WHO on virus origin as Trump repeats lab claim</h2> 
  <p>China has said it is “always open to cooperate” with World Health Organisation (WHO) investigations into the origins of the coronavirus, as Donald Trump repeated claims that the outbreak originated in a Wuhan laboratory.</p> 
  <p>China has denied the claim, for which the US is yet to provide evidence.</p>

  <p>The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, claimed earlier this week he had seen “enormous evidence” that the virus had originated at the lab, but has not released any evidence.</p> 
  <p>Pompeo has since walked back his remarks, <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-michael-r-pompeo-with-jack-heath-of-the-jack-heath-radio-show/">telling a US radio station on Thursday</a>: “there’s evidence that it came from somewhere in the vicinity of the lab, but that could be wrong.”</p> 
  <p>Chinese officials and state media have reacted harshly to the claims, accusing Trump, Pompeo, and US officials of blaming China to cover up US failings in its outbreak-response, and seeking to improve Trump’s electoral chances.</p>

  <p>As the UK prepares to celebrate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ve-day">VE Day</a>, the institutional order created by the west following the defeat of Germany, and on which Johnson’s vision rested, seems after 75 years finally to be coming apart.

  <p>Covid-19, an invisible enemy, but deadlier than the blitz, has exacerbated and accelerated trends recalibrating risk, revealing new Great Powers and placing all UK diplomatic alliances under scrutiny.

  <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Friday the coronavirus pandemic keeps unleashing a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering and appealed for an all-out effort to end hate speech globally,” AP reports. <br><br>The UN chief said anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and in the streets, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have spread, and Covid-19-related anti-Muslim attacks have occurred.</p> 
  <p>Guterres said migrants and refugees have been vilified as a source of the virus and then denied access to medical treatment.<br><br>With older persons among the most vulnerable, contemptible memes have emerged suggesting they are also the most expendable, he said.

  <h2>Coronavirus could ‘smoulder’ in Africa for several years, WHO warns</h2> 
  <p><em>The Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jasonburke">Jason Burke</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/emmanuel-akinwotu">Emmanuel Akinwotu</a> report: </em></p> 
  <p>The Covid-19 pandemic could “smoulder” in Africa for several years after killing as many as 190,000 people in the coming 12 months, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization">World Health Organization</a> has said.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/africa-coronavirus-cases-hit-10-million-months-200417055006127.html">The WHO warned</a> last month that there could be 10m infections on the continent within six months, though experts said the pandemic’s impact would depend on governments’ actions.</p> 
  <p>A study released by the organisation this week predicts that between 29 million to 44 million people could become infected in the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail. This “would overwhelm the available medical capacity in much of Africa” where there are only nine intensive care unit beds per million people.</p> 
  <p>“While Covid-19 likely won’t spread as exponentially in Africa as it has elsewhere in the world, it likely will smoulder in transmission hotspots,” said the director of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization">World Health Organization</a>’s Africa region, Dr Matshidiso Moeti. “Covid-19 could become a fixture in our lives for the next several years unless a proactive approach is taken by many governments in the region. We need to test, trace, isolate and treat.”</p> 
  <p>The research looked at 47 countries in the WHO African Region with a total population of one billion.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://africacdc.org/covid-19/">More than 51,000 people</a> in Africa have been infected and 2,012 have died. The total number of cases has risen sharply in the past week.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Global death toll nears 270,000</strong><strong>. </strong>The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 268,999, according to <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which has tracked the spread of the virus. There are 3,846,949 confirmed cases.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>US death toll passes 75,000.</strong><strong> </strong>The US death toll from coronavirus has now <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">surpassed 75,000 people</a>, according to the counter from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths in the US are the highest globally at 75,447, a rise of around 2,000 in a day, followed by the UK at 30,689 deaths.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>Record daily deaths in Mexico. </strong>Mexico’s health ministry on Thursday reported 1,982 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections and 257 additional fatalities, the most lethal day since the pandemic reached the Latin America’s second largest country.</li> 
   <li><strong>US President Donald Trump continues to push theory that virus originated in a lab, without evidence. </strong>“Something happened,” Trump told US reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,” the US president added during a meeting with the Texas governor. It comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen “enormous evidence” that the virus had originated at the lab. No evidence has been produced. China<strong> </strong>has denied the claims.<strong> </strong><br></li> 
   <li><strong>White House reportedly blocking release of CDC guidance on reopening businesses. </strong>A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was abruptly shelved by the White House, according to AP News. The document includes step-by-step guidance on how and when local authorities should allow businesses to reopen and life to resume as normal.</li> 
   <li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/australia-hits-back-at-us-claim-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab?CMP=share_btn_tw">Australia hits back at US claim linking coronavirus to Wuhan lab</a>. </strong>The Australian government has pushed back at US claims the coronavirus may have originated in a Wuhan lab and has determined that a “dossier” giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document.</li> 
   <li><strong>Australia outlines three-step plan for easing restrictions. </strong>Australia’s Prime Minister, Scott Morrison outlined the steps the country will take to achieve a “Covid-safe economy in July of this year”. However, the final decisions on the easing of restrictions remains in the hands of state governments. </li> 
   <li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/trump-valet-coronavirus-positive-us">Trump tests negative for coronavirus after report valet was infected</a>. </strong>Donald Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence<strong>,</strong> have tested negative for coronavirus after finding out that a member of the US military who worked on the White House campus had become infected, a White House spokesman said. The military official was identified by CNN as personal valet to the US president.</li> 
   <li><strong>US unemployment claims hit 33.3 million. </strong>A further 3.2 million Americans sought unemployment benefits last week as the economic toll from coronavirus continued to mount.</li> 
   <li><strong>WHO study: 190,000 people in Africa could die from virus. </strong>Up to 190,000 people could die of Covid-19 during the first year of the pandemic if containment measures fail, according to a study by the World Health Organisation (WHO) based on prediction modelling and analysing 47 countries in the region.</li> 
   <li><strong>France virus deaths fall.</strong> France reported 178 new coronavirus deaths, a fall on the previous day, and saw its number of patients in intensive care drop under 3,000 for the first time since late March.</li> 
   <li><strong>International tourism to plunge by up to 80%. </strong>The number of international tourist arrivals could plunge by 60-80% in 2020 owing to the coronavirus, the World Tourism Organization has said.</li> 
   <li><strong>Russia overtakes Germany and France after record rise in cases. </strong>Russia overtook France and Germany for coronavirus cases on Thursday, giving it the fifth-highest total in the world at 177,160. Donald Trump offered to send medical aid to Moscow during a phone call with Vladimir Putin<strong>,</strong> the Kremlin said.</li>

 <h2 class="block-title">India boosts output of anti-malarial drug hyped by Trump</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>India has ramped up output of an anti-malarial drug hailed by US President Donald Trump as a “game-changer” in the fight against coronavirus, even as its pharmaceutical industry struggles to make other key medicines in a lockdown, AFP reports. </p> 
  <p>Drug companies have seen demand for hydroxychloroquine soar since March when Trump’s remarks sparked a run on the medication and caused a global shortage - despite health agencies warning over its safety in the treatment of Covid-19.</p> 
  <p>India accounts for 70% of global production of hydroxychloroquine, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Despite the challenges, Indian companies have managed to export the medicine to 97 countries during the pandemic, the health ministry said.</p> 
  <p>To meet the growing demand, Ipca Laboratories, one of four key makers of hydroxychloroquine, is increasing output by a third to 130 million tablets a month in May - despite having only 40% of its 18,000 workers on deck.</p> 
  <p>Zydus Cadila, another major producer, said it would boost production tenfold to about 150 million tablets a month in May.</p>

  <p>North Korea condemned the South on Friday for holding military drills, saying the situation was returning to before the diplomatic rapprochement of 2018, as leader Kim Jong Un - whose health was the subject of intense speculation in recent weeks - reached out to traditional ally Beijing, Reuters reports. <br></p> 
  <p>Kim sent Chinese leader Xi Jinping a diplomatic communication congratulating him for China’s “success” in controlling the novel coronavirus epidemic, the state news agency KCNA reported.</p> 
  <p>The nuclear-armed North has closed its borders to try to protect itself from the disease that first emerged in its giant neighbour, and insists it has not had any cases even as the virus has swept across the world.</p> 
  <p>Kim told Xi he was as pleased with China’s successes as his own, KCNA reported, adding he “sent militant greetings to every member of the Communist Party of China”.</p> 
  <p>Rumours swirled for weeks about Kim’s health after he failed to appear at the 15 April celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather, the North’s founder – the most important day in the country’s political calendar – until he reappeared at the weekend at a factory opening.</p> 
  <p>Kim’s temporary disappearance triggered a series of unconfirmed reports and fevered speculation over his condition, while the United States and South Korea insisted they had no information to believe the conjectures were true.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Australia outlines three-step plan for easing restrictions</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Australia’s Prime Minister, Scott Morrison is speaking now. He is outlining the steps the country will take to achieve a “Covid-safe economy in July of this year”.</p>

  <p>There are three steps: <br><br><strong>Step one</strong> will “enable greater connection with friends and family”<br></p> 
  <p>Things that will be allowed include:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Gatherings up to 10 people, and five guests in your own home.</li> 
   <li>Children back in classrooms and in playgrounds in their communities.</li> 
   <li>Recreational activities such as golf, lap swimming and boot camps.</li> 
   <li>Retail and small cafes and restaurants reopening.</li> 
   <li>Interstate recreational travel, starting again.</li> 
   <li>An easing of restrictions for funerals.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Step two,</strong> Morrison says, “will allow larger size gatherings up to 20 people, including for venues such as cinemas and galleries, more retail openings on sector-based Covid-safe plans, organised community sport, and beauty parlours, and you’ll be pleased to know, barre classes open once again.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Step three,</strong> Morrison says, will see gatherings of up to 100 people. But its timing, he says, will depend on the success of the previous steps.</p> 
  <p>“But most workers, by then, will be back in the workplace. Interstate travel will likely resume. Pubs and clubs with some restrictions will be open. And also possibly gaming venues. As I said, steps three, step three, but also step two, will get greater definition as we move through the success of step one.”</p>

  <p><em>Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian’s South-east Asia correspondent, and Aanya Piyari have this report: </em></p> 
  <p>Trouble is brewing for the world’s tea producers as the coronavirus lockdown shut down the harvest in several important regions, including the picking of India’s “champagne of teas”.</p> 
  <p>Despite forecasts of increased demand from drinkers stuck at home across the world, producers have become frustrated by the enforced quarantining of their workforce, with India’s output expected to drop by 9% in 2020.</p> 
  <p>Lockdown measures in the north-eastern Indian state of Assam halted work for more than a month. The global coronavirus outbreak escalated at the worst possible time for Indian tea producers, just as the most valuable harvest of the year was ready to be plucked.</p> 
  <p>India has very specific production periods, experts said, called flushes. The prized first flush of Darjeeling, the “champagne of teas” harvested in the country’s north-eastern, has been severely hit. This harvest, which is generally picked between March and April, accounts for as much as 40% of annual revenue.</p> 
  <p>Other tea exporting countries, including China, Sri Lanka and Vietnam, have also experienced disruption, though Kenya - the main supplier of tea to the UK - has so far avoided major problems. The International Tea Committee has predicted the country may see output rise<strong> </strong>by 15% this year.</p>

  <p>Also Thursday, the government said four unaccompanied Guatemalan minors tested positive for the novel coronavirus after being deported by Mexico this week, AP reports. <br><br>The cases are the first that the government has acknowledged for deportees arriving from Mexico. The three boys and one girl all teenagers arrived by bus Monday, said Anaeli Torres, director of Special Protection and Non-Residential Attention for Guatemala’s social welfare agency.</p> 
  <p>All four arrived with paperwork from Mexico certifying that they were asymptomatic and Torres said they continue to be asymptomatic. But the government is testing all minors when they arrive before sending them back to their families, she said.</p> 
  <p>Since the cases were identified, the adolescents have been moved to the appropriate health services, Torres said. She also called on Guatemalans living near shelters where deported children are housed to not stigmatise them.</p> 
  <p>Virus fears have led to aggressive rejection of deportees in some communities.<br><br>They have the right to return to their country and a dignified family reunification,” Torres said.<br><br>Ten other children who arrived with them from Mexico were still awaiting their test results, according to Torres.</p>

  <p>A Guatemalan man deported from the United States tested positive for the new coronavirus, the government said Thursday, despite assurances from US authorities that the Guatemalans had been tested and were negative before being flown back to their country, AP reports. </p> 
  <p>The man arrived Monday on a flight carrying 75 Guatemalan migrants, all of whom had paperwork stating they had been tested and were not infected.<br><br>But an employee of Guatemala’s Health Department speaking on condition of anonymity said the man was one of 10 migrants chosen at random for a test after he returned. He was the only one who came back positive.<br><br>There was no immediate explanation for the conflicting results, but it appears some of those tests may have been done a week before they were deported.<br><br>Prior testing had been a condition for Guatemala to accept the resumption of deportation flights, after the Guatemalan government reported at least 100 deportees from the United States tested positive for the virus after arriving in Guatemala in recent weeks. Those cases led the government to twice suspend deportation flights from the US. <br></p>

  <h2>US senators propose renaming street outside Chinese embassy after Wuhan whistleblower</h2> 
  <p>US lawmakers have proposed renaming the street in front of the Chinese embassy in Washington after the late Wuhan doctor punished for warning about the spread of coronavirus, a step sure to outrage Beijing.</p> 
  <p>The measure would rechristen the section of the Washington street in front of the embassy “Li Wenliang Plaza”, instead of the innocuous current name of International Place.</p> 
  <p>Li was one of a group of doctors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/li-wenliang-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-profile">who shared posts on social media</a> in December warning that a virus was spreading in Wuhan.</p> 
  <p>He was reprimanded by police and made to sign a statement promising not to commit any more “law-breaking actions.”</p> 
  <p>He died from the illness in February, triggering a nationwide outpouring of grief and a rare apology by police for his treatment.</p> 
  <p>“We’ll ensure the name Li Wenliang is never forgotten – by placing it permanently outside the embassy of the nation responsible for the deaths Dr Li tried to prevent,” said Tom Cotton, a Republican senator known for his hawkish views on China.</p>

  <p>A black lawmaker came to Michigan’s capitol with an escort of armed black citizens on Wednesday, days after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism">white protesters with guns</a> staged a volatile protest inside the state house, comparing the Democratic governor’s public health orders to “tyranny”.</p> 
  <p>The state representative Sarah Anthony, 36, said she wanted to highlight what she saw as the failure of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan">Michigan</a> capitol police to provide legislators with adequate security during the protest, which saw demonstrators with rifles standing in the legislative chamber above lawmakers.</p> 
  <p>“When traditional systems, whether it’s law enforcement or whatever, fail us, we also have the ability to take care of ourselves,” she told the Guardian. Anthony became the first African American woman elected to represent her district in Lansing, Michigan’s capital, in 2018.</p> 
  <p>One of Anthony’s constituents, a black firefighter, organized Wednesday’s capitol escort. While early reports focused on three black men with large rifles escorting Anthony, there were six participants, including two women, and some of them were armed with handguns, Lynn said. Five of the participants are black and one is Hispanic. Michael Lynn Jr, a Lansing resident, said he was frustrated to see his legislator being violently intimidated in her workplace. He said the escort was the first time he had ever chosen to openly carry his AR-15 rifle.</p>

  <h2>Two piglets for a kayak: Fiji returns to barter system as Covid-19 hits economy</h2> 
  <p><em>Talei Tora reports for the Guardian from Suva:</em></p> 
  <p>Two piglets for a pre-loved kayak, a taxi fare in exchange for fresh produce, hot cross buns for online tutoring, an old carpet for a professional photography session, vegetable seedlings for homemade pies, and offers to have backyards cleaned for prayers.</p> 
  <p>These are just a few examples of the hundreds of barter trades that are taking place across Fiji since a Facebook page “Barter for Better Fiji” was created a few weeks ago in response to sharp falls in employment due to coronavirus. The page now has more than 100,000 members, in a country of just under 900,000 people.</p> 
  <p>The Pacific region has largely been spared the Covid-19 outbreak. According to the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, as at the end of April, there had only be recorded cases in six Pacific countries and territories, which between them have reported 260 cases and seven deaths. </p> 
  <p>However, most Pacific nations closed their borders due to coronavirus fears and are feeling the impact of the suspension of international travel. The IMF has forecast a 2.7% decline in growth for the Pacific Island Countries (PICs) with a 40% decline in tourism across the region.</p>

  <p>South African Breweries, one of the world’s largest brewers, says it may have to destroy 400 million bottles of beer as a result of the country’s ban on alcohol sales that is part of its lockdown measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus, AP reports. <br><br>South Africa stopped all sales of alcohol when its lockdown came into effect on March 27 and the brewery has seen beer pile up at its production facilities. The brewer is seeking special permission from government to move the beer to other storage facilities. The transport of alcohol has also been outlawed in South Africa.<br><br>SAB told news station eNCA on Thursday that if it’s not able to move the beer, which amounts to about 130 million litres (34 million gallons), it’ll be forced to discard it at a loss of about $8 million. That loss would put 2,000 jobs at risk, SAB said.</p> 
  <p>It would also be frustrating news for millions of thirsty South African beer drinkers who are going without.<br><br>South Africa is one of just a handful of countries that have prohibited alcohol sales as part of its fight against the coronavirus. India and Thailand also had bans on alcohol sales, but recently lifted their restrictions.

  <p>In case you missed it, here is the full story on the Trump administration’s decision to bury a document from the US Centers for Disease Control: </p> 
  <p>The Trump administration shelved a document created by the nation’s top disease investigators with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places during the still-raging coronavirus outbreak.</p> 
  <p>The 17-page report by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team, titled Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework, was researched and written to help faith leaders, business owners, educators and state and local officials as they begin to reopen.</p> 
  <p>The AP obtained a copy from a second federal official who was not authorised to release it. The guidance was described in AP stories last week, prior to the White House decision to shelve it.</p> 
  <p>The Trump administration has been closely controlling the release of guidance and information during the coronavirus pandemic that scientists are still trying to understand, with the president himself leading freewheeling daily briefings until last week.</p> 
  <p>Traditionally, it’s been the CDC’s role to give the public and local officials guidance and science-based information during public health crises. During this one, however, the CDC has not had a regular, pandemic-related news briefing in nearly two months. Dr Robert Redfield, the CDC director, has been a member of the White House coronavirus task force, but largely absent from public appearances.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hello and welcome to today’s live global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> 
  <p>I’m Helen Sullivan, and I’ll be taking you through the latest news from around the world for the next few hours. </p> 
  <p>The White House has reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/trump-buries-cdc-report-coronavirus-reopening">shelved a document created by the nation’s top disease investigators</a>, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places during the still-raging coronavirus outbreak.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile Trump has again claimed the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan, but provided no evidence. </p> 
  <p>The Australian government has hit back at the claim, saying that it has determined that a “dossier” giving weight to the theory is not a Five Eyes intelligence document, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/australia-hits-back-at-us-claim-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab?CMP=share_btn_tw">but instead a compilation of open-source material</a> – reports and studies that were publicly available. The identity of the author remains unclear.</p> 
  <p>Here are the most important recent developments: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Global death toll passes 265,000</strong><strong>. </strong>The total number of coronavirus deaths across the world has reached at least 268,999, according to <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins University</a>, which has tracked the spread of the virus. There are 3,836,215 confirmed cases. </li> 
   <li><strong>US death toll passes 75,000.</strong><strong> </strong>The US death toll from coronavirus has now <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">surpassed 75,000 people</a>, according to the counter from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths in the US are the highest globally at 75,447, a rise of around 2,000 in a day, followed by the UK at 30,689 deaths. </li> 
   <li><strong>US President Donald Trump continues to push theory that virus originated in a lab, without evidence. </strong>“Something happened,” Trump told US reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the theory that the coronavirus was released from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “Probably it was incompetence. Somebody was stupid,” the US president added during a meeting with the Texas governor. It comes after US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed he had seen “enormous evidence” that the virus had originated at the lab. No evidence has been produced.
