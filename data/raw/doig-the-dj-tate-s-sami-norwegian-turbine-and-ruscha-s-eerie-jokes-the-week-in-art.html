Wendy Porter, a nurse at the hospital, is seen here standing in the staircase of the North Wing at St Bartholomew’s hospital in London, which contains The Pool of Bethesda and The Good Samaritan – two large-scale murals by the British painter. It opened to all on Monday after a £9.5m restoration project. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/06/restored-hogarth-murals-london-hospital-open-public-st-bartholomews">Read the full story</a></p> <h2>What we learned</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/oct/09/somerset-saved-my-sanity-don-mccullin-at-90-in-pictures">Country days in Somerset saved Don McCullin’s sanity</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/06/i-sometimes-have-the-feeling-that-things-are-alive-the-sinister-silicone-gun-art-of-lisa-herfeldt">Happiness is a warm silicone gun for Lisa Herfeldt</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/oct/08/this-is-a-west-african-story-how-modern-art-tackled-nigerias-identity-crisis">Independence for Nigeria freed the minds of its artists</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/07/betty-parsons-review-scintillating-seaside-adventures-from-the-woman-behind-giants-like-rothko">Weekends for art dealer Betty Parsons were strictly for painting her own work</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/07/nordic-noir-review-severed-head">The British Museum’s Nordic Noir show is scarily poor</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/09/wayne-thiebaud-review-courtauld-gallery-london">Wayne Thiebaud’s still lifes of sweets and cakes are a taste of the American dream</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/oct/08/david-hockney-don-bachardy-christopher-isherwood-california-queer-art">Don Bachardy recalled how Hockney painted him for a landmark work of queer art</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2> <p><strong>Flood Waters </strong><strong>by Claude Monet, 1896</strong></p>    <p>Here comes the flood, as the great impressionist records an unexpectedly apocalyptic scene. Floods in art are usually biblical. Artists including Uccello, Michelangelo and Poussin painted the deluge as a divine punishment by God, leaving sinners drowning or scrambling for tiny rocks while Noah survives in the Ark. But there is no such sacred meaning here. Monet is simply observing a bit of bad weather. Stranded at his home in Giverny by local flooding in autumn 1896, he used the time to paint this gloomily entrancing view of a water-covered field. Barren trees rise like spectres from the grey swamp as the drowned earth merges with mists above. This is a starker, grimmer version of Monet’s waterlily paintings: as in those dreamy decorations, he melts and mirrors one reality into another, sky reflecting water, but here the effect is haunted, even nightmarish. <br><a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/claude-monet-flood-waters">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in Touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
