<p>Bendigo Bank’s phone app and e-banking services have been restored after an hours-long outage just one day before Christmas.</p> <p>The bank confirmed the problem just after 9am on Tuesday morning, with Osko payments also impacted. By 12.30pm, services had been restored.</p> <p>“We apologise for any inconvenience and thank our customers for their patience,” the bank said.</p> <p>At the time cards, ATMs, branch services and incoming payments were unaffected, the bank had said.</p> <p>“We appreciate your patience while we work to restore service and understand this is a busy time of year for all,” it said.</p> <p>Bendigo Bank’s post to Facebook garnered more than 300 comments in roughly half an hour, with some claiming issues with online banking were a regular occurrence, happening multiple times in a month.</p> <p>“This is happening more and more with the Bendigo Bank app,” one user wrote. “I’ve banked with Bendigo for around 30 years and I’m seriously considering changing banks because I’ve been caught without app access so many times now.”</p> <p>One user wrote: “I am in a country town where they don’t have a [branch] so I am stuck.” Another said they were in the same situation: “If I don’t do the [trek] to town soon there won’t be a Christmas lunch in this house.”</p> <p>“This happens way too often,” another user wrote, with another person claiming they had trouble paying for fuel.</p> <p>ANZ users in New Zealand experienced an internet banking outage at a similar time on Tuesday, though ANZ Australia systems were operating normally. Services in New Zealand were restored by early afternoon.</p>
