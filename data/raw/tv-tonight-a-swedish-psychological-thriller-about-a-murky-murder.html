<h2>Jana: Marked for Life</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Four</strong></p> <p>A Swedish psychological thriller based on the bestselling novel by Emelie Schepp about a steely public prosecutor. It opens with a double bill – Jana Berzelius (Madeleine Martin) is put on the case of the murder of a high-ranking member of the Swedish Migration Agency, whose face is familiar. Then, when another body is found with the murder weapon, she recognises strange scarring on the body. What ensues is an investigation into her own troubled upbringing. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Doctor Who</h2> <p><strong>6.45pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>You are cordially invited to the event of the season, as the resurgent Who channels Bridgerton for a lavishly costumed mashup. In 1813, the Doctor and Ruby are cutting a rug at a fancy ball. But who or what keeps bumping off guests? Jonathan Groff from Mindhunter co-stars as a smouldering Mr Darcy-a-like with a secret. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>In With a Shout for Soccer Aid</h2> <p><strong>6.55pm, ITV1</strong></p> <p>The football fundraiser is back this week, and to celebrate Lionesses Lianne Sanderson, Laura Coombs and Izzy Christiansen unite for a game of a totally different kind. Will they be able to raise £20,000 for Unicef by shouting what they see on the screens in front of them? <em>HR</em></p> <h2>A Royal Guide to Scotland</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>Where in Britain do the royals feel most at home? Judging by Queen Elizabeth II’s Balmoral getaways and Prince William’s St Andrews uni hijinks, it must be Scotland. But how did this affinity originate? And do the Scottish people return the sentiment? <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2>Rebus</h2> <p><strong>9.15pm, BBC One</strong></p> <p>This impressively intense take on the Ian Rankin novels benefits from a fine lead performance from Richard Rankin (no relation). Its depiction of Edinburgh borders on dystopian: this week, the criminal underworld is rendered more terrifying still by the arrival of a group of former soldiers working in enforcement roles. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Later … With Jools Holland</h2> <p><strong>10.15pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>Erstwhile chart-topper Gabrielle is back with a new album. She’ll be performing alongside Yorkshire indie-rockers Yard Act, Kiwi singer-songwriter Jordan Rakei, Big Thief frontwoman Adrianne Lenker and south London’s Fat Dog. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Poolman, out now, Prime Video</strong></p>    <p>In this jolly, silly California noir pastiche, civic-minded Los Angeles pool cleaner and Erin Brockovich stan Darren (Chris Pine) finds himself investigating a conspiracy involving a councillor and property developers. But his city hall contact is the very femme fatale-ish June Del Rey (DeWanda Wise) – so does that make him a useful idiot in someone’s plot? Pine’s debut as director and co-writer is a studied mashup of The Big Lebowski and Chinatown, with Lynchian top notes and a star-laden supporting cast of Annette Bening, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Danny DeVito. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <p><strong>The Royal Hotel, 10pm, Sky Cinema Premiere</strong></p> <p>It doesn’t quite have the levels of anarchic terror of its most obvious forebear, Australian new wave classic Wake in Fright, but Kitty Green’s outback drama conjures up a similar atmosphere of incipient male violence. Julia Garner (who starred in Green’s previous film The Assistant) and Jessica Henwick play American backpackers seeking quick cash by working at the titular pub in a rural mining town. Amid casual sexism, bar brawls and murky new friendships, the duo struggle to negotiate a macho world that threatens to devour them. <em>SW</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Women’s Challenge Cup Rugby League: Leeds Rhinos v St Helens, 11.15am, BBC Two </strong>The final at Wembley Stadium.</p> <p><strong>Men’s Challenge Cup Rugby League: Warrington v Wigan, 2pm, BBC One </strong>The final at Wembley Stadium.</p> <p><strong>Tennis: French Open, 2pm, Eurosport 1 </strong>The women’s singles final.
