<p>Good morning. Firearm ownership is surging in Australia and the gun lobby has been mobilising against new laws, as explored in our new gun control series launched today.</p> 
<p>Plus, tens of thousands marched across the country yesterday in a show of support for Palestine, calling for an end to Australia’s arms trade with Israel and sanctions. And internationally, the Russian foreign minister has claimed Vladimir Putin does want a peace deal in Ukraine, while denying his country had bombed civilian targets.</p>
