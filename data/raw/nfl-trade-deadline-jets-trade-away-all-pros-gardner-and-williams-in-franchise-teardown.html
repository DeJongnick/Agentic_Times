<p>The Indianapolis Colts have acquired two-time All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets in a stunning trade ahead of Tuesday’s NFL deadline, according to multiple reports.</p> <p>In exchange, the Colts will send two first-round picks to New York, marking one of the most significant deals of the season. Gardner, the No 4 overall pick in the 2022 draft, has quickly established himself as one of the league’s premier defenders, earning All-Pro honors in each of his first two years.</p> <p>“New York it’s been real,” Gardner posted with a green heart emoji <a href="https://x.com/iamSauceGardner/status/1985764144117690757">on X</a>.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/iamSauceGardner/status/1985764144117690757">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New York it&#39;s been real💚</p>&mdash; SAUCE GARDNER (@iamSauceGardner) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamSauceGardner/status/1985764144117690757?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2025</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>The move comes just months after Gardner signed a four-year, $120.4m extension with the Jets – a deal that made him one of the highest-paid cornerbacks in NFL history. His departure signals a major shift for New York’s defense, which was built around his lockdown coverage skills. The Jets look set for a rebuild after slumping to a 1-7 record this season. The franchise has not made the playoffs since the 2010 season, the longest drought in the NFL.</p> <p>For the 7-2 Colts, the trade represents a clear push toward Super Bowl contention. With Gardner joining a secondary that already ranks among the league’s top units, Indianapolis are betting big on an elite defense to power their playoff run.</p> <p>It was the first of two massive trades by Jets general manager Darren Mougey before the deadline Tuesday. New York also agreed to trade defensive lineman Quinnen Williams to the Dallas Cowboys for a second-round pick in 2026, a first-round pick in 2027 and defensive tackle Mazi Smith, two people with knowledge of the deal told the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the teams hadn’t announced the trade.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the Cowboys acquired linebacker Logan Wilson from the Cincinnati Bengals for a seventh-round pick on Tuesday. Hours before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/nov/04/nfl-report-arizona-cardinals-beat-dallas-cowboys-jacoby-brissett">the Cowboys lost to the Arizona Cardinals</a> on Monday night to fall to 3-5-1, owner Jerry Jones said the team had a deal in place to add a player who could improve the defense.</p> <p>Wilson had requested a trade after his playing time decreased for the Bengals, who have the league’s worst defense. The Cowboys traded two-time All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons to Green Bay before the season, leaving a huge void that Wilson doesn’t fill.</p> <p>“Some guys have the ability to see a certain key and, at the same time, take a step up in the hole,” Jones said on his radio show on 105.3 The Fan. “He knows how to get in the gaps right now. ... For what we need right now, he can come in immediately and help us at linebacker.”</p> <p>Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman, who led the Cowboys to three Super Bowls in the 1990s, mocked the deal during the ESPN broadcast of Monday’s loss to the Cardinals.</p> <p>“He may want to cancel that trade,” Aikman said. “I don’t think one player from what I’ve seen tonight is going to make a difference for this group.”</p> <p>NFL teams had until 4pm EST on Tuesday to make a trade.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles have been aggressive. General manager Howie Roseman continues adding players to a talented roster to improve the team’s chances for a repeat.</p> <p>Since the Eagles (6-2) last played a game, they’ve acquired edge rusher Jaelan Phillips and cornerbacks Michael Carter II and Jaire Alexander.</p> <p>Phillips, who came from Miami on Monday for a third-round pick, immediately bolsters the pass rush. The 2021 first-round pick had three sacks in his last five games for the Dolphins. All of Philadelphia’s edge rushers combined have three sacks this season.</p> <p>Carter gives the defense a veteran slot cornerback to allow defensive coordinator Vic Fangio more flexibility to use Cooper DeJean outside. Alexander, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, is a low-risk, high-reward acquisition.</p> <p>The Baltimore Ravens also added an edge rusher, getting Dre’Mont Jones from Tennessee for a conditional fifth-round pick. Jones has 4.5 sacks this season so he’s an upgrade for the Ravens (3-5) at a position of need.</p> <p>Several trades already went down last month. The Bengals acquired Joe Flacco. The Rams got cornerback Roger McCreary. Defensive end Keion White went to the 49ers. Safety Kyle Dugger was traded to the Steelers. The Jaguars and Browns swapped cornerbacks Greg Newsome II and Tyson Campbell.</p> <p>The Chargers added edge Odafe Oweh in a deal that sent safety Alohi Gilman to the Ravens.</p> <p>There are some high-profile players who could be on the move. Bengals All-Pro edge rusher Trey Hendrickson and Jets running back Breece Hall are among the biggest names being mentioned in trade speculation.</p>
