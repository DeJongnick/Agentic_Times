 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We’re wrapping up this live coverage now after the day’s events at the UN. You can read our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/22/arab-and-muslim-leaders-to-meet-trump-to-discuss-peace-plan-for-gaza">full report here</a>, and below’s a recap of the key news lines. Thanks for reading.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>French president Emmanuel Macron officially recognised a Palestinian state at the United Nations </strong>on Monday, spurring a wave of western moves to do the same despite fierce resistance from Israel and the US.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Macron told a two-state solution conference he convened with Saudi Arabia that the war in Gaza should end </strong>and “the time has come to do justice for the Palestinian people”<strong>.</strong> He called for Hamas-held hostages to be freed and for an end to “the bombings of Gaza, the massacres and the displacement”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Macron set out a plan for a UN-mandated international stabilisation force in postwar Gaza</strong>. “The time for peace has come, as we are just moments away from no longer being able to seize it,” he told the general assembly. </p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Palestinian Authority hailed France’s “historic and courageous” decision</strong> and its delegation gave him a standing ovation.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Australia, Britain, Canada and Portugal also recognised a Palestinian state</strong>, raising pressure on Israel as it intensifies its war in Gaza. <strong>Monaco, Belgium,</strong> <strong>Andorra, Malta and Luxembourg then all recognised</strong>, bringing the total number of recognitions to three-quarters of UN membership.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>UN secretary general António Guterres said statehood was a “right, not a reward” for Palestinians</strong>. “Nothing can justify the horrific 7 October terror attacks by Hamas or the taking of hostages. And nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.”</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel and the US – its chief ally – boycotted the summit</strong>, which ended late on Monday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Arab and Muslim leaders are set to meet President <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a></strong> in New York to discuss their separate plan for a stabilisation force in Gaza.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Germany, Italy and Japan are among major US allies that declined to recognise a Palestinian state</strong>. Spain, Ireland and Norway gave recognition in May, with Sweden in 2014.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed not to allow a Palestinian state, saying “it will not happen</strong>”. Israeli UN ambassador Danny Danon said Israel “will take action” over the recognition announcements. “They are not promoting peace, they are supporting terrorism.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump believed that recognising Palestinian statehood “is a reward to Hamas”</strong>, the White House said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, urged Israel not to respond to the new recognitions</strong> by annexing parts of the West Bank, saying: “Settler expansion threatens the very viability of a Palestinian state.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas called on Hamas to surrender its weapons to his Palestinian Authority</strong>. Addressing the summit virtually after the US refused to allow him to attend, Abbas said: “We also condemn the killing and detention of civilians, including Hamas actions on October 7 2023.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The wave of recognition of a Palestinian state is historic but unlikely to immediately change the situation on the ground in Gaza</strong>, reports Agence France-Presse, which quoted the International Crisis Group’s Israel-Palestine project director, Max Rodenbeck, as saying: “Unless backed up by concrete measures, recognising Palestine as a state risks becoming a distraction from the reality, which is an accelerating erasure of Palestinian life in their homeland.”<br><em>With AFP and agencies</em></p></li>

  <p>Just to recap, the US and Israel boycotted today’s two-state conference at the UN. Israeli UN ambassador <strong>Danny Danon</strong> said Israel would discuss how to respond to the announcements of recognition after prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> returned to Israel next week. </p> 
  <p>“Those issues were supposed to be negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians in the future,” Danon told reporters ahead of the conference. </p> 
  <p>Netanyahu is scheduled to meet <strong>Donald Trump</strong> on 29 September in Washington before returning to Israel, as Reuters reports. </p> 
  <p>Netanyahu has rejected repeated calls to end Israel’s military offensive until Hamas is destroyed and has said a Palestinian state “will not happen”, calling recognition of statehood a “prize” for Hamas. </p> 
  <p>The US has told other countries that Palestinian recognition will create more problems, secretary of state <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> said this month.</p>

  <p>Australian prime minister <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> is preparing to meet the French president on the sidelines of the UN general assembly as he defends Australia’s recognition on Sunday of Palestinian statehood. </p> 
  <p>Ahead of his third official meeting with <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong>, Albanese addressed the leaders’ summit on a two-state solution and compared the plight of Palestinians to that of the Jews before the creation of Israel, the Australian Associated Press reports.</p> 
  <p>“In recognising Palestine, Australia recognises the legitimate and long-held aspirations of the Palestinian people,” Albanese said. “It means real hope for a place they can call home.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is the same hope that sustained generations of Jewish people.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In his speech to the conference – which has now wrapped up – Albanese also urged the Israeli government to “accept its share of responsibility” for the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Analysis: Allies’ recognition of Palestine angers Netanyahu but his options for response are limited</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to denounce the recognition of a Palestinian state by many of Israel’s historic allies, but the prime minister may be struggling to decide how to turn rhetoric into a concrete response.</p> 
  <p>His options are perhaps more constrained than he would have his supporters believe. He has variously threatened annexation of occupied Palestinian land and bilateral action against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/19/what-uk-recognition-palestine-state-will-mean">countries that joined the tide of recognition</a>.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>laying formal claim to part or all of the West Bank would jeopardise the Abraham accords</strong>, the historic agreement that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/15/uae-bahrain-and-israel-sign-historic-accords-at-white-house-event-formal-relations-trump-netanyahu">normalised ties with regional powers</a> including the United Arab Emirates.</p> 
  <p>That deal was perhaps the <strong>most high-profile foreign policy achievement of Donald Trump’s first presidency</strong>, cited in nominations for the Nobel peace prize he openly covets, and one of Netanyahu’s own landmark achievements.</p> 
  <p><strong>The UAE, one of its most important partners, has already said annexation is a “red line”</strong>, and the <strong>deal’s collapse would carry a high risk of alienating Netanyahu’s single most important supporter</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Israel chose a bilateral response to Ireland, Norway and Spain when they recognised a Palestinian state last year, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cl77drw22qjo">including withdrawing ambassadors</a>.</p> 
  <p>Doing the same thing now, when so many key allies have followed suit, would be far more complicated – and could harm <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> far more than its targets, former Israeli diplomats said.</p> 
  <p>It would accelerate Israel’s trajectory towards the isolated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/netanyahu-super-sparta-vision-israel-economic-future-isolation">“super-Sparta” status</a> that Netanyahu celebrated last week and then backed away from after public outrage and economic warnings.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Arab and Muslim leaders to meet Trump to discuss peace plan for Gaza</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/patrickwintour">Patrick Wintour</a><em> and </em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/roth-andrew">Andrew Roth</a> <em>in New York</em></p> 
  <p>As I reported earlier, <strong>Arab and Muslim leaders are to meet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> in New York tomorrow to discuss their plan for a UN-mandated international stabilisation force in Gaza</strong> as France plans to join the UK, Canada and Australia in recognising Palestine as a state.</p> 
  <p>The recognition of Palestine by France and five other states is due to play out in dramatic fashion later today on the floor of the UN general assembly as France and Saudi Arabia co-chair a summit to discuss the future of a two-state solution, a road map to peace that Benjamin Netanyahu has declared a dead-end.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, derided the session as an “embarrassing political circus” and the US has warned its allies that the recognition of Palestine could lead to a “reciprocal” Israeli reaction, <strong>setting the scene for a major diplomatic crisis as world leaders meet in New York for the 80th anniversary of the UN</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The Trump meeting, scheduled after his address to the UN’s general assembly, is the <strong>most direct engagement between the White House and Arab states on post-ceasefire plans for Gaza</strong> since he was elected president for a second time.</p> 
  <p>Trump is expected to deliver an aggressive speech decrying “globalist institutions” on Tuesday which he will claim have “have significantly decayed the world order”, a White House spokesperson said in a briefing.</p> 
  <p>The US president is also expected to meet leaders from Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. <strong>Nothing Trump has done so far suggests that he shares the view held by the Gulf states that the PA is a viable alternative to Hamas, or should be considered a partner for peace</strong>. He has imposed sanctions on PA officials and banned Mahmoud Abbas, its 89-year-old leader, from coming to New York to speak to the UN.</p> 
  <p>Arab leaders see the meeting as <strong>a chance to pin down Trump on whether he supports the Arab League’s proposals for Gaza’s future, or even a variation put to him by a working group led by Tony Blair, the former UK prime minister, and Jared Kushner, who is the president’s son-in-law</strong>. Neither of the reconstruction plans proposes the mass expulsion of Palestinians, a proposal that Trump at times has appeared to support. The Blair plan does not clearly endorse the PA as the long-term administrators for Gaza.</p> 
  <p><strong>The Arab states are likely to insist they will not join any international force unless the reformed PA is given a future role.</strong> <strong>They also want a roadmap to a two-state future that excludes further Israeli settlements or annexation of the West Bank</strong>.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">US and Israel 'will not take part in this charade', Israel's UN ambassador says ahead of summit</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Danon said a two-state solution was taken “off the table” after the 7 October attack, adding that both the US and Israel “<strong>will not take part in this charade</strong>”, referring to the imminent meeting in which France and others will recognize Palestine.</p> 
  <p>Danon also expressed disappointment towards French president Emmanuel Macron.</p> 
  <p>“On October 8, you stood with Israel, you spoke about the hostages. Today you’re moving on, you’re leaving the hostages behind,” he said referring to the countries with plans to recognize Palestinian statehood.</p> 
  <p>“Many leaders today will speak about the future when Hamas will not be part of Gaza, but I will ask them: who is going to do that?” Danon said. “The responsibility is on our shoulders.”</p>

  <p>As we’ve been reporting, <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> has indicated that France will join several other western governments that have recognized Palestine, as he prepares to host a meeting with Saudi Arabia on the moribund idea of a two-state solution.</p> 
  <p>“<strong>They want a nation, they want a state, and we should not push them towards Hamas,</strong>” Macron said on Sunday, adding that outside recognition of Palestinian aspirations would help isolate the armed group.</p> 
  <p>AFP reports that Macron also said he would make the <strong>release of hostages</strong> taken by Hamas during its October 7, 2023, attack on Israel <strong>a precondition for opening a French embassy to the Palestinian state</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s foreign ministry said that recognition does not “promote peace, but on the contrary further destabilizes the region and undermines the chances of achieving a peaceful solution”.</p> 
  <p>Israel said it would skip an emergency UN security council meeting on Gaza on Tuesday <strong>because of the Jewish New Year, calling the timing “regrettable”</strong>.</p> 
  <p>More than 140 world leaders are descending on New York this week for the annual United Nations general assembly, which will be dominated by the Palestinian crisis.</p>

  <p><strong>Israeli military forces are likely to mount new attacks into parts of Gaza now crowded with hundreds of thousands of displaced people once they have concluded their current offensive into Gaza City, a former Israeli national security advisor and general has said.</strong></p> 
  <p>Yaakov Amidror, who served as national security adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu from 2011 to 2013 after decades in the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), said that the “hard core” of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a> was in Gaza City but that “another chapter” could follow after the offensive there: an attack into the “central camps” area further south.</p> 
  <p>“The campaign in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> City will be three months of intensive [fighting] then six months to clear it [of Hamas fighters] so there is no threat from there and then we decide about the central camps,” Amidror said.</p> 
  <p>The “central camps” refers to the heavily built-up Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza. Both are packed with displaced Palestinians from elsewhere in Gaza, and have been repeatedly subjected <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/05/1162996%20during%20recent%20months.">to airstrikes</a>.</p> 
  <p>Aid officials working in Gaza told the Guardian that they had been “warned off” investing substantial resources in new facilities in the central camps area during recent discussions with Israeli military officials.</p> 
  <p>“Our clear understanding from those conversations was that the IDF would be going in there, though it wasn’t clear if that meant now or after they’re done in Gaza City,” one said.</p>

  <p>Italy’s grassroots unions, which represent hundreds of thousands of people ranging from schoolteachers to metalworkers, called for a 24-hour general strike in both public and private sectors, including public transportation, trains, schools and ports.</p> 
  <p>The strike caused disruptions across the country, with long delays for national trains and limited public transport in major cities, including Rome, AP reported.</p> 
  <p>In Milan, tensions escalated when dozens of protesters dressed in black and armed with batons tried to smash the main entrance of the city’s central train station, throwing smoke bombs, bottles and stones at police, who responded with pepper spray. In Bologna, police used water cannons to disperse a crowd of demonstrators who blocked a highway.</p> 
  <p>The transit of goods was slowed or partially blocked by workers’ sit-ins and rallies in Italy’s main ports of Genoa and Livorno. More than 20,000 people gathered in front of Rome’s central station to protest the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

  <p>Earlier this month, Israel ordered the demolition of all homes built without permits in Qatanna and Qubeiba - the hometowns of the attackers, and said 750 people from the town would have their work permits revoked.</p>

  <p><em>Jason Burke, our international security correspondent, has explored how the</em> wave of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/21/uk-recognises-palestine-as-an-independent-state">international recognitions</a> of a Palestinian state has been received by politicians across the political divide in Israel and how Israel’s increasing isolation on the international stage may affect the government’s standing.</em> <em>Here is an extract of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/22/wave-of-recognitions-of-palestinian-state-criticised-by-israeli-politicians">his story</a>:</em></p> 
  <p>Israel’s prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>, leads the most far-right government in Israel’s history and his coalition is in part dependent on the continuing support of <a href="https://www.hartman.org.il/israel-at-war-the-paradox-of-religious-zionism/">extremist religious Zionist factions</a>, which have a messianic vision of Israel’s destiny, and <a href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/b1yl5kczex">ultra-Orthodox religious parties</a>.</p> 
  <p>Neither are likely to be influenced by international outrage at the conduct of the war in Gaza, where an Israeli offensive has killed more than 65,000 and devastated the territory, or the continued expansion of settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p> 
  <p>Nor are supporters of the more mainstream, rightwing Likud, which Netanyahu leads.</p> 
  <p>Gideon Rahat, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, said that in the short term at least Netanyahu and his allies would be strengthened by the “diplomatic tsunami”, as it has been called by local media, that Israel was facing.</p> 
  <p>“There are many people in Israel who are worried about international isolation, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/netanyahu-super-sparta-vision-israel-economic-future-isolation">most are not Netanyahu supporters and especially not his base</a>,” said Rahat.</p> 
  <p>This may change, however, as isolation deepens, and could become a factor with politically significant centrist voters at elections, which have to be held before November next year.</p> 
  <p>Dr Shira Efron, distinguished Israel policy chair and senior fellow at the Rand Corporation, said that recognition was viewed in Israel as a “zero-sum game”.</p> 
  <p>“The view is that if you are for the self-determination of the Palestinians, you are necessarily against Israel,” she said. “The fear is that if it can happen in the UK or in France, then it can happen anywhere.”</p>

  <p><strong>Arab and Muslim leaders are to meet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> in New York to discuss their plan for a UN-mandated international stabilisation force in Gaza after France joined the UK, Canada and Australia in recognising Palestine as a state.</strong></p> 
  <p>Israel has warned that it might respond to the recognition of Palestine by annexing the West Bank, citing claims from Hamas that recognition by allies of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> was a victory for the terror group.</p> 
  <p>France has said the plan for a stabilisation force would marginalise Hamas by disarming the group and excluding it from power.</p> 
  <p>The proposal, which is due to be endorsed on Monday at a UN conference on Palestinian statehood, includes a UN-mandated force to provide security in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> as well as oversee the disarmament of Hamas and help train a Palestinian Authority (PA) police force.</p> 
  <p>The Arab League declared in July that Hamas must play no further role in governance, with power handed to a newly elected PA to govern Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Hamas would be required to hand over its weapons to the authority.</p> 
  <p>The Trump meeting, scheduled after his address to the UN’s general assembly, is the most direct engagement between the White House and Arab states on post-ceasefire plans for Gaza since he was elected president for a second time.</p>

  <p><strong>Some French mayors have defied government orders and flown Palestinian flags on town halls, with more expected to follow suit as France prepares to formally recognise a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly.</strong></p> 
  <p>It’s unclear how many cities will join the initiative on Monday after Socialist leader Olivier Faure’s call to fly the flags despite warnings from the Interior Ministry against such displays in a country with both Europe’s largest Jewish and Muslim populations, AP reported.</p> 
  <p>But the call has been gaining momentum as Palestinian flags have been more and more visible in France over the nearly two-year war in Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Palestinian banners were on display in demonstrations this week during a big day of protests across the country that criticised several polices by French president Emmanuel Macron and his government.</p> 
  <p>The Palestinian flag has been flying at the town hall of Malakoff, a suburb of Paris, since Friday. The city mayor, Jacqueline Belhomme, told the Associated Press on Sunday she was ordered to take it down but refused to comply.</p> 
  <p>“We stand with the Palestinian people; it is something symbolically important, just as we did some time ago with the Ukrainian flag when we stood with the Ukrainian people who were under attack by Russia.”</p>

  <p>While he welcomed the decision, the first minister also urged the government to go further, including imposing sanctions on members of the Israeli government, pulling out of the free trade deal with the country and ending all military cooperation with Israel.</p> 
  <p>Also calling for the UK to join South Africa’s case against Israel at the International Court of Justice and commit to executing International Criminal Court arrest warrants, the first minister said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a historic moment for the people of Palestine which should have come long ago.</p> 
   <p>I have been clear that the UK’s recognition of the State of Palestine should have been unconditional, but this decision goes some way towards acknowledging the UK’s solemn and historic responsibility towards all peoples of the region.</p> 
   <p>While this announcement is welcome news, this is just the first step towards establishing the two-state solution.</p> 
   <p>I urge the UK government to take further action to accelerate peace including continuing to call for an immediate ceasefire and the resumption of free flowing aid.</p> 
   <p>The international community must use all its energy to persuade and pressurise Israel to end the violence and return to a peace process.</p>

  <p>Palestine’s ambassador to the UK, <strong>Husam Zomlot</strong>, has addressed a crowd in front of the Palestine Mission in central London during a special ceremony to mark its transition to becoming Palestine’s embassy in the country after the UK formally recognised Palestine as an independent state yesterday.</p>

  <p>“In the same capital of the Balfour Declaration, after more than a century of ongoing denial, dispossession and erasure, the UK government has finally taken the long overdue step of recognising the state of Palestine,” he added.</p> 
  <p>The UK is to recognise a Palestinian state based provisionally on 1967 borders, before Israel occupied the Gaza Strip and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>. It will also pave the way for full diplomatic relations.</p>

  <p>This snippet is from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/19/what-uk-recognition-palestine-state-will-mean">an explainer</a> written by my colleagues Patrick Wintour and Archie Bland:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>There are two different criticisms. Israel and the US claim that recognition is a reward for the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023. Israel also claims the Palestinian Authority leadership is endemically corrupt, repressive and that the promise to hold elections has been repeatedly made, only to be deferred. They claim no partner for peace exists.</em></p> 
   <p><em>A second criticism is that the two-state solution has become a diplomatic fig leaf, and a relic of the past dating back to the 1993 Oslo accords that proposed a Palestinian state on 1967 borders. </em></p> 
   <p><em>These critics argue the emotions ingrained by 7 October mean support for the concept has drained away on both sides of the divide.</em></p> 
   <p><em>In a new book, Tomorrow is Yesterday, two veteran negotiators – Robert Malley and Hussein Agha – describe the two-state solution as a meaningless distraction and a performative notion used by diplomats for 30 years to avoid finding real solutions. </em></p> 
   <p><em>They say without practical steps to force Israel engage, “the offer of recognition won’t change the life of a single Palestinian”.</em></p>

  <p>The UN investigators cited examples of the scale of the Israeli killings, aid blockages, forced displacement and the destruction of a fertility clinic to back up its genocide finding.</p> 
  <p>The 1948 UN Genocide Convention defines genocide as crimes committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such”. To count as genocide, at least one of five acts must have occurred.</p> 
  <p>The UN commission found that Israel had committed four of them: killing; causing serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the Palestinians in whole or in part; and imposing measures intended to prevent births.</p> 
  <p>It cited as evidence interviews with victims, witnesses, doctors, verified open-source documents and satellite imagery analysis compiled since the war began two years ago.</p> 
  <p>Israel is fighting allegations at the world’s top court, the international court of justice, of committing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/09/explainer-what-is-the-icj-and-what-is-south-africas-claim-against-israel">genocide in Gaza</a>. Israel has denied the claims.</p>

  <p>UN investigators said last week they had determined that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> has committed “genocide” in Gaza since October 2023, with the “intent to destroy the Palestinians” in the territory.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations">United Nations</a> independent international commission of inquiry (COI), which does not speak on behalf of the UN, found that “genocide is occurring in Gaza and is continuing to occur”, said its head, Navi Pillay.</p> 
  <p>“When clear signs and evidence of genocide emerge, the absence of action to stop it amounts to complicity,” she added. “All states are under a legal obligation to use all means that are reasonably available to them to stop the genocide in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>.”</p>

  <p>The report concluded that Israel’s prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>, as well as its president, <strong>Isaac Herzog</strong>, and the former defence minister <strong>Yoav Gallant</strong>, had “incited the commission of genocide” and that Israeli authorities had “failed to take action against them to punish” this incitement.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Daniel Meron, called the report a scandalous and fake “libellous rant” that had been authored by “Hamas proxies”.</p>

  <p>The Israeli military has targeted high-rise towers in the city, telling aid workers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/20/idf-warns-aid-workers-only-hospitals-are-protected-sites-in-northern-gaza">that only hospitals will not be targeted</a>, and ordering the city’s 1 million residents to leave.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Recognition is largely symbolic. When the UK’s position was announced the then foreign secretary, David Lammy, said: “It will not change the position on the ground.”</em></p> 
   <p><em>But it allows the UK to enter treaties with Palestine and would mean that the Palestine head of mission becomes a fully recognised ambassador.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Some argue that a greater onus would be placed on the UK to boycott goods imported into the UK by Israel that come from the occupied territories.</em></p> 
   <p><em>But it is seen more as a statement on Palestine’s future, and disapproval of Israel’s refusal to negotiate a Palestinian state…</em></p> 
   <p><em>There are genuine fears that Israel is about to annex the West Bank or make Gaza so uninhabitable that Palestinians are forced over the borders into Jordan or Egypt, so destroying the possibility of a Palestinian homeland.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Recognition that Palestine is a state with the right to self-determination is an attempt to show Israel cannot simply annex land that the international court of justice has declared to be illegally occupied.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Why is the UK recognising Palestinian statehood now?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Formally, the UK is recognising Palestine as an independent state as part of an attempt to preserve and nurture the vision of a two-state solution in which the state of Palestine coexists next to Israel.</p> 
  <p>There are genuine fears that Israel is about to annex the West Bank or make Gaza so uninhabitable that Palestinians are forced over the borders into Jordan or Egypt, so destroying the possibility of a Palestinian homeland.</p> 
  <p>Recognition that Palestine is a state with the right to self-determination is an attempt to show Israel cannot simply annex land that the international court of justice has declared to be illegally occupied.</p> 
  <p>The UK placed a set of conditions on Israel – and not the Palestinians – that if met would have meant Britain would hold back from recognition.</p> 
  <p>These were: a ceasefire in Gaza, an end to Israel’s military campaign, and a commitment to long-term negotiations on a two-state solution.</p>

  <p>“Our focus remains on serious diplomacy, not performative gestures. Our priorities are clear: the release of the hostages, the security of Israel, and peace and prosperity for the entire region that is only possible free from Hamas,” the spokesperson was quoted as having said.</p> 
  <p>Analysts in Israel suggest that Benjamin Netanyahu will make a decision on how to respond to the wave of western countries recognising an independent Palestinian state after his forthcoming trip to Washington at the end of the month.</p> 
  <p>Donald Trump has not commented on Sunday’s moves to recognition but has expressed his opposition to them in the past.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Qatar welcomes recognition of Palestinian state by some western countries</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Qatar has welcomed the recognition of a Palestinian state by the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal, saying the move supported efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the region.</p> 
  <p>The UK’s deputy prime minister <strong>David Lammy</strong>, who will represent the UK at the general assembly, said yesterday that the prospects of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel “lays in tatters” after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/israel-threats-outrage-qatar-strike-hamas">Israel carried out an airstrike on a Hamas negotiating team in Qatar</a> at the start of the month, which caused a huge diplomatic fallout.</p> 
  <p>Hamas said six people were killed in the attack, including the son of its exiled Gaza chief, Khalil al-Hayya. It said its top leadership, including the negotiations team, had survived.</p> 
  <p>Qatar, a close US ally, had been hosting negotiations aimed at securing a ceasefire in Israel’s war in Gaza, and has played a key role as an intermediary. It has hosted the Hamas political bureau since 2012, and hosts a large American airbase in the desert near Doha.</p> 
  <p>Last week, the US secretary of state, <strong>Marco Rubio</strong>, called on Qatar to continue to play a constructive role in bringing an end to the war and said it could help reach the goals of releasing all 48 hostages still held in Gaza, disarming Hamas and building a better future for Palestinian people.</p> 
  <p>Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been bullish in his defiance of international condemnation of the attack in Doha and said he did not rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders “wherever they are”.</p> 
  <p>Qatari prime minister <strong>Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani</strong> has called on the international community to stop applying “double standards” and to punish Israel.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">European officials warn Israel over West Bank annexation plans following moves towards recognition</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We are restarting our live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and the diplomacy around it. </p> 
  <p>European officials have reportedly warned Israel not to annex parts of the occupied <strong>West Bank</strong> in retaliation for western countries recognition of Palestinian statehood.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/21/uk-canada-and-australia-announce-formal-recognition-of-palestine-with-wave-of-israel-allies-to-follow">UK, Australia and Canada all formally recognised Palestinian statehood </a>on Sunday, in a historic move that put three major US allies at odds with the Trump administration and drew an immediate, angry response from Israel. </p> 
  <p>Portugal also recognised Palestine yesterday, and France is among the European countries expected to do the same at the UN general assembly in New York this week.</p> 
  <p>Israeli prime minister, <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong>, said yesterday that recognition rewarded Hamas’ terrorism and said “we doubled Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) and we will continue on this path”.</p> 
  <p>The Israeli far-right finance minister, <strong>Bezalel Smotrich</strong>, and <strong>Itamar Ben-Gvir</strong>, the far-right national security minister, called for wholesale annexation of the occupied West Bank in response to the declarations. </p> 
  <p>“The days when Britain and other countries would determine our future are over … The only response to this anti-Israeli move is sovereignty over the historic homeland of the Jewish people in Judea and Samaria, and permanently removing the folly of a Palestinian state from the agenda,” Smotrich wrote on X.</p> 
  <p>The UK’s foreign secretary, <strong>Yvette Cooper</strong>, has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1wggrdn9dno">told the BBC</a> that she has warned Israel not to annex parts of the West Bank in response to the UK’s recognition of Palestinian statehood,<strong> </strong>which has particular historic significance given the UK’s role in the creation of Israel after the second world war. </p> 
  <p>Cooper said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We have been clear that this decision that we are taking is about the best way to respect the security for Israel as well as the security for Palestinians.</em></p> 
   <p><em>It’s about protecting peace and justice and crucially security for the Middle East and we will continue to work with everyone across the region in order to be able to do that.</em></p>

  <p>The UK is to recognise a Palestinian state based provisionally on 1967 borders, before Israel occupied the Gaza Strip and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/west-bank">West Bank</a>. It will also pave the way for full diplomatic relations, with the Palestinian head of mission, Husam Zomlot, likely to be upgraded to full ambassadorial status.</p> 
  <p>If Israel does carry out some form of annexation of the West Bank, European officials would consider restricting trade with settlements, imposing more sanctions on violent settlers, and formally adopt an advisory opinion issued last year by the UN’s international court of justice, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/israels-settlement-policies-break-international-law-court-finds">which found Israel’s occupation to be in violation of international law</a>, according to the Financial Times. </p>
