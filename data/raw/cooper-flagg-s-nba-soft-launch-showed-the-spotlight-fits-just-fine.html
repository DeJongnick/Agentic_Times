<p>“I would say that might be one of the worst games of my life,” Cooper Flagg told reporters last Thursday night. “But we got the win, so that’s what really matters to me.” It was a telling statement from the 18-year-old basketball phenom after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/11/cooper-flagg-summer-league-debut-dallas-mavericks">his first Las Vegas Summer League game</a>. The No 1 overall pick in this year’s NBA draft – taken by the Dallas Mavericks after a one-and-done college career at Duke – didn’t have nearly as disastrous a debut as he made out. Though he struggled to shoot the ball, Flagg still managed to flash his playmaking and defensive range. Clearly hyperaware to the moment and the hype surrounding his technical NBA debut, he looked determined to put on a show: aggressively hunting his shot and seeking out highlight-reel dunks at every opportunity.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/19/cooper-flagg-the-17-year-old-cold-ass-white-boy-breaking-the-basketball-discourse">Cooper Flagg: the 17-year-old ‘cold-ass white boy’ breaking the basketball discourse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He bounced back with 31 points in his second (and ultimately final) Summer League appearance on Saturday. But it was the second-half of his comment after Thursday night’s game that encapsulates why Flagg is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/dec/19/cooper-flagg-the-17-year-old-cold-ass-white-boy-breaking-the-basketball-discourse">one of the most hyped teenage prospects</a> in decades: the kid is a winner.</p> <p>The buzz around Flagg began in his native Maine, where he became the first freshman to win the state’s Gatorade Player of the Year award. He transferred to Montverde Academy in Florida after his first year of high school in search of stiffer competition, and the accolades continued to accumulate: McDonald’s All American, Gatorade National Player of the Year, even <a href="https://www.usab.com/news/2022/12/annual-awards-mens-5x5-poy">USA Basketball’s Male Athlete of the Year</a>, the youngest to earn the honor since the award’s inception in 1980. Long compared to Kevin Garnett and Jayson Tatum for his two-way skillset and relentless work ethic, Flagg reclassified to enter college a year early – and did the same a second time to reach the NBA sooner. With every challenge cleared, he’s sought the next one with even greater urgency.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2024/09/12/sports/cooper-flagg-is-running-toward-the-grind">a 2024 feature on Flagg for the Ringer</a>, J Kyle Mann described the 6ft 9in, 205lb Swiss army knife as “running toward the grind”, a sentiment longtime Mavericks beat writer Tim Cato echoes in Vegas this week when I ask for his assessment of the teenager. “What really stands out to me about Cooper is he has always ascended,” Cato says. “He loves to cite a quote from his mom, ‘If you’re the best player in the gym, you need to find a new gym.’ And I just think that shows up in every aspect of his career.”</p>    <p>That dogged commitment to improvement has made Flagg both more polished and more reserved than many of his peers. The Tatum comparisons, one could argue, are as apt behind the microphone as they are on the court. His answers can feel a little too polished, the jagged edges sanded down. He lacks the off-the-cuff charisma of an Anthony Edwards or the unfiltered snarl of a Garnett. There’s little brashness, no “face of the league” bravado – just focus. When I asked him after his monster second Vegas appearance, where he punctuated what felt like every five minutes of play <a href="https://x.com/All_Things_Mavs/status/1944154179729338840">with a poster dunk</a> and looked every part the budding superstar, what he dreams about when he lets his imagination run wild over the potential of his NBA career, he had an aw-shucks answer seemingly in the can. “I’m not getting too far ahead of myself. I haven’t really thought about that too much,” he said. “I’m kind of just focused on each individual day and just trying to get better. I know I have a really long way to go, and a lot to improve on.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/25/cooper-flagg-nba-draft-duke">Cooper Flagg will go No 1 in the NBA draft. He also broke the Duke supervillain stereotype</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“That focus is what stands out most about Cooper,” says Cato. “Sometimes even to his detriment. When he says stuff like ‘I’m not really into music,’ he just seems like a guy solely consumed with basketball and challenging himself to reach new heights.”</p> <p>Flagg could do a lot worse than ending up a rough equivalent of Tatum, of course: an arguable top-five player who is a year removed from an NBA championship. He would probably be quite pleased with that trajectory (and, it’s worth noting, the New Englander <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/42271118/the-tiny-town-legendary-1980s-nba-boston-celtics-team-built-cooper-flagg">grew up a Celtics fan</a>). But some insiders see an even loftier ceiling. One NBA executive told me Flagg was “the most skilled and hardest-working prospect in either of his Summer League games”, adding: “He has a pretty strong case as the most complete 18-year-old player since LeBron James.”</p> <p>What impressed most in Flagg’s debut wasn’t any single element. It was the totality: the aggression, the poise, the basketball IQ, the defense, the size, the athleticism. Flagg is poised to make his formal regular-season debut in October as a ready-made, plug-and-play contributor with superstar upside. Against all odds, a Mavericks organization just months removed from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/02/anthony-davis-luka-doncic-trade-mavericks-lakers-nba-basketball">the Luka Dončić saga</a> appears, indeed, to have hit the lottery.</p>
