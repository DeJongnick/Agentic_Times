<p>Kemi Badenoch believes that the only problem with Brexit was that the government didn’t have a plan for the economy following Britain’s departure from Europe (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jan/16/kemi-badenoch-uk-getting-poorer">Report, 16 January</a>). This, in itself, is a shocking admission of the Conservative party’s negligence. However, as the erstwhile “poor man of Europe”, Britain’s economy has never been sustainable without easy trade with Europe. This must have been clear. Brexit was always built on the preposterous conceit that we could survive outside the EU. Perhaps the penny has dropped now that the pound is tumbling.<br><strong>Ed Gillam</strong><br><em>Exeter</em></p> <p>• While Kemi Badenoch recognises flaws in the Tory handling of Brexit and Ed Davey calls for membership of the customs union by 2030, you rightly call upon the government for action (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/17/the-guardian-view-on-britain-and-europe-labour-must-bring-it-on">Editorial, 17&nbsp;January</a>). And what have we heard from Keir Starmer? He plans to “make Brexit work” but has not uttered a single word on what this will entail. Trips to Brussels and facile soundbites will not suffice; he needs to fill this vacuum with meaningful action.<br><strong>Peter Goodair</strong><br><em>Birmingham </em><br><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
