    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - Their results have been poor – two goalless draws and two defeats without scoring – but they aren’t bottom. Wolves, who have lost all four of their games, are at the foot of the table., 2:B - Duplantis has now broken the pole vault world record 14 times in his career., 3:C - Postecoglou takes his new team to Burnley on Saturday, which is a good chance to pick up his first win., 4:D - The 26.2-mile race came down to a sprint finish. Alphonce Simbu pipped Amanal Petros to the finish line by 0.03 seconds., 5:D - Not at the World Athletics Championships but at the Vuelta a España, where Jonas Vingegaard won the race, João Almeida finished second and Tom Pidcock was third., 6:B - Hampshire, who were beaten by Somerset in the T20 Blast final at Edgbaston, take on Worcestershire in the 50-overs format at Trent Bridge., 7:A - It’s been a great season for the club, who are sitting fifth in League Two., 8:B - The previous record of 30 straight wins was also set by England., 9:B - She has apologised, saying: "It's not the image I want to give, nor the player I want to be. I accept the sanction.", 10:C - It was an incredible win for Hatton, who was a big outsider against Tszyu, then widely regarded as one of the world’s top pound-for-pound boxers. It was a pivotal moment in both of their careers. Tszyu retired after the defeat and Hatton went on to unify the division by beating Carlos Maussa., 11:C - The Crawford v Álvarez fight on Saturday was watched by more than 41 million people on Netflix. , 12:B - His shirt did not give it away., 13:B - Jon Jennings, who won the top two prizes, said he noticed some competitors’ stones “seemed a little too perfect.” He became the tournament’s first American winner after skimming his stones a cumulative distance of 177 metres. “Cheaters never win and winners never cheat,” he said., 14:B - The rules state that teams must field a team that includes at least four players who started their last league game. Savage started four players and then took them off straight after kick-off. It worked as his team won the game 3-2., 15:B - The idea is to try to replicate the name-calling the players will face on the course. “It is to simulate the sights and sounds and noise,” explained Rory McIlroy. “It’s better to try to desensitise yourself as much as possible before you get in there. You can get them to say whatever you want them to say. So you can go as close to the bone as you like.”</p>
