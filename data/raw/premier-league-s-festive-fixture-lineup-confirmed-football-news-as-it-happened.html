While Manchester City’s manager added that “everyone can beat anyone”, there has been a dominant side: his, as apart from last term when Liverpool were champions, City claimed the title for in a record four consecutive years - 2020-21 to ‘23-24. Guardiola’s point may be that in those seasons Liverpool and Arsenal were always serious challengers to City.</p> <p>He said: “The Premier League has always been like this, all the teams can beat each other, it is good. At some point like the NBA, there is not a dominant team in the last four or five or six years. There is always one different team and everyone can beat everyone. I think for the spectator and for the show of the Premier League it is really, really good.</p> <p>“I remember when I was in [Bayern] Munich or Barcelona, I always heard the rumours that in England, everyone could beat everyone. I always had that sense. Maybe Liverpool and ourselves in the past changed that dynamic because we were so consistent in terms of points and arriving every season with 90, 90, 90 points, close to 100 points.”</p> <p>While the NBA has been claimed by six different franchises since 2020 - the LA Lakers, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, Denver Nuggets, Dallas Mavericks and Oklahoma Thunder – Guardiola believes City are close to being near their very best again.</p> <p>“Still, we are not at our best, but we are close. I think I had the feeling, I said a month ago that these words would be completely devastating if you don’t get results. I know that, but I had the feeling when I see the team, when I see in the dressing room, in the trainings, and how we apply, how we want to try to do things, I had the feeling,” said the manager. “[And] that when I think Rodri can come [to] his best, that he will not be soon at his best, but he can help us, and alongside all the alternatives I can have, we will be a team that will be difficult for the opponents to beat us, and this is what I want. Will we be still close to the fight [for the title then]? I don’t know.”</p> <p>City are in fifth place, six points behind Arsenal, and host second-place Bournemouth in Sunday’s late game. Guardiola said that Rodri may be available to play some part following a hamstring problem. “I think he will be ready to help us. I dunno from the beginning but hopefully with us,” said the manager.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-31T15:12:30.957Z">at 3.12pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6904cedd8f08e3e3851d100f" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-31T15:00:03.633Z">3.00pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Handover:</strong> John Brewin is here to see you down the home straight.

Unfortunately, circumstances meant we once again faced the huge task of rebuilding, with 15 players and key members of my backroom staff leaving before pre-season began.</p> <p>“Even so, I was confident in the group we were developing. The squad was growing stronger each week, and with 32 league games still to play, I truly believed we were on the path to a successful season. While I am naturally disappointed by the club’s decision, I would like to thank everyone connected with Reading Football Club – the staff, my coaching team, and especially the players – for their loyalty, hard work, and professionalism throughout my time there.”</p> <p>Hunt has been replaced by Leam Richardson, 45, who signed a deal to manage the Royals until June 2027 and brought James Beattie and Danny Shcolfield to the Select Car Leasing Stadium as part of his coaching staff.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-31T15:13:08.016Z">at 3.13pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6904b2a98f089c910df3454f" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-31T13:09:42.712Z">1.09pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>More news!</strong> Andoni Iraola, David Moyes, Thomas Frank and the beleaguered Vitor Perira are all due to rock the pre-match mic about now.

Welbeck has represented his country 42 times but last played for them in a 1-0 friendly win over Switzerland in September 2018, more than seven years ago.

I’m happy with the quality of the team. But I’m also convinced by the strategy and policy we have. What makes it ‘the issue’ – not all of them have had a proper pre-season. When three or four are injured, you go down to having 16 players.</p> <p>I am a firm believer in 21 or 22 players are enough. But you have to keep them fit as we did last season. We are struggling to keep them fit this season for in my opinion, obvious reasons.</p> <p>[Alexander Isak] came to us on 1 September. A few others missed out in pre-season. It has been more difficult than last season to keep them more available. When players are not available, it [workload] comes down more to the same players.</p> <p>But no excuses for results. We had to play a lot of away games with only two days in between. That would have been difficult last season, and for any player that has been fit this season through pre-season. But it has not been the case this season.</p> <p>Then you have to manage it. The upcoming week is three games in eight days. It has nothing to do with squad depth, but it has how we have run through the season in terms of injuries, availability every two or three days.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-31T09:41:19.394Z">at 9.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6900d7908f0834dc8678fb3a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-31T09:35:46.819Z">9.35am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Preamble</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Another spine-tingling weekend of football is upon us.
