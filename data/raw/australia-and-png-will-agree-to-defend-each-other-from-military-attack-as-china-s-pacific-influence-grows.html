<p>Australia and Papua New Guinea will agree to defend each other in the event of a military attack, part of a landmark defence agreement due to be signed on the sidelines of celebrations to commemorate the country’s independence this week.</p> <p>Anthony Albanese and PNG’s defence minister, Billy Joseph, both downplayed a delay to the deal being formalised, insisting the plan known as a Pukpuk treaty won’t affect sovereignty in the former Australian colony.</p> <p>Designed to push back against China’s expansionist attitude to Pacific countries, the deal is the latest negotiated by the Albanese government with regional neighbours.</p> <p>The cabinet of PNG’s prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/papua-new-guinea-independence-50th-anniversary-png-world-leaders">James Marape</a>, had been due to sign off on the deal on Monday night but fell short of the required quorum of members due to independence celebrations.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/papua-new-guinea-1975-independence-remembering-png-first-moments">PNG became independent from Australia</a> on 16 September 1975.</p> <p>“Importantly, this deal won’t affect our sovereignty. We’re still an independent nation,” Joseph told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>“The treaty can also be amended if needed in future.</p> <p>“We’re taking it to cabinet first, then parliament, and I’m confident it’ll get strong support.”</p> <p>The treaty will allow PNG citizens to join the Australian Defence Force, and for Australians to serve with PNG troops, promote interoperability between the two countries and integrate responses to a military attack.</p> <p>Joint military training and defence exercises are planned, as well as new cooperation on cybersecurity preparedness.</p> <p>Joseph said PNG was choosing Australia as its main defence partner, alluding to China’s efforts to build influence with Pacific countries, including through major infrastructure spending and loans.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/15/andrew-hastie-threatens-to-quit-coalition-frontbench-over-net-zero">Andrew Hastie threatens to quit Coalition frontbench over net zero</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“As we hit 50 years of independence, this is a strategic move, we’re choosing Australia as our defence partner. Some external players have tried to distract us, but we’ve stayed focused.”</p> <p>Albanese said the delay was due to celebrations around PNG.</p> <p><strong>“</strong>They all went to their respective homelands and so they didn’t have quorum at the cabinet meeting, and that’s understandable. This is about celebrating 50 years,” he said.</p> <p>“This is about our mutual security. This is about our mutual sovereignty as well, showing respect for each other. And it’s a natural progression of how closely we work together.”</p> <p>Albanese and senior Labor figures including the defence minister, Richard Marles, and the Pacific minister, Pat Conroy, are joining celebrations in Port Moresby. Prince Edward, the younger brother of King Charles, is representing Britain.</p> <p>Officials from China and the US are in PNG this week as well.</p> <p>Questions about the new agreement follow a delay to a separate deal between Australia and Vanuatu earlier this month. That deal would see Australia spend up to $500m over a decade <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/09/albanese-went-to-vanuatu-to-sign-a-500m-agreement-but-leaves-empty-handed-thanks-to-concerns-about-china">on climate change resilience, security services and the economy.</a></p> <p>The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said it was appropriate that Australia and Papua New Guinea pursue security together.</p> <p>“Independence means a partnership of two equals sharing mutual respect,” she said.</p> <p>“The new treaty being finalised by Papua New Guinea and Australia will bring a transformation of our mutual partnership - providing the basis of deeper ties for the next fifty years.”</p> <p>The Greens’ defence spokesman, David Shoebridge, said the proposed defence treaty had not been subject to serious discussion in either Australia or PNG.</p> <p>“Despite the government’s rhetoric, the militarisation of the region does nothing to make us, or our neighbours, safe,” he said.</p> <p>Australia will fund an extension to PNG’s national parliament, adding a new ministerial wing to the building as a gift to commemorate independence.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Breaking News">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
