Ministers claim the current system incentives people to switch to the UC health element because it is a lot more generous than the standard rate.</p> <p>Some government MPs are expected to rebel in votes later, but as a result of the concessions last week the government’s majority is now longer at risk.</p> <p>Here are some of the key points from today’s debate.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>The Green party is calling for the bill to be amended to make the increase in the standard rate of UC more generous than currently planned.</strong> This plan is set out in amendment 39, tabled by Siân Berry from the Greens, which was selected as the lead amendment for today’s debate. All the amendments are <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/59-01/0267/amend/universal_day_cwh_0709.pdf">here</a>. </p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>More than 40 MPs have signed an amendment tabled by Labour’s Richard Burgon that would block the cut to the health element of UC. </strong>The health element is set to be cut from £97 per week to £50 per week. Burgon said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The halving of the universal credit health element is an especially cruel cut - targeting disabled people already assessed as too sick to be able to work.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Rachael Maskell, the Labour MP who led the revolt against the bill last week, described the bill, even in its amended form, as “a stain on our great party, founded on values of equality and justice”.</strong></p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Stephen Timms, the minister for social security and the disabled, has claimed the bill will protect people with fluctuating conditions. </strong>In her speech <strong>Maskell</strong> said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If someone has a fluctuating physical or mental health condition like multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, cystic fibrosis, or other recurring muscular-skeletal condition, if following a period of remission and work then relapse and returning to universal credit, unless unequivocally stated, they will return onto the pittance of £50-a-week for their health element.</p> </blockquote> <p>But Timms intervened to say “the bill protects people in exactly the situation that she describes”. He said that if a pre-2026 claimant slips out of being eligible for universal credit but meets the eligibility criteria again within six months, the bill would demand that they be considered “continuously entitled to an award”. It would mean that they could go “straight back onto the position they are in at the start”, Timms said.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Debbie Abrahams, Labour chair of the work and pensions committee, urged the government to delay its reform of health benefits until November 2026.</strong> She said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This is to allow for the NHS capacity to ramp up and to ensure funding follows health need, so that people with newly required conditions or impairments can receive early treatment and a better aligned labour market that will enable them to return to work quickly.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Zarah Sultana, the independent MP who last week said she was leaving Labour to set up a new party with Jeremy Corbyn, said the bill showed the government was “not out of touch, but also morally bankrupt”.</strong></p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-09T16:39:45.168Z">at 5.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-686e8e578f082b1b94754347" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-09T15:57:28.532Z">4.57pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Starmer and Macron agree that 'new deterrent' needed to stop small boats, No 10 says</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Downing Street has issued a statement about <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>’s talks with <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> over lunch today. It says the PM and the president agreed that “a new deterrent” was needed to stop the small boat crossings.</p> <p>This seems to be a reference to the idea of a “one in, one out” returns scheme, which would involve migrants arriving illegally in the UK being swiftly returned to France, but with the UK also agreeing to take in an equivalent number of migratns based in France who are claiming asylum in the UK. Starmer is said to be urging Macron to accept a deal of this sort, but Macron has reportedly been resisting, and the idea is unpopular with some other European countries. Last month Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta wrote to the European commission complaining that such a scheme could incentivise even more irregular migration into southern Europe.</p> <p>Starmer and Macron are attending a more formal summit tomorrow, and further details on what has (or has not) been agreed should emerge when they speak to reporters tomorrow afternoon.</p> <p>The No 10 statement said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>[Starmer and Macron] reflected on the state visit of the president so far, agreeing that it had been an important representation of the deep ties between our two countries.</p> <p>Moving on to discuss joint working, they shared their desire to deepen our partnership further – from joint leadership in support of Ukraine to strengthening our defence collaboration and increasing bilateral trade and investment.</p> <p>The prime minister welcomed the news that EDF would take a 12.5% stake in Sizewell C leading to lower bills, more jobs and better energy security for the UK.</p> <p>The leaders agreed tackling the threat of irregular migration and small boat crossings is a shared priority that requires shared solutions.</p> <p>The prime minister spoke of his government’s toughening of the system in the past year to ensure rules are respected and enforced, including a massive surge in illegal working arrests to end the false promise of jobs that are used to sell spaces on boats.</p> </blockquote> <p>This paragraph seems to amount to an acknowlegement that Macron was seeking assurances on this issue, as the Telegraph reported this morning.

She was referring to <strong>Mark Drakeford</strong>, who is now finance secretary in the Welsh government, who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c07d53zgmk7o">told the BBC’s Walescast</a> podcast the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, should “absolutely” look at a wealth tax. Drakeford said the “root of inequality is the way that wealth is distributed across the population”.</p> <p>Badenoch also claimed that Reeves herself backed a wealth tax when she was in opposition. She was referring to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/07/08/five-forms-wealth-tax-rachel-reeves-labour-chancellor/">this Telegraph story</a> saying that Reeves supported “five forms of wealth tax” when she was a backbench MP in 2018. The Telegraph said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In 2018, the chancellor backed a number of new levies in a pamphlet called The Everyday Economy. It was published by Ms Reeves when she was chairing the Commons business committee.</p> <p>In it, she said the government could revise council tax bands, replace council tax with property tax, raise and reform inheritance tax, impose a land tax, and bring capital gains tax in line with income tax.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Reeves</strong> has not changed council tax, or introduced a land tax. But in her budget last year she did limit the extent to which farms are protected from inheritance tax, and she increased capital gains tax.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686e78ab8f084bf9154bb156" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-09T14:32:58.141Z">3.32pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Dale Vince backs growing calls for 'wealth tax' - and what this term might actually mean</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Dale Vince</strong>, the green entrepreneur and Labour party donor, has issued a statement saying that he favours higher taxes on the wealthy.

Tax breaks, allowances, loopholes - there’s an abundance of them, and it results in people with money paying half the rate of tax of people with a job. </p> <p>It’s right that those with the deepest pockets, who’ve taken the most from our economy, pay their fair share. It’s why calls are growing for a wealth tax. </p> <p>It’s about fairness - we tax money made with money at half the rate of money made with a pair of hands - it’s just not right. Our tax code was written by people with money for people with money - it needs to serve us all.</p> </blockquote> <p>While Starmer did not rule out a wealthy tax at PMQs, his answer to Adrian Ramsay, the Green party’s co-leader, made it clear that he is quite negative about the concept. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/09/pmqs-live-uk-politics-latest-updates-starmer-badenoch-macron-labour-conservatives?page=with%3Ablock-686e50f98f082b1b94753ee4#block-686e50f98f082b1b94753ee4">12.26pm</a>.)</p> <p>But a lot depends on what you mean by “wealth tax”. The Green party favour <a href="https://greenparty.org.uk/2024/06/12/greens-pledge-investment-to-mend-broken-britain/">a purist version</a>, a 1% tax on assets worth more than £10m, and a 2% tax on assets worth more than £1bn. This would fit the literal definition of a wealth tax. Starmer is very unlikely to embrace this version – not least because<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/08/norman-tebbit-emmanuel-macron-horizon-post-office-scandal-uk-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-686d4a0e8f082b1b94753628#block-686d4a0e8f082b1b94753628"> the experts say it would not work</a>.</p> <p>No 10 has been<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/07/children-ehcps-support-cuts-special-educational-needs-reform-nigel-farage-keir-starmer-20th-anniversary-july-7-attacks-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-686bb5008f089731c616d7ee#block-686bb5008f089731c616d7ee"> keen to point out</a> that it is in favour of taxes on the wealthy – as it has made clear over the last 12 months by announcing policies that actually do raises taxes for the wealthy.

In his statement, he is not explicitly backing the Green party version of a wealth tax. But he points out that taxes on capital gains are lower than taxes on income, and he is calling for significant reform of the tax system to address this.

But it is relatively easy to unsettle a PM by making it obvious when they are ducking a question, and Kemi Badenoch achieved that successfully today. The ultra-succinct reply that Keir Starmer gave to her first question (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/09/pmqs-live-uk-politics-latest-updates-starmer-badenoch-macron-labour-conservatives?page=with%3Ablock-686e4cca8f084bf9154bae8f#block-686e4cca8f084bf9154bae8f">12.06pm</a>) only served to highlight the extent to which he was flannelling like fury in his second answer (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/09/pmqs-live-uk-politics-latest-updates-starmer-badenoch-macron-labour-conservatives?page=with%3Ablock-686e4d228f084bf9154bae96#block-686e4d228f084bf9154bae96">12.07pm</a>), when he refused to rule out a further freeze in tax or national insurance thresholds in the budget. The Tories have now put out a press release saying this means “a toxic cocktail of Labour tax rises are coming in the autumn budget”.</p> <p>They are almost certainly right about tax rises being on the way. But you did not need Badenoch, or PMQs, to tell you that. If you wanted to find out that a further tax threshold freeze, you should have read <strong>Heather Stewart</strong> in the Guardian last week (always a wise move).</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/27/reeves-expected-to-freeze-income-tax-thresholds-to-raise-fresh-funds">Reeves expected to freeze income tax thresholds to raise funds after welfare U-turn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps Badenoch is a Guardian reader too.</p> <p>The Conservative leader probably achieved the goal she had set herself ahead of PMQs, but this did not really amount to a great triumph. Establishing that taxes are likely to go up is not hard. Badenoch tried to argue that, because if the income tax threshold is frozen some pensioners will end up paying income tax, Labour would be introducing a “retirement tax”. But this does not really work as a weapons-grade slogan, because the issue is relatively complicated, and the phrase may never be heard again. Condemning Labour for freezing tax thresholds is also a bit awkward for the party that announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/may/30/six-year-income-tax-threshold-squeeze-to-last-until-2028-says-uk-chancellor-jeremy-hunt">a six-year income tax threshold squeeze</a> when it was in power.</p> <p>However, in one respect, Badenoch was on much stronger ground. She pointed out that, in her<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/autumn-budget-2024-speech"> budget speech</a> last year, <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> said this six-year squeeze had to end. Reeves said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Having considered this issue closely, I have come to the conclusion that extending the threshold freeze would hurt working people. It would take more money out of their payslips.</p> </blockquote> <p>Starmer was not willing to say those words still apply. Going back on a policy intention set out in a budget is not the same as breaking a manifesto commitment, but Badenoch has identified why extending the freeze would look a bit like the breach of a pledge.</p> <p>Tory leaders always assume they cannot go wrong attacking Labour tax rises. Often that does turn out to be the case, but this territory is difficult for Badenoch at the moment because her party has yet to explain how it would fund repealing the tax rises she condemns. Starmer made this point effectively today, as he usually does.</p> <p>PMQs is structured in such a way as to make the PM v leader of the oppositon contest the main event of the show. But today was a good example of why this dynamic is not suited to multi-party politics. The leaders (or co-leader in one case) of the five main UK-wide parties all spoke, and their contributions were interesting too. Nigel Farage was literally shouted down – which is a good indication of the way Labour MPs feel about him, and fear him, but probably not the best tactic to deploy against someone who likes to act as an establishment scourge. With Adrian Ramsay, Starmer seemed better briefed than he usually is on the contents of the Green party’s manifesto – a sensible move, given the threat they post to Labour from the left.</p> <p>And, with the Liberal Democrats, it was obvious that Starmer and Ed Davey both assumed cross-party collaboration between their parties is very feasible. (I even found myself wondering if the Lib Dem MP Cameron Thomas has collaborated with No 10 by tipping them off about his question, because Starmer’s joke anti-Tory reply [see<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/09/pmqs-live-uk-politics-latest-updates-starmer-badenoch-macron-labour-conservatives?page=with%3Ablock-686e54a78f08ba9382f60620#block-686e54a78f08ba9382f60620"> 12.39pm</a>] was almost too good to be spontaneous.)</p> <p>Given the size of Starmer’s majority, he has not needed to court the Lib Dems. But at the weekend Tim Shipman from the Spectator published the <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/revealed-morgan-mcsweeneys-memo-to-the-pm-on-how-labour-could-fail/">full text</a> of a memo that <strong>Morgan McSweeney</strong>, Starmer’s chief of staff, wrote for Starmer in May last year, before the general election, and it shows that there are people in No 10 very open to some sort of future Lib-Lab cooperation. Under the heading of what a new Labour government could do to bring the country together, McSweeney wrote:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>A more radical approach would be to welcome Ed Davey to Downing Street in the early days of a new administration. If we have a large majority, there will certainly be pushback from within the party. But the benefits could be considerable: it will show our intentions to work with others and a different tone and style of politics.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-09T14:53:33.940Z">at 3.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-686e55b48f08ba9382f60631" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-09T11:44:03.175Z">12.44pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Adrian Ramsay</strong>, the Green party co-leader, also raises a point of order.

Accepting this above inflation recommendation, which was significantly higher than affordability, required reprioritisation of NHS budgets. Because of this government’s commitment to recognising the value of the medical workforce, we made back-office efficiency savings to invest in the frontline. That was not inevitable, it was an active political choice this government made.

She said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This review puts a much needed spotlight on the crisis in our courts. Sir Brian Leveson is right to call it unacceptable. The reality is the justice system is at crisis point with many victims waiting years for their case to come to trial.

Yesterday Emmanuel Macron, the French president, enjoyed the best ceremonial aspects of his state visit – being hosted at Windsor Castle, addressing MPs and peers in the Royal Gallery at parliament, a state banquet. But today he is getting down to proper talks with Keir Starmer and, although they are expected to agree some new measures relating to curbing the number of small boats crossing the Channel, there are signs that the final deal might not be as wide-ranging as the UK government might have liked.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/08/europe-should-reduce-us-and-china-dual-dependencies-macron-warns">their story</a> about Macron’s address to parliament, <strong>Kiran Stacey </strong>and <strong>Morgan Ofori</strong> report:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The British government has been hoping to use the trip to show that its “EU reset” had borne fruit, including on the traditionally difficult subject of migration.</p> <p>British officials have been hoping to sign a new deal that would involve Britain accepting asylum seekers who have a genuine family connection with the UK in return for being able to send others back to France. However, they had warned in recent days that it might not be ready in time for this trip.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this morning the Daily Telegraph has splashed on a story saying Macron wants Britain to do more to reduce the “pull factors” the encourage migrants to cross the channel. In <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/07/08/emmanuel-macron-blames-keir-starmer-migrant-crisis/">their story</a>, <strong>James Crisp</strong> and<strong> Charles Hymas</strong> say:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The Telegraph understands that Mr Macron wants Sir Keir to crack down on the UK’s black market for labour and welfare payments and make family reunification for <a href="https://archive.is/o/jibWf/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2022/02/01/uk-must-let-asylum-seekers-make-applications-france-get-channel/">genuine asylum seekers</a> easier as conditions for the deal.</p> <p>An Elysée source warned that Mr Macron expected measures “addressing the root causes of the factors that attract people to the United Kingdom”, adding: “These causes must also be addressed by the British.”</p> </blockquote>    <p><strong>Nick Thomas-Symonds,</strong> the Cabinet Office minister responsible for post-Brexit relations with the EU, has been doing an interview round this morning. He sounded a bit more defensive than usual for a minister talking about small boats, and he was not talking up the chances of a ‘one in, one out’ deal. Here are the main points.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Thomas-Symonds insisted that the UK is already addressing the “pull factors” affecting small boat crossings. </strong>Asked about Macron’s supposed views, as set out in the Telegraph splash, he told the Today programme:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Addressing pull factors is exactly what we have been doing. That is why there’s been over 7,000 arrests here in the United Kingdom dealing with things like, for example, illegal working which this government has been cracking down on.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He claimed that policy was moving “in the right direction” on small boats. </strong>The number of crossings is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jun/24/number-of-people-crossing-channel-in-small-boats-hits-new-high">at a record level for this time of year</a>. But Thomas-Symonds told Today the numbers would have been even higher if it had not been for action taken by the British and the French. He said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We have prevented, working together with the French authorities, and indeed beyond across Europe, 12,000 people from crossing the Channel who otherwise would have done.</p> <p>We have seized 600 boats that otherwise would be being used in the channel.</p> </blockquote> <p>When <strong>Emma Barnett</strong>, the presenter, said that having crossing numbers at a record level was nothing to boast about, <strong>Thomas-Symonds</strong> said he was not boasting. But he went on:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Preventing 12,000 people from crossing is most definitely something that is in the right direction …</p> <p>To your point about numbers, we’ve seen, yes, over 21,000 have crossed so far this year. There was a 10-week period in 2022 when we had 20,000 people who crossed in that intense period.</p> <p>But nobody, nobody, is boasting about those numbers.</p> <p>There is no simple solution to that issue.</p> <p>It is about it’s not about gimmicks, it’s not about performative politics, it is about doing the hard yards of solving this.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He claimed that cooperation with the French was already paying off.</strong> He said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We obviously want to see, in the bilateral relationship with France, which is crucial, but also around Europe, more people smugglers being arrested. We want to see more people prevented from attempting that dangerous crossing, more prosecutions of people smugglers.</p> <p>And you do that by deepening your intelligence sharing. That’s what we’re doing in Dunkirk, for example. I’ve been down to Dover, I’ve been across to France, I’ve literally seen this work happening, and it yields results. Just the last couple of weeks, we saw nine people in Lille sentenced nine people to 64 years in total for people smuggling offences. That’s work between our National Crime Agency and the French authorities.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>And he rejected claims that, by abandoning the Tories’ Rwanda policy, the government had removed the deterrent for people tempted to cross the channel. </strong>When it was put to him that there was no deterrent, he replied:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Sorry, but we do have a deterrent, and the deterrent has been the 30,000 people who’ve been removed by this government who have no right to be here.</p> <p>Knowing and having that in place, that people who have no right to be here will be deported, is a far more effective deterrent than spending £700m pounds on a gimmick that sent four volunteers to Rwanda.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.15am:</em> Mark Wild, HS2 chief executive, and Lord Hendy, rail minister, give evidence to the Commons transport committee about HS2.</p> <p><em>10.40am:</em> John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, is on a visit to Falkirk community hospital to announce a further £85m for initiatives that improve the flow of patients through the health service.</p> <p><em>Noon:</em> Keir Starmer faces Kemi Badenoch at PMQs.</p> <p><em>12.30pm:</em> Sir Brian Langstaff, chair of the infected blood inquiry, publishes a report on how the compensation payment process is working.</p> <p><em>After 12.45pm:</em> MPs resume their debate on the universal credit and personal independent payment bill.
