<p>Workers are now receiving more of the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/03/australian-economy-households-spending-more-helping-momentum-weak-growth">economic pie</a>” than before the pandemic, with the increase in labour’s share of national income delivering an extra $28bn into the pockets of Australians over the past year alone.</p> <p>Pat Bustamante, a senior economist at Westpac, said his analysis suggested that the tighter post-Covid labour market was behind the greater share going to workers, from an average of 53.8% through the 2010s, to more than 55% now.</p> <p>While the movement in the division of national income appears small, even fractional changes translate to tens of billions of dollars in an economy of about $2.8tn.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/10/abs-income-and-housing-survey-delayed-briefing-documents-show">Data missing on two of nation’s ‘biggest issues’ as Australian Bureau of Statistics fumbles key survey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The ABS splits total national income between labour and capital.</p> <p>The labour (or wage) share is the portion of total domestic income paid to workers in wages, salaries and other benefits.
