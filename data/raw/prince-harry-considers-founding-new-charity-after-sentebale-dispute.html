<p>Prince Harry is considering establishing a new charity after a dispute that led to him leaving Sentebale, a spokesperson has said.</p> <p>It comes after the Duke of Sussex was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/06/prince-harry-among-those-criticised-in-report-on-dispute-at-sentebale-charity#:~:text=Prince%20Harry%20among%20those%20criticised%20in%20report%20on%20dispute%20at%20Sentebale%20charity,-Watchdog%20says%20all&amp;text=The%20Charity%20Commission%20has%20criticised,watchdog%20cleared%20him%20of%20racism.">criticised by the Charity Commission</a> for allowing a row with the chair of Sentebale, which he co-founded in 2006, to “play out publicly”.</p> <p>The row involved Harry stepping down as patron in March in support of trustees who resigned in opposition to the board’s chair, Dr Sophie Chandauka, who had previously accused him of bullying and harassment.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/06/prince-harry-among-those-criticised-in-report-on-dispute-at-sentebale-charity">Prince Harry among those criticised in report on dispute at Sentebale charity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The charity works in Botswana and Lesotho supporting the health and wellbeing of young people, especially those with HIV and Aids. Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, who co-founded Sentebale alongside Harry in honour of Diana, Princess of Wales, also stepped down as patron.</p> <p>It has been suggested by allies close to Harry that he is keen to “continue to support the children of Lesotho and Botswana” and that he is examining his options over the nature of that support.</p> <p>A source close to the prince told the Telegraph: “He may well choose to just support existing charities operating in the same space in the region or he may choose to set up something new completely.”</p> <p>On Sunday, Harry’s official spokesperson said the prince remained “absolutely committed to continuing the work he started, supporting the children and young people of Lesotho and Botswana, nearly 20 years ago”.</p> <p>The spokesperson added: “In what form that support takes – no decisions have been made. All options remain on the table; whether that be starting a new charity or working to support pre-existing charities operating in the same sector in the region.”</p> <p>Earlier this week, a source said the row had been “emotionally absolutely devastating” for the prince, and described Chandauka’s comments as “nothing short of a hostile takeover”.</p> <p>The Charity Commission, which cannot investigate individual allegations of bullying, said it found no evidence of systemic bullying or harassment at the charity, including misogyny or misogynoir, but acknowledged “the strong perception of ill treatment” felt by some involved.</p> <p>The trustees who resigned said in a statement they were “gravely concerned for the future of the charity” as they felt the regulator had “chosen to ignore key concerns and irrefutable evidence raised with them regarding the leadership and oversight of Sentebale’s chair”.</p> <p>In response to the findings, Sentebale said in a statement: “The Charity Commission is explicitly clear, including in its public guidance, that it is not the commission’s responsibility to adjudicate or mediate internal disputes. This would include individual allegations of bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir etc.</p> <p>“As a result, the commission has not investigated any individual allegations and therefore has not made any findings in relation to individuals, including Prince Harry.”</p>
