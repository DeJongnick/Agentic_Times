<h1>Who are the rightwing influencers filling Trump’s head with visions of antifa?</h1>

<p>Last week’s White House roundtable on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/23/what-is-antifa-meaning-trump">antifa</a> was an odd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf6Em35gguU">affair</a>, mainly because the supposed experts who briefed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> on antifascism were rightwing influencers who make a living filming themselves confronting leftwing protesters.</p> 
<p>Videos of protests in Portland and Chicago produced by these conservative content creators have long shaped the president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/05/trump-portland-video-protests">distorted view</a> of reality.</p> 
<p>Although the influencers all describe themselves as “independent journalists”, they all frame leftwing protesters as nefarious or ridiculous in their videos, and eight of the 11 are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jaredlholt.bsky.social/post/3m2re73uauk2m">current or former employees</a> of Turning Point USA, the conservative advocacy organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk.</p> 
<p>None presented evidence to support <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/president-trump-deploys-federal-resources-to-crush-violent-radical-left-terrorism-in-portland/">the administration’s claim</a> that antifascists, who disrupt white supremacist rallies or oppose the mass deportation of their neighbors, are “terrorists”. Instead, they shared personal stories of having been victimized by leftwing protesters.</p> 
<p>“Their job”, the extremism researcher Jared Holt said <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/043-who-are-on-140478449">on his podcast</a>, “is to make these viral clips that they can show on Fox News and scare your grandpa into thinking antifa is on the verge of a mass slaughter, and that Mr Trump is the only man who can put an end to this by sending the military to go crack some skulls”.</p>

<p>Here is a guide to the conservative media activists whose work fills the president’s head with visions of antifa.</p> 
<h2>Andy Ngo</h2> 
<p>Since Donald Trump first shouted the word “<a href="https://x.com/ChrisStephensMD/status/900192642234949632">antifa</a>” at a rally in 2017, a week after he accused antifascists of “violently attacking” white supremacists at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, no one has done more than Andy Ngo to promote the myth that black-clad protesters around the nation are part of a secret terrorist network.</p> 
<p>Ngo, the son of Vietnamese refugees in Portland, made his name on Twitter by posting video clips, often misleadingly edited or captioned, of street battles that broke out when far-right groups from surrounding counties descended on the liberal city to provoke antifascists.</p> 
<p>His willingness to selectively edit his reports to blame antifascists for the violence was <a href="https://www.portlandmercury.com/news/2019/08/26/27039560/undercover-in-patriot-prayer-insights-from-a-vancouver-democrat-whos-been-working-against-the-far-right-group-from-the-inside">revealed</a> in 2019, when video recorded by an antifascist mole in a rightwing group Ngo had embedded with, Patriot Prayer, showed that Ngo had witnessed, and chosen not to report, the Christian nationalists planning to instigate violence at a leftwing gathering.</p> 
<p>A month later, <a href="https://x.com/Jimryan015/status/1145067852375851008">Ngo was attacked</a> by antifascists while filming their efforts to counter a Proud Boys rally in Portland. He was punched, kicked and doused with silly string and a milkshake he later claimed had been laced with quick-drying cement. (That accusation appears to have been a false rumor shared with the police by a rightwing activist who was <a href="https://x.com/Johnnthelefty/status/1145601176747986946">caught on camera</a> the same day dousing antifascists with grey powder.) </p> 
<p>That assault instantly made him a sought-after guest on Fox News. Two years later, he published Unmasked: Inside Antifa’s Radical Plan to Destroy Democracy, a best-selling book filled with exaggerated or inaccurate claims about leftwing protesters. </p> 
<p>Ngo’s use of the term “domestic terrorists” to describe antifa, now <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1976311878432313705">amplified</a> in official US government statements, is not just inaccurate, it can be dangerous. In 2022, a Portland resident who followed Ngo on YouTube went to the site of a planned racial justice march Ngo had railed against, screamed that antifascist volunteers protecting the marchers were “terrorists” and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/19/blm-march-portland-shooting">opened fire</a>. The rightwing gunman shot four traffic safety volunteers and a protest medic. One woman died at the scene, another succumbed to her injuries later.</p> 
<p>Ngo is a video journalist turned pundit with 1.7 million followers on X. </p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Katie Daviscourt</h2> 
<p>Katie Daviscourt, a former Turning Point USA activist, is a correspondent for Post Millennial, a far-right Canadian website where Andy Ngo is an editor. A Portland police sergeant recently described her in an internal report as one of the “counter-protesters” filming protests outside a Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement office who “constantly return and antagonize the protesters until they are assaulted or pepper sprayed”. A week later, Daviscourt was <a href="https://x.com/KatieDaviscourt/status/1973241441834115509">struck by a protester</a> who tried to block her from filming by swinging a Palestinian flag in her face. </p> 
<p>The next night, she <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-police-seek-publics-help-after-safe-space-officer-loses-track-assault-suspect-near-ice-facility">appeared on Fox News</a> with a black eye to accuse Portland police officers who spent 2020 <a href="https://x.com/pdxfrontline/status/1532490043134136320">battling with antifascists</a> of being part of antifa. “The Trump administration needs to start treating antifa like Isis, the terrorists that they are, and put an end to them for good,” she <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=733242756398703">told Jesse Watters</a>.</p> 
<p>Daviscourt is a video correspondent for the Post Millennial with 260,000 followers on X.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Nick Sortor</h2> 
<p>Nick Sortor, a former real estate agent from Kentucky, made his name during the Biden administration by going to the scenes of disasters, in East Palestine, Ohio, and Lahaina, Maui, to scream at officials and push conspiracy theories in interviews with Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon.</p> 
<p>In February, <a href="https://x.com/nicksortor/status/1889093364571619749">he claimed</a> that Elizabeth Warren, the 76-year-old Massachusetts senator, has “assaulted” him as she pushed past him to get into her car while he was peppering her with questions based on viral misinformation.</p> 
<p>Sortor has been involved in multiple physical altercations with protesters in Portland this month, some of which <a href="https://x.com/angertab/status/1975086630840226261">he clearly initiated</a>. Video shot by a Fox News correspondent one night <a href="https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1974088103829926100">showed</a> Sortor ripping a burning American flag from the hands of an elderly protester he later described as an “Antifa thug”. Later that night, Sortor was arrested <a href="https://x.com/RheinDAmacher/status/1974235482780545424/video/1">after exchanging blows</a> with protesters, who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/12/portland-ice-trump-antifa-nick-sortor/">reportedly</a> objected to him filming closeup images of a teenage girl who had just been <a href="https://x.com/bennetthaselton/status/1973965734540947699">maced by a federal officer</a>. </p> 
<p>The charges against Sortor were later dropped by a local prosecutor after his arrest prompted an outcry in the conservative media. Sortor received a sympathetic text from Trump and a phone call from the attorney general, Pam Bondi, who ordered the head of the justice department’s civil rights division, Harmeet Dhillon, to <a href="https://x.com/AAGDhillon/status/1974175518435217577/photo/1">open an investigation</a> of the Portland police bureau over supposed anti-conservative bias. Dhillon was previously Andy Ngo’s lawyer.</p> 
<p>Sortor is an influencer who confronts protesters and Democrats for his 1.2 million X followers.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Julio Rosas</h2> 
<p>Julio Rosas got his start working for Charlie Kirk’s Turning Point USA, <a href="https://x.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1965895839932719360">writing</a> last month that meeting the conservative activist “is THE reason why I have my career in politics today”. </p> 
<p>The marine reservist spent much of 2020 filming <a href="https://vimeo.com/935228869?fl=pl&amp;fe=vl">undercover video of racial justice protests</a>, highlighting rare instances of violence in clips that helped Fox News and the Trump White House frame demonstrations that were about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/05/nearly-all-black-lives-matter-protests-are-peaceful-despite-trump-narrative-report-finds">94%</a> entirely peaceful as anarchic.</p> 
<p>Rosas’s openly partisan approach to covering protests was reflected in his comment to Trump that the “sustained political violence that we’re seeing in this country is not a ‘both sides’ issue”.</p> 
<p>Rosas did not tell the president that, in previous years, he had filmed two infamous acts of rightwing political violence: <a href="https://x.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1298484633143775234">Kyle Rittenhouse shooting two people</a>, one fatally, in 2020; and Trump supporters <a href="https://x.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1346932861392232450">hurling a metal barricade</a> into the doors of the Capitol, <a href="https://x.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1346918106375995392">striking police officers</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1346939312647118849">attacking journalists</a> on 6 January 2021.</p> 
<p>Rosas is a correspondent for Glenn Beck’s Blaze TV with 230,000 followers on X.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Savanah Hernandez</h2> 
<p>Savanah Hernandez, a former host for the far-right, conspiracy theory outlet Infowars now <a href="https://x.com/sav_says_/status/1974154273664668045">creating videos in Portland</a> for Turning Point USA, was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-conservative-women-stand-liberal-mob-ingraham">celebrated on Fox News</a> in the summer of 2020 for a stunt in which she had herself filmed <a href="https://x.com/sav_says_/status/1282740963971137536">holding up a sign</a> that read “Police Lives Matter” during a Black Lives Matter protest that followed the murder of George Floyd.</p> 
<p>At the White House roundtable, she directed her rage at reporters from the White House pool covering the roundtable. “The same media that’s sitting in this room with us, has declared all of us at this table Nazis and fascists, and they’ve been doing this for years,” Hernandez said. “This is why Antifa feels emboldened to attack us.”</p> 
<p>What Hernandez was apparently not aware of is that, since the Trump administration now selects members of the press pool to be admitted to events with the president, many of the people she was yelling at actually worked for pro-Trump outlets.</p> 
<p>Hernandez is a contributor to Turning Point USA and a former Infowars host with 700,000 followers on X.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Cam Higby</h2> 
<p>Cam Higby is a Turning Point USA activist who got his start creating videos for PragerU, a rightwing media outlet that promotes climate-crisis denialism and soft-pedals the brutal reality of American slavery in educational films now approved for use in K-12 schools in 10 states.</p> 
<p>In recent weeks, Higby has <a href="https://x.com/camhigby/status/1974700670919070044">spent time in Portland</a>, but has also been emulating Turning Point’s murdered founder Charlie Kirk, by setting up tables on college campuses and challenging students to debate him. </p> 
<p>At the White House roundtable, however, Higby cast himself as a reporter unfairly targeted by antifa. “I’m attacked every time I do my job. When I leave my house to go to work, I’m violently assaulted. I’ve had guns pulled on me. I’ve been bear-sprayed. I’ve been beaten down. I’ve been almost killed,” <a href="https://x.com/EricLDaugh/status/1976023877248745741">he said</a>. </p> 
<p>Higby is a Turning Point USA media activist with 190,000 followers on X.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Nick Shirley</h2> 
<p>Nick Shirley, 23, started out making prank videos during his high school years in Utah but last year he began to make YouTube videos aimed at boosting Donald Trump. </p> 
<p>In February 2024, Shirley recorded himself asking migrants if they supported Joe Biden and shared video on X of several saying they did with the caption: “Confirmed: Migrants for Biden 2024”. Three months later, Shirley hired Latino day laborers at a Home Depot parking lot and paid them $20 each to appear in a video holding signs outside the White House with the slogans: “I Love Biden” and “I Need Work Permit for My Family.”</p> 
<p>Last month, he produced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHZD-HmCwvU">a friendly profile</a> of the English racist organizer Tommy Robinson, and called <a href="https://youtu.be/gehLCKdH5mw?si=A5eBjcQaEk21GMwc">a protest he attended</a> in Paris an “antifa riot”.</p> 
<p>Shirley has been in Portland in recent weeks, making a video he titled, “<a href="https://youtu.be/RKBvEKvDYIg?si=heu6oDt18G4iZtAP">Portland has Fallen... ANTIFA Take Control of City</a>”, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKMzQwtnWoY">telling Fox News</a> that Oregon’s governor, who refused to give him an interview during a protest march, had “sided with antifa”.</p> 
<p>Shirley is a YouTube influencer with 880,000 subscribers.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Jonathan Choe</h2> 
<p>Jonathan Choe, now a Turning Point USA correspondent, was <a href="https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2022/03/21/68783953/komo-journalist-blasts-out-proud-boy-propaganda">fired from his job</a> as a reporter for the ABC affiliate in Seattle in 2022 for producing <a href="https://youtu.be/NW8KeFTMG3c?si=b0djrAhYGr0bDJZ-&amp;t=158">what looked like</a> a promotional video for the Proud Boys, set to a song by a white supremacist, in his spare time.</p> 
<p>In addition to reporting on leftwing protests for rightwing outlets, he covers homelessness in Seattle as a fellow at the Discovery Institute, a Christian conservative thinktank . </p> 
<p>In May, Choe was filmed <a href="https://x.com/KatieDaviscourt/status/1927509884976681314">striking a protester in the face</a> with a baton and then insisting to police that he was the victim. “He assaulted me,” Choe shouted, in video recorded by Daviscourt.</p> 
<p>Last week in Portland, Choe <a href="https://x.com/FrontlinesTPUSA/status/1975105304078721460">filmed</a> a man he identified as “Maga patriot Thomas Allen” punching a protester and knocking them to the ground during a skirmish initiated by Sortor. When Allen was then arrested by the police, Choe suggested it was unjust because “antifa militants” had earlier in the night briefly seized Allen’s red Maga cap.</p> 
<p>Allen was arraigned last week for misdemeanor assault.</p> 
<p>Choe is a Turning Point USA correspondent with 180,000 followers on X.</p>

<h2>James Klug</h2> 
<p>James Klug is affiliated with Turning Point USA and known for videos in which he argues with and mocks liberals. </p> 
<p>On inauguration day 2021, Klug offered his followers <a href="https://youtu.be/eMXJvxwqY1o?si=b-W8rVShJiC1ZfpO&amp;t=280">a behind-the-scenes look</a> at how influencers like Rosas go undercover to capture violence at leftwing protests in the city and then appear on Fox News to put all the blame on antifa. </p> 
<p>The violence in that case was from a small group of anarchists who smashed windows at the Oregon Democratic party’s headquarters in Portland, as Joe Biden was sworn in as president. </p> 
<p>Rosas <a href="https://x.com/Julio_Rosas11/status/1352287339440074752">told Laura Ingraham</a> on Fox it was the work of antifa, although Rose City Antifa, the Portland group that helped revive the Nazi-era concept of antifascist organizing, said in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/city/2021/02/02/rose-city-antifa-distances-itself-from-protesters-who-smashed-windows-vandalized-property/?ref=robert-mackey-1.ghost.io">a statement</a>&nbsp;this was an anarchist action antifascists played no part in. </p> 
<p>Klug is a Turning Point USA ambassador with 617,000 YouTube subscribers.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Brandi Kruse</h2> 
<p>Brandi Kruse, a Republican podcaster who quit her job as a reporter for Seattle’s local Fox affiliate in 2021, recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H1JEw2AFQ0">spent 48 hours in Portland</a> for her podcast, a city she subsequently described as a “shithole”. She told Trump that she was a former critic who now endorsed him. </p> 
<p>Kruse also claimed the president’s antifascist rhetoric had already had an effect. “I genuinely believe there would be people at these tables who would be dead today, and would have been killed in Portland, had you not called them a terror organization and said we’re going to bring the full weight of the federal government to bear.”</p> 
<p>Kruse is a former local TV reporter from Seattle who has 165,000 followers on X.</p> 
<p></p> 
<h2>Jack Posobiec</h2> 
<p>Jack Posobiec, a former One America News host who left the fringe cable channel to start a show on the far-right network Real America’s Voice <a href="https://tpusa.com/live/human-events-daily-is-premiering-on-rav-tonight/">sponsored by</a> Turning Point USA, is best known for promoting the Pizzagate conspiracy theory. </p>
