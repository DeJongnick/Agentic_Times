<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> said that he wants to restart nuclear arms control talks with Russia and China and that eventually he hopes all three countries could agree to cut their massive defense budgets in half.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump lamented the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in rebuilding the nation’s nuclear deterrent and said he hopes to gain commitments from the US adversaries to cut their own spending.</p> <p>“There’s no reason for us to be building brand-new nuclear weapons. We already have so many,” Trump said. “You could destroy the world 50 times over, 100 times over. And here we are building new nuclear weapons, and they’re building nuclear weapons.”</p> <p>“We’re all spending a lot of money that we could be spending on other things that are actually, hopefully, much more productive,” Trump said.</p> <p>While the US and Russia have held massive stockpiles of weapons since the cold war, Trump predicted that China would catch up in their capability to exact nuclear devastation “within five or six years”.</p> <p>He said that if the weapons were ever called to use, “that’s going to be probably oblivion”.</p> <p>Trump said he would look to engage in nuclear talks with the two countries once “we straighten it all out” in the Middle East and Ukraine.</p> <p>“One of the first meetings I want to have is with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia. And I want to say: ‘Let’s cut our military budget in half.’ And we can do that. And I think we’ll be able to.”</p> <p>Trump in his first term tried and failed to bring China into nuclear arms reduction talks when the US and Russia were negotiating an extension of a pact known as New Start. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/21/putin-russia-halt-participation-new-start-nuclear-arms-treaty">Russia suspended its participation in the treaty during the Biden administration</a>, as the US and Russia continued on massive programs to extend the lifespans of or replace their cold war-era nuclear arsenals.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/05/us-arms-advantage-over-russia-and-china-threatens-stability-experts-warn">US arms advantage over Russia and China threatens stability, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Outlining his vision for a shake-up in the world order, Trump also said he would “love” to have Russia back in the G7, from which it was suspended in 2014 after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula.</p> <p>“I think it was a mistake to throw him out,” Trump said, referring to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>In his first term, Trump also called for Russia to be readmitted, but he found little support among other western countries.</p> <p>Trump revealed Wednesday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/12/trump-putin-ukraine-ceasefire">he expected to meet Putin separately for Ukraine peace talks</a>, in a sudden thaw in relations.</p> <p>In their first confirmed contact since Trump’s return to the White House, the US president said he had held a “highly productive” conversation with his Russian counterpart, who ordered the bloody 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</p>
