<p>A black coat is like a mortar and pestle: you only need one good one to see you through the years. A sleek black coat can be worn almost anywhere too, from a fancy night out to over tracky dacks for a pop down to the shops.</p> <p>But before you know it, the versatility of the aforementioned coat can unwittingly slide into monotony over winter.</p> <p>It’s my third winter with my trusty black coat – a cashmere and merino wool blend oversized number from <a href="https://au.shopthecurated.net/products/the-boyfriend-coat-black?variant=43614977786089">The Curated</a>. It’s seen the insides of many offices, pubs and train carriages, and it visits the dry cleaner once a year. Over a week, I challenged myself to style it five different ways.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/25/dont-feel-like-you-have-to-stop-at-one-the-shiny-thrifty-brooch-revival">‘Don’t feel like you have to stop at one’: the shiny, thrifty brooch revival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I naturally try to mix up my outfits as much as I can (because wearing the same black puffer jacket every day isn’t good for my mental health). I layer with thermals so I can still wear summer pieces, and style up outfits with accessories. A bulky belt, bright scarf or playful bag can help refresh a well-worn formula.</p> <p>Most of my accessories are secondhand. Some of the pieces I’m wearing here have been bought from a street vendor in Newtown’s Pride Square, a London car boot sale and various op-shops around Melbourne.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <h2>Office: day one</h2>    <p>Layers are your best friend in winter. I’m wearing a shrunken (oops!) wool sweater from McIntyre as my base – it was once roomy, but after an accidental hot wash it has become a snug, but still wearable undershirt. On top I’ve added an op-shopped red cardigan and scarf, all bundled under my coat. Layers don’t have to be particularly bulky to keep you warm. A little colour coordination doesn’t hurt anybody, either; there’s a recurring thin red stripe down these hand-me-down pants from my partner’s mum. Hot tip: wearing knee-high boots under flared pants adds extra warmth.</p> <h2>Office: day two</h2>    <p>There comes a time in the middle of winter when I become sick to bits of rotating through the same five pants. I’m currently there. I don’t believe in separate summer and winter wardrobes, especially with how tumultuous our climate is. My silky skirt and woven handbag don’t scream sub-10-degree temperatures, but that’s exactly why I gravitated towards them. I find that pairing cold-weather essentials (such as this coat and these leather boots) with brighter and lighter pieces is a simple way to shake me out of my winter fashion slump. Changing the hemline from pants to a calf-grazing skirt alters the way the coat sits. When both the skirt and coat fall at a similar height, it makes the coat look full-length.</p> <h2>Weekend: day one</h2>    <p>Since I saw LA cool girls declare that black coats pair well with activewear, <em>I’ve</em> wanted to pair <em>my</em> black coat with activewear. My first foray in that direction is draping a HoMie hoodie over my shoulders like a shawl. Immediately, I felt as if I could step into an Erewhon undetected. The contrast between a dapper coat and a casual hoodie adds a playful, celebrity-running-errands-paparazzi-shot energy to a get-up. And as my mother says, it’s always good to bring an extra layer.</p> <h2>Weekend: day two</h2>    <p>To make a black coat feel less corporate and more casual, I like to create oversized silhouettes. Baggy pants, a generous scarf (this one’s from New Zealand label Wynn Hamlyn) and a trucker hat tone down the coat’s formality. Playing around with how you button a shirt can switch up its vibe, too. One button says “I’m off-duty”; all buttons done up say “I mean business”.</p> <h2>Night out</h2>    <p>A black coat’s a black coat. No amount of colourful styling will change that. When the outing calls for it, I lean into its monochromatic sharpness. For a friend’s birthday out on the town, I paired a velvet bodysuit with some secondhand Levi’s jeans, and topped off the outfit with a chunky belt and striped handbag. When colour’s limited, mix up your textures instead.</p>
