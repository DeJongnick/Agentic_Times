<p>US spectators’ behaviour at the Ryder Cup (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/28/usa-fans-ryder-cup-rory-mcilroy">US fan ugliness at the Ryder Cup was merely a reflection of Trump’s all-caps America, 28 September</a>) reminded me how shrewd George Orwell was when, in 1945, he said serious sport was “<a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/the-sporting-spirit/">war minus the shooting</a>”. Sadly, how topical too. Perhaps women’s increasingly popular sport will do better.<br><strong>John Bailey</strong><br><em>St Albans</em></p> <p>• One of the great pleasures of the use of subtitles is spotting the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/19/interstellar-seven-types-of-mumble-dialogue-inaudible">mondegreens</a> (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/27/gen-z-watch-tv-subtitles-i-understand-why">Most of gen Z watch TV with the subtitles on – and I understand why, 27 September</a>). Among my favourites over the years: “night vision giggles” for “goggles”, “sliced alone” for “Sly Stallone”, “we found two deadly oceans” for “two dead Laotians” and “raw shock test” for “Rorschach test”.<br><strong>Ruth Eversley</strong><br><em>Paulton, Somerset</em></p> <p>• I can’t agree strongly enough with Chris Ramshaw’s letter about mumbled dialogue (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/29/branding-of-new-forest-ponies-is-indefensible">29 September</a>). And sometimes the speech is too fast for the subtitles to be read before the next barrage.<br><strong>Alyson Elliman</strong><br><em>Carshalton Beeches, London</em></p> <p>• Another hack for bread and butter pudding (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/26/just-desserts-for-a-brave-amusing-recreation-of-british-puddings">Letters, 26 September</a>) is hot cross buns, buttered and cut into strips. The sultanas and raisins in the buns also save a trip to the shop.<br><strong>Ann Smith</strong><br><em>Churchdown, Gloucestershire</em></p> <p>• I can’t see what all the fuss is about on digital ID (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/29/mixed-feelings-on-labours-plan-for-mandatory-digital-id">Letters, 29 September</a>).
