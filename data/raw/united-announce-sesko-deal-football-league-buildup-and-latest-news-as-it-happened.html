Is there a chance they come crashing down?</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Well, as long as Wrexham’s revenues continue to build, then they are probably a more sustainable entity than most. Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney foot the bills but the sideshows – the Disney+ documentary series, the overseas pre-season tours –fuel their ambitions. To a point.</p> <p>The Championship is still a bit of a wild west in terms of wages despite some clubs introducing wage caps – the jump in numbers from League One is something to which Phil Parkinson recently alluded – and they are undoubtedly having to hand out some handsome contracts to attract players. Their net spend is about £11m this summer and they have a bloated squad as a result of relatively overnight success. This summer Shaun Harvey, the former EFL chief executive who is a director at Wrexham, said: “Our wage bill per month now will be more than we paid for the whole time we were in the National League.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68971c538f08c69345b784aa" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/ben-fisher"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-09T10:20:14.599Z">11.20am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Acunnane under the line:</strong></p>  <figure class="element element-comment" data-canonical-url="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/172245492">  <div class="d2-comment-embedded" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <div class="d2-left-col"> <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/109252662" title="View acunnane’s profile"> <img class="d2-avatar" src="https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/109252662" height="40" width="40" alt="User avatar for acunnane"> </a>  </div> <div class="d2-right-col"> <div itemscope itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <a class="d2-username" href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/109252662" title="View acunnane’s profile" itemprop="url"> <span itemprop="givenName">acunnane</span> </a> </div> <div class="d2-permalink"> <a class="d2-datetime" href="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/172245492" title="Link to this comment" itemprop="datePublished">09 August 2025 10:12am</a> </div>  <div class="d2-body" itemprop="text"><p>Morning all! Question for Ben (and others): Do you believe the hype around MK Dons this season? Great manager in the form of Paul Warne, fantastic summer signings, but obviously we’re awful last season and finished 19th. Can Paul Warne change the culture at the club so quickly? Who else are likely to challenge in league two?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Yes, MK Dons have been super-aggressive in the summer window and therefore Paul Warne is naturally under pressure to win promotion. If anyone can change the culture at the club, I’d fancy Warne, who is a brilliant character as well as a manager with a solid track record. His endearing personality may actually help given they are going to be expected to win every week – I always remember how he told me he was dressed as an elf the day he was asked to step up to become the manager at Rotherham.

It commemorates the 36 children who relocated to Caerleon from Bilbao after fleeing the Spanish civil war in 1937.

At the same time Chansiri is not subject to any disqualifying conditions, so the English Football League are semi-powerless to anything, except regular dialogue with Chansiri’s advisers to encourage him to accelerate a sale. The EFL are of the belief Chansiri is trying to sell the club.</p> <p>Solidarity and basic payments from the Premier League and EFL dropped this week to help pay wages and ease cashflow but Wednesday are up against it in terms of creditors and HMRC. They are banned from paying fees for players until June 2027 owing to financial breaches.</p> <p>Chris Powell, assistant manager to Danny Rohl last season, recently described Wednesday as the “most functional dysfunctional club” he’s ever been at. Wednesday will fulfil their fixture at Leicester on Sunday but the fear is that the problems run and run. Then there will be more questions about boycotts.
