<h2>Joe Wicks: Licensed to Kill</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Love him or loathe him (how could you?!), Joe Wicks has got his first TV series – and, in an unexpected twist, he’s creating a “killer” snack bar for it. Wicks grew up on ultra-processed food and still likes a treat today, but now he is teaming up with Dr Chris van Tulleken to work on a stunt that will put pressure on the government to make changes to the food industry. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Trace, Track, Get My Car Back</h2> <p><strong>2pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>A new series offering a daytime dive into the varied world of car crime. First, a look at the use of hire cars for criminal activity. In this episode, police track a rental Land Rover that has been linked to street robberies in Manchester; while, in Nottingham, they hunt for a stolen three-tonne digger. If it’s not nailed down … <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Blue Lights</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong></p>    <p>As series three of the Belfast-set police procedural continues, Sgt Sandra Cliff (Andi Osho) declares the cop shop “a craic-free zone”. She’s right: there’s nothing but tension in the air, not least when a gnarly car accident kickstarts events that put Aisling (Dearbháile McKinney) and her colleagues in serious danger. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Secrets of the Brain</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Two</strong><strong><br></strong>Prof Jim Al-Khalili continues his journey of discovery into the human body’s control centre with a trip to watch primates in the rainforest taking on survival challenges. Elsewhere, he and his wife, Julie, look into how important close relationships are in making people more intelligent (spoiler alert: very). <em>Nicole Vassell</em></p> <h2>Task</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic</strong><strong><br></strong>Tensions are running high, as Robbie (Tom Pelphrey) hunts down Ray, gun in hand, frantic for answers about Cliff. Meanwhile, Tom (Mark Ruffalo) and his FBI taskforce are closing in, piecing together clues from family ties and surveillance. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Social Media Monsters</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>This new true-crime strand begins with an episode on the murder of 15-year-old Holly Newton in Northumberland in 2023, and the harassment she endured from her former boyfriend prior to her death. While review copies were unavailable, here’s hoping it is handled with the sensitivity it so clearly deserves. <em>HJD</em></p> <h2>Film choices</h2> <p><strong>The Deadly Affair (Sidney Lumet,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>196</strong><strong>7</strong><strong>), </strong><strong>10.05pm, Talking Pictures TV</strong></p>    <p>Based on John le Carré’s first novel, which introduced stolid spy hero George Smiley, but Sidney Lumet’s cool mystery didn’t have the rights to his name. So James Mason stars as MI6 agent Charles Dobbs, who investigates the alleged suicide of a possible double agent married to Simone Signoret’s concentration camp survivor. But his patient process is put into sharp relief by a messy personal life with his adulterous wife Ann (Harriet Andersson). <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <p><strong>Io Capitano (Matteo Garrone, 2023), </strong><strong>11.35pm, Film4</strong></p>    <p>The story of two teenage migrants journeying from Senegal to Europe gets a sympathetic treatment from Gomorrah director Matteo Garrone. Seydou (Seydou Sarr, running the gamut from petrified to bullish) and his cousin Moussa (Moustapha Fall) face a perilous trip through Mali and Niger then across the Sahara to the Mediterranean coast, one that starts as a hopeful adventure but soon becomes a fight for survival. Garrone places the boys against beautiful landscapes and throws in dream sequences, giving the film an oddly magical feel at times. But ultimately, it’s a harsh, cautionary tale. <em>SW</em></p>
