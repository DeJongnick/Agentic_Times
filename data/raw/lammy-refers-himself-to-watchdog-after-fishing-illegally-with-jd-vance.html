<p>David Lammy has referred himself to the environment watchdog after going fishing with JD Vance without the required licence during the US vice-president’s trip to the UK.</p> 
<p>The foreign secretary hosted Vance and his family at Chevening House in Kent last week, where the pair fished from the property’s private lake. Anglers aged 13 and over must hold a rod licence to fish for freshwater species such as carp in England and Wales. Lammy failed to land a catch, but “all of my kids did”, Vance said.</p> 
<p>The Foreign Office said an “administrative oversight” meant licences had not been obtained in advance. Lammy bought them as soon as he was made aware, and wrote to the Environment Agency to acknowledge the breach. “He also thanked them for their work protecting Britain’s fisheries,” a Foreign Office spokesperson said.</p> 
<p>The agency confirmed the licences had since been bought. All fish caught during the visit were returned to the water.</p> 
<p>The fishing trip formed part of a wider UK tour by Vance, who was on holiday in the Cotswolds with his wife, Usha, and three children. The visit has combined family time with private political meetings and a heavy security presence in the normally quiet Oxfordshire countryside.</p> 
<p>Vance’s stay at Dean Manor, an 18th-century Georgian home, reportedly arranged by the former chancellor George Osborne, led to road closures, police checkpoints and the installation of a temporary helipad. Pippa and Johnny Hornby, who own the property, later apologised to residents for the “circus” caused by the vice-president’s security detail.</p>

<p>Protesters from the Stop Trump Coalition <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/cotswolds-residents-protest-against-jd-vance-visit-charlbury">held a “Vance not welcome” party in nearby Charlbury</a>, attended by about 100 people carrying placards and cakes mocking the Republican politician. Some slogans took aim at Vance’s record on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday evening, Vance was greeted by dozens of pro-Palestine protesters bashing pots and pans as he arrived at the luxury Carnell Estate near Kilmarnock in East Ayrshire.</p> 
<p>Vance has held informal talks with senior Conservatives, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/12/jd-vance-has-met-robert-jenrick-on-cotswolds-visit-but-not-expected-to-see-kemi-badenoch">including the shadow justice secretary, Robert Jenrick</a>, and the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp. He also attended a breakfast with Nigel Farage. According to US and UK officials, discussions with Lammy covered Ukraine, Gaza, trade and concerns from Washington about aspects of UK legislation, including the Online Safety Act.</p> 
<p>The Foreign Office said Lammy and Vance had enjoyed a warm and constructive meeting. Vance described the foreign secretary as a good friend and “very, very gracious host” despite his failure to catch a fish.</p>
