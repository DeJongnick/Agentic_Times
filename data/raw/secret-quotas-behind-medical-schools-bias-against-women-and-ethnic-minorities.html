<p>Your article brings most welcome news (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/06/female-doctors-outnumber-male-peers-in-uk-for-first-time">Female doctors outnumber male peers in UK for first time, 6 February</a>). It also reminds one that change takes an&nbsp;eternity.</p> <p>In 1985, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/13/we-were-made-to-feel-like-outcasts-the-psychiatrist-who-blew-the-whistle-on-racism-in-british-medicine">Aggrey Burke and I published a study showing that secret quotas existed in all the London medical schools</a> which limited the numbers of women and&nbsp;minority ethnic students that they allowed to be admitted to study medicine. </p> <p>A year later, we discovered that at St George’s hospital medical school, this quota was achieved by using “discriminatory” computer software to unfairly limit such students’ access.</p> <p>This discovery was investigated by the Commission for Racial Equality in 1988 and the discriminatory practices were exposed, and they immediately ceased throughout&nbsp;the&nbsp;UK.</p> <p>I write to point out that the change to reach staff equality has taken 40 years, equivalent to a generation. If only society could&nbsp;move faster.<br><strong>Joe Collier</strong><br><em>Emeritus professor of medicines policy at St George’s</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
