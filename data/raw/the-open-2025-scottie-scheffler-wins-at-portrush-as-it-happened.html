In fact, it was pretty much the only time all week he <em>didn’t</em> look inevitable, the only hole out of 72 in which he didn’t act in his usual cool, composed, absurdly talented fashion. The world number one now has four majors to his name, and is just a US Open victory away from the career slam. An extraordinary force of nature. And he’s <em>delighted</em>.

He tides up for par, a final round of 69, and finishes his week at -10. Yep, not how he would have dreamt it, but it’s a pretty special moment anyway. He acknowledges the gallery, shakes hands with Matt Fitzpatrick – par, 69, -11 – and turns again to wave everyone thanks and goodbye before disappearing down the tunnel.

Birdies at 3, 4, 7, 9 and 12. He’s -7 for the championship, and if he’d got his act together like this for his first round, he’d be thinking about breaking Henrik Stenson’s record for lowest winning total of 264, set at Troon in 2016, and it’d be Scottie Scheffler doing all the chasing today. But he didn’t, so he isn’t, and Scottie won’t be, so here we are.

Lowry’s gone out in style, in more ways than one: he went out in 32 strokes, and then nearly holed out from the bottom of the big swale to the left of 18. Inches away from a sensational valedictory blow. A 66 to bid farewell, and he ends the week at -2.
