<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/01/uk-experienced-its-hottest-summer-on-record-in-2025-met-office-says">Record warm weather</a> and a Bank of England <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/07/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-quarter-point-4">interest rate cut</a> lifted retail sales in August, according to the latest survey, but retailers fear that speculation about tax rises could weigh on consumers in the crucial pre-Christmas trading period.</p> <p>Retail sales increased 3.1% year on year as consumer spending on food and drink rose, and sales of computers and related equipment performed well as parents readied children for the new school year.</p> <p>However, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which publishes the monthly figures in conjunction with KPMG, said the 4.7% boost in spending on food and drink was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/07/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-quarter-point-4">due to price rises</a> as opposed to consumers buying more products.</p> <p>The report said food inflation was driven by rising prices across staples including beef, chocolate and coffee.</p> <p>And while computing – and gaming – continued to show strong sales, parents facing an expensive start to the new school year cut back on buying uniforms.</p> <p>The BRC said businesses were concerned about sales in the golden quarter, the crucial three-month period in the run-up to Christmas that many retailers rely on for the bulk of their revenues.</p> <p>“Sunny weather and an interest rate cut helped August round off a solid summer of sales,” said the chief executive, Helen Dickinson. “Despite a better summer, retailers approach the golden quarter with caution.</p> <p>“With the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-tax-increases">later-than-expected budget</a> falling just days before Black Friday [discount sales], many are uneasy about how consumer confidence and spending could be impacted by tax rise speculation in the run-up to Christmas.”</p> <p>Last week, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, announced the budget <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/03/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-tax-increases">would be held on 26 November</a>, later than many had expected.</p> <p>Last month’s sales increase followed a rise of 2.5% in July, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/12/warm-weather-england-euros-success-lifted-uk-retail-sales-in-july">fuelled by warm weather and England’s successful Euros football campaign</a>, and 3.1% in June.</p> <p>The latest report also found furniture sales grew for the second month in a row, after months of decline, as did home goods such as appliances, DIY products and garden tools.</p> <p>Linda Ellett, the head of consumer, retail and leisure at KPMG, said: “Sales of many home goods have been seeing monthly increases since the spike in property transactions ahead of the changes to stamp duty in April.</p> <p>“Home appliances, accessories and DIY and garden tools all saw sales growth in August. New product launches also boosted mobile phone sales.”</p> <p>In late July and August, Samsung launched <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/23/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-android-review-thinner-lighter-better-folding">two models of its Galaxy foldable phone</a>, and Google <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/04/google-pixel-10-review-the-new-benchmark-for-a-standard-flagship-phone">rolled out the Pixel 10</a>.</p> <p>Overall non-food sales increased by 1.8% year on year last month, the third consecutive monthly increase.</p> <p>However, the report also found that shopper confidence fell for the third consecutive month in August, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/07/bank-of-england-cuts-interest-rates-quarter-point-4">many expecting further food price inflation</a> and other financial pressures.</p> <p>Sarah Bradbury, the chief executive of the Institute of Grocery Distribution, said: “The emotional weight of rising energy bills and fears of tax hikes in the autumn budget are adding to the strain, especially as unemployment ticks upward</p> <p>“Yet there are glimmers of relief: interest rates have been cut again, and mortgage rates are easing, offering some financial respite. Financially resilient shoppers may remain more confident, even as they brace for a challenging winter.”</p>
