<h1>Deadly heatwaves are the new reality – we need to transform the UK’s cities and towns to survive them</h1>

<p>There’s a lot to be anxious about as a new parent, let alone in a heatwave when the thermometer in your one-year-old daughter’s room is reading 26C. That’s six degrees higher than the upper limit of the <a href="https://www.lullabytrust.org.uk/baby-safety/safer-sleep-information/room-temperature/">recommended temperature</a> for a child’s room. After scrolling my phone for advice on how to cool her room, I couldn’t help waking up every few hours to check she was OK on the baby monitor.</p> <p>In the UK, we are unprepared at every level for the extreme weather caused by climate breakdown. Whether it’s unbearably hot buildings in the summer, our damp and cold homes (some of the leakiest in Europe) filled with mould in the winter, our unprotected towns built on flood plains, or our unfit-for-purpose train tracks that get shut down at the slightest weather warning, the climate crisis is already wreaking havoc on public and private infrastructure – and it’s only getting worse.</p> <p>Despite heatwaves becoming more common in the UK, the dangers from extreme heat are not well known. Heatwaves are often described as “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/27/the-silent-killer-what-you-need-to-know-about-heatwaves">silent killers</a>” – elderly and vulnerable people are at risk of dying alone and in their homes. At the moment, the <a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/2025/04/30/the-country-is-not-prepared-for-climate-impacts-say-advisors/">government’s own advisers say</a> that heat deaths could rise several times over to exceed 10,000 in an average year by 2050 without action. Vulnerable groups such as disabled people, elderly people and children are most at risk from extreme heat. But low-paid workers and those forced to work outside are at high risk as well. Take the example of the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/barcelona-investigates-street-sweepers-death-as-spain-swelters-in-heatwave/ar-AA1HKKe7">Spanish street sweeper</a> who died last week in Barcelona after working for hours in the heat of the day, or the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/13/the-story-of-a-heat-death-david-went-to-work-in-his-new-job-on-a-french-building-site-by-the-end-of-the-day-he-was-dead">construction worker David Azevedo</a> who died in France in 2022.</p> <p>The main solution offered up to us is air conditioning – but it actively worsens climate effects and extreme heat for everyone else by pumping hot air into the streets while using huge amounts of power. Air conditioning can actually <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/08/30/fact-check-is-air-conditioning-making-cities-hotter">raise the temperature</a> of cities by more than 2C, and it was found that cooling measures <a href="https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/03/EN-Ember-Report_Powering-through-the-heat-how-2024-heatwaves-reshaped-electricity-demand.pdf">accounted for an estimated 37%</a> of the increase in US electricity demand during April-September 2024 compared with the same period the year before.</p> <p>Instead of jumping to this as the only solution, we need to embrace practical, low-carbon solutions such as increasing tree cover and greenery in our cities, and utilising the <a href="https://www.ceh.ac.uk/news-and-media/news/green-spaces-and-wetlands-keep-cities-cool-during-heatwaves">shade they provide to release water vapour into the air </a>and improve air quality. The government could invest in water-cooling methods such as <a href="https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu/en/metadata/adaptation-options/water-uses-to-cope-with-heat-waves-in-cities">sustainable fountains, splash pads and spray parks</a>, protect bodies of water such as canals, and continue to implement measures to lessen car use – while prioritising air conditioning for the places that need it most such as hospitals, care homes, public transport and nurseries.</p>    <p>Redesigning our cities and towns this way could be transformative. For example, Barcelona has a burgeoning network of more than <a href="https://www.barcelona.cat/barcelona-pel-clima/en/specific-actions/climate-shelters-network/shelters-list">400 free shelters</a> that offer refuge from sweltering summer heat and the winter cold. And in Singapore, <a href="https://www.sg101.gov.sg/resources/connexionsg/environment-urban-heat-island-effect">open spaces around buildings</a> have been added in addition to extending green spaces and implementing other measures such as using lighter colours on roofs and walls.</p> <p>Homeowners should be supported, and landlords required to reduce internal heat in houses. Councils and governments should be upgrading social infrastructure, including hospitals and nursing homes, with insulation, reflective surfaces and good ventilation to avoid them from overheating. We could also begin exploring the use of green walls and roofs as well as external shading through trees, awnings, external blinds and shutters. Investing in these measures could be supported by a fairer taxation system, to ensure polluting corporations and those with extreme wealth <a href="https://www.gndrising.org/pay-up/">pay up</a> to help tackle these issues.</p> <p>It’s not just regulation and building rules that should be changed – we need to ensure workers’ rights are at the heart of adaptation planning too. While there are accepted lower temperature limits for workplaces, there is still no legal upper limit for how hot an office or factory can be. This must be changed to ensure workers are protected and employers invest in heatproofing. The <a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/Temperature.pdf">TUC</a>, among other trade union bodies, wants to see a legal maximum temperature for indoor work of 30C (27C for those doing strenuous work). There should also be a legal duty for employers to protect those working outside by providing sun protection and water, and organising work so they are not outside during the hottest part of the day.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/01/italy-limits-outdoor-work-as-heatwave-breaks-records-across-europe">Italy limits outdoor work as heatwave breaks records across Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Local authorities could help the public make sensible decisions by giving timely information on heat warnings. And the NHS must do more to alert vulnerable people with heart and respiratory conditions to the dangers, as rates of death caused by heat start to climb at much lower temperatures than we expect.</p> <p>As we make the case for these necessary and fair adaptations to a warming world, we must not forget that there is still a moral case to reduce our emissions. Every degree of warming makes a difference to the overall impact on our planet and humanity at large – and to approach the adaptation debate with an either/or mindset is to lose on both fronts. It is challenging, but the truth is we must not just accept the trajectory we are on as if we have no power to change course. We must double down on our efforts to push our political leaders to drastically reduce our emissions in a way that is fair, as well as investing in the resilience of communities to ensure we are able to live well as temperatures continue to rise.
