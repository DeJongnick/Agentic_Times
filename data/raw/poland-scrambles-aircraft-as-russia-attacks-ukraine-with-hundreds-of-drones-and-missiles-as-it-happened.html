 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>This blog will be closing shortly, below is a recap of today’s developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Polish and allied aircraft were deployed early on Saturday to ensure the safety of Polish airspace after Russia launched airstrikes targeting western <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> near the border with Poland, armed forces of the Nato-member country said. </strong>“Polish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, while ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have been brought to the highest state of readiness,” the operational command said in a post on X.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russia fired 40 missiles and about 580 drones at Ukraine in a “massive attack” that killed three and wounded dozens, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday.</strong> “Every such strike is not a military necessity but a deliberate strategy by Russia to terrorise civilians and destroy our infrastructure,” Zelenskyy said on social media, urging Kyiv’s allies to provide more air defence systems and hit Moscow with extra sanctions. He said attacks took place across nine regions, including Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Zaporizhzhia, Poltava, Kyiv, Odesa, Sumy and Kharkiv.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Sergiy Lysak, the head of the Ukrainian military administration in the Dnipropetrovsk region, said Russia’s latest strikes killed one person and wounded 30, with one man in a serious condition.</strong> Vyacheslav Chaus from the regional administration in Chernigiv in northern Ukraine said a 62-year-old man died in a drone attack. About 20 residential buildings were damaged in the Khmelnytskyi region, local official Sergiy Tyurin said on Telegram, adding that one body was found “during the extinguishing of a fire in one of the houses.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s south-western Samara region killed four people,</strong> the local governor said on Saturday as Kyiv said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> had been targeted with hundreds of Russian drones overnight.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A cyber-attack at a service provider for check-in and boarding systems has disrupted operations at several major European airports including London’s Heathrow, Brussels and Berlin’s Brandenburg, causing flight delays and cancellations on Saturday. </strong>Collins Aerospace owner RTX said on Saturday that it had become aware of a cyber-related disruption to its MUSE software in selected airports, adding that it was “actively working to resolve the issue and restore full functionality to our customers as quickly as possible”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy will urge Donald Trump to impose sanctions on Russia when they meet next week at the United Nations in New York, and has called on Ukraine’s allies to “stop wasting time”.</strong> Zelenskyy said he expected further sanctions to be imposed if <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> refuses to meet him for face-to-face talks or to agree to a ceasefire. “If the war continues and there are no moves towards peace we expect sanctions,” he said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland on Friday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/estonia">Estonia</a> said, triggering complaints of a dangerous new provocation from the EU and Nato. </strong>Italian F-35 fighters attached to Nato’s air defence support mission in the Baltic states were scrambled to intercept the Russian jets and warn them off, Estonian and Italian officials said, with alliance chief Mark Rutte praising the “quick and decisive response”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry on Friday denied that three of its MiG-31 fighter jets had illegally entered Estonian airspace. </strong>The ministry said the jets were on a “scheduled flight... in strict compliance with international airspace regulations and did not violate the borders of other states, as confirmed by objective monitoring”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy on Friday condemned the move, calling the 12-minute incursion “outrageous” and accusing Moscow of deliberately expanding its “destabilising activity” three and a half years after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. </strong>“These are not accidents. This is a systematic Russian campaign directed against Europe, against Nato, against the West. And it requires a systemic response,” Zelenskyy posted on X.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>UK chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce plans to explore using frozen Russian assets to fund a “reparations loan” that could provide billions of pounds for Ukraine’s war effort.</strong> The chancellor is expected to make the announcement at a meeting with her European counterparts in Copenhagen on Saturday, saying it is “right to explore all options to support Ukraine”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>One or more large fires erupted early on Saturday at Russia’s Saratov oil refinery as it was hit heavily by Ukrainian drones that attacked the target deep inside Russian territory for at least the second time in a week. </strong>Videos vetted and posted by online analysts showed incoming UAVs followed by big explosions and flames rising from the site while air raid sirens blared. The major refinery is nearly 600km (370 miles) east of the frontline in Ukraine. The Russian governor in the area, Roman Busargin, confirmed an attack by UAVs.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Firefighters, supported by troops, battled two wildfires on Saturday in north-west Spain,</strong> fuelled by dry conditions and high temperatures, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.</p> 
  <p>In the province of <strong>Lugo in Galicia,</strong> 82 brigades and 25 water bombing aircraft were tackling a fire that erupted on Thursday, which has so far destroyed about 1,400 hectares (3,500 acres), the regional government said in a statement.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, 34 brigades and 17 aircraft were fighting a separate blaze in neighbouring <strong>Ourense province,</strong> also ignited on Thursday, which has consumed around 240 hectares.</p> 
  <p>Both fires have been classified as “status two”, signalling a threat to built-up areas.</p> 
  <p>Dozens of people were evacuated overnight on Friday, though most have since returned home.</p> 
  <p>The fires come as Spain experiences warmer-than-usual temperatures, with parts of Galicia exceeding 30C in recent days.</p> 
  <p>Temperatures are expected to fall later on Saturday, with rain forecast to aid firefighting efforts.</p> 
  <p>Western and northwestern Spain, along with neighbouring Portugal, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/04/spain-portugal-wildfire-weather-climate-crisis-study">were hit by devastating wildfires this summer.</a></p> 
  <p>Four people died in each country, with nearly 330,000 hectares burned in Spain and almost 250,000 hectares in Portugal in just a few weeks, according to the European Forest Fires Information System.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Zelenskyy accuses allies of ‘wasting time’ as he prepares for Trump meeting</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lukeharding">Luke Harding</a></strong> reporting from <strong>Kyiv</strong>:</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> will urge <strong>Donald Trump</strong> to impose sanctions on <strong>Russia</strong> when they meet next week at the <strong>United Nations</strong> in <strong>New York</strong>, and has called on <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s allies to “stop wasting time”.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy said he expected further sanctions to be imposed if <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> refuses to meet him for face-to-face talks or to agree to a ceasefire. “If the war continues and there are no moves towards peace we expect sanctions,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Trump has repeatedly threatened to take action against Russia but has so far failed to follow through. Last week he said the <strong>US</strong> was ready to “do major sanctions” – but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/trump-ready-to-impose-sanctions-on-russia-if-nato-nations-stop-buying-its-oil">only after all </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/trump-ready-to-impose-sanctions-on-russia-if-nato-nations-stop-buying-its-oil">Nato</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/trump-ready-to-impose-sanctions-on-russia-if-nato-nations-stop-buying-its-oil"> countries agreed to stop buying oil from Russia</a>, and to put tariffs on <strong>China</strong>, another big importer.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to a group of journalists in Kyiv, including the Guardian, Zelenskyy expressed frustration at the pace of events. He said to “tie up” possible US sanctions with demands on <strong>European</strong> countries to move first was to “slow down the pressure on Putin”.</p> 
  <p>Speaking in his presidential office, Zelenskyy said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>President Trump expects strong action from Europe. I think we are wasting a lot of time if sanctions are not imposed or some steps are not taken, that we very much expect from him [Trump].</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Trump’s close allies <strong>Hungary</strong> and <strong>Slovakia</strong> have refused to cut energy ties with <strong>Moscow</strong>. They are the last two <strong>EU</strong> members still buying Russian oil via the <strong>Druzhba pipeline</strong>. Ukraine <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/22/ukraine-attacks-pipeline-that-sends-russian-oil-to-hungary-and-slovakia">bombed it last month</a>, prompting an angry response from Hungary’s prime minister, <strong>Viktor Orbán</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy said he wanted the “whole of Europe” to impose sanctions. He said Trump could “push” European countries to do more and added that Slovakia’s pro-Russian government was likely to respond to American pressure. “Everyone is looking to the United States,” he said.</p> 
  <p>He reiterated his willingness to meet Putin in any format – either one to one, or “trilaterally”, with the US president in the room. <strong>The Kremlin</strong> says the “root causes” of the conflict have to be addressed before this can happen, referring to Ukraine’s capitulation.</p>

  <p><strong>UK</strong> chancellor <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong> will announce plans to explore using frozen <strong>Russian</strong> assets to fund a “reparations loan” that could provide billions of pounds for <strong>Ukraine</strong>’s war effort, reports the PA news agency.</p> 
  <p>The chancellor is expected to make the announcement at a meeting with her <strong>European</strong> counterparts in <strong>Copenhagen</strong> on Saturday, saying it is “right to explore all options to support Ukraine”.</p> 
  <p>It comes after <strong>European Commission</strong> president <strong>Ursula von der Leyen</strong> last week suggested providing a loan to Ukraine backed by the “cash balances” associated with Russian assets frozen by the <strong>EU</strong>. She did not provide details of how it would work, but the move would allow the EU to use Russian assets to fund Ukraine without immediately confiscating them, which several countries fear would breach international law.</p> 
  <p>According to the PA news agency, <strong>Treasury</strong> officials also declined to discuss the mechanisms the UK would consider, but said they would be developed alongside the EU and comply with international law.</p> 
  <p>Reeves said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While Russia has no respect for international law, the UK does.</p> 
   <p>We will only consider options in line with international law and that are economically and financially responsible.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In March, the UK announced it would provide a £2.26bn loan to Ukraine based on profits generated by frozen Russian assets. But the government has been urged to go further, with the Liberal Democrats calling for ministers to seize the assets outright and use them to support Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>The Treasury said a “reparations loan” could see billions of pounds made available for Ukraine without touching the underlying assets. Reeves said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is Russia’s war, and Russia should pay. It is right to explore all options to support Ukraine.</p> 
   <p>Defending against Russian aggression is vital not just to the long-term security and prosperity of Ukraine, but to the UK and the whole of Europe.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Since the outbreak of war, the UK has committed up to £21.8bn for Ukraine, just less than the £25bn of Russian assets the government has frozen, reports the PA news agency.</p>

  <p><em>Ruth Michaelson is a journalist based in Istanbul</em></p> 
  <p>The outgoing head of MI6 has issued a damning indictment of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying that Vladimir Putin has “bitten off more than he can chew”.</p> 
  <p>Richard Moore, known within MI6 as C, used his farewell speech in Istanbul to say that while Russia was unlikely to win on the battlefield, his agency was seeking to recruit spies inside Russia and worldwide in order to fight back.</p> 
  <p>“Putin has sought to convince the world that Russian victory is inevitable, but he lies. He lies to the world. He lies to his people. Perhaps he even lies to himself,” said Moore. “But we should not believe him. Or credit him with strength he does not have.”</p> 
  <p>Any Russian victories on the battlefield remained incremental, said Moore, and incurred massive costs as the president’s army fell far short of its original aims to swiftly capture all of Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>The rising costs now included more than a million casualties – a quarter of them “poorly trained troops from Russia’s poorest regions” that were “fed into the meat grinder”, he said.</p>

  <p>Russian forces have been grinding across eastern Ukraine for months, trying to take control of the <strong>Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</strong></p> 
  <p>Hopes of a truce have faded since <strong>US president Donald Trump</strong> held separate high-profile meetings with his <strong>Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin</strong> and <strong>Ukraine’s Zelenskyy</strong> last month.</p> 
  <p>In other developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland on Friday, Estonia said, triggering complaints of a dangerous new provocation from the EU and Nato.</strong> Italian F-35 fighters attached to Nato’s air defence support mission in the Baltic states were scrambled to intercept the Russian jets and warn them off, Estonian and Italian officials said, with alliance chief Mark Rutte praising the “quick and decisive response”.</p></li>

This is a systematic Russian campaign directed against Europe, against Nato, against the West. And it requires a systemic response,” Zelenskyy posted on X.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>President Donald Trump said on Friday he would soon be briefed on reports that Russia had violated Estonia’s airspace and made clear he was not pleased with the situation. </strong>“I don’t love it. I don’t like when that happens. Could be big trouble,” Trump told reporters.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>One or more large fires erupted early on Saturday at</strong> <strong>Russia’s Saratov oil refinery</strong> <strong>as it was hit heavily by Ukrainian drones</strong> <strong>that attacked the target deep inside Russian territory for at least the second time in a week.</strong> Videos vetted and posted by online analysts showed incoming UAVs followed by big explosions and flames rising from the site while air raid sirens blared. The major refinery is nearly 600km (370 miles) east of the frontline in Ukraine. The Russian governor in the area, Roman Busargin, confirmed an attack by UAVs.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The EU proposed on Friday to bring forward by a year to January 2027 a total ban on Russian natural gas imports as part of its 19th package of sanctions targeting Moscow. </strong>The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said “it is time to turn off the tap” of fossil fuel revenue to the Kremlin. Zelenskyy welcomed the measures, saying they would have a significant effect on the Russian economy.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ukrainian troops pressed on with a frontline counteroffensive around two eastern cities on Friday with Zelenskyy saying heavy losses were being inflicted on Russian forces. </strong>The counteroffensive had disrupted Russian plans in their longstanding objective of seizing the logistics centre of Pokrovsk, said Ukraine’s president. Russia said its forces captured two new villages – Muravka outside Pokrovsk and Novoivanivka further in the Zaporizhzhia region – but its defence ministry made no reference to the Ukrainian drive near the towns of Pokrovsk and Dobropillia.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The general staff of Ukraine’s military listed Muravka among settlements where its forces had halted 87 attacks near Pokrovsk.</strong> Zelenskyy also said Ukrainian forces were holding their positions around Kupiansk – an area of Ukraine’s north-eastern Kharkiv region that has been subject to Russian assaults for months.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy said on Friday that Kyiv plans to begin exporting certain types of weapons, such as naval drones, to finance its domestic military production.</strong> “We already have certain types of weapons in much larger quantities than we actually need today in Ukraine,” Zelenskyy said in his daily address.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russia has filed an appeal with the International Court of Justice over a decision deeming Moscow responsible for the downing of a Malaysian jetliner over Ukraine in 2014, killing 298 people, the court said on Friday.</strong> Australia and the Netherlands, the countries with the most fatalities in the disaster, had launched the case, calling for Russia to assume responsibility for the downing and pay damages.</p></li>
