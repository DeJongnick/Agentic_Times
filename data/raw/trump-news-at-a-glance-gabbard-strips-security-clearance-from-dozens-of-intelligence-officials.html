<p>National intelligence director <strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong> said on Tuesday that she had stripped security clearances from 37 current and former national security officials, including some who worked on the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.</p> <p>In a memo <a href="https://x.com/DNIGabbard/status/1957893651327332529/photo/1">posted on X</a>, Gabbard accused the targeted individuals of having engaged in “politicizing and manipulating intelligence, leaking classified intelligence without authorization, and/or committing intentional egregious violations of tradecraft standards”.</p> <p>This move is the latest in a series of retributions by the Trump administration against national security officials and political opponents he views as adversaries. In March, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/22/trump-revokes-security-clearances-political-enemies">Trump revoked security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris</a>, and several other Democrats and critics. The order also stripped access from former secretary of state Antony Blinken, former representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, New York attorney general Letitia James – who prosecuted Trump for fraud – and Biden’s entire family.</p> <p>Here are the key Trump administration news of the day:</p>  <h2>Trump rules out sending US troops to Ukraine as part of security guarantees</h2>  <p>Donald Trump has ruled out sending US troops to Ukraine to enforce a potential peace deal with Vladimir Putin, tempering a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump">promise to provide Kyiv with security guarantees</a> that European allies had called a significant breakthrough towards halting the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Asked during a phone interview with Fox News whether he could assure listeners – including many members of his Maga base who support an isolationist America-first foreign policy – that the US would not put troops on the ground in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>, Trump said: “You have my assurance, and I’m president.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/european-leaders-ukraine-russia-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>DoJ investigates DC police over allegedly fudged crime statistics</h2>  <p>Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into allegations that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/washington-dc">Washington DC</a> police systematically manipulated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/ukcrime">crime</a> statistics to make the city appear safer than it actually is.</p> <p>The probe, anonymous sources tell the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/19/trump-police-dc-takeover-justice-department/">Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/justice-department-investigating-whether-dc-police-manipulated-crime-d-rcna225886?cid=eml_nbn_20250819&amp;user_email=44c11d5d46c3757ec95f4420aa14bc672186d4206f29a3824bba58589834f455&amp;utm_campaign=breakingnews">NBC News</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-investigating-possible-dc-crime-data-manipulation-amid-trumps-crackdown-violence">Fox News</a>, being conducted by the US attorney’s office for the District of Columbia under Jeanine Pirro, is the latest escalation between the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> and DC officials over federal control of local <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-police">policing</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/19/washington-dc-crime-stats-investigation"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Teen detained by Ice while walking dog</h2>  <p>A southern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> community is calling for the release of a high school student whom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">US immigration</a> agents arrested earlier this month while he was walking his dog.</p> <p>Benjamin Marcelo Guerrero-Cruz<strong> </strong>was supposed to be starting his senior year of high school at Reseda charter high school this month.
