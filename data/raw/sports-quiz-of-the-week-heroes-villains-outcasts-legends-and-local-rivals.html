    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - Kudos to both men., 2:A - And we thought the third Test, which England won by 22 runs, was a close one., 3:A - They have moved to different countries – Son to the United States and Müller to Canada – but will be meeting in MLS., 4:C - Miyū Yamashita won the tournament at Royal Porthcawl in Wales, with Minami Katsu and Rio Takeda also making in on to the leaderboard., 5:A - Her shot bounced off Steph Kyriacou’s ball and rolled into the hole., 6:B - Costa fell out with the Porto manager Octávio Machado in 2001 and was sent on loan to Charlton, where he made 24 appearances., 7:A - The Lions only scored one more point than Australia over the three Tests., 8:C - Ferrand-Prévot was destined for cycling success. Her father ran a bike shop, her mother ran a cycling school, her uncle is a former mountain biking champion and her sister is a successful cyclist., 9:D - They met at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee, a venue with a capacity of 146,000., 10:B - “I got my passport out to take a photo to send to the manager and I left it on my bedside table,” Carter said. “My partner went to the gym and left my dog home alone and it’s gone down the hallway, jumped on the bed and just chewed up the passport. It was a bit of a shambles. I thought something like that would happen to me, so no point getting stressed about it.” The good news is that Carter now has an emergency passport and will make the trip., 11:B - Isak will really want to stay now., 12:B - The WNBA says spectators who throw objects on to the court will face at least a one-year ban and prosecution from law enforcement., 13:C - For a few years in the early 1900s, the Charity Shield was contested by the winners of the Football League and Southern League. Brighton won the Southern League in 1910 and went on to win the Charity Shield. It remains the club’s only national honour., 14:B - The first leg, in Sweden, finished 0-0. The second leg, in Denmark, is on Tuesday night., 15:A - Law won the award in 1964. A few other Scots have come close: Jimmy Johnstone was third in 1967 and Kenny Dalglish was second in 1983.</p>
