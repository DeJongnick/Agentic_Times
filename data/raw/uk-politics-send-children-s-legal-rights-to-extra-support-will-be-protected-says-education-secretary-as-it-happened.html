In its write-up of what was said at the No 10 lobby briefing about the state visit, PA Media says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The French president and his wife Brigitte will be hosted by the king when they travel to the UK for a state visit on Tuesday.</p> <p>During his stay in Britain, Macron and Starmer will hold a Franco-British summit, where tackling migration is set to be a pressing issue.</p> <p>As well as small boats crossing the English Channel, defence, security and economic growth are among the top issues on the agenda for the meeting, No 10 indicated.</p> <p>Joint work with the French to tackle migration is “stronger than it has ever been”, Downing Street said, while suggesting further efforts to prevent small boats crossings will be on the agenda for the Franco-British summit.</p> <p>A <strong>No 10 spokesman</strong> added: “We very much look forward to welcoming President Macron for a historic state visit this week. That relationship is key to a number of issues, and we expect to make good progress on a wide range of priorities, including migration, growth, defence and security, which will deliver on the interests of both the British and the French public.”</p> <p>Macron’s visit comes after the tally for small boats crossings pushed past 20,000 this year, the earliest point this has happened in a calendar year since data started being recorded in 2018. The total for 2025 currently sits at 21,117, according to PA news agency analysis of Home Office data.</p> <p>Downing Street declined to say whether the French police’s use of a knife to puncture an inflatable boat last week was a sign of new tactics being employed. The Sun On Sunday has meanwhile reported that French police have been laying nets in the water that could jam boat propellers, in an attempt to reduce the number of crossings.</p> <p>But the No 10 spokesman appeared to suggest a new approach had been discussed but not yet rolled out.</p> <p>He said: “We are the first government to have secured agreement from the French to review their maritime tactics so their border enforcement teams can intervene in shallow waters. This is operationally and legally complex, but we’re working closely with the French. We expect this to be operationalised soon.”</p> </blockquote>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-07T13:17:50.205Z">at 2.17pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-686bbe7e8f0833eb8521006d" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-07T12:51:02.689Z">1.51pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">No 10 says it's 'totally inaccurate' to say families or schools might lose funding from planned changes to Send provision</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Downing Street has said it would be “totally inaccurate” to say families or schools might lose funding as a result of its proposals to overhaul support for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send).</p> <p>At the lobby briefing, asked about the campaign that has been launched to stop the goverment restricting education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which give Send pupils a legal right to extra support (see<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/07/children-ehcps-support-cuts-special-educational-needs-reform-nigel-farage-keir-starmer-20th-anniversary-july-7-attacks-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-686b70138f089731c616d580#block-686b70138f089731c616d580"> 9.34am</a>), a <strong>No 10 spokesperson</strong> said that, while the government was committed to reform, it has not drawn up firm plans yet.

Those rights are enforced by the official Send tribunal, and embodied in education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which set out children’s needs and the provision they entail in a legally binding document. Contrary to what you read in <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/comment/article/your-council-may-well-go-bust-next-year-if-it-cant-escape-the-grip-of-the-frightful-four-ztrvjq8m2">certain news outlets</a>, they are not any kind of “golden ticket”: parents and carers used to unreturned phone calls and long waits still frequently have to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/jan/07/councils-scapegoat-parents-disabled-vulnerable-children-support">fight their local councils</a> for the help their plans set out. But – and as a special needs parent, I speak from experience – they usually allow stressed-out families to just about sleep at night.</p> <p>For about 40 years, such rights <a href="https://www.ipsea.org.uk/blog/defending-send-law-why-rolling-back-children-and-young-peoples-rights-would-ignore-40-years-of-legal">have been a cornerstone</a> of the Send system. But their future is now uncertain: councils, in particular, are frantically <a href="https://www.lawgazette.co.uk/commentary-and-opinion/council-bodies-want-shot-of-send-legal-duties/5120461.article">lobbying ministers</a> to get parents and their pesky rights out of the way. Late last year, a government source <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9e4fab16-aabb-4ca5-9f2f-099da057be26">quoted in the Financial Times</a> held out the prospect of “thousands fewer pupils” having access to rights-based provision. Despite the fact that EHCPs are most sorely needed in mainstream schools, a senior adviser to the Department for Education recently said that a consideration of whether EHCPs should no longer apply to children in exactly those settings is “<a href="https://schoolsweek.co.uk/ehcp-shake-up-considered-as-part-of-send-reforms-adviser-confirms/">the conversation we’re in the middle of</a>”. There are whispers about families who currently have EHCPs being allowed to keep them, while in the future, kids with similar needs would be waved away, something that threatens a stereotypical two-tier model, another element with worrying echoes of the benefits disaster.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686b878e8f08aadc85acfbf6" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-07T08:40:20.993Z">9.40am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Consumer confidence rising, survey suggests</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The majority of UK households are feeling financially secure, with 70% of people confident enough to plan a summer holiday, according to a survey.

Less than a week after the government had to abandon the main pillar of its welfare reform plans 90 minutes before a vote it was otherwise likely to lose, the government is now facing another revolt over plans to scale back support available to disabled people. But this row affects children, not adults – specifically pupils with special educational needs who have education, health and care plans (EHCPs) that guarantee them extra help in schools.</p> <p>As <strong>Richard Adams </strong>and<strong> Kiran Stacey</strong> report, although the plans have not been announced yet, campaigners are alarmed by reports that access to EHCPs is set to be restricted.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jul/06/government-faces-battle-over-send-overhaul-as-campaigners-voice-fears">Government faces battle over Send overhaul as campaigners voice fears</a> </p> </aside>    <p>The Times has splashed<a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/education/article/labour-revolt-special-needs-support-rs5bvj72v"> on the same issue.</a></p>    <p>The Times quotes an unnamed senior Labour MP saying: “If they thought taking money away from disabled adults was bad, watch what happens when they try the same with disabled kids.”</p> <p><strong>Stephen Morgan</strong>, the early education minister, was giving interviews this morning.

Instead he replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We absolutely want to make sure that we deliver better support for vulnerable children and their parents and we’re committed to absolutely getting that right. So it’s a real priority for us.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to him that he was not saying yes, he replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Well of course we want to make sure that every child gets the support that they need.
