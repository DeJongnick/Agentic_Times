<p>After deploying the national guard to the streets of the American capital, Donald Trump is now eyeing longer-term powers over authorities, saying on Wednesday that he is seeking to extend his temporary powers over Washington DC’s police department.</p> <p>Trump earlier this week invoked a never-before-used clause of the law that sets out the federal district’s governance structure to take temporary control of the police department, but will need Congress’s permission to extend it beyond the 30 days allowed under the statute.</p> <p>“We’re going to need a crime bill that we’re going to be putting in, and it’s going to pertain initially to DC,” Trump said. He alluded to other options for extending control of the police department, saying “if it’s a national emergency, we can do it without Congress”.</p> <p>Here are the key stories at a glance:</p>  <h2>Trump suggests other Democratic-led cities follow suit on crime legislation</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> said on Wednesday he would ask Congress for “long-term” control of Washington DC’s police department and signaled he expected other Democratic-led cities to change their laws in response to his deployment of national guard troops and federal agents into the capital.</p> <p>The president’s comments came as the White House took credit for dozens of arrests overnight in Washington as part of Trump’s campaign to fight a “crime crisis”, which its leaders say does not exist.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/mayor-dc-trump-national-guard"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump: Putin to face ‘severe consequences’ if he doesn’t agree ceasefire</h2>  <p>Vladimir Putin will face “very severe consequences” if he does not agree a ceasefire in the war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> at his summit with Donald Trump in Alaska, the US president said on Wednesday.</p> <p>Speaking after a call with Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders, including Britain’s Keir Starmer, Trump also suggested he would push for a second summit if his meeting with Putin goes well – this time including his Ukrainian counterpart.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/13/trump-assurances-europe-putin-ukraine-alaska-talks"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump says he will host Kennedy Center awards</h2>  <p>Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that he will host the Kennedy Center honors this year and said he had been heavily involved in choosing who to nominate, rejecting people he thought were too liberal.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/trump-kennedy-center-honors"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump official led thinktank that promoted lies about Tren de Aragua</h2>  <p>A senior official appointed to the defense department led a thinktank that promoted fake news about the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, according to <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/trump-official-headed-organization-that-spread-fake-news-about-tren-de-aragua/">InSight Crime</a>, a non-profit analyzing organized crime.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/joseph-humire-thinktank-tren-de-aragua"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Health professionals call for RFK Jr to be removed</h2>  <p>A grassroots organization of health professionals has released a report outlining major health challenges in the US and calling for the removal of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a> from the US Department of Health and Human Services.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/defend-public-health-robert-f-kennedy-jr-hhs"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump revokes signature Biden order promoting economic competition</h2>  <p> Donald Trump on Wednesday revoked a 2021 executive order on promoting competition in the US economy issued by Joe Biden, the White House said.</p> <p>Biden signed a sweeping executive order in July 2021 to promote more competition in the US economy as part of a broad push to rein in what his administration described as a pattern of corporate abuses, ranging from excessive airline fees to large mergers that raised costs for consumers.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/trump-revokes-biden-order-economy"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>What else happened today:</h2>  <ul> <li><p><strong>A US judge ordered the Trump administration to restore a part of the federal grant</strong> funding that it recently<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/trump-ucla-frozen-funds"> suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Veteran climate scientists are organizing a coordinated public comment</strong> to a US Department of Energy report which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/climate-science-trump-administration">cast doubt on the scientific consensus on the climate crisis</a>.</p></li> </ul>  <p>Catching up?<em> Here’s what happened on <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/13/trump-administration-news-updates-latest">12 August 2025</a></strong>.</em></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="alt">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
