<p>The government is about to cut student debt by 20% across the board – so how much debt do young Australians have, and how much has it changed?</p> 
<p>Labor’s student debt relief bill is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/22/hecs-debt-bill-legislation-labor-coalition-support">likely to pass with bipartisan support</a> and will slash the Hecs/Help debt for about 3 million graduates <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/21/hecs-help-reduce-student-debt-labor-bill-explainer">by an average of $5,500</a>, according to the government.</p> 
<p>Data from the tax office shows that the average Hecs/Help debt held by younger Australians increased by a third between 2009 and 2024, even with inflation taken into account. This coincides with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/apr/26/its-perverse-how-australias-student-loan-scheme-traps-graduates-in-a-debt-spiral">consistent increase</a> in the time it will take to pay off the debt – now almost a decade.</p> 
<p>Some economists say Labor’s 20% cut <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/22/labors-hecs-reduction-bill-not-the-fairest-way-to-relieve-student-debt-economists-say">isn’t the fairest way</a> to relieve student debt, while higher education expert Prof Andrew Norton says “more graduates will be caught on a <a href="https://theconversation.com/labors-new-bill-would-cut-help-loans-by-20-but-it-also-risks-locking-some-graduates-into-a-debt-treadmill-261472">debt treadmill</a>, repaying less than the annual indexation on their Help balance”.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, ACT senator David Pocock fronted the media alongside five other independent MPs and a string of peak bodies calling for structural reform to higher education – including student tertiary fees.</p> 
<p>Under the Coalition’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/19/australia-hecs-fee-help-scheme-50000-arts-degree">Job-Ready Graduates package (JRG)</a>, introduced in 2021, the student contribution for degrees including arts, law and business drastically increased, with students now accruing debts of <a href="https://www.studyassist.gov.au/financial-and-study-support/commonwealth-supported-places/student-contribution-amounts">about $17,000</a> per year of study.</p> 
<p>The federal government has deferred reforming the widely panned scheme to an independent tertiary commission, established this year in its interim phase.</p> 
<p>“Labor want another review into something that we knew was broken when it was introduced,” Pocock said on Wednesday. “Where is the courage from this government to embrace hard reform?”</p> 
<p>The independent member for Kooyong, Dr Monique Ryan, will this week table an amendment to the student debt bill to reverse the JRG package and change the timing of Hecs/Help indexation until after prepayments are made.</p> 
<p>(Student debts are indexed every year before the ATO takes into account the payments made on them, meaning the interest doesn’t take into account the repayments.)</p> 
<p>“If the government truly values education, it must find the capacity to fund it properly,” she said.</p> 
<p>The National Union of Students is on her side. Its president, Ashlyn Horton, said cutting debt was a “long overdue move” that indicated Canberra “might finally be listening” to concern about the rising cost of degrees.</p> 
<p>But she said it “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/21/hecs-help-reduce-student-debt-labor-bill-explainer">doesn’t come close</a> to fixing the structural mess that got us here”. In the meantime, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/19/australia-hecs-fee-help-scheme-50000-arts-degree">$50,000 arts degree is here</a>, and dying with your debt is a real possibility.</p>
