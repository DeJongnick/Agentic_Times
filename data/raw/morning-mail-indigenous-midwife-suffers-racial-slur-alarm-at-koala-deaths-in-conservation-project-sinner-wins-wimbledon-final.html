<p>Good morning. We lead today with revelations an Indigenous midwife was referred to by a racist slur on a staff whiteboard at one of Sydney’s largest public hospitals – contributing to her quitting in frustration.</p> <p>Meanwhile, there are calls for answers after a failed project aiming to re-establish a koala population in an area of south-eastern New South Wales resulted in more than half of the koalas involved dying.</p> <p>In international news, a former Israeli PM says plans for a “humanitarian city” in southern Gaza would amount to a concentration camp for Palestinians.
