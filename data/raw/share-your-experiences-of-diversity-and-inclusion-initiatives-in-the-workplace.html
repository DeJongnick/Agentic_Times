Nigel Farage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/03/unison-chief-tells-staff-at-reform-controlled-councils-to-sign-up-to-union">said during a speech on Friday</a> that he would advise staff working on diversity or climate change initiatives to seek “alternative careers very, very quickly” after the party took control of Durham county council.</p> <p>What has your experience of these policies been in the workplace?

Have you seen an increase in opportunities?</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="092244ae-8f0c-4754-9dbd-fdaaeef1014b" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>
