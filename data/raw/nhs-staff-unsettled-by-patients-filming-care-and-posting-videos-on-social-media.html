<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">NHS</a> staff have voiced concern about the growing numbers of patients who are filming themselves undergoing medical treatment and uploading it to TikTok and Instagram.</p> <p>Radiographers, who take X-rays and scans, fear the trend could compromise the privacy of other patients being treated nearby and lead to staff having their work discussed online.</p> <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) has gone public with its unease after a spate of incidents in which patients, or someone with them in the hospital, began filming their care.</p> <p>On one occasion a radiology department assistant from the south coast was inserting a cannula into a patient who had cancer when their 19-year-old daughter began filming.</p> <p>“She wanted to record the cannulation because she thought it would be entertaining on social media. But she didn’t ask permission,” the staff member said.</p> <p>“I spent the weekend afterwards worrying: did I do my job properly? I know I did, but no one’s perfect all the time and this was recorded. I don’t think I slept for the whole weekend.”</p> <p>They were also concerned that a patient in the next bay was giving consent for a colonoscopy – an invasive diagnostic test – at the same time as the daughter was filming her mother close by. “That could all have been recorded on the film, including names and dates of birth,” they said.</p> <p>Ashley d’Aquino, a therapeutic radiographer in London, said a colleague had agreed to take photographs for a patient, “but when the patient handed over her phone the member of staff saw that the patient had also been covertly recording her, to publish on her cancer blog.</p> <p>“As NHS staff we wear name badges, so our names will be visible in any video. It makes people feel very uncomfortable and anxious.”</p> <p>Dean Rogers, the SoR’s director of industrial strategy and member relations, urged all NHS trusts and boards to ensure that patients know they need permission from staff before filming.</p> <p>“As healthcare professionals we need to think: does that recording breach the confidentiality of other patients? Does it breach our ability to deliver care?”</p> <p>Dr Katharine Halliday, the president of the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “In my experience, rules about filming and recording are there to protect the privacy and dignity of patients and staff and should be followed accordingly.</p> <p>“In a clinical environment, you will be surrounded by patients in their most vulnerable moments, staff focusing on life-saving work and sensitive personal information. It’s important to be mindful of this and always seek permission for photography, filming or recording – even if it’s just for your own personal use.”</p> <p>Prof Meghana Pandit, NHS England’s co-national medical director (secondary care), said: “We want to do everything possible to support patients’ understanding of their diagnosis and treatment – but it’s vital that, if patients wish to record any part of their NHS care, they discuss this with their healthcare professional first and it remains for personal use only.</p> <p>“Recording other patients inadvertently and without their permission risks breaching patient confidentiality – the information and treatment provided to other patients on NHS premises should never be recorded, let alone posted to social media.”</p>
