<p>Maya Angelou once said “a hero is any person really intent on making this a better place for all people” and when she said that, I can only assume she had Australian TikToker and micro-influencer Tennilles_deals in mind.</p> <p>Who exactly is Tennilles_deals? Firstly, she’s the Mother Teresa of Aussie supermarkets. Secondly, I don’t know anything about her personally because this savvy queen doesn’t market herself like your average influencer. She lets her work speak for itself.</p> <p>The work in question? Weekly uploads of POV-style videos where Tennille meticulously goes through major supermarkets to show you what’s on special that week. Her soothing voice and steady hand shepherds you through a sea of yellow price tags. It’s detailed work, considerate and necessary.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Tennilles_deals on TikTok.">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@tennilles_deals/video/7535391242520251666&quot; data-video-id=&quot;7535391242520251666&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@tennilles_deals&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@tennilles_deals?refer=embed&quot;&gt;@tennilles_deals&lt;/a&gt; Coles half price items spotted in store this week - sale ends 12&amp;#47;8&amp;#47;25 &lt;a title=&quot;coles&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/coles?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#coles&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;supermarket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/supermarket?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#supermarket&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;grocery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/grocery?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#grocery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;savemoney&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/savemoney?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#savemoney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;♬ original sound - tennilles_deals&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7535391284983384833?refer=embed&quot;&gt;♬ original sound - tennilles_deals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>A deep shame I used to harbour is that I would wait by my phone every Monday at 5pm for the Coles and Woolworths catalogues to drop. Wednesday was even more special – that’s Aldi catalogue day, and nothing can rival the feeling of a niche European snack or a new power-cleaning tool with a 75% discount.</p> <p>For me, looking through a supermarket catalogue produces a frisson I’ve only ever experienced while scouring the Royal Easter Show showbag booklet as a child of the early 2000s. The excitement I would feel running my finger over each lolly listed in the $15 (slightly offensively named) Mega Sumo Bag. The burden picking between Wonka or Wizz Fizz because I knew my mum wouldn’t let me get both. A supermarket catalogue offers the same thrill: an anticipation of what could soon be yours.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/aug/18/ai-has-created-a-new-breed-of-cat-video-addictive-disturbing-and-nauseatingly-quick-soap-operas">AI has created a new breed of cat video: addictive, disturbing and nauseatingly quick soap operas</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the days of flipping through paper catalogues are well and truly over. That’s why Tennilles_deals is so important, giving us tight, three-minute videos that provide us with a 360-degree view of each product: a walking, talking catalogue. We’re in the combat zone of the Woolies and Coles duopoly with her and she is protecting us, guiding us through each aisle. She is our mum. We are her children.</p> <p>And I’m not alone in the admiration I have for this woman. There’s a reason Tennilles_deals has amassed almost 100,000 followers. She offers the people something the mega-chain supermarkets could never: a personable touch; a space where cash-strapped Aussies can vent about price-gouging.</p>      <p>One of her videos about the price of extra virgin olive oil starts a debate in the comments. Kerry from Tamworth says she remembers when it was only $7; we love-react Kerry’s comment in solidarity. She is not alone. We are not alone. Barry from Wagga Wagga voices outrage on the Cadbury chocolate block deal. We agree that two for $10 is ridiculous and we remember the simpler $3 block days. Barry then says something out of the blue about his hot cousin, but we ignore it because we agreed about the chocolate thing and we don’t need to go any further.</p> <p>The effect of cozzie livs gives the average Australian fear when entering a supermarket. Gone are the days when I would enter a store without a list and a finite plan of what to purchase. Having the opportunity to see that I can get five Chobani pots for $10 soothes me. As do the gently encouraging words of Carol from Broken Hill: “Do not pass up that Chobani deal.” It means I can enter a Woolies free from the anxiety that I’ll go over budget in pursuit of protecting my gut microbiome.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Tennilles_deals on TikTok.">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@tennilles_deals/video/7530198812929887495&quot; data-video-id=&quot;7530198812929887495&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@tennilles_deals&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@tennilles_deals?refer=embed&quot;&gt;@tennilles_deals&lt;/a&gt; Woolworths half price items spotted in store this week - sale ends 29&amp;#47;7&amp;#47;25 &lt;a title=&quot;woolworths&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/woolworths?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#woolworths&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;woolies&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/woolies?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#woolies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;supermarket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/supermarket?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#supermarket&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;grocery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/grocery?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#grocery&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;savemoney&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/savemoney?refer=embed&quot;&gt;#savemoney&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;♬ original sound - tennilles_deals&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7530198947207351057?refer=embed&quot;&gt;♬ original sound - tennilles_deals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>What Tennilles_deals is doing is building community. “Australian of the year,” one TikToker comments under her “Woolworths half price items spotted in store this week 29/7/25” post – and I couldn’t reply with three fire emojis more quickly if I tried.</p> <p>Unfortunately, nominations for 2026 Australian of the year are closed, so my only way to show my respect is via this very public essay. Keep doing the lord’s work, Tennille. The people love you and the people need you. You’re the real deal.</p>
