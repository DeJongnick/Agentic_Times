<p>The Late Show with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> won its first-ever <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/emmys">Emmy</a> on Sunday, less than two months after news of its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/07/cbs-stephen-colbert-late-show-george-cheeks">cancellation</a> elicited a gleeful reaction from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>.</p> <p>Colbert’s program won at Sunday’s Creative Arts Emmys in the category of outstanding directing for a variety series for an episode featuring actors David Oyelowo, Finn Wolfhard and Alan Cumming as well as a musical performance by the rock band OK Go.</p> <p>Though Colbert himself had previously won 10 Emmy awards, it marked the first time the Late Show had brought home one of the prestigious statuettes during his tenure, which began in 2015 and is slated to end in May 2026 after CBS <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/democrats-cbs-colbert-show">controversially</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/stephen-colbert-late-show-celebrities-react">decided</a> in July to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/18/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-to-end-in-2026-as-cbs-cancels-show">cancel it</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/07/cbs-stephen-colbert-late-show-george-cheeks">‘The economics made it a challenge’: CBS boss talks Stephen Colbert cancellation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>CBS moved to cancel Colbert’s show as the network’s parent company, Paramount, still awaited the federal government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/paramount-skydance-merger-fcc">approval</a> of an $8.4bn merger with the Skydance media conglomerate. Furthermore, at the time, Colbert had just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jul/15/late-night-roundup-colbert-stewart-meyers-trump-paramount-epstein">criticized</a> CBS for paying $16m to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/02/paramount-settles-with-trump-for-16m-over-60-minutes-interview-with-kamala-harris">settle</a> a lawsuit filed by Trump over the president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/01/trump-cbs-harris-interview-lawsuit">claims</a> that the network edited footage of an interview with Kamala Harris to make her look better in her unsuccessful White House run in 2024.</p> <p>Legal experts widely believed CBS could defeat Trump’s claims of defamation in court, and on his show, Colbert dismissed the settlement as “a big fat bribe”.</p> <p>Colbert announced three days later that he had been informed of his show’s cancellation. Trump – who had frequently been the butt of jokes on the Late Show – relished the news, posting on his Truth Social platform: “I absolutely love that Colbert was fired.”</p> <p>The Late Show host replied that it had always been a dream of his for a sitting president to celebrate the end of his career and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/22/stephen-colbert-trump-cbs-bribe">told</a> Trump on air: “Go fuck yourself.”</p> <p>Regulators at the Trump administration-controlled Federal Communications Commission later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/paramount-skydance-merger-fcc">approved</a> Paramount’s sale to Skydance.</p> <p>CBS’s chair of television media, George Cheeks, in August tried to separate the cancellation of Colbert’s show from the politics of Trump’s second presidency. Instead, he blamed financial headwinds confronting the late-night talkshow format. <br></p> <p>“The challenge in late-night is that the advertising marketplace is in significant secular decline,” Cheeks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/07/cbs-stephen-colbert-late-show-george-cheeks">said</a> at a news conference after Skydance’s takeover of Paramount. “We are huge fans of Colbert – we love the show.</p> <p>“Unfortunately, the economics made it a challenge for us to keep going.”</p> <p>The US entertainment news outlet <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/awards/late-show-stephen-colbert-wins-emmy-first-cancelation-1236509589/">Variety</a> noted that many television industry insiders saw the Late Show’s Emmy win on Sunday as a reaction to public consternation generated by its cancellation at the hands of Paramount.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jul/19/paramount-cbs-trump">Cancelling Colbert, bribery, an $8bn deal: what’s going on at Paramount?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Colbert’s Late Show had amassed more than 30 Emmy nominations before Sunday’s victory by director Jim Hoskinson. Only AMC’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/better-call-saul">Better Call Saul</a> had more Emmy nominations without a win, having <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2024/jan/16/that-show-deserved-to-be-encased-in-gold-the-biggest-shocks-from-the-emmy-awards">memorably lost</a> on all of more than 50 nominations it had amassed during its run of six seasons, according to Variety.</p> <p>The Late Show was also nominated in the category of talk series in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/15/emmy-nominations-2025-list">main Emmy ceremony</a> scheduled for 14 September.</p> <p>Emmy awards individually won by the outgoing Late Show host stem from his run on Comedy Central’s The Colbert Report.
