  <ul> 
   <li><p>Pope Leo XIV’s formal inauguration Mass to mark his appointment will take place in St. Peter’s Square on Sunday 18 May, the Vatican said in a statement on Friday. The new pope, elected on Thursday, will hold his first general audience on 21 May.</p></li>

   <li><p>After years of sympathetic and inclusive comments from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis">Pope Francis</a>, LGBTQ+ Catholics expressed concern on Thursday about hostile remarks made more than a decade ago by Father Robert Prevost, the new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-leo-xiv">Pope Leo XIV</a>, in which he condemned what he called the “homosexual lifestyle” and <em>“</em>the redefinition of marriage” as “at odds with the Gospel”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>In the UK, a spokesperson for King Charles has said that the king, who is head of the Church of England which broke with Rome in the 1530s, sent a private message of congratulations to newly elected Pope Leo XIV.</p></li> 
   <li><p>China has sent congratulations to newly elected Pope Leo XIV and hopes the Vatican under the new pontiff will continue dialogue with China “in a constructive spirit”, Reuters reports a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said on Friday at a regular press conference.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/white-smoke-signals-election-of-new-roman-catholic-pope">election of Pope Leo XIV</a> has been celebrated across Latin America, where many hailed him as the second pontiff from the region, after his Argentinian predecessor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis">Francis</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/08/what-will-the-new-pope-be-like-hes-chosen-to-be-called-leo-thats-no-accident">choice of the name Leo</a> was a “clear and deliberate” reference to the last pope named Leo. Leo XIII was elected in 1878 and was best known for his 1891 encyclical, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html">Rerum Novarum</a>, which outlined workers’ rights.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Many shared their excitement at having an American pope, and specifically a pope born in Chicago. City mayor Brandon Johnson tweeted “Everything dope, including the pope, comes from Chicago” and former US president Barack Obama congratulated the “fellow Chicagoan” on social media.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Pope Leo has confirmed all top Vatican officials in their current roles on a temporary basis, giving him time to decide before making definitive appointments, the Vatican said in a statement on Friday.</strong></p> 
  <p>All Vatican senior officials, appointed for five-year terms, serve at the pleasure of the pope. A new pontiff usually rolls over existing mandates, at least initially, before deciding whether to change key positions.</p>

  <p><strong>Very few people seem to know exactly where Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost – now known as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-leo-xiv">Pope Leo XIV</a> – stands on the big issues of the day, despite the recent flurry of profiles and the raking over of old pronouncements. But one person who has a better idea than most is the new pontiff’s elder brother, John Prevost.</strong></p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/08/world/pope-conclave-news#pope-leo-xiv-brother-john-prevost">a recent interview with the New York Times</a>, the 71-year-old retired teacher noted his brother’s emotional and ideological proximity to his friend, Pope Francis, and said he shared his predecessor’s concerns about the US’s immigration policy.</p> 
  <p>Provost described his brother as middle of the road, adding: “I don’t think we’ll see extremes either way.” He also said the new pope would not hesitate to speak out against injustices. “I don’t think he’ll stay quiet for too long if he has something to say.</p> 
  <p>“I know he’s not happy with what’s going on with immigration. I know that for a fact. How far he’ll go with it is only one’s guess, but he won’t just sit back. I don’t think he’ll be the silent one.”</p> 
  <p>Francis made no secret of his opposition to Donald Trump’s border and mass deportations plans, and also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/21/jd-vance-among-last-visitors-to-pope-francis-after-series-of-public-fallouts">took issue with JD Vance’s interpretation of the church’s teaching</a> on our responsibilities to others.</p>

  <p><strong>Pope Leo XIV said he hoped to lead a Roman Catholic church “that illuminates the dark nights of this world” as he held his first mass as pontiff under Michelangelo’s ceiling frescoes in the Sistine Chapel.</strong></p> 
  <p>The surprise election of cardinal Robert Prevost, the first ever US pope, came after a conclave that lasted less than 26 hours, one of the shortest in modern Catholic history.</p> 
  <p>Leo began his homily on Friday during the mass with cardinals in English, before switching to Italian. In the English passage he echoed words from the psalms, saying “I will sing a new song to the Lord, because he has done marvels”.</p> 
  <p>“Not just with me,” he continued. “But with all of us, my brother cardinals, as we celebrate this morning, I invite you to recognise the marvels that the Lord has done, the blessings that the Lord continues to pour out upon all of us.”</p> 
  <p>Switching to Italian, he said he hoped the church could “illuminate the dark nights of this world”. He said he would be a “faithful administrator” of the church, and that it should be judged by the holiness of its members and not “the grandeur of her buildings”.</p> 
  <p>In a later passage referring to evangelisation, Leo said there were many settings in which the Christian faith was considered “absurd, meant for the weak and unintelligent. Settings where other securities are preferred, like technology, money, success, power, or pleasure.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Leo XIV delivers first homily since his election as pope</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Pope Leo XIV has delivered his first homily as pope. During a mass attended by cardinals in the Sistine Chapel he lamented that people value “technology, money, success, power or pleasure” over Christianity</strong></p> 
  <p>The pope expressed concern at the plight of Christian believers, who he said in many places were “mocked, opposed, despised or at best tolerated and pitied.”</p> 
  <p>He said he hoped that the Catholic church can bring light to “dark nights of this world”, saying that it should be judged by the holiness of its members, and not by the grandeur of its buildings.</p> 
  <p>Speaking in Italian, he warned that those who treat the figure of Jesus as if he was some sort of charismatic leader or superman, even if they are baptised into the church, are leading a life of “de facto atheism.”</p> 
  <p>69-year-old Robert Francis Prevost was chosen yesterday as the new leader of the world’s 1.4 billion Roman Catholics, and is the first North American to be elected to the role.</p> 
  <p>He has spent considerable time in Peru, and is multilingual. That was reflected during the service, where he addressed cardinals in both English and Italian, and Bible readings were made in English and in Spanish.</p> 
  <p>Leo XIV was applauded by cardinals as he left the Sistine Chapel. He is expected to lunch with them later on, after which they will be free to return home, having gathered at the Vatican for the funeral of Pope Francis and the conclave to elect his successor.</p>

  <p>As the mass proceeds, with a reading from <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021%3A9-21&amp;version=NIV">the Book of Revelations 21:9-14</a>, our columnist Arwa Mahdawi has turned her attention to the papacy, asking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/09/pope-leo-xiv-moral-leadership">if Leo XIV will be “the moral leader we desperately need”</a>?</p> 
  <p>She writes:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I am not an American Catholic. Nor am I Protestant, Episcopalian, Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist or anything else. I am an atheist, although not a terribly devout one. But I am certainly praying as hard as I can that Pope Leo will be the moral leader that the world so desperately needs at this moment.</p> 
   <p>During a time when international law has been dealt a deadly blow, when might is right and decades of progress seem to be unravelling, the late Pope Francis made an impression on non-Catholics like me for his moral clarity towards many marginalized groups and his advocacy for peace everywhere.</p> 
   <p>We do not yet know how Pope Leo will undertake his duties but he is widely considered a centrist who was aligned with Francis on a number of social issues. Whether Pope Leo will remain outspoken, whether he will continue Francis’s demands for a ceasefire in Gaza, remains to be seen. But the world desperately needs strong moral leadership at the moment. May Leo be the light we need in the current darkness.</p>

  <p>Early statements from a new pope are viewed as setting the tone for how they intend to govern the Catholic church, and the issues that they will press forward on. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/19/pope-francis-first-mass-vatican">A few days after he was elected pope in 2013</a>, <strong>Pope Francis</strong> delivered a message about defending the weak, the poor and the environment. </p> 
  <p>At that time, Pope Francis said his role was to open his arms and protect all of humanity: “Especially the poorest, the weakest, the least important, those whom Matthew lists in the final judgment on love: the hungry, the thirsty, the stranger, the naked, the sick and those in prison.</p> 
  <p>“Today amid so much darkness we need to see the light of hope and to be men and women who bring hope to others,” Pope Francis said in 2013. “To protect creation, to protect every man and every woman, to look upon them with tenderness and love, is to open up a horizon of hope, it is to let a shaft of light break through the heavy clouds.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Unearthed comments from new pope alarm LGBTQ+ Catholics</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>After years of sympathetic and inclusive comments from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis">Pope Francis</a>, LGBTQ+ Catholics expressed concern on Thursday about hostile remarks made more than a decade ago by Father Robert Prevost, the new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-leo-xiv">Pope Leo XIV</a>, in which he condemned what he called the “homosexual lifestyle” and </strong><em><strong>“</strong></em><strong>the redefinition of marriage” as “at odds with the Gospel”.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a 2012 address to the world synod of bishops, the man who now leads the church said that “Western mass media is extraordinarily effective in fostering within the general public enormous sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the Gospel – for example abortion, homosexual lifestyle, euthanasia”.</p> 
  <p>In the remarks the cleric blamed mass media for fostering so much “sympathy for anti-Christian lifestyles choices” that “when people hear the Christian message it often inevitably seems ideological and emotionally cruel”.</p> 
  <p>“Catholic pastors who preach against the legalization of abortion or the redefinition of marriage are portrayed as being ideologically driven, severe and uncaring,” Prevost added.</p> 
  <p>He went on to complain that “alternative families comprised of same-sex partners and their adopted children are so benignly and sympathetically portrayed in television programs and cinema today”.</p> 
  <p>The video illustrated his criticism of the “homosexual lifestyle” and “same-sex partners and their adopted children” with clips from two US sitcoms featuring same-sex couples, The New Normal and Modern Family.</p>

  <p>US media has reacted to the news that there is to be an American pope for the first time. The <strong>New York Times</strong> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/08/world/pope-conclave-news">said</a> the decision defied “a longstanding belief that church leaders would never select a pope from a global superpower that already has considerable influence in world affairs.”</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Washington Post</strong> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/05/08/pope-prevost-us-reaction/">spoke</a> to Rev Gregory Sakowicz, the rector at Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago.

  <p>“It’s a great day for Chicago, the country and the world,” Sakowicz said, adding that upon hearing the news his congregation “erupted” and acted like “the Chicago Bears won the Super Bowl.”</p>

  <p>Pope Francis “clearly had his eye on Prevost” as his successor, the Associated Press writes. Here’s a bit more analysis from the agency on how and why Pope Leo may have been selected from among his peers: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Prevost had been a leading candidate for the papacy since Francis tapped him to be head of the Vatican’s powerful Dicastery for Bishops, which vets bishop nominations around the world. </p> 
   <p>There had long been a taboo on a US pope, given America’s superpower status in the secular world, but Prevost prevailed, perhaps because he’s also a Peruvian citizen and had lived for years in Peru, first as a missionary and then as bishop.<br><br>Francis, the first Latin American pope, clearly had his eye on Prevost and in many ways saw him as his heir apparent. He sent Prevost to take over a complicated diocese in Peru in 2014, then brought him to the Vatican in 2023. </p> 
   <p>Earlier this year, Francis elevated Prevost into the senior ranks of cardinals, giving him prominence going into the conclave that few other cardinals had.<br><br>Since arriving in Rome, Prevost had kept a low public profile but was well-known to the men who count. </p> 
   <p>Significantly, he presided over one of the most revolutionary reforms Francis made, when he added three women to the voting bloc that decides which bishop nominations to forward to the pope.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/white-smoke-signals-election-of-new-roman-catholic-pope">election of Pope Leo XIV</a> has been celebrated across Latin America, where many hailed him as the second pontiff from the region, after his Argentinian predecessor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/pope-francis">Francis</a>.</p> 
  <p>The news prompted particular elation in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/peru">Peru</a>, where he lived and worked for more than 20 years and was granted citizenship in 2015. In the capital, Lima, the bells of the cathedral rang in celebration.<br><br>In his first appearance from the Vatican balcony, Leo XIV briefly switched from Italian to Spanish to address the faithful “from my beloved diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru”, where he served as bishop for more than a decade.</p> 
  <p>Peru’s president, Dina Boluarte, <a href="https://x.com/presidenciaperu/status/1920563009706954856">hailed the “historic” election</a> of Leo XIV, whom she described as a Peruvian “by choice and conviction” who had devoted more than 20 years of service to the country. </p> 
  <p>Even so, Prevost has spoken out against Boluarte’s government in the past. In early 2023, he described his “sadness and pain” over the deaths of 49 protesters in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/08/peru-protests-president-election-what-is-happening-explainer">anti-government demonstrations</a> that erupted when President Boluarte took office in December 2022, replacing Pedro Castillo who was forced out for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/07/peru-parliament-dissolved-impeachment-vote-coup-fears">attempting to suspend congress</a>.</p> 
  <p>At the time Prevost said the unrest reflected the historic neglect of Peru’s poor, saying: “This conflict does not represent the best of the country.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Why choose the name Leo?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>What’s in a name? When it comes to a pope – everything. The white smoke from the Sistine Chapel earlier this evening told the world that a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/white-smoke-signals-election-of-new-roman-catholic-pope">new pope to succeed Francis</a> had been elected – and for the first time the pontiff is from the US.</p> 
  <p>But if Donald Trump and his Catholic convert Veep, JD Vance, are ready to cheer, then they should think again. Cardinal Robert Prevost has chosen the name Leo XIV – and if you’re a papal Leo, you tend to be a reformer at the progressive end of Catholicism. </p> 
  <p>That Prevost has decided to become Leo XIV will make Catholics think immediately of the last Leo – Leo XIII – and his 1891 encyclical or teaching document, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html">Rerum Novarum</a>, which outlined workers’ rights to a fair wage, safe working conditions and the rights of workers to belong to trade unions. </p> 
  <p>If Pope Francis was the People’s Pope, then Leo XIV is all set to be the Workers’ Pope.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Opening summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of Pope Leo XIV’s first full day in office, during which he is expected to hold his first mass as leader of the Catholic church.</p> 
  <p><strong>Robert Francis Prevost</strong>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/new-pope-cardinal-robert-prevost-leo-reaction">first US-born pope</a>, will celebrate a private mass with cardinals at the Sistine Chapel on Friday at 11am (0900 GMT), during which he will deliver his much anticipated first homily as pope. It will be broadcast live.</p> 
  <p>The 69-year-old, who has spent much of his life in Peru, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/08/white-smoke-signals-election-of-new-roman-catholic-pope">was elected by his fellow cardinals</a> on Thursday during a secret conclave after the death of his predecessor, Pope Francis.</p> 
  <p>With the choice of Prevost, experts say, the cardinals opted for continuity with the late Francis, a progressive from Argentina who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/21/pope-francis-outsider-whose-reforming-mission-made-him-an-ally-of-progressives">shook up the Church</a> in his 12-year papacy.</p> 
  <p>“He is a moderate consensus candidate who fits into a soft continuity, a gentle continuity with Pope Francis, who will not alienate conservatives,” said Francois Mabille, a researcher at the Paris-based think tank IRIS and author of a book on Vatican strategy.</p> 
  <p>Here’s what you should know about the new pope:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Vatican spokesperson Matteo Bruni said the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/may/08/what-will-the-new-pope-be-like-hes-chosen-to-be-called-leo-thats-no-accident">choice of the name Leo</a> was a “clear and deliberate” reference to the last pope named Leo</strong>. Leo XIII was elected in 1878 and was best known for his 1891 encyclical, <a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html">Rerum Novarum</a>, which outlined workers’ rights.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>In his first comments after his election</strong>, <strong>Pope Leo XIV preached a message of “unity” and of “moving forward”</strong>. He said he wants this message of peace to “enter your hearts, to reach your families and all people, wherever they are.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Many shared their excitement at having an American pope</strong>, and specifically a pope born in Chicago. City mayor <strong>Brandon Johnson</strong> tweeted “Everything dope, including the Pope, comes from Chicago” and former US president <strong>Barack Obama</strong> congratulated the “fellow Chicagoan” on social media.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The election of Prevost was also celebrated in Peru, where he has spent much of his life</strong>. Peru’s president, <strong>Dina Boluarte</strong> described him as a Peruvian “by choice and conviction”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>US president Donald Trump said he was “surprised”</strong> <strong>but that it is a “great honour” to have an American pope</strong>. Leaders from countries around the world also offered their congratulations.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>An account on X widely believed to belong to the new pope</strong> <strong>shows him to be somewhat critical of the Trump administration.</strong> The account posted two articles that took issue with the stance by <strong>JD Vance</strong>, also a Catholic, on immigration. One article was headlined “JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn’t ask us to rank our love for others.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Leo’s brother, John Prevost, told US media that Leo, was not afraid to speak his mind and that he was currently very unhappy with “what’s going on with immigration”</strong>. He told the New York Times: “I don’t think he’ll stay quiet for too long if he has something to say … I know he’s not happy with what’s going on with immigration. I know that for a fact.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>In a 2012 address to the world Synod of Bishops</strong>, <strong>the then</strong> <strong>Father Robert Francis Prevost appeared to criticise homosexuality</strong>. He said “Western mass media is extraordinarily effective in fostering within the general public enormous sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the Gospel – for example abortion, homosexual lifestyle, euthanasia”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Like his predecessor, Pope Francis, Leo is also on the record as opposing the ordination of women</strong>. He told a 2023 synod that “clericalizing women” would not solve problems in the Catholic Church and might create new ones, according to the <a href="https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/255823/cardinal-at-synod-on-synodality-clericalizing-women-will-not-solve-problems">Catholic news agency</a>.</p></li>
