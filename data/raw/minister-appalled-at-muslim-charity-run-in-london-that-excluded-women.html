<p>The communities secretary has said it was “absolutely unacceptable” for women to be excluded from taking part in a Muslim charity run in London.</p> <p>The event on Sunday, in Victoria Park, Tower Hamlets, was advertised on the Muslim Charity Run website as an “inclusive 5km race” for “runners and supporters of all ages and abilities” – open to “men, boys of all ages and girls under 12”.</p> <p>Speaking on LBC radio, the communities secretary, Steve Reed, said he was “appalled” and that the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) would determine whether any laws or regulations had been breached.</p> <p>He added: “I saw these reports … and I was as horrified as anybody else.</p> <p>“It’s absolutely unacceptable that women should be blocked from going on a fun run in a public space when the men are allowed to go out there and do that.</p> <p>“Now, we have an equalities watchdog, I’m sure that they will be aware of this case. It’s getting a lot of publicity, and quite rightly so, and they will determine whether there has been any breach of the law or regulations and then I’m sure sanctions will follow as appropriate. But speaking for myself, I was appalled.”</p> <p>He added: “We do not want a situation in this country where men are allowed to do things that women are then barred from. We cannot tolerate that.”</p> <p>East London mosque, which organised Sunday’s run in Victoria Park – the 12th annual event – alongside the London Muslim Centre, said hundreds of runners and supporters had gathered for the community event.</p> <p>The event is described on the mosque website as a “highlight in the east London Muslim calendar, raising thousands of pounds for vital causes across the UK and abroad, from local youth projects, food banks and refugee support to international humanitarian relief”.</p> <p>The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, is quoted on the website congratulating participants, saying: “Well done to each and every one of you, especially to the youngsters and the elders and the community at large for participating today.”</p> <p>The council said it had contacted the mosque to “seek urgent clarification” after “reports about age and gender restrictions”.</p> <p>The EHRC is understood to be looking into the matter after a report by the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the commission said: “The EHRC receives complaints each week about allegations of unlawful activity contrary to the Equality Act 2010. We consider each complaint carefully and take action where appropriate.”</p> <p>Certain exceptions under equality law can apply to charities and religion or belief organisations, including potentially restricting events to one sex only.</p> <p>A Tower Hamlets council spokesperson said: “This was an independent event held in Victoria Park, not organised by the council.</p> <p>“Like many local charitable events, it made use of the park space. Following the reports about age and gender restrictions, the council has contacted East London mosque to seek urgent clarification.</p> <p>“We are firmly committed to ensuring leisure and sporting activities in Tower Hamlets are inclusive and accessible.”</p> <p>The mosque said in a statement: “Our goal remains the same: to nurture faith, wellbeing, and social good for everyone in our community.</p> <p>“The Muslim Charity Run is one of many initiatives that promote health, wellbeing, and charitable giving across our community.</p> <p>“ELM encourages women to take part in sporting activities. There are many Muslim women from our community who have taken part in sporting events including boat races, cycling, hiking and marathons as well as various sporting challenges to raise funds for charity.</p> <p>“We remain committed to listening to the needs of our community and ensuring our programmes serve everyone.” </p>
