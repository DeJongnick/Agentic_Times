<p>Good morning.</p> <p>JD Vance sought to downplay the revelation that leaders of a group called the Young Republicans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/jd-vance-racist-messages-young-republicans-chat-leak">exchanged hundreds of racist and sexist text messages</a> – including one in which rape was called “epic”, and another in which someone wrote “I love Hitler” – as youthful indiscretions.</p> <p>Vance suggested that the participants in the leaked chats were much younger than they in fact were. Some of the participants were barely younger than the 41-year-old vice-president.</p> <p>“The reality is that kids do stupid things, especially young boys,” Vance said. “They tell edgy, offensive jokes. That’s what kids do. And I really don’t want us to grow up in a country where a kid telling a stupid joke – telling a very offensive, stupid joke – is cause to ruin their lives.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How old are the people who exchanged the messages?</strong> <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/10/republican-hitler-group-chat-nazi-politico/">Mother Jones reports</a> that public records indicate that eight of the 11 Republican operatives who took part in the offensive chat appear to range in age from 24 to 35.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Hamas says all reachable hostage bodies recovered </strong><strong>as Israel threatens to resume Gaza fighting</strong></h2>    <p>Israel has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/hamas-hostage-bodies-recovered-amid-israel-gaza-fighting-ceasefire-deal">threatened to resume fighting in Gaza</a> after Hamas announced it could not return any more bodies of Israeli hostages without specialist recovery equipment to retrieve the remains from the ruins of the devastated territory.</p> <p>The threat from Israel Katz, the defence minister, came after Hamas handed over the remains of two more hostages late last night, bringing the total returned to nine, along with a tenth body that Israel said was not that of a hostage.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What has the US said about the return of the dead hostages?</strong> Though well short of the 28 dead hostages expected by Israel, senior US advisers later said they believed Hamas was committed to finding and returning the others.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>San Francisco opposes ‘authoritarian crackdown’ as Trump threatens to send troops</strong></h2>    <p>Donald Trump suggested that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/san-francisco-trump-national-guard-troops">San Francisco could be the next city he targets with federal troops</a>, threatening a deployment that local and state officials have said would be unnecessary and unwelcome.</p> <p>Speaking at the White House to the FBI director, Kash Patel, the president said: “I’m going to be strongly recommending, at the request of government officials … that you start looking at San Francisco … one of our great cities 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and now it’s a mess … Every American deserves to live in a community where they’re not afraid of being mugged, murdered, robbed, raped, assaulted or shot.”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What have San Francisco leaders said?</strong> San Francisco and California leaders have said they oppose Trump’s intervention and have worked to convey that there was no crisis of crime and violence that required outside help or a militarized response. The state senator Scott Wiener said on Wednesday that the city “neither needs nor wants Trump’s personal army on our streets”.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In other news …</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>The US supreme court heard oral arguments yesterday in Callais v Louisiana</strong>, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/voting-rights-act-supreme-court-case">high-stakes voting rights case</a> in which the court’s conservative majority appears poised to gut one of the most powerful provisions of the Voting Rights Act.</p></li> <li><p><strong>South Korea has issued its most serious travel warning for parts of Cambodia, issuing a “code black” ban</strong> that orders citizens to leave areas in which the government has identified <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/south-korea-bans-travel-to-parts-of-cambodia-amid-deepening-scam-crisis-that-has-left-80-missing">increasing employment scams and detention cases targeting its nationals</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Britney Spears has responded to her </strong><strong>former husband Kevin Federline’s claims in his </strong><strong>forthcoming memoir about their marriage</strong>, calling his depiction of her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/oct/16/britney-spears-ex-husband-kevin-federline-memoir">“extremely hurtful and exhausting”</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Stat of the day: Nestlé to </strong><strong>cut 16,000 jobs as new chief targets sales growth</strong></h2>    <p>Nestlé said it planned to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/16/nestle-cut-jobs-new-chief-sales-growth">cut 16,000 jobs over the next two years</a> as the owner of KitKat and Nescafé attempted to reduce costs and increase sales.
