<p>Benjamin Netanyahu has again taken a significantly longer flight route than necessary, avoiding the airspace of several European countries, this time while en route to the UN in New York.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, who has an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/21/icc-issues-arrest-warrant-for-benjamin-netanyahu-israel">international criminal court arrest warrant against him</a> for alleged crimes including starvation as a method of warfare, made a trip that flight-tracking data <a href="https://uk.flightaware.com/live/flight/XA001">showed</a> followed the Mediterranean Sea, rather than a more direct route over the continent.</p> <p>The Wing of Zion, Israel’s equivalent of the US’s Air Force One, did cross territory over Greece and Italy but then turned south towards the strait of Gibraltar before heading across the Atlantic.</p> <p>The Israeli government did not give an official reason for the routing, although Israeli media reported it was to avoid overflying a country that would be obliged to arrest him.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/netanyahu_plane_route/giv-325546IaYhdI1CqF5/" data-alt="map"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/09/netanyahu_plane_route/giv-325546IaYhdI1CqF5/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Shorter, more fuel-efficient routes may have flown across France, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and the UK. Those countries have all signed the ICC statute and would be legally required to arrest and surrender Netanyahu to The Hague-based court if he entered their territory.</p> <p>While there is disagreement over whether a country’s military should enforce the rule by forcing a plane to land, the case would be much clearer if Netanyahu’s plane were to make an unscheduled or emergency landing.</p> <p>France had previously authorised Israeli use of its airspace for Thursday’s flight, the French news agency AFP reported, citing a French diplomatic source. However, the flight did not cross French territory, possibly changing plans en route.</p> <p>Relations between Israel and France have soured recently, with Paris heading an international diplomatic push to put pressure on Israel to end the bloodshed in Gaza, including by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/22/arab-and-muslim-leaders-to-meet-trump-to-discuss-peace-plan-for-gaza">recognising Palestine as a state</a> this week.</p> <p>Netanyahu bitterly opposes recognition, and his political career has focused on preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state.</p> <p>The Jerusalem Post reported two weeks ago that some journalists and members of Netanyahu’s entourage would not accompany him to compensate for the additional fuel required for the extended route.</p> <p>It is not the first time Netanyahu’s fight has taken a circuitous route. In July, the UN special rapporteur for the occupied territories, Francesca Albanese, <a href="https://x.com/FranceskAlbs/status/1942822110696554868">criticised</a> Italy, France, and Greece for providing “safe passage to ICC-wanted Benjamin Netanyahu” when he flew to the US.</p> <p>Three months earlier, the Times of Israel <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-flight-path-to-us-lengthened-due-to-concerns-over-icc-warrant-health/">cited</a> the Israeli ambassador to the US, Yechiel Leiter, as telling a pro-settlement organisation that Netanyahu’s flight to Washington DC in February had taken steps to avoid making an emergency landing in Europe.</p> <p>Fears of a medical emergency while in the air were heightened as Netanyahu had his prostate removed in late 2024. “He had just had surgery, he came with two doctors, and they told him he may have to land for treatment,” it quoted the ambassador as saying. “But if he were to land anywhere in Europe, he could be arrested as a war criminal.”</p> <p>The ambassador reportedly said Netanyahu’s flight deviated to fly in airspace close to US army bases, so he could land on those in an emergency.</p> <p>The Israeli leader is scheduled to address the UN general assembly on Friday and is due to meet the US president, Donald Trump, next week. Both Netanyahu and Trump reject the authority of the ICC.</p>
