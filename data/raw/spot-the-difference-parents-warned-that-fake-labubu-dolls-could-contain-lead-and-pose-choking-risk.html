<p>Does your Labubu have exactly nine teeth? Are its ears narrow? Or do its body parts – eyes, feet and hands – detach from its grimacing face?</p> <p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has <a href="https://www.productsafety.gov.au/about-us/product-safety-news/news/dont-get-bitten-by-fake-labubu-dolls">issued a warning</a> to fans of the it-dolls, stating that a burgeoning market of counterfeit Labubus could pose safety risks to young children.</p> <p>The fake dolls, often called Lafufus, can pose a choking risk due to potentially detachable parts and poor-quality stitching. The ACCC said it was also concerned counterfeit products could contain unsafe levels of harmful chemicals, including lead.</p> <p>“Watch out for potential safety risks associated with counterfeit or fake Labubu dolls – often called Lafufus – and keep these products away from young children,” the ACCC said in a product safety release on Wednesday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>“Lafufu dolls may pose a safety risk to consumers, especially young children. Some Lafufus are small enough to fit entirely within the mouth of a young child, while other versions may have detachable body parts such as eyes, feet and hands, and poor stitching, which may be a choking hazard.”</p> <p>The ACCC provided a few brief tips to identify a real Labubu, made by the company Pop Mart, from a fake:</p> <ul> <li><p>Counterfeit items could have small detachable parts like eyes, feet or hands.</p></li> <li><p>Lafufu’s could have poor stitching or use cheap fabrics.</p></li> <li><p>Authentic Labubus have exactly nine teeth.
