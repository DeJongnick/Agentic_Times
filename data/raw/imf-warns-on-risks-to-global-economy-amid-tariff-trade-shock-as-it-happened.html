One of the key questions is how the harms will be spread.</p> <p><strong>Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas</strong>, the IMF’s chief economist, said the tariffs will reduce activity and gradually it will also translate into higher prices in the US – even as he revealed a slightly higher growth forecast than expected.</p> <p><strong>Philip Luck</strong>, director of the economics programme at the Washington-based <strong>Center for Strategic and International Studies</strong>, said that the US has essentially aimed to convince other nations that it can take more pain – warding them off significant retaliation. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This success in avoiding retaliation likely stems from credible signaling of “escalation dominance”—essentially convincing partners that entering a cycle of economic retaliation would be more costly for them than for the United States.</p> </blockquote> <p>There are also more signs of discontent in the EU – which could feel particularly hard done by if other countries face a “world tariff” of 15%. That would be the same level that the EU agreed to much fanfare. Reuters reported:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>German Economy Minister <strong>Katherina Reiche</strong> said on Tuesday that the European Union is currently negotiating with the United States from a position of weakness and emphasized the need for a change in approach.</p> <p>The EU will closely measure the United States against the commitments made in Sunday’s tariff deal, Reiche said, adding that the new tariffs would bring an enormous burden.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Modupe Adegbembo</strong>, an economist at Jefferies, an investment bank, said the EU deal meant the worst-case scenario of 30–50% tariffs has been avoided.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>While the agreed tariffs still represent a sharp increase from the pre-April average of just 1.2% to 17.5%, firms can now plan with greater confidence despite the higher costs. Over the longer term, however, this substantial rise in tariffs will materially increase the cost of US market access for EU exporters and may weigh on business sentiment.</p> <p>Although the absolute cost of exporting to the US has risen, the EU’s relative competitiveness has improved. The new 15% baseline tariff is higher than the 10% faced by UK exporters, but remains more favorable than the 30% applied to Chinese goods and is on par with Japan’s 15%. This positioning could help cushion the impact on export volumes, even as firms adjust to the new trade environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>In other business and economics news:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> bank’s second quarter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jul/29/us-china-trade-donald-trump-world-tariff-federal-reserve-bank-of-england-euro-dollar-business-live?page=with%3Ablock-688883bc8f086229c4205b8d#block-688883bc8f086229c4205b8d">profits rose 28%</a> to £2.5bn, beating consensus estimates for £2.2bn.</p></li> <li><p>Donald Trump said the UK’s taxes on <strong>North Sea oil</strong> “make no sense” and called for incentivising production.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Stellantis</strong>, the maker of the Fiat, Jeep and Vauxhall car brands, has said that it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jul/29/us-china-trade-donald-trump-world-tariff-federal-reserve-bank-of-england-euro-dollar-business-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-6888a1828f08e8f8da71f425#block-6888a1828f08e8f8da71f425">expects a €1.5bn hit from tariffs</a> this year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Anglian Water</strong> has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jul/29/us-china-trade-donald-trump-world-tariff-federal-reserve-bank-of-england-euro-dollar-business-live?page=with%3Ablock-688882d48f088ae73187132c#block-688882d48f088ae73187132c">ordered to pay £62.8m</a> by the water regulator, Ofwat, over failures in managing its wastewater treatment works and network that meant it was unable to cope with sewage flows.</p></li> <li><p>Trade talks between the <strong>US and China</strong> continued in Sweden, with an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/jul/29/us-china-trade-donald-trump-world-tariff-federal-reserve-bank-of-england-euro-dollar-business-live?page=with%3Ablock-688865728f086229c4205ac8#block-688865728f086229c4205ac8">extension of a deadline likely</a>, according to the Trump administration.</p></li> </ul> <p>You can continue to follow our live coverage from around the world:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/29/aidrops-aid-futile-msf-israel-gaza-war-middle-east-latest-news-updates">Gaza needs to be ‘flooded with large-scale food aid’ to prevent mass starvation, says World Food Programme – Middle East crisis live</a> </p> </aside> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jul/29/uk-politics-latest-news-cabinet-keir-starmer-nigel-farage-online-safety-act">Starmer to hold emergency cabinet meeting on Gaza amid calls to recognise Palestinian state – UK politics live</a> </p> </aside> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jul/29/russia-ukraine-donald-trump-moscow-europe-latest-updates-news">Zelenskyy says at least 22 people killed in Russian attacks on Ukraine, hours after Trump put pressure on Moscow – Europe live</a> </p> </aside> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/jul/29/four-killed-shooting-manhattan-new-york-donald-trump-us-politics-latest-news-updates">Gunman who killed four people in New York building was targeting NFL headquarters, mayor says – follow live</a> </p> </aside> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2025/jul/29/england-victory-parade-lionesses-london-bus-procession-fans-euro-2025-live">England victory parade: fans join Lionesses in London after Euro 2025 triumph – live</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em><strong>Thank you for following today again, and please do join me bright and early tomorrow.

We urge all parties to settle trade disputes and agree on clear and predictable frameworks. Collective efforts should be made to restore and improve the global trading system.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also gave a blunt defence of <strong>central bank independence</strong> – after Trump’s repeated criticisms of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. Trump wants Powell to lower interest rates.</p> <p>Gourinchas said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is important to reaffirm and preserve the principle of central bank independence. The evidence is overwhelming that independent central banks, with a narrow mandate to pursue price and economic stability, are essential to anchoring inflation expectations. That central banks around the world achieved a successful ‘soft landing’ despite the recent surge in inflation owes a great deal to their independence and hard-earned credibility.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also said that recent trade deals are essentially covered by the IMF forecasts, because they lock in relatively high tariffs, such as 15% on EU exports to the US. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We are not seeing a major change on the effective tariff rate on other countries.</p> <p>It might be a little bit above, a little bit below, but it won’t be very different.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6888c5538f08e5ff0e35ad7a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-29T13:03:54.752Z">2.03pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Global economy to grow by 3% in 2025 says IMF</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The <strong>International Monetary Fund (IMF)</strong> has <strong>upgraded its forecast for global economic growth</strong> this year after the US retreated from some of its most extreme tariff measures.</p> <p>The Washington-based fund predicted global growth in 2025 will be 3%, up from an estimate in April of 2.8%.
