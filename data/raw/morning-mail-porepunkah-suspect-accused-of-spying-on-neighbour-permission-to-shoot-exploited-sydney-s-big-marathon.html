<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>There are more than 200,000 category A hunting licences in NSW, but official figures reckon that only 11,000 people take part in recreational hunting each year. This startling discrepancy encapsulates concern among gun control advocates who say people are exploiting lax regulation of “permission-to-shoot” letters to obtain guns. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/28/golden-ticket-to-guns-police-want-australias-laws-tightened-to-stem-abuse-of-firearms-licences">Sarah Martin and Christopher Knaus have this special report</a>.</p>

<p>Marathon running has never been so popular. In the five years before Covid, the Sydney marathon averaged 4,000 finishers. It has now transformed itself into a so-called marathon major and this Sunday it expects 35,000 runners. Other city marathons have entered the race for runners in recent years such as Ballarat and Wollongong, and Geelong is ready to fire the start’s pistol next year. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2025/aug/28/sydney-marathons-debut-as-major-is-timed-perfectly-with-australias-running-boom">Elise Beacom tries to keep up with the pace</a>.</p>
