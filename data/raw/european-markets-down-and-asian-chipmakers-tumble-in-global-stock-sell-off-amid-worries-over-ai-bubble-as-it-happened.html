But he said looking back there was a good argument that it should have been higher.</p> <p>Asked by Treasury committee member and Labour MP <strong>Yuan Yang</strong> why he rejected using low interest rates when he was in charge of the Treasury from 2010 to 2016 to increase investment spending, he said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>With the passage of time you look back on it and think maybe that was the wrong thing and we should have rethought the capital budget.</p> <p>We definitely cancelled things that we later had to reinstate, which was not ideal.</p> <p>But if we had massively increased the capital budget it would have put more pressure on current spending at a time when we had a high budget deficit. It would also have put more pressure on us to raise taxes.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Sir Vince Cable</strong>, a former business secretary who was also quizzed by the committee ahead of the budget on 26 November, said senior civil servants warned him that the bond markets were extremely concerned about the level of the UK’s annual deficit and the rising level of debt.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>They said the bond markets don’t distinguish between capital and current spending, it all borrowing. And that’s the argument that was thrown back at us.</p> <p>I think with hindsight, this is one area where we caould have taken a different track,” said cable, who was business secretary in the coalition government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Osborne added that <strong>Rachel Reeves</strong>, the current chancellor, should protect investment spending in the budget and would need to announce “unavoidable” tax hikes to balance the books.</p> <p>However, he said the chancellor should demand deep reforms from Whitehall departments in return for extra cash.</p> <p>Osborne and Cable said there should also be tax reform such as merging income and national insurance levies and scrapping fuel duty relief.</p>    <p>Osborne said it would be “messy” to make small adjustments and it would be “easier to go for one of the big three taxes: income tax, national insurance or VAT” while overhauling the system.</p> <p>He revealed that tax reform he had considered with Liberal Democrat Treasury ministers when the two parties were in a coalition was overruled by then-prime minister David Cameron in favour of smaller changes, leading to the so-called “pasty tax” in his 2012 budget he was later forced to row back due to a backbench rebellion.</p> <p>Osborne told the Treasury committee they had agreed to introduce two additional bands of council tax for high value properties in order to cut the top rate of income tax from 50% to 40%.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>And then for perfectly good, sound political reasons, David Cameron felt the Conservatives had promised not to have a mansion tax.</p> <p>And so we settled on 45% and a series of small taxes, including taxes on hot food to pay for it.</p> <p>“That is a good example of tax reform being quite hard when you’re trying to raise taxes.</p> </blockquote> <p>Osborne argued the chancellor should merge income tax and national insurance as “it’s sort of odd we have two taxes on income”.<br><br>The two former cabinet ministers appeared before the cross-party panel of MPs as part of its series looking ahead to the Budget.</p> <p>Reeves is widely expected to rip up Labour’s manifesto pledge not to raise certain taxes in three weeks’ time by increasing the basic rate of income tax.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-05T14:38:29.672Z">at 2.38pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-690b5b568f082152466b64dd" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-05T14:14:10.607Z">2.14pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The FTSE 100 index in London has reversed earlier modest falls and is now trading 0.3% higher at 9,746.

By business size, essentially all of the gains stemmed from large firms with 500+ employees.</p> <p>Ryan said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Even if the government shutdown ends this week, the Fed may still lack official payroll data before its December 10th announcement due to disruptions in data collection. In that case, this release – while imperfect – <strong>suggests the labour market has at least stabilised in recent months but still lacks real momentum, leaving our call for a December interest rate cut intact.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-05T14:16:10.948Z">at 2.16pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-690b568d8f082152466b64c0" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-05T14:00:51.114Z">2.00pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">US employers add 42,000 jobs in hiring rebound – ADP</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>In the United States, private employers added 42,000 jobs in October, a rebound from a couple of months of weak hiring, <a href="https://adpemploymentreport.com/">according to a closely-watched repo</a>rt.</p> <p>ADP Research said the bounce wasn’t broad-based, though, with education and healthcare, and trade, transportation, and utilities leading the growth.

So there’s a deeply important investability issue for the UK.</p> </blockquote>    <p>The Lloyds CEO also took a swipe at the money behind the claims industry, which he said had been pushing customer claims through the courts. </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>They’re funded, by the way, by largely international private equity, limited litigation funds, often that are based in Bermuda and other locations like that. It’s a very important part of this ecosystem that’s been created in the UK in a way that hasn’t been supported in most other jurisdictions in the world.

But we need to be very careful to not make the banks accountable for the risks of the non-bank sector, or providing that transparency - otherwise, it will make us less competitive. <br><br>And we do believe that transparency is needed. It would be absolutely right for the regulators to determine how to manage that risk directly through the sector, not through the banking sector. <br><br>And I would be concerned for the future of the UK if it were to go down that path, especially in the international competitiveness environment we’re currently in.</p> </blockquote> <p>It comes as the private credit industry, which is largely unregulated, comes under greater scrutiny after two US company bankruptcies - First Brands and Tricolor - and warnings from the International Monetary Fund and the Bank of England.<br><br>The Bank of England’s governor, <strong>Andrew Bailey</strong>, said last month that the recent failures had worrying echoes of the sub-prime mortgage crisis that kicked off the global financial crash of 2008. Meanwhile, the IMF warned that a downturn could have ripple effects across the financial system, given that banks were increasingly exposed to a largely unregulated private credit industry. <br><br>Nunn said Lloyds itself did not lend to the private credit sector. <br><br>The Bank of England is currently preparing a stress test to determine whether the booming private credit risks amplifying shocks across the UK’s financial system.

This includes lifting levies on farm goods, Beijing confirmed on Wednesday, but imports of US soybeans will still face a 13% tariff.</p> <p>The State Council’s tariff commission announced it would remove duties of up to 15% it imposed on certain US agricultural goods from 10 November – while maintaining the 10% levies prompted by Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs.</p> <p>Investors were cheered last week when US and Chinese presidents met in South Korea, but Beijing did not provide details of what had been agreed.</p> <p><strong>Even Rogers Pay</strong>, a director at Beijing-based research firm Trivium China, told Reuters:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Broadly, it’s a great sign that the two sides are making rapid progress in putting the deal into effect. It shows they’re aligned and that the agreement is likely to hold up.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, Chinese buyers of US soybeans still face 13% tariffs, which traders said makes US shipments too expensive for commercial buyers compared to Brazilian alternatives.</p> <p><strong>Over here, British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer reported a 55% drop in profits in the past six months, as sales were hit by a damaging cyber-attack in April that forced it to suspend online clothing orders for seven weeks.</strong></p> <p>The cyber attack also hit food availability at its stores. M&amp;S, one of the biggest names on the UK high street, made an adjusted profit before tax of £184.1m in the six months to 27 September, down from £413.1m a year earlier.</p> <p>Clothing and homewares sales fell by 16.4%. Food sales rose by 7.8%, better than expected, as M&amp;S said it was “largely recovered” from the effects of the attack.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We are confident we will be recovered and back on track by the financial year end.</p> </blockquote> <p>In May, the retailer estimated that the cyber attack would cost it £300m in lost operating profit in the year to March 2026, although it hopes to halve that through insurance and cost cuts. Its insurer has paid out £100m. M&amp;S is now aiming to achieve £600m in cost savings this year – £100m more than previously targeted – after it was also hit by a new packaging recycling levy.</p> <p><strong>Stuart Machin</strong>, the chief executive, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The retail sector is facing significant headwinds – in the first half, cost increases from new taxes were over £50m - but there is much within our control and accelerating our cost reduction programme will help to mitigate this.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Asian stock markets are mostly down. Japan’s Nikkei fell as much as 7% and closed 2.5% lower (after reaching a record high on Tuesday) and the South Korean Kospi slumped by 2.85%, after earlier losses of 5%. </strong>The FTSE 100 index in London is also expected to open lower.</p> <p>Shares on Wall Street tumbled on Tuesday, when the S&amp;P 500 fell by 1.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 2%, on fears that technology stocks had soared too high, with a cooling in the artificial intelligence boom. Last week, US stock indices hit record highs and analysts say that some investors are taking profits, especially in AI-related stocks.</p> <p><strong>The Agenda</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>8.15am-8.55am: Spain, Italy, France, Germany PMI final surveys for October</p></li> <li><p>9am GMT: UK New car sales for October</p></li> <li><p>9.05am GMT: Bank of England Khan speech</p></li> <li><p>9.30am GMT: UK Services and composite PMIs final for October</p></li> <li><p>10am GMT: Eurozone producer prices for September</p></li> <li><p>1.15pm GMT: US ADP Employment for October</p></li> <li><p>3pm GMT: US ISM Services PMI for October</p></li> <li><p>US Supreme Court to consider legality of Trump tariffs</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-05T08:47:04.506Z">at 8.47am GMT</time></p>  </div>
