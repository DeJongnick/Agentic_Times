<p>A warm, dry year, followed by what feels like a final hurrah of summer as September gives way to October, has become the norm in recent years, at least where I live in Somerset. That’s usually good news for migrating birds, as they can head south safely, without the risk of sudden storms derailing their journey.</p> <p>But autumn can still have a bite, weather-wise. Strong westerly gales during late August and the first two weeks of September meant that several pelagic seabirds – those that usually spend the autumn and winter months well out to sea – found themselves venturing unexpectedly close to land.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/sep/23/ive-spent-32-years-writing-about-the-great-outdoors">I’ve spent 32 years writing about the great outdoors.

Earlier, the tail-end of Hurricane Erin brought flocks of this Arctic species off the coasts of Ireland, Wales and south-west England, with as many as 1,700 individuals reported.</p> <p>The Sabine’s gulls stayed offshore, but other migrants temporarily sought refuge inland. Two species of phalarope – grey and the scarcer red-necked – holed up at a Somerset reservoir, where they delighted birders for whom these tiny, swimming waders are a rare sight. After fattening up to boost their energy levels for a week or so, they departed on a calm, clear night, none the worse for their brief diversion.</p>
