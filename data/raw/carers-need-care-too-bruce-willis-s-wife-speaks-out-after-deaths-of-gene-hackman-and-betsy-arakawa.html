<p>Emma Heming Willis, the primary carer for her husband, the actor Bruce Willis, who is suffering from a rare form of dementia, has issued a statement in the wake of the deaths of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/feb/27/gene-hackman-dies-wife-dog-95">Gene Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa</a>.</p> <p>An investigation by local authorities in New Mexico concluded last week that Arakawa, 65, died of a rare respiratory disease around seven days before her husband, meaning that it was likely he spent a week by himself, disorientated and increasingly malnourished.</p> <p>His Alzheimer’s disease led investigators to suspect he may have remained unaware his wife had died, and was evidently unable to summon help. Hackman, 95, was eventually found near the entrance to their home in Santa Fe, apparently after suffering a fall.</p> <p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHCbwHMyQ90/?hl=en">Instagram</a>, Heming Willis, 46, said she hoped the tragic deaths of the couple and one of their dogs would prompt people to reflect on the “broader story”.</p> <p>“I do really believe that there is some learning,” she said. “Caregivers need care, too. And that they are vital, and that it is so important that we show up for them so that they can continue to show up for their person.”</p> <p>She continued: “I think that there’s this common misconception that caregivers, they got it figured out. They got it covered. They’re good. I don’t subscribe to that.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/16/bruce-willis-frontotemporal-dementia-aphasia-ftd">Willis, 69, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023</a>, the year after he announced his<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/feb/16/bruce-willis-frontotemporal-dementia-aphasia-ftd"> retirement due to aphasia</a>. It is believed he is no longer verbal.</p> <p>His wife, as well as his daughters and ex-wife Demi Moore, have been praised for their candour discussing his condition, and their support of the former action star. Heming Willis’s memoir of caregiving, The Unexpected Journey, will be published in September.</p> <p>“Having resources and information readily available is imperative,” she has said of the book. “I know between my experience and other care partners that I have spoken to; our stories are unfortunately similar.”</p>    <p>Questions have been raised by many about why Hackman and his wife did not appear to have a more robust support network in place.</p> <p>The circumstances of Hackman’s death have substantially affected the legacy of one of Hollywood’s most venerated stars, with his and Arakawa’s plight highlighting the obstacles faced by vulnerable elderly people and those who look after them.</p>
