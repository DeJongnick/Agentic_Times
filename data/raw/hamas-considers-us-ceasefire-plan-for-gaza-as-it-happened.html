  <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – a US and Israeli-backed group running food distribution centres - told Reuters on Friday that “the most deadly attacks on aid sites have been linked to U.N. convoys,” and said the U.N. and humanitarian groups should work “collaboratively” with the GHF to “maximise the amount of aid being securely delivered into Gaza”. The U.N. in Geneva was immediately available for comment.</p> 
  <p>It comes after an influx of patients wounded at non-United Nations food distribution sites run by the GHF. The U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said 509 of 613 people killed at aid points were near GHF distribution points. </p> 
  <p>The GHF dismissed these numbers as coming “directly from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry” and were being used to “falsely smear” its effort.</p> 
  <p>The GHF has previously said it has delivered more than 60 million meals to hungry Palestinians in five weeks “safely and without interference”, while other humanitarian groups had “nearly all of their aid looted.”</p>

  <p>The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders Friday in northeast Khan Younis and urged Palestinians to move west ahead of planned military operations against Hamas in the area. The new evacuation zones pushed Palestinians into increasingly smaller spaces by the coast.</p> 
  <p>Hamas said Friday that it was holding discussions with leaders of other Palestinian factions to discuss a ceasefire proposal presented to it by Egyptian and Qatari mediators. Hamas said it will give its final response to mediators after the discussions have concluded.</p> 
  <p>“We’ll see what happens. We’re going to know over the next 24 hours,” US President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One late Thursday when asked if Hamas had agreed to the latest framework for a ceasefire.</p>

  <p>In Gaza, Israel has <a href="https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/">automated its target selection</a>, with horrifying results.</p> 
  <p>As security sources <a href="https://www.972mag.com/israeli-intelligence-chatgpt-8200-surveillance-ai/">explained</a> to +972 magazine in April 2024, Israel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes">Lavender AI </a>program had marked about 37,000 Palestinians as suspected “Hamas militants”, selecting them as potential targets for assassination. A further program, with the sinister name of Where’s Daddy?, was tracking them to their homes so that they could be bombed at night, often killing not only their families but many other people in the same block. “Once you go automatic,” one of the sources told the journal, “target generation goes crazy.” Almost everyone in Gaza had been given a Lavender rating of between 1 and 100. As soon as the number in the AI system was high enough, the name would<strong> </strong>be added to the kill list. That would be treated as a military order, even though the operators knew that at least 10% of the targets were misidentified.</p>

  <p>At least 15 people were killed in Israeli airstrikes, including eight women and one child. Another 20 were shot while waiting for aid, according to Nasser Hospital, including two who were killed near distribution sites in Rafah and 18 who were waiting for trucks to deliver supplies elsewhere in southern Gaza.</p> 
  <p>The recent killings took place as efforts to halt the 21-month war appeared to be moving forward.</p>

The Health Ministry in Gaza said the number of Palestinians killed in the territory has passed 57,000. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count, but says more than half of the dead are women and children.</p>

  <p>Followers of the Baha’i faith - a small but global religion with an interfaith credo - are facing repression in several Middle East nations, particularly Iran, that is drawing criticism from human rights groups.</p> 
  <p>The abuse is most evident in Iran, which bans the faith and has been widely accused of persecuting its adherents, human rights advocates say. They also report systemic discrimination in Yemen, Qatar and Egypt.</p> 
  <p>Iran has been a driving force in the spread of anti-Baha’i repression in countries where it holds influence, advocates say - a plan first made public in a leaked 1991 government document. These include Yemen, where Iran backs Houthi rebels who control much of the country, and Qatar, where links include co-ownership of the world’s largest natural gas field.</p> 
  <p>“The sheer arsenal the Iranian government has expended to crush the Baha’is in every avenue of life has been astronomical,” said Nazila Ghanea, an Oxford University law professor and U.N. Special Rapporteur on religious freedom. “It has also extended its reach, time and again, beyond the border of Iran,” she said.</p>

  <p>Hezbollah has begun a major strategic review in the wake of its devastating war with Israel, including considering scaling back its role as an armed movement without disarming completely, three sources familiar with the deliberations say.</p> 
  <p>The internal discussions, which Reuters reports aren’t yet finalised and haven’t previously been reported, reflect the formidable pressures the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group has faced since a truce was reached in late November.</p>

It is also grappling with acute financial strains, US demands for its disarmament and diminished political clout since a new cabinet took office in February with U.S. support.</p>

  <p>Hamas leaders are close to accepting a proposed deal for a ceasefire in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> but want stronger guarantees that any pause in hostilities would lead to a permanent end to the 20-month war, sources close to the militant Islamist organisation have said.</p> 
  <p>Hamas officials met on Thursday in Istanbul to discuss the ceasefire proposals and later issued a statement confirming they were talking to other “Palestinian factions” before formally announcing a response.</p> 
  <p>The militant Islamist group has come under immense pressure in recent months, with its military leadership decimated and the Israeli military forcing its fighters out of former strongholds in the southern and central parts of Gaza.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Hamas discusses ceasefire proposal</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Hamas has said it was discussing a ceasefire proposal put forward by the US with other Palestinian factions. In a statement early on Friday morning it said would submit its response to mediators once those talks conclude</strong>. Hamas is seeking clear guarantees that the ceasefire will eventually lead to the war’s end, a source close to the group told Reuters.</p> 
  <p><strong>Meanwhile a senior Israeli official close to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the news wire that preparations were in place to approve a ceasefire deal</strong>. A separate source familiar with the matter said that Israel was expecting Hamas’ response by Friday and that if it was positive, an Israeli delegation would join indirect talks to cement the deal.</p> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> also said on Friday it would probably be known in 24 hours whether the Palestinian militant group had agreed to accept what he has called a “final proposal” for a ceasefire in Gaza. <strong>The US president also said he had spoken to Saudi Arabia about expanding the Abraham Accords</strong>, the deal on normalization of ties that his administration negotiated between Israel and some Gulf countries during his first term.<br><br>Trump was asked on Friday if <strong>Hamas had agreed to the latest ceasefire deal framework</strong>, and said: “We’ll see what happens, we are going to know over the next 24 hours.”</p> 
  <p>In other developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>When asked by a reporter on Thursday whether he still wanted the US to take over Gaza, Trump said: “I want the people of Gaza to be safe more importantly.” He added: “They’ve gone through hell.” </strong>Trump first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/05/donald-trump-plan-to-take-over-gaza-strip-netanyahu-visit">floated his plan for a “Riviera of the Middle East”</a>, which included ethnically cleansing Gaza, in February.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>At least 73 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks on Thursday including 15 killed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2025/jul/03/footage-shows-aftermath-of-israeli-strike-on-gaza-school-turned-shelter-video">an attack on a school</a>, Gaza civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said.</strong> Those killed included 38 people waiting for humanitarian aid at three separate locations in central and southern Gaza, and a child killed by a drone in Jabalia in the north.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/03/israel-bombardment-offensive-gaza-hamas-ceasefire-talks">escalated its offensive in Gaza</a> before the imminent ceasefire talks, with warships and artillery launching one of the deadliest and most intense bombardments in the devastated Palestinian territory for many months this week</strong>. In all, about 300 people may have been killed this week and thousands more injured, according to officials.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Among those targeted by Israel was one of Gaza’s most senior doctors,</strong> <strong>Dr Marwan al-Sultan. </strong>Tributes were paid on Thursday to the renowned cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> Strip, who was killed alongside several members of his family. He was the 70th healthcare worker to be killed by Israeli attacks in the last 50 days, according to Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW), a Palestinian medical organisation.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The UN special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories">Palestinian territories</a> has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/03/global-firms-profiting-israel-genocide-gaza-united-nations-rapporteur">called for sanctions and an arms embargo on Israel</a> and for global corporations to be held accountable for “profiting from genocide” in Gaza</strong>. A <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/documents/country-reports/ahrc5923-economy-occupation-economy-genocide-report-special-rapporteur">report by Francesca Albanese</a> to the UN Human Rights Council on Thursday pointed to the deep involvement of companies from around the world in supporting Israel during its 21-month onslaught in Gaza.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran</strong> <strong>on Thursday affirmed its commitment to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, as it accused Germany of “malice” over its criticism of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/25/irans-parliament-approves-bill-to-suspend-cooperation-with-iaea">Tehran’s decision to suspend cooperation</a> with the UN nuclear watchdog</strong>. “Iran remains committed to the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) and its Safeguards Agreement,” foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X. “The explicit German support for the bombing of Iran has obliterated the notion that the German regime harbors anything but malice towards Iranians,” he added in response to a German foreign office post criticising the move.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The producer of a film about medics in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> that was dropped by the BBC has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jul/03/gaza-film-producer-accuses-bbc-trying-gag-decision-drop">accused the corporation of trying to gag him</a> and others over its decision not to show the documentary</strong>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/03/gaza-doctors-under-attack-review-channel-4-crucial-film-stuff-of-nightmares">Gaza: Doctors under Attack</a>, which was finally broadcast on Channel 4 on Wednesday night, recounts how hospitals in the territory have been overwhelmed, bombed and raided. Ben de Pear, the programme’s executive producer and a former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel4">Channel 4</a> News editor, accused the BBC of attempting to stop him talking about its “painful journey” to the screen with the use of legal gagging clauses.</p></li>
