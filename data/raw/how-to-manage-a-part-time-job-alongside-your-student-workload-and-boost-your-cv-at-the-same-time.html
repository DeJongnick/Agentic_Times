<p>If you’re planning to go to university, you may also be thinking about getting a job while studying. But it can be difficult to know where to look, especially if you’re moving to an unfamiliar city.</p> <p>The most important thing is to find a job that’s flexible enough to fit alongside your studies. With the third term increasingly quiet or even empty you might consider filling it with temporary work – but remember your main goal is to get a degree that opens the door to the career you want. Many universities, including <a href="https://careers.ed.ac.uk/students/undergraduates/discover-what-s-out-there/find-jobs-while-student/working-hours-rights-at-work">Edinburgh</a>, <a href="https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/student/international/current/working-in-the-uk/university-recommendation.aspx">Birmingham</a> and <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/study/undergraduate-fees-and-funding/work-while-you-study">Brunel</a>, recommend working no more than an average of 15 hours a week during term time so that your studies aren’t compromised.</p> <p>Aside from the usual job search platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed and Reed, there are other sites worth a look if you want flexible work either during term time or the holidays. <a href="https://jobtoday.com/gb">Jobtoday</a>, <a href="https://www.caterer.com/">Caterer</a>, <a href="https://www.e4s.co.uk/search/part-time-jobs">E4s, </a><a href="https://www.studentjob.co.uk/">StudentJob</a> and <a href="https://daily-jobs.jobs-bear.com/">JobsBear</a> all list jobs around the UK, including casual work.</p> <p>As well as searching on job sites, you could contact local catering companies – they often let you pick up waitering shifts as and when they suit you. From October, Christmas temp roles are worth looking out for as many retail and hospitality companies will be offering flexible working contracts during this time.</p> <p>Working for a chain that has branches around the country is great because it can give you the flexibility of transferring to another outlet when moving between home and university and vice-versa.</p> <p>When you get to university, your campus will have an employability or careers team. They should be able to give you guidance on finding jobs in the area, as well as helping you with your CV and cover letter.</p> <p>Even if the role does not match what you hope to do for a living post-university, having a job while studying will equip you with essential life skills. All jobs involve being organised and punctual, many will help you build resilience and your communication skills as you deal with different people and situations. </p> <p>Roles such as restaurant work can have great transferable skills such as conflict resolution (dealing with awkward customers), building rapport (with colleagues and not-awkward customers) and being able to work well under pressure. These will all serve you well on your CV.</p> <p>“Increasingly, major graduate employers are prioritising skills over academic qualifications when selecting candidates,” says Claire Tyler, head of insights at the <a href="https://ise.org.uk/knowledge/research/104/student_development_survey_2024">Institute of Student Employers</a>, the biggest UK student recruitment community.</p> <p>“We recommend students research the skill requirements of the graduate employers they may wish to apply to after university and then seek part-time work which will help demonstrate these skills. </p> <p>“Developing skills during part-time employment work is an accessible way students can ensure they stand out in a competitive graduate job market.”</p>
