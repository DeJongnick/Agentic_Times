 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Here’s a look at where things currently stand:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Egypt’s president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi held a meeting on Monday with the presidents of France and Turkey, and Qatar’s emir and others to help coordinate the implementation of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> ceasefire and reconstruction efforts for the territory, according to a statement by the Egyptian president’s office. </strong>The meeting was held on the sidelines of an international summit in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh to finalise an agreement aimed at ending the war in Gaza.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Hamas has started deploying armed fighters and police across parts of Gaza in an apparent attempt to reassert authority in the devastated Palestinian territory after the ceasefire deal agreed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> last week. </strong>Images showed dozens of Hamas fighters at a hospital in southern Gaza during the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/israeli-hostage-release-hamas-gaza-last-living">release of Israeli hostages on Monday morning</a> and there were reports of shootings and executions elsewhere in the territory.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A last-minute plan by Donald Trump to invite Benjamin Netanyahu to a multinational Gaza summit in Egypt had to be aborted after the Turkish president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan">Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</a>, said he would not land his plane in Sharm el-Sheikh if the invitation stood. </strong>The mid-air power power struggle started after it was announced that the Israeli prime minister had accepted a late invitation from Trump to the conference being jointly chaired by the US president and his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, in Egypt.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Two busloads of Palestinian detainees were transferred from Israeli prisons to Ramallah, in the occupied West</strong><strong> Bank, on Monday, where jubilant crowds awaited them.</strong> In total, 88 of the nearly 2,000 prisoners were sent to the West Bank, with the rest deported to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, according to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Commission.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump declared that the ceasefire agreement marks the end of Israel’s war on Gaza, as well as the end of the “age of terror and death”. </strong>Speaking to the Knesset, the US president said: ‘This is not only the end of a war. This is the end of the age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Netanyahu said Trump is the greatest friend Israel has ever had. “Donald Trump is the greatest friend that the State of Israel has ever had in the White House,” he told the Knesset.</strong> “No American president has ever done more for the state of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, and as I said in Washington, it ain’t even close,” the Israeli prime minister said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>At least 67,869 Palestinian people have been killed and 170,105 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Monday.</strong> In a statement, the health ministry said the bodies of 63 people, including 60 recovered from rubble, arrived in hospitals across the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> Strip over the latest 24-hour reporting period.</p></li>

  <p><strong>The “Summit for Peace” was a virtual who’s who of Middle Eastern and European politics, while attracting other unlikely power brokers in the Trump era of international diplomacy such as FIFA </strong><strong>president, </strong><strong>Gianni Infantino</strong><strong>.</strong></p> 
  <p>Leaders from at least 27 countries, many in Europe and the Middle East, joined the Summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday.</p> 
  <p>Conspicuously absent among them was Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu, whose presence other regional leaders would likely have protested. But there were the leaders of the major Arab and regional states, including Egypt’s Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, Turkey’s Recep Erdoğan, as well as the leaders of the Gulf states Qatar and United Arab Emirates.</p> 
  <p>Keir Starmer and European leaders from France, Germany, Italy, Hungary and others also attended.</p>

  <p><strong>As world leaders arrived in Egypt on Monday to celebrate the first stage of the Gaza ceasefire deal and discuss the next steps, there was a curious note of disharmony between the US and the UK.</strong></p> 
  <p>Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, had appeared on the BBC on Sunday talking about the UK’s “key role” in shaping the agreement – only to be slapped down on X by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, who called her “delusional”.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile Gideon Sa’ar, the Israeli foreign minister, reposted a message by the former British military officer Richard Kemp claiming: “The British government played no role in the ceasefire agreement, except a negative one by encouraging Hamas to resist through recognition of a nonexistent ‘Palestinian state’.”</p>

  <p><strong>The estimated 65,000 people in “hostages square” in Tel Aviv heard it before they saw it. Like so many sunflowers, their faces turned up to search the clear blue morning sky for the source of the sound. Then it swept into view from the west, from the direction of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>.</strong></p> 
  <p>A helicopter, military brown, was on the way to Ichilov hospital a few hundred metres away. But it diverted. It circled around the crowd giving each person below a view, and then tilted to its right, in an apparent salute to the cheering, waving, smiling faces below.</p> 
  <p>At the door of the helicopter, the keen-eyed will have seen the outline of a figure almost hanging out, seemingly straining to get closer to the jubilant crowd below.</p> 
  <p>It appeared to be one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/israeli-hostage-release-hamas-gaza-last-living">final 20 live hostages released that morning</a> after two years in Hamas captivity. He used his hands to make a shape: a heart.</p> 
  <p>About eight helicopters in all swept by, not all of them diverting to put on a show. Some medical cases may have been more urgent than others.</p> 
  <p>But each received a raucous cheer on what was certainly a highly emotional day for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, and one that so many dearly hope will prove to be historic.</p>

  <p><strong>The UK’s foreign ministry has brought together Middle East and European officials as part of a three-day conference on rebuilding post-war Gaza.</strong></p> 
  <p>Agence France-Presse reports:</p> 
  <p><em>Far from a high-profile Gaza summit in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, the UK’s foreign ministry quietly brought together Middle East and European officials at an isolated mansion deep in the southern English countryside.</em></p> 
  <p><em>The aim of the three-day conference was to start the “crucial planning and coordination efforts for postwar Gaza” which would be Palestinian-led, the UK prime minister’s office said in a statement.</em></p> 
  <p><em>“We must be ready to act –</em><em> to clear rubble, rebuild homes and set up infrastructure, restoring access to education and healthcare,” junior foreign minister Hamish Falconer added in a statement.</em></p> 
  <p><em>“We know the scale of the task. We know how urgent it is, and how complex it will be,” he added, highlighting it “will take years and cost billions”.</em></p>

  <p><strong>A vote on Israel’s participation in next year’s Eurovision song contest has been postponed in the wake of the ceasefire in Gaza, the European Broadcasting Union has confirmed.</strong></p> 
  <p>The EBU was due to hold an extraordinary general meeting of its members in November to enable a vote on Israel’s participation amid deepening divisions among its members. </p> 
  <p>Several broadcasters including EBU members in Spain, Ireland and Slovenia, said they would boycott the event if Israel took part in 2026. </p> 
  <p>Confirming the EGM has been cancelled, the EBU said in a statement: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>“In the light of recent developments in the Middle East, the EBU’s Executive Board (meeting on 13 October) agreed there was a clear need to organize an open and in-person discussion among its Members on the issue of participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026. Consequently, the Board agreed to put the issue on the agenda of its ordinary Winter General Assembly, which will be taking place in December, rather than organizing an extraordinary session in advance.”</p>

  <p><strong>The police could not hold the crowds back. As soon as they saw the Palestinian prisoners through the windows of the bus, hundreds of people gathering in front of a theatre in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank rushed forward, chanting the names of loved ones they had not seen for years and in some cases, decades.</strong></p> 
  <p>The prisoners were gaunt, the sharp angles of their faces decorated by freshly scabbed-over wounds. Loved ones hoisted them up on their shoulders with ease. One prisoner, swaddled in a Palestinian keffiyeh and splaying his fingers into a V for victory, was dropped before his mother, whose feet he began to kiss.</p> 
  <p>In total, 88 Palestinian detainees were released from Israeli prisons and sent to the occupied West Bank on Monday – the other nearly 2,000 prisoners were sent to Gaza, where a minority would travel on to neighbouring countries.</p> 
  <p>The detainees were released by Israel a few hours after all living Israeli hostages were returned from Gaza. The exchange marked the first step in a ceasefire that could permanently end the two-year conflict in the territory.</p> 
  <p>The geopolitical implication of the prisoner release was far from families’ minds on Monday; most were celebrating a release they never thought would come. Most of the men were serving life sentences and many were charged with violent crimes.</p>

Telegram channels associated with Hamas said “collaborators and traitors” had been targeted, a reference to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/30/israel-backed-militia-groups-potentially-threaten-new-peace-plan-for-gaza">Israel-backed militia in the territory</a>, while Hamas gunmen also engaged in bloody clashes with a powerful local family in Gaza City over the weekend.</p> 
  <p>The violence is unlikely to immediately threaten the current ceasefire agreement with Israel but raises significant concerns over the disarmament of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hamas">Hamas</a>, a key though ill-defined provision of the deal, and the challenges that will confront the new stabilisation force of regional troops that is to be deployed to Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Asked by a journalist on Air Force One about reports that Hamas was moving against rivals to regain control in parts of Gaza, the US president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, suggested the militant Islamist organisation was acting within the parameters of the ceasefire deal.</p> 
  <p>“They do want to stop the problems and they’ve been open about it, and we gave them approval for a period of time … You have close to 2 million people going back to buildings that have been demolished, and a lot of bad things can happen. So we want it to be – we want it to be safe. I think it’s going to be fine. Who knows for sure,” Trump said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump plan to invite Netanyahu to Gaza summit aborted after Erdoğan warning</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>A last-minute plan by Donald Trump to invite Benjamin Netanyahu to a multinational Gaza summit in Egypt had to be aborted after the Turkish president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/recep-tayyip-erdogan">Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</a>, said he would not land his plane in Sharm el-Sheikh if the invitation stood.</strong></p> 
  <p>The mid-air power power struggle started after it was announced that the Israeli prime minister had accepted a late invitation from Trump to the conference being jointly chaired by the US president and his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, in Egypt.</p> 
  <p>Netanyahu’s presence at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/donald-trump-egypt-peace-summit-abdel-fattah-al-sisi">summit in Sharm el-Sheikh</a> had apparently been sealed by Trump in a phone call from Israel on Monday morning with Sisi.</p> 
  <p>It is not clear if Erdoğan’s refusal to land for the summit was the cause of Netanyahu changing his plans, but it is known that he spoke to Sisi to raise his objections from his plane above <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/egypt">Egypt</a>.</p> 
  <p>A statement from the Israeli prime minister’s office said: “Prime Minister Netanyahu was invited by US President Trump to participate in a conference taking place today in Egypt. The prime minister thanked President Trump for his invitation but stated that he would not be able to attend due to the proximity of the event to the start of the holiday.”</p> 
  <p>Figures on the extreme right in Netanyahu’s coalition government had also threatened to resign if he went to the conference.</p> 
  <p>International criminal court arrest warrants have been issued against Netanyahu for alleged war crimes in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a>, and while Egypt is not a signatory to the court, his presence at the summit would have been contentious, including among those Arab states that have not normalised relations with Israel. More than 20 world leaders were due to attend the hastily arranged summit.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>US president Donald Trump has boarded Air Force One and is now set to leave Israel to fly to Egypt for the Gaza peace summit.</strong></p> 
  <p>He was seen on to the plane by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom the pair shared seemingly warm exchanges – although most of the conversation on the runway was inaudible due to the noise of the plane.</p> 
  <p>Trump and Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/11/donald-trump-and-abdel-fattah-al-sisi-to-chair-gaza-peace-summit">co-host a summit of more than 20 world leaders</a> in Sharm El Sheikh.</p> 
  <p>The summit’s aim is “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability”, according to the Egyptian presidency.</p> 
  <p>The impressive aims of the meeting are matched by a similarly impressive guest list, many of whom have played a vital role in securing the ceasefire and hostage release deal that is currently in place.</p>

  <p>The US president, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, is expected to head straight to his plane so he can co-chair the peace summit with Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi in Sharm el-Sheikh as quickly as possible. He is running late. </p> 
  <p>The summit’s aim is “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability”, according to the Egyptian presidency.</p> 
  <p>The continuing success of Trump’s deal – and how closely the next stages match up to Trump’s 20-point peace plan – are all expected to be up for discussions at Monday’s meeting.</p> 
  <p>Among those who are attending are the UN secretary general, <strong>António Guterres</strong>, Britain’s prime minister, <strong>Keir Starmer</strong>, Italian prime minister, <strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong>, Spanish prime minister <strong>Pedro Sánchez</strong>, the Turkish President <strong>Recep Tayyip Erdoğan</strong>, and the French president, <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s Gaza plan left open the possibility of a role for <strong>Mahmoud Abbas</strong>’ Palestinian Authority in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> – contingent on various reforms – but Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> has rejected such an idea.</p> 
  <p>The PA is a governing body that has control of parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</p> 
  <p>Abbas met with Macron on the sidelines of the Egyptian summit and discussed the ceasefire agreement, the entry of aid into the Gaza Strip, and the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Joy and sorrow as only some Palestinian prisoners are released to Ramallah, while others are deported to Gaza</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>William Christou is reporting for the Guardian from Ramallah:</em></p> 
  <p>Two busloads of Palestinian detainees were transferred from Israeli prisons to Ramallah, in the occupied West-bank, on Monday, where jubilant crowds awaited them.</p> 
  <p>In total, 88 of the nearly 2,000 prisoners were sent to the West Bank, with the rest deported to Gaza, according to the Palestinian Prisoners’ Commission.</p> 
  <p>Gaunt prisoners wrapped in the Palestinian keffiyeh flashed peace signs from the bus as the cheering crowd screamed their names.</p> 
  <p>Once the door of the bus was opened, police could not hold the surging crowd back. Family descended upon their loved ones, hugging them and carrying them on their shoulders towards waiting relatives. One prisoner rode his friend’s shoulders and with his fingers splayed into a V for victory, before collapsing before his mother’s feet.</p> 
  <p>“He’s been locked up for 24 years,” said a relative of Saber Masalma, a member of Fatah, the main faction of the Palestine Liberation Movement (PLO) who was arrested in 2002 and sentenced to life in prison on charges of conspiracy to cause death and placing explosive charges. Masalma had a phone shoved in his face, so that he could meet his nieces and nephews over video call for the first time.</p> 
  <p>Saber’s relative said that his condition had deteriorated dramatically over the last two years and that he barely recognised his brother after his dramatic weight loss.<br><br>“He looks like a dead body. But we will bring him back to life,” he said, laughing. They were off to a restaurant, where they would have to be careful that Saber does not eat too much, as his stomach is not used to much food after not eating well in prison.</p> 
  <p>Among the scenes of joy was also sorrow. Several families who had been told by the Israeli security services that their family members were coming home were surprised to see that their loved ones were not on the buses on Monday.<br><br>Prisoners told families that over a dozen prisoners had been taken last night from the main group so that they could be deported from Gaza, in a surprise to their families. Deportation to Gaza meant that it would be virtually impossible for families to see their loved ones again.</p> 
  <p>Seeing that their loved ones were not going to emerge from the buses as expected, a woman collapsed, while others began to wail.</p> 
  <p>“Why are they deporting him?,” a woman screamed in tears, as police officers rushed her away from the crowd.</p> 
  <p>The rest of the nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners were deported to Gaza, a small portion of whom would be exiled to neighbouring countries such as Turkey and Egypt.</p>

  <p>The director told the outlet that the end of the Israeli assault on Gaza is a “great day” and one that will see a number of prisoners who have been held in prisons for decades released. </p> 
  <p>The director added that more than 150 released Palestinian prisoners will be deported to other countries.</p>

  <p>Prior to Israel’s 12-day war with Iran in June, Tehran and Washington held five rounds of nuclear talks but faced major stumbling blocks such as uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, which western powers want to bring down to zero. </p>

  <p>“My administration is actively supporting the new president of Lebanon and his mission to permanently disarm Hezbollah’s… brigades.”</p> 
  <p>Israel has continued to launch strikes on Lebanon <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/27/israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-begins-biden-lebanon-iran">despite a 2024 ceasefire with Hezbollah</a>, which states only UN peacekeepers and the Lebanese army should be deployed in southern Lebanon.</p> 
  <p>Israel accuses Hezbollah of trying to rebuild its capabilities after the group suffered heavy losses during the war.</p> 
  <p>Earlier this month, the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, called for renewed efforts to bring a permanent end to hostilities in Lebanon. He said that until the end of September, they have verified 103 civilians killed in Lebanon since the ceasefire.</p> 
  <p>The Lebanese government first aimed to disarm Hezbollah by the end of the year, but officials later said resources are too limited to meet the deadline. The current aim is to fully clear a stretch along the Lebanon-Israel border, defined as south of the Litani river, by the end of November before moving into further phases.</p>

  <p>The US president is expected to say countries working together toward peace under the Gaza ceasefire agreement represents an “incredible triumph for Israel and the world”.</p> 
  <p>In excerpts from the speech, being reported by Reuters, Trump will say that Israel “has won all that can be won by force of arms”.</p> 
  <p>He will add that it is time to translate what he will described as “victories against terrorists” into peace and prosperity for the Middle East.</p> 
  <p>Israel has been left hugely isolated on the international stage because of its military conduct during its devastating war on Gaza, which was fuelled by US weaponry provided by both the Biden and Trump administrations.</p> 
  <p>More than 67,000 Palestinian people have been killed by Israeli attacks since the war began, according to the territory’s health ministry, most of them civilians.</p> 
  <p>Much of the territory has been reduced to rubble and its infrastructure destroyed by relentless Israeli aerial bombardments.</p> 
  <p>International arrest warrants against Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, are in effect, and the UN’s highest court is considering allegations of genocide brought by South Africa.</p>

  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said from Air Force One en route to Israel that the Gaza peace deal “could be the biggest thing I was ever involved in”, Axios is reporting.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/13/trump-israel-gaza-war-hostages-ceasefire-biggest-deal?utm_medium=organic_social&amp;utm_source=x&amp;utm_campaign=editorial">US news outlet</a> said that, when asked what Trump’s message to the Israeli people would be in the speech, the US president said: “Love and peace for eternity.”</p> 
  <p>Trump said he had watched parts of a Saturday rally for the hostages in Tel Aviv whose speakers included his daughter <strong>Ivanka Trump</strong>, son-in-law <strong>Jared Kushner</strong> and envoy <strong>Steve Witkoff</strong>, the report continued, and had spoken to the three about it afterwards.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It was an incredible rally. It was a great thing. Everybody is thrilled.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The Axios report said Trump sounded enthusiastic about the global leaders’ meeting to be held later on Monday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, aimed at formally ending the Gaza war as the ceasefire enters its fourth day.</p> 
  <p>He said the range of countries that would be in attendance signalled the world was united around his peace plan.</p> 
  <p>Trump said he didn’t know why Israeli prime minister <strong>Benjamin Netanyahu</strong> wasn’t expected to attend, noting that the Egyptian hosts handled the guest list, the report continued.</p> 
  <p>But Trump said he thought it was good that Palestinian president <strong>Mahmoud Abbas</strong> would attend.</p>

  <p>The summit’s aim is “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East and usher in a new era of regional security and stability”, according to Egypt’s presidency.</p> 
  <p>The impressive aims of the meeting are matched by a similarly impressive guest list, many of whom have played a vital role in securing the ceasefire and hostage release deal now in place.</p> 
  <p>The continuing success of the agreement – and how closely the next stages match up to Trump’s 20-point peace plan – are all expected to be up for discussions at Monday’s summit.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump questions if Blair will be part of Gaza peace team</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has questioned whether former UK prime minister <strong>Tony Blair</strong> will serve on a new “board of peace” that is intended to oversee the governance of <strong>Gaza.</strong></p> 
  <p>The US president’s comments come amid ongoing criticisms of Blair for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/30/fatal-flaws-analysts-cast-doubt-on-tony-blair-plan-for-future-of-gaza">his role</a> in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/iraq-war-20-years-on">Iraq war</a> that began in 2003.</p> 
  <p>“I’ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he’s an acceptable choice to everybody,” Trump said, without naming specific leaders who could be weighing in on his choice of Blair, Reuters is reporting.</p> 
  <p>The Gaza peace plan floated by the White House last month listed Blair as a member of the proposed board.</p> 
  <p>Trump made his remarks to reporters aboard Air Force One during his flight to Israel, where he is scheduled to address its parliament on Monday.</p> 
  <p>Trump is also set to attend a world leaders’ summit in Egypt aimed at formally ending the Gaza war, as the ceasefire enters its fourth day.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Donald Trump is en route to the Middle East after telling reporters the “war is over” and that he expects the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to hold. </p> 
  <p>The US president will meet families of the hostages in Israel before flying to Egypt for a “peace summit”.</p> 
  <p>It will be an eventful day. In Israel, families of the 20 remaining living hostages are preparing to welcome them home. Later on Monday, Israel will release about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. After that, the remains of some of the hostages who have died in Gaza are expected to be repatriated.</p>
