There’s a lot of good players and it’s up to the coaches to decide, but it was good to play today and show what I can do,” she said. “It was incredible and something I’ll remember for the rest of my life, so it’s very big.” <strong>Reuters</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-687033ee8f08ed9c6fb4bf7b" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-10T21:44:51.390Z">10.44pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Thank you for joining me for this match.</strong> Signe Gaupset gave her coaches something to think about before the quarter-final with two goals and two assists after Norway finished the group stage with three wins from three.
