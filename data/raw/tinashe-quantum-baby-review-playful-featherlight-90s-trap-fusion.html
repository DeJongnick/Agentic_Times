<p>TikTok remains a predictably unpredictable cultural randomiser. The latest career beneficiary of its supercharger fairy dust is US R&amp;B singer <a href="https://www.tinashenow.com/home">Tinashe</a> – more than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-s7TCuCpB5c">a decade in the game</a> – whose recent track Nasty <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/why-is-tinashe-nasty-going-viral.html">went viral</a> when a fan paired it with a reel of a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/tinashe-nasty-viral-dance-quantum-baby.html">bespectacled British man hip-swivelling to soca</a>. There’s a whiff of vindication here. In 2019, the genre-straddling but unhappy singer left her major label after a protracted battle to release 2018’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/15/tinashe-joyride-album-review-kitty-empire">Joyride</a></em>. (Tinashe’s last albums have been independently or self-released.)</p> <p><em><a href="https://symphony.to/tinashe/quantum-baby">Quantum Baby</a></em><em>’s</em> title chimes with the unpredictable nature of both subatomic particles and social media blessings. Its contents, though, are pretty reliable, if a little lower-key than its standout, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrjESdPsLxE">Nasty</a>, advertises. Like its predecessor, <em>BB/Ang3l</em> (2023, seven tracks), <em>Quantum Baby</em> is short (eight tracks) and simultaneously playful, featherlight and nagging, a fusion of 90s signifiers with modern-era trap beats and silvery production choices.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/aug/16/identifying-as-underrated-not-healthy-tinashe-on-staging-the-pop-comeback-of-the-year">‘Identifying as underrated isn’t healthy’: Tinashe on staging the pop comeback of the year</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No Broke Boys is <em>Quantum’</em>s most obvious Nasty bedfellow, with a tough-girl sing-song chorus. Most other tracks slink their way to the low-lit bedroom (When I Get You Alone). The restless Getting No Sleep, though, is the most emblematic of this cult R&amp;B creator: it’s electronic pop, with R&amp;B attitude and a shuffle of drum’n’bass; the video nods to how Tinashe put self-love first. </p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKj94nNuQkk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gKj94nNuQkk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKj94nNuQkk">Watch the video for Getting No Sleep by Tinashe.</a></figcaption> </figure>
