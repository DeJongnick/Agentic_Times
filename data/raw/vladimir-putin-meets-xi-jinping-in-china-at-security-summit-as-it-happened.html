 <h2 class="block-title">Investigation launched into ‘horrific murder’ of Ukrainian politician in Lviv</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A Ukrainian former parliamentary speaker was shot dead in Lviv on Saturday, authorities said, as European foreign ministers met to discuss increasing pressure on Moscow to end its war against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>Andriy Parubiy</strong>, a member of parliament who served as parliamentary speaker from 2016 to 2019 and a key figure in Ukraine’s 2013 pro-European Maidan revolution, was shot dead, prosecutors said. </p> 
  <p>A murder investigation has been launched and the president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/volodymyr-zelenskiy">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a>, condemned the killing as a “horrific murder”.</p> 
  <p>Europe’s foreign ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss possible measures to force Moscow to the negotiating table. Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said that Russia was “clearly not preparing for peace”.</p> 
  <p>“The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/eu">European Union</a> and all the member states support the diplomatic efforts to achieve peace and the end of Russia’s war. But it’s clear that Russia is not preparing for peace. It is the opposite: they are preparing for more war,” she said. Ministers also discussed the war in Gaza and the deepening humanitarian crisis there.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Following a meeting with Ukraine’s top general, <strong>Oleksandr Syrsky</strong>, Ukrainian President <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> said that his country’s forces are planning new strikes deep into Russia.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1962094455181160741">In a post on X</a>, the Ukrainian leader wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We analysed in detail the situation in the Zaporizhzhia direction and the enemy’s intentions. Also the situation in the border areas of the Sumy and Kharkiv regions.</em></p> 
   <p><em>We will continue our active operations in exactly the way needed for Ukraine’s defence. The forces and resources are prepared. New deep strikes have also been planned.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Russia launched a deadly attack across Ukraine overnight on Saturday when a five-storey residential building was hit in <strong>Zaporizhzhia</strong>.</p> 
  <p>In his X post, Zelenskyy said that the Russian army is “concentrating its greatest efforts” in <strong>Pokrovsk</strong>, a strategically important logistics hub and mining town in eastern Ukraine that was once considered the safest place in the Donbas.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy said Russia is suffering heavy losses in the area, and claimed that, overall, more than 290,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or severely injured in fighting across the frontline since the start of the year.</p> 
  <p>“The majority of these losses were sustained precisely in the Donetsk region, while failing to achieve any of their strategic objectives,” he wrote.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy recently warned that Russia was massing a force of 100,000 troops near the mining town which Moscow has been trying to capture for more than two years.</p>

  <p>The Kremlin said that European powers were hindering US President Donald Trump’s efforts to achieve peace in Ukraine and that Russia would continue its operation in Ukraine until Moscow saw signs that Kyiv was ready for peace.</p> 
  <p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media reporters that the “European party of war” was continuing to hinder US and Russian efforts on Ukraine. “We are ready to resolve the problem by political and diplomatic means,” Peskov said. “But so far we do not see reciprocity from Kyiv in this. So we shall continue the special military operation.”</p> 
  <p>European powers say that they do not believe Putin wants peace in Ukraine. Putin has repeatedly said he is ready to discuss peace but that Russia will not give up any of the land that it has taken in Ukraine.</p>

  <p>At an emergency meeting of the UN security council on Friday, the US warned Russia to move toward some sort of peace settlement and meet with Ukraine or face possible sanctions.</p> 
  <p>The meeting was called after a major Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight from Wednesday to Thursday that killed more than 20 people.</p> 
  <p>John Kelley, the US mission’s minister-counselor, said the airstrikes “cast doubt on the seriousness of Russia’s desire for peace” and demanded they stop. He said Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy must agree to meet, and reiterated Donald Trump’s warning that the US could impose sanctions on Russia if the war continues.</p> 
  <p>Despite months of diplomatic efforts, Putin has repeatedly ignored Trump’s calls to end the fighting. The “America First” Trump administration has not taken any tangible steps to pressure Russia into stopping its attacks, but has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/us-military-aid-ukraine-pause-trump-zelenskyy-updates">paused intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv at various points</a>.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Senior White House officials have accused some European leaders of prolonging Russia’s war in Ukraine by convincing Volodymyr Zelenskyy to hold out for a better deal with Moscow, <a href="http://axios.com/2025/08/30/trump-accuse-european-leaders-prolong-ukraine-war">Axios is reporting</a>.</p> 
  <p>The officials, frustrated by the lack of progress since the Putin-Trump talks in Alaska two weeks ago, said some European leaders are pushing Ukraine to hold out for unrealistic territorial concessions by Russia.</p> 
  <p>“The Europeans don’t get to prolong this war and backdoor unreasonable expectations, while also expecting America to bear the cost,” a senior White House official told Axios.</p> 
  <p>“If Europe wants to escalate this war, that will be up to them. But they will be hopelessly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.”</p> 
  <p>Axios did not specify what countries the US officials were referring to but the outlet was told that it was not the UK or France, who set up the “coalition of the willing”, a loose partnership of western countries pledging support for Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Donald Trump has indicated he wants a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy, but while the Ukrainian leader has shown his readiness, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/aug/22/ukraine-war-latest-updates-zelenskyy-putin-trump-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68a856788f088233182d415a#block-68a856788f088233182d415a">the Kremlin has held back</a> and intensified attacks on Ukraine despite international diplomatic efforts to bring the war to an end.</p>

  <p>The Guardian’s Russian affairs reporter, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pjotr-sauer">Pjotr Sauer</a>, has written a piece about Putin’s trip and what it may mean for the war in Ukraine. Here is an extract <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/30/vladimir-putin-china-visit-xi-jinping-ukraine">of his story</a>: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Key on the agenda, analysts say, will be for Putin and Xi to align their positions on the war in Ukraine amid US efforts to end the fighting. “It is an important time for them to talk about where the war is headed and how likely it is to be stopped in the near future,” said Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Gabuev said Moscow wanted to know whether it could expect any further assistance from China and how Beijing would respond if the US were to ask it to put pressure on Russia to end the fighting…</em></p> 
   <p><em>China has emerged as an economic lifeline for Russia during the war in Ukraine, and Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China’s direct aiding of Moscow’s war effort.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Bilateral trade climbed to more than $240bn last year, two-thirds higher than before the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Beijing is now the leading buyer of Russian oil and coal and will shortly surpass Europe as Moscow’s main market for natural gas…</em></p> 
   <p><em>The talks are also likely to touch on deepening military cooperation between Beijing and Moscow, a development that has alarmed western governments.</em></p> 
   <p><em>While China has stopped short of providing direct military aid, US officials say Beijing has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/china-north-korea-russia-ukraine-indo-pacific-security">supplied</a> about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the semiconductors Russia needs to rebuild its war machine. In return, China is believed to be receiving assistance in sensitive defence technologies.</em></p> 
   <p><em>China claims it is a neutral mediator in the war in Ukraine, but the two countries have pulled closer together since the start of the invasion.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> and Indian prime minister <strong>Narendra Modi</strong> are among the more than 20 world leaders attending <strong>the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</strong> (SCO) summit, which is being held in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin.</p> 
  <p>The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus – with 16 more countries affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”. The China and Russia-led regional security grouping is trying to rebalance global power in their favour and away from the US.</p> 
  <p>Putin, who is wanted for war crimes by the international criminal court, arrived in Tianjin on Sunday to a red carpet welcome and warm greetings from top-ranking city officials.</p> 
  <p>During his trip, which is expected to stretch to close to a week, the Russian president will hold talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping, his close ally, and watch Beijing’s Victory Day military parade marking 80 years since Japan’s defeat in the second world war, where Putin is due to be the star guest alongside North Korea’s Kim Jong-un and leaders of Iran and Cuba.</p> 
  <p>Kim and Putin signed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/19/russia-and-north-korea-sign-mutual-defence-pact">mutual defence pact last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/28/north-korea-troops-fighting-for-russia-ukraine-confirmed-kim-jong-un">North Korea confirmed</a> this April that it had deployed soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine to fight alongside Russian troops.</p> 
  <p>Putin has turned to Beijing for trade and political support since his full-scale invasion of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> was launched in February 2022. China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>. Ukraine’s armed forces said on Sunday that Russian forces failed to gain full control of any major Ukrainian city over the summer. </p> 
  <p>The chief of Russia’s general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Saturday that since March Russia had captured more than 3,500 square km (1,351 square miles) of territory in Ukraine and taken control of 149 villages.</p> 
  <p>“Despite Gerasimov’s claims, Russian forces have not gained full control over any major city,” the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said. “The figures presented by the occupiers regarding captured territories and settlements are grossly exaggerated.”</p> 
  <p>We have not yet been able to independently verify any of these claims. Ukraine acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that Russia’s army <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/27/ukraine-war-briefing-russian-troops-inside-dnipropetrovsk-region-ukraine-says">had entered the Dnipropetrovsk region</a>, a central administrative area previously spared from intense fighting. </p> 
  <p>Russian forces have slowly gained ground in costly battles for largely devastated areas in eastern and southern Ukraine, normally with few inhabitants or intact buildings left.</p>
