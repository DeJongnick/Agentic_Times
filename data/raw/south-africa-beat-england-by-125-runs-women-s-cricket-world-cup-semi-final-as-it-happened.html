Losing the toss wasn’t the worst thing in the world – we’d have bowled too but I think it turned out all right. </p> <p>I didn’t know if we had enough runs as it was a pretty flat wicket. Kappy was phenomenal. As long as Nat was there it looked like it go either way so we were really happy to get her out.</p> <p>[On Marizanne Kapp] She was so special.

We weren’t at our best and to beat the best teams you need to put a whole game together. We didn’t do that and we’re hugely disappointed. It’ll take a bit of time to sink in.</p> <p>[On the last 10 overs of SA’s innings] Laura Wolvaardt had the best of the conditions, she knew what she was doing and she took advantage. We stuck at it, we didn’t let the occasion get to us in the field. </p> <p>[On the start to England’s innings] Kappy bowled some brilliant deliveries. It’s not ideal losing three very quick wickets and that made the chase very difficult. </p> <p>[On England’s World Cup overall] We’ve come a long way since the summer and we’ve learned a lot about ourselves. This will hurt but hopefully in time we’ll be able to take the learnings from it and move forward.

When somebody gets 160-odd and somebody gets five-for, you’re not gonna be on the winning side too many times. I think the players put everything into today and it wasn’t to be for us.</p> <p>[On haemorrhaging runs in the last 10 overs] That’s happened a few times and it’s an area we need to address. There was some good hitting and it can be hard to restrict someone who’s got 160 on a really good wicket. Credit to South Africa.</p> <p>[Could you have played another seamer given the red soil?] Hindsight’s a wonderful thing. That combination has served us really well throughout the comp. At times we just didn’t hit our straps today; those last 10 overse really cost us.</p> <p>I came into the role and I knew it wouldn’t change overnight. Some really positive things have come out of this trip, and I think we’ve performed a little bit better under pressure, but there are also certain moments we haven’t seized. That’s an ongoing thing.</p> <p>Overall we are making progress and I think that’s the most important thing, but ultimately you’re defined by results and today we’re going out of a World Cup at the semi-final stage. I’m a winner. I don’t like losing. But equally I knew what I took on with this role; I knew it wouldn’t be a quick fix.</p> <p>This makes me more hungry to go home and work with these players over the winter period. Some players will be going to the Big Bash but there will be a group of players training from December through to March. We’ve got camps in Oman and South Africa where we’ll spend time with these players and upskill them. That’s exciting for me. We’ve targeted 13-15 players who we’re going to work really hard with.</p> <p>We won’t make any rash decisions but we’ve got to look to the future. We’ve got some unbelievable talent coming through.</p> <p>It’ll be a sad dressing-room. I don’t think I’ll say too much tonight; there isn’t much you can say that will make things better. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-29T16:29:27.848Z">at 4.29pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-69023c4b8f08230808242ef8" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-29T16:13:50.881Z">4.13pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Laura Wolvaardt’s reaction</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It still feels a bit unreal.

You want someone to be who they are, she is as a captain what she is as a human being. I thought I learnt more about her in the India game by the way she kept her team in that game, the way she chose the 49th and 50th overs, the fielding.
