We do have an inflationary issue globally. It’s a global issue, it’s due to supply chains, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and it’s all in the aftermath of the global pandemic. But what the secretary of treasury had to say in evidence before senate estimates is that the energy price relief package will make a material difference to reducing cost of living pressures, that’s right, that’s all they have to say. Philip Lowe, the RBA governor, similarly referred to in his address to the Financial Review business Summit on the 8 March, again, also referred to what was happening with high inflation, he said there is that of the high inflation that we are currently experiencing is one of the legacies of the pandemic and of rushes in vision of Ukraine. The pandemic interrupted the supply side of the global economy and pushed up cost some prices. But on top of this, the monetary and fiscal policy response to the pandemic has also pushed up costs and prices. There, he was referring to the last budget, the last budget of the former government in March where the considerable money was pumped into the economy and all ended as soon as people voted in May that considerable increase also had an impact as well, not according to me, according to the RBA governor.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2023-03-20T04:02:18.412Z">at 4.02am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6417d9148f086bbc85010989" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2023-03-20T03:55:05.387Z">3.55am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Aukus will be great for skills and training.

By 2020, it was 45% of our GDP and just one practical example of what that means is that in the 1990s we had eight oil refineries producing most of our petrol onshore, today, with only two oil refineries, we import most of our petrol from overseas and indeed import most of it from just one country.</p> <p>And so Australia has always needed a long-range submarine capability and the Collins class has been and continues to be a highly effective capability but even as we seek to evolve it and extend its life, the fact that every few days it is required to surface in order to recharge its batteries is an act which, in the 2030s, will become increasingly detectable and that means the capability will be increasingly diminished.</p> <p>… Now obviously this capability has the capacity to operate during a conflict but it’s true intent is to provide for the peace and the stability of our region because the defence of Australia doesn’t really mean that much without the collective security of our region and the maintenance of the rules-based order upon which we increasingly depend.</p> <p>Over the last few months, particularly over the last few weeks, we’ve been engaged in an intensive effort in explaining our strategic intent to our neighbours in the Pacific and in south-east Asia and since our announcement on Monday, I think there reaction demonstrates the genuine appreciation they have the transparency that we have shown but also an understanding of why Australia is making the decision that we are.</p> <p>Because at the end of the day, Australia’s future nuclear-powered submarines represent our contribution to the peace and stability of our region and of the world.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2023-03-20T03:29:18.682Z">at 3.29am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6417ce778f086bbc85010938" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2023-03-20T03:12:03.040Z">3.12am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Sussan Ley</strong> to <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>:</p> <p>Tomorrow marks 10 months since the 2022 election.

This is partly because Labor is now the government and the FWC is independent. And it is also partly because with inflation, all of these things have become a lot more tricky.</p> <p>How tricky? Where here is the whole transcript between <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> and <strong>Katy Gallagher</strong> this morning, where the finance minister talked around the fact that she was not saying anything:</p> <p><strong>PK:</strong> Now back home, there’s reporting the major unions will make submissions to the Fair Work Commission to increase the minimum wage and award wages by more than 7% to match inflation. Last year, you supported a 5% minimum wage increase to match inflation – should it be bumped up again?</p> <p><strong>KG:</strong> We’ll be making a submission to the annual wage review in the next few weeks, I think it’s required but …</p> <p><strong>PK:</strong> Do you think 7% seems reasonable?</p> <p><strong>KG:</strong> Well, I’ll leave that for the unions. We, last year, didn’t put a pay figure on it. I think we made the argument that, particularly low-paid workers, you know, we wouldn’t want to see them go backwards, but we left it to the Commission.</p> <p><strong>PK:</strong> So, let me put this to you. Do you still not, is that your position, that you don’t want to see them go backwards?</p> <p><strong>KG:</strong> We would want to make, I think for, particularly for low-income workers, we want to make sure that, you know, they are getting sustainable and affordable pay rises. And you’ll see our submission provided through that wage case in the next couple of weeks.</p> <p><strong>PK:</strong> So, I’m gonna ask it again, politely. Will you put in a submission that says that they shouldn’t go backwards?</p> <p><strong>KG:</strong> Well, we’re currently finalising that submission, Patricia so …</p> <p><strong>PK:</strong> So you’re not wedded to that language?</p> <p><strong>KG: </strong>Well, no, I think we’ve made it clear since coming into government that we want to see wages moving, we have been particularly concerned about the lowest paid. And, of course, with the cost of living pressures that are on people now, that has an impact. What their wage increase has, has an impact on their living standards. So you will see a submission from us that goes through the detail about you know, what we see as the government as important, and then the Fair Work Commission makes the decision. But we didn’t put a figure on it last year. I don’t expect we will put a figure on it this year.</p> <p><strong>PK: </strong>No, but you did talk about not going backwards, and that means keeping up with inflation. So that’s my key question. Do you think you should keep up with inflation for this lowest for these lowest-paid workers?</p> <p><strong>KG: </strong>We want to see low-income workers get a good pay rise, you’ll see our submission. The submission hasn’t been finalised, PK. I think it’s fair that we are able to finalise that submission through our processes, and then …</p> <p><strong>PK: </strong>It does seem like a different, with respect, minister, it sounds like a different position to the one that was taken during the election campaign, where the prime minister use that word, ‘absolutely’, about them not going backwards.</p> <p><strong>KG: </strong>Well, we will finalise our submission. I mean, in a unusual or difficult position where that submission hasn’t been finalised. We support wage increases, particularly for low-income workers. You’ve seen that since the beginning of this government, you won’t see that change. We will continue to argue for that. But the final, the submission needs to be finalised and go through our processes.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2023-03-20T01:00:43.834Z">at 1.00am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6417aba38f086bbc8501088a" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2023-03-20T00:43:36.171Z">12.43am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Government moves to categorise IRGC as terrorists</strong></p> <p>Over in the house, <strong>Karen Andrews</strong> is moving a motion calling on the government to formally categorise the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRCG) as an organisation involved in, supporting and facilitating terrorism.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>In my former role as minister for home affairs, I oversaw the listing of the entirety of Hamas, the Base, and Hezbollah as terrorist organisations.

Senator <strong>Jordon Steele-John</strong> wants to move a motion to say the Senate recognises that “in 2003, Australia was a part of a United States-led coalition which illegally invaded the sovereign nation of Iraq – with catastrophic consequences for Iraq and the broader region”.</p> <p>The motion, if passed, would also urge “the Australian Parliament and government to learn the lessons of the past and to never again be dragged into another country’s unjust war of aggression” and call for “the withdrawal of ADF personnel still deployed to Iraq today under Operation Okra and Operation Accordion”.</p> <p>The government said it would not support the suspension of standing orders, saying there were other opportunities to debate the matter. <strong>Murray Watt</strong>, for the government, said the Greens were not alone in opposing the Iraq war at the time; Watt pointed to Labor’s position elaborated by then leader <strong>Simon Crean</strong> in 2003. Watt also said the government’s decision to enter into the Aukus arrangement was a sovereign decision and added that any decision to deploy those submarine capabilities in future would also be a sovereign decision for Australia.</p> <p>The Coalition’s <strong>Simon Birmingham</strong> said there were lessons learned but he also said <strong>Saddam Hussein</strong> had been a brutal dictator. Birmingham said the Iraqi people did now have “more say over their future”.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2023-03-19T23:32:12.603Z">at 11.32pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-641798a18f089504f3597e51" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/benita-kolovos"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2023-03-19T23:20:44.864Z">11.20pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Victorian Liberal leader speaks to reporters over move to expel Moira Deeming from party</strong></p> <p>The Victorian opposition leader, <strong>John Pesutto</strong>, is holding a press conference after he announced last night he will move to expel MP <strong>Moira Deeming</strong> from the parliamentary Liberal party due to her involvement in an anti-trans protest attended by a neo-Nazi group.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I have not taken this decision lightly but the events which were brought to my attention over the weekend, not far from where we stand, there was a protest which attracted Nazis on the steps of this magnificent parliament.

First, there’s the referendum (machinery provisions) amendment bill, which basically sets the rules for the referendum – things like polling places, donation disclosures and pre-polls. That’s gone through the lower house and is in the Senate, where the Coalition is currently planning to oppose it unless the government legislates for millions in public funding for the Yes and No campaigns.</p> <p>Labor and the Liberals are in negotiations there, which the special minister of state, <strong>Don Farrell</strong>, was tight-lipped about in an interview on Sunday, only saying he wanted the opposition to give some “goodwill” to the changes. The crossbench has a bunch of amendments already proposed. The bill is listed first up in the Senate today, and Farrell says he is hopeful it will pass by Tuesday.</p> <p>Then, separately, the government is currently planning to introduce a constitutional amendment bill into the parliament next week. This bill is the main game for the referendum, which will outline the proposed question to go on the ballot paper, and the exact wording of the proposed constitutional amendment. As we reported last week, this is contingent on final advice from the government’s referendum working group arriving and then being considered by the cabinet, likely next week.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/17/linda-burney-insists-there-is-no-division-after-indigenous-voice-working-group-failed-to-finalise-advise">Linda Burney insists ‘there is no division’ with Indigenous voice working group yet to finalise advice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government wants to introduce the amendment bill next week so they can send it off to a parliamentary inquiry, which will run for a few months, in anticipation of voting on the bill in June. That timeline is important because the government has pegged the October-December window as their preferred timing for the referendum.</p> <p>Quirks in the referendum legislation compel the government to hold the vote between three and six months after passing an amendment bill; so, counting backwards, the government would need to pass the bill in June to have a vote in October.</p> <p>So basically the government wants a lot of the referendum legislation dealt with in this fortnight. Keep all this in mind as the next two weeks unfold.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2023-03-19T23:18:41.529Z">at 11.18pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-641793038f086bbc85010806" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2023-03-19T23:08:00.198Z">11.08pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Greens and Labor may find compromises on safeguard mechanism</strong></p> <p>As the negotiations for the safeguard legislation reach the sticky end, you will hear a lot from Labor MPs not directly involved with the negotiations talking about 2019 and the CPRS.</p> <p>It’s an old fight and a very, very well trodden path from Labor.

The emails alert principals to contact employee support services.</p> <p>It was an 18.7 percentage point jump on the alerts compared with the previous year.</p> <p>The risk was highest among special school principals, with 56.3% triggering red flag emails in 2022.

Forty-four per cent of principals have been subjected to physical violence – the highest figure recorded since the survey began in 2011.</p> <p>ACU investigator and former principal <strong>Dr Paul Kidson </strong>said school leaders were now 11 times more at risk of experiencing physical violence in their workplace than the general population.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>Our research shows abuse and intimidation towards principals and the associated health risks suffered by school leaders continues to grow and it must stop.
