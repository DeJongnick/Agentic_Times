<p>Rowan McCabe’s positive piece about the power of poems (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/17/toured-uk-council-estates-poems-poetry">I toured UK council estates and learned this: all our lives are poems just waiting to be written, 17 September</a>) might inspire readers to check out their local spoken-word poetry open-mic events. At these, anyone can perform their work to highly enthusiastic, supportive and multi-generational audiences, and, of course, listen to other poets’ work.</p> <p>This form of poetry gives everyone a voice, is 100% inclusive, and a million kilometres away from the common assumption that poetry is an outdated, inaccessible literary form written by dead white men. The open mic is truly democratic – you can be the poet laureate or a first-timer, you still get five minutes. An online search for “spoken-word poetry open mic” will provide local listings. Please try&nbsp;it – it changed my life!<br><strong>Max Terry Fishel</strong><br><em>Bromley, London</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
