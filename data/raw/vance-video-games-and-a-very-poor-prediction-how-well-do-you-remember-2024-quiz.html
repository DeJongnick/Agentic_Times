    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - Quayle’s book didn’t sell like a hot potatoe, 2:A - Or name a local representative for the company. Though the backdrop, as the Guardian reported, was a long-running and politically charged battle between Musk and Brazil’s top court, which was trying to combat the dissemination of far-right misinformation and anti-democratic content. A supreme court judge lifted the ban in October., 3:A - Judo legend Riner’s fourth gold medal, in&nbsp;the +100kg final was one of the moments of the games. Sprinter Pérec won three golds at the 1992 and 1996 Games., 4:E - The US triumphed in a super over. Writing in the Guardian, Mark Ramprakash called it “an upset for the ages”. , 5:B - Sheinbaum contributed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The other old jobs are those of other election winners this year – Donald Trump, Keir Starmer and new Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian. Finnish president Alexander Stubb left a golf scholarship in the US to focus on politics. , 6:B - Boringly, the security firm CrowdStrike distributed a&nbsp;faulty update to its Falcon Sensor security software. It was fixed within a few hours. , 7:E - But let’s not rule it out. Willy’s Chocolate Experience also inspired a Jimmy Kimmel Live! spoof starring Freddie Highmore and a barbed comment from Keir Starmer in the&nbsp;Commons. , 8:B - It’s Rodney (you plonkers)., 9:D - Released in 1994, Theme Park sold several million copies and won a Golden Joystick award. The game set players the task of building a successful theme park in the UK with just a few thousand pounds and a small plot of land. , 10:A - Computer systems engineering. Badenoch also did a master’s in the same subject before beginning her career as a software engineer. Fun, related, fact: she once admitted using these skills to hack Harriet Harman’s website to “say nice things about the Tories”. She apologised for the prank in 2018., 11:E - Demand was so high to follow the path of the eclipse, in which 32 million people were in&nbsp;the path of totality, that Delta added a second flight, though, as the Washington Post reported, “a glimpse of totality proved elusive for many of the people who had reserved a spot”. , 12:B - Donald Trump’s nominee to run America’s health system was beset by a series of bizarre animal-related stories during his abortive run for the White House. They include an investigation he beheaded a whale in 1994 (denied) and accusations, that he dumped a road-killed bear in central Manhattan (admitted) and allegations that he was photographed eating a barbecued dog (says it was a goat). , 13:C - The kingdom had, alongside Argentina, been due to join the alliance at the start of the year. Argentina pulled out after the election of Javier Milei in 2023; the Saudis are still considering joining. No one is yet calling it BRICSEESUI, sadly. , 14:B - Other crafts to complete the epic journey to the moon in 2024 were Japan’s Slim and China’s Chang’e-6. , 15:C - Trump’s tour of the pods was credited in part with his victory. Immigration hardliner Stephen Miller doesn’t have a podcast, but has been named as Trump’s deputy chief of policy. , 16:C - The&nbsp;Gallaghers will in fact play Croke Park, the home of the Gaelic Athletic Association, on 16-17 August. Liam Gallagher, whose parents are both Irish, is a fan of the Gaelic games, tweeting in 2020: “Gaelic football rules better than the shit I’ve been watching in the PL recently pure passion.”, 17:A - Palmer was one of the five (out of five) successful penalty scorers in the quarter-final penalty shootout win against Switzerland. Rio Ferdinand was among the voices hailing the success of the scorers, who all have Black heritage, after the racist abuse targeted at Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka after their misses in 2021. One of the other scorers, Jude Bellingham was one of five members of the England squad who could have played for Ireland. , 18:A - The then-Tory party chair faced criticism for landing a last-minute safe seat in Essex, having been the MP for North West Durham since 2019. It wasn’t that safe, though. Holden won by just 20 votes. Mak held on to his seat by 92&nbsp;votes, Hunt by 891, Cleverly and Badenoch by a relatively comfortable 3,670&nbsp;and 2,610, respectively. , 19:D - After Trump’s victory, Stewart clarified (as if it were needed … ): “For the record – I was completely wrong about Kamala Harris. It is heartbreaking that Trump is now the president.” , 20:B - It’s worth revisiting the full quote: “They were no-playing motherfuckers. Paul was the worst bass player I ever heard. And Ringo? Don’t even talk about it. I remember once we were in the studio with George Martin, and Ringo had taken three hours for a four-bar thing he was trying to fix on a song. He couldn’t get it.” </p>
