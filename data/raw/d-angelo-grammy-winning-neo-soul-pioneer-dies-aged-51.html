<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/d-angelo">D’Angelo</a>, the Grammy-winning R&amp;B singer who helped pioneer the sound of neo-soul, has died. He was 51.</p>

<p>“The shining star of our family has dimmed his light for us in this life … After a prolonged and courageous battle with cancer, we are heartbroken to announce that Michael D’Angelo Archer, known to his fans around the world as D’Angelo, has been called home, departing this life today, October 14th, 2025,” his family said in a statement. “We are saddened that he can only leave dear memories with his family, but we are eternally grateful for the legacy of extraordinarily moving music he leaves behind. We ask that you respect our privacy during this difficult time but invite you all join us in mourning his passing while also celebrating the gift of song that he has left for the world.”</p> 
<p>D’Angelo burst on to the scene in 1995 with his debut album Brown Sugar, which married classic R&amp;B melodies with the sounds of hip-hop and notched his first Top 10 single with Lady. His follow-up album, the 2000 classic Voodoo, solidified his status as one of the fathers of the stripped-down, hearty sounds of neo-soul. He was as influential as he was elusive, not releasing a follow-up to Voodoo until late 2014, with his third and final album Black Messiah.</p> 
<p>D’Angelo won four Grammys over the course of his career, including best R&amp;B album for Voodoo in 2001 and for Black Messiah in 2016. He also won for best R&amp;B song in 2016 for Really Love and best R&amp;B vocal performance for Untitled (How Does It Feel), whose music video – in which the singer appeared seemingly unclothed against a stark black background – turned D’Angelo into an international sex symbol in the early 2000s.</p> 
<p>Born and raised in Richmond, Virginia, D’Angelo gravitated toward music at an early age. He began playing piano at the age of three, playing in the church alongside his father, who was a Pentecostal minister. He continued to perform locally in a variety of groups, including Three of a Kind, Michael Archer and Precise, and Intelligent, Deadly but Unique (IDU).</p> 
<p>He signed with the record label EMI in 1993, at the age of 19. The following year, he scored his breakout hit when he co-wrote and co-produced the 1994 song U Will Know for the R&amp;B supergroup Black Men United, featuring Usher, Brian McKnight, R Kelly, Boyz II Men, Raphael Saadiq and Gerald Levert. Following the slow-burn success of Brown Sugar, D’Angelo struggled with writer’s block and the pressures of fame, often taking long breaks from the spotlight.</p> 
<p>D’Angelo is survived by three children. The mother of his eldest son, soul singer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/mar/03/angie-stone-obituary">Angie Stone</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/mar/01/soul-singer-angie-stone-dies-in-a-car-crash-at-63">died</a> earlier this year in a car crash at the age of 63.</p> 
<p>Shortly after news of his death, former collaborators and artists influenced by his music paid tribute on social media.</p> 
<p>“Say it ain’t so, but we just lost a friend, a creator &amp; legend, D’Angelo,” <a href="https://x.com/Bootsy_Collins/status/1978141821105496308">wrote</a> Bootsy Collins on X.</p> 
<p>Writing on X, singer Doja Cat <a href="https://x.com/DojaCat/status/1978140862207885343">praised</a> D’Angelo as “a true voice of soul and inspiration to many brilliant artists of our generation and generations to come”.</p> 
<p>Singer-songwriter Jill Scott also paid tribute to the king of neo-soul: “I never met D’Angelo but I love him, respect him, admire his gift,” she <a href="https://x.com/missjillscott/status/1978136729098871054">wrote</a> on X. “This loss HURTS!! Love to my family that are family to him. I’m so sorry. R.I.P. GENIUS.</p> 
<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPy7zteANzP/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=fa12f8f5-3e40-4ba8-b18c-21247754bc9a">lengthy post</a> on Instagram, Tyler, the Creator, recalled buying a copy of Voodoo for his ninth birthday. “I couldn’t understand how someone could write something so simple but personal but broad but genius,” he wrote. “That’s how special he was. A savant. A true alien. I am so lucky to have gotten my copy of VOODOO when I did. We are so lucky to have been alive to enjoy his art. My musical DNA was helped shaped by this man. Forever grateful. Safe travels.”</p> 
<p>Flea, the bassist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, called D’Angelo “one of my all time favorites whose records I went to again and again” in an Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPy_VJMEe6z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=b8f60d97-e7c0-4749-82bf-06d5596b7de6">post</a>.</p> 
<p>“No one did anything funkier over the last 30 years,” he said. “I never knew him but humbled myself before his music. What a rare and beautiful voice and an inimitable approach to songwriting. What a musician!!! He changed the course of popular music. Fly free with the angels D’Angelo, we will listen to you forever and always be moved. I drop to my knees and pray.”</p> 
<p>“Rest Peacefully D’Angelo,” <a href="https://x.com/MissyElliott/status/1978158665090630116">wrote</a> Missy Elliott on X. “No parent want to see their children go but it’s painful for children to see their parents go to so send prayers up for his son who also lost his mom this year for strength.”</p> 
<p>Writing on Instagram, musician and producer Nile Rodgers remembered when music executive Garry Harris, who signed D’Angelo, first played him his music.</p> 
<p>“He was trying to figure out what to do with the music he’d brought with him,” Rogers wrote. “I listened to every cut … not just out of respect but because it was smoking. At the end of the encounter he asked me, ‘What should I do with it?’ I remember this as if it were yesterday. I said: “Put it out. It’s perfect!’ Being the artist he is, I guess he had to explore some ways to make it better. About a year later I heard one of those songs on the radio. It was genius and it was exactly what he had played for me. I know… I still have the original cassette.”</p>
