He also placed a large stack of papers on his desk with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2025/israel-gaza-war-children-death-toll/?itid=hp_world_p007_f002">the names of 18,500 children</a> who have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza published on Wednesday by the Washington Post.</p> <p>“What the extremist Netanyahu government is doing now is not an effort to win a war; there is no military purpose in starving thousands and thousands of children,” Sanders said. “Let us be clear: this is not an effort to win a war; this is an effort to destroy a people.”</p> <p>Sanders added that, by one estimate, 70% of the cost of destroying Gaza has been paid for by American taxpayers. He also noted that the arms sales clearly violate two US laws: the Foreign Assistance Act and the Arms Export Control Act.</p> <p>“Tonight we have the power to act,” Sanders said. “The power to force Netanyahu and his extremist government to end this slaughter.”</p> <p>The two resolutions introduced by Sanders were supported by colleagues including his allies <strong>Peter Welch</strong>, Vermont’s junior senator, and <strong>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</strong>, the New York congresswoman who has toured the country with Sanders for “Fighting Oligarchy” rallies.</p> <p>“The mass starvation in Gaza must end,” Welch said in remarks after Sanders spoke. “The forced displacement of 2 million Palestinians in Gaza must end.”</p> <p>“It is unthinkable that at this moment, when a third of Gaza has not eaten in days, the Senate would green light the bombs, guns, and munitions that have already been used to kill 60,000 Palestinians,” Ocasio-Cortez said in <a href="https://ocasio-cortez.house.gov/media/press-releases/ocasio-cortez-statement-senator-sanders-resolutions-block-weapons-transfers">a statement</a>. “Today, every Senator has a choice to make: they can uphold US law by preventing the transfer of these weapons, or they can cower to Netanyahu and hand over the arms being used to perpetuate a genocide.”</p> <p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/bau0cVlUAI0?si=7X51CFxtmIJMHzUB">an interview</a> with CNN on Tuesday night, Sanders was asked if Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was lying when he said there is no starvation in Gaza. “Of course he’s lying,” Sanders replied. “He is a disgusting liar.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bau0cVlUAI0"

entered the race to be the state’s next governor praised former vice-president <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> on Wednesday after her decision not to run for the office, despite leading in the polls, made all of their lives a little easier.</p> <p><strong>Katie Porter</strong>, the former congresswoman who studied consumer law with Elizabeth Warren, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/katieporteroc.bsky.social/post/3lv7iulzeu22b">called Harris</a> “a principled leader” and added: “I’m proud of the work we accomplished together on consumer protection during the housing crisis and grateful for her service to California and our country.” When Harris was California’s attorney general, in 2012, she <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-appoints-independent-monitor-protect-interests">appointed Porter</a>, a bankruptcy law expert, to monitor the state’s $18 billion mortgage settlement with major banks in the wake of the financial crisis.</p> <p><strong>Xavier Becerra</strong>, who succeeded Harris as California’s attorney general and then served as health secretary in the Biden-Harris administration, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMvsAUXhwFM/?img_index=2">hailed</a> her as “a trailblazing leader” who chose to channel her “formidable energy and experience” into “other endeavors”.</p> <p><strong>Antonio Villaraigosa</strong>, a former Los Angeles mayor, <a href="https://x.com/AVillaraigosa/status/1950633061810606221">voiced</a> his “deep respect for Vice President Kamala Harris and her decades of leadership and public service to the people of California and our nation.” In hi statement, Villaraigosa, who <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-05-20/villaraigosa-harris-becerra-biden">suggested in May</a> that both Harris and Becerra should be asked whether they were part of “a systematic cover-up to keep Joe Biden’s mental decline from the public”, strongly hinted that Harris was likely passing up on the race to become California’s governor in 2027 so that she could run for president again in 2028. “Her decision not to enter the race for Governor reflects her continued commitment to serving at the highest levels of government”, he wrote.</p> <p><strong>Eleni Kounalakis</strong>, California’s current lieutenant governor, released a video statement in which she emphasized that she is close to Harris. “I got a call from my friend Kamala Harris. I’m very honored that she called me before any announcements were made to tell me of her plans”, Kounalakis said. “I have so much respect and so much gratitude for the vice president’s leadership.”</p> <p>There was no immediate statement from another potential candidate, the former Republican real estate developer <strong>Rick Caruso</strong>, who registered as a Democrat and spent $100 million on his unsuccessful run for Los Angeles mayor in 2022.</p> <p>Caruso teased a run for governor on Tuesday, when he posted <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMtep2-yE-e/?igsh=NWVybHRyMDAxejc1&amp;img_index=1">Instagram images</a> of himself meeting with Willie Brown, and looking at a photo of the California state assembly. Brown, who once dated Harris, had suggested in <a href="https://x.com/Elex_Michaelson/status/1947880399264510011">a recent podcast interview</a> that Harris might not win a race for governor and talked up the prospects of Caruso instead.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-688a9e428f08e66ccdc02a41" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-30T22:57:43.036Z">11.57pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump announces trade deal to impose 15% tariffs on imports from South Korea, despite existing free trade agreement he signed</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> announced on Wednesday that he has agreed to a new trade deal with South Korea that will subject imports to a 15% tariff rate. South Korean importers will pay no tariffs on US goods they purchase.</p> <p>The new arrangement comes seven years after the president negotiated <a href="https://www.cato.org/free-trade-bulletin/trumps-first-trade-deal-slightly-revised-korea-us-free-trade-agreement#increased-export-quotas-and-expansion-of-eco-credits-for-u-s-autos">a slightly revised</a> version of the existing <a href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/korus-fta">US-Korea Free Trade Agreement</a>, known as Korus, under which almost 95% of the goods traded between the two nations were free of tariffs. When that agreement was struck, Trump called the deal “fair and reciprocal” and praised it as a win for US auto-makers, since South Korea <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/fact-sheets/2018/september/fact-sheet-us-korea-free-trade">agreed to phase out</a> a 25% tariff on US-made trucks.</p> <p>Trump said that South Korea agreed to invest $350bn in the US and purchase $100bn in US energy products.</p> <p>Writing on his social media platform, Trump claimed that the new agreement meant that “South Korea will be completely OPEN TO TRADE with the United States, and that they will accept American product including Cars and Trucks, Agriculture, etc.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-30T23:44:18.431Z">at 12.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-688a8c318f08dc862cec3a09" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-30T21:33:47.161Z">10.33pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Brown University agrees to pay $50m to settle dispute with Trump administration</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Brown University <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2025-07-30/brown-united-states-resolution-agreement">announced</a> on Wednesday it “reached a voluntary agreement with the federal government to restore funding for the University’s federally sponsored medical and health sciences research and resolve three open reviews assessing Brown’s compliance with federal nondiscrimination obligations”.</p> <p>As part of <a href="https://www.brown.edu/sites/default/files/brown-and-united-states-resolution-agreement_July-30-2025.pdf">the agreement</a>, signed by Christina H Paxson, the president of Brown, attorney general Pam Bondi, education secretary Linda McMahon and health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, Brown will pay $50m “to state workforce development organizations operating in compliance with anti-discrimination laws” over the next 10 years.</p> <p>One provision of the agreement stipulates that “Brown shall not maintain programs that promote unlawful efforts to achieve race-based outcomes, quotas, diversity targets, or similar efforts”. Defining the effort to bring diversity to campuses as a form of illegal discrimination against white students is a core element of the Trump administration’s ideological war on higher education.</p> <p>“Accordingly,” the agreement adds, “Brown will provide a timely report to the United States summarizing its compliance with this obligation, including an assurance that Brown has acted responsibly to ensure its programs do not promote unlawful DEI goals.”</p> <p>Another provision, which might seem to be at odds with the ban on promoting diversity, is a commitment from the university to combat antisemitism by taking actions “to support a thriving Jewish community, research and education about Israel, and a robust Program in Judaic Studies, through outreach to Jewish Day School students to provide information about applying to Brown, resources for religiously observant Jewish community members, renewed partnerships with Israeli academics and national Jewish organizations, support for enhanced security at the Brown-RISD Hillel, and a convening of alumni, students, and faculty to celebrate 130 years of Jewish life at Brown”.</p> <p>The education secretary <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/secretary-mcmahon-statement-brown-university-deal">called</a> the agreement as evidence that the Trump administration “is successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation’s higher education institutions”.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-30T21:55:23.349Z">at 10.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-688a89498f08e66ccdc029bd" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-30T21:11:05.502Z">10.11pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>At the start of his remarks, before touting what he called the supposed benefits of helping Americans to access their medical records on their phones, health secretary <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong> took a moment to praise the way <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has changed the White House since January.</p> <p>As Kennedy recalled visiting the Oval office when his uncle, <strong>John F Kennedy</strong>, was president, he said that the White House had become, over time, drab.
