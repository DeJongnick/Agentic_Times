    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - There have been 11 treble winning teams: Celtic in 1967, Ajax in 1972, PSV Eindhoven in 1988, Manchester United in 1999, Barcelona in 2009 and 2015, Inter in 2010, Bayern Munich in 2013 and 2020, Manchester City in 2023 and PSG in 2025., 2:D - No one has scored a hat-trick in a European Cup final since the 1960s., 3:B - Nadal won the event 14 times and his win-loss record went from 31–0 to 70–1, 105–2 and 112–3, before finishing at 112–4. , 4:A - Capriati’s career was up and down to say the least. She reached the French Open semi-finals at 14, was arrested on shoplifting and marijuana charges later in her teens, and returned to tennis and won three grand slams. , 5:D - England are playing twice in the next week: against Andorra in Spain and against Senegal in a friendly at the City Ground in Nottingham., 6:D - “I have done pre-season in Orlando and I will be very surprised if we do not suffer,” said Tuchel. “Suffering is one of the headlines for this World Cup.” Sounds fun., 7:B - The 2021 final was at the Rose Bowl, the 2023 final was at the Oval and the 2025 final will be at Lord’s. Despite the lure of playing at home, England have never reached the final. , 8:D - The West Indies players stayed on their coach and were late, meaning they did not have a proper warm-up. “It was very tough,” said Gudakesh Motie. “It was a long drive to the ground with a lot of traffic – it took about two hours on the bus. When we got to the ground we had only a few minutes before play.” , 9:B - It’s a 48-team tournament so expect to see a few new faces – and a few more pages – in the sticker album., 10:A - Yates did not win any of the stages but he completed the 2,140-mile course quicker than anyone else. , 11:B - Warrington are up against it. They lost to Wigan in last year’s final and are underdogs against Hull KR this time around. , 12:C - The draw for the race took place at a Picturehouse cinema in Epsom and featured the balls and velvet bag used in FA Cup draws. It was a step up from last year, when they used hand-scrawled ping-pong balls and held the draw outside the local Wetherspoons. , 13:C - The Earl of Derby and Sir Charles Bunbury both helped establish the race. They supposedly flipped a coin to determine whether it would be named “Derby Stakes” or “Bunbury Stakes.” Although Bunbury lost the coin toss, Newmarket later featured his name in the “Bunbury Cup”., 14:B - Boxing has lost one of its greats. , 15:B - Taxi drivers in Rome did not welcome the comparison. “We are the best at not having accidents, otherwise we would lose our working day,” said one annoyed driver. “I would like to see Formula One drivers manoeuvring around construction sites, scooters and golf carts the way we do. Rome is now a jungle, not a Formula One track.” </p>
