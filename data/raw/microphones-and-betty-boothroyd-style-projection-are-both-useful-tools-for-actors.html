<p>The increasing use of microphones on stage (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/aug/04/handheld-microphones-inter-alia-national-chekhov-rosamund-pike">‘We can hear their saliva’: why are so many actors suddenly using microphones?, 4 August</a>) has prompted more astute producers and theatres to transform their audiences’ engagement. When a sound operator sends the signal from a mic directly through the loop system, anyone using hearing aids or the theatre’s own headphones gets a degree of clarity that is unequalled. Along with captioning, this is a lifeline for millions who attend theatre. I know it goes against the grain for old stagers who hold that unenhanced “shouting at night” is the purest form of theatre, but those with <a href="https://rnid.org.uk/get-involved/research-and-policy/facts-and-figures/prevalence-of-deafness-and-hearing-loss/">some degree of hearing loss</a> – one in three of the UK population –&nbsp;will tell you a different story.<br><strong>Richard Lee</strong><br><em>Leigh-on-Sea, Essex</em></p> <p>• Emma John mentions a veteran actor who trained his voice to fill large spaces and refuses to use a microphone. This reminded me of an Open University awards ceremony many years ago. The microphone went down and my colleague announcing the graduands was told by Betty Boothroyd, in her best Speaker’s voice, to <em>project!</em> A lovely moment.<br><strong>Chris Walters</strong><br><em>Buxton, Derbyshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
