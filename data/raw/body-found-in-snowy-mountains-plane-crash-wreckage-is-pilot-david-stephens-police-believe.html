Police needed a number of air assets for investigators to reach the site.</p> <p>A police spokesperson said earlier on Friday a “recovery operation” would start at about midday to “retrieve and examine” the plane.</p> <p>“The recovery operation will involve officers from Riverina police district, PolAir, Police Rescue, and the criminal investigation and crime scene unit,” the spokesperson said.</p>    <p>The initial search for the crash site included the police alpine operations unit, the NSW and Victorian ambulance services, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, state emergency services and Snowy Hydro.</p> <p>An <a href="https://www.amsa.gov.au/">Australian Maritime Safety Authority</a> Challenger rescue jet and two helicopters conducted the overhead search.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said it had started an investigation into the crash.</p> <p>“Investigators are working closely with the NSW police to gather available evidence, including imagery of the accident site and any aircraft components containing recorded data that can be retrieved and recovered to the ATSB’s technical facilities in Canberra for download and analysis,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>“The investigation’s findings will be contained in a final report to be released at the conclusion of the investigation. That report will also detail the ATSB’s analysis of the evidence to support those findings.”</p>
