<h2>Pick of the week<br>Talk 90s to Me</h2> <p>Miranda Sawyer gets into full-on nostalgia mode in this series dedicated to the days of Cool Britannia, Girl Power, Trainspotting and much more. If you’ve not had your fill of Oasis yet, her <a href="https://uk.radio.net/podcast/talk-90s-to-me">first episode</a> is a loving deep dive into fandom and how one Mancunian outfit went where no 90s band had gone before. Says former Q editor Ted Kessler, it all came down to the Gallaghers’ undeniable strain of “electricity … chaos and anarchy”. <em>Hannah J Davies</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em> </p> <h2>StanLand</h2>    <p>This <a href="https://shows.acast.com/stanland?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=podcast-page">tale of a podcaster</a> transported to a weird world behind an Ikea wardrobe boasts a stacked cast including Jon Hamm, Rhea Seehorn and John Waters, and counts Bob Odenkirk as an executive producer. It’s a lot to live up to and sometimes feels laboured. But if sideways fantasy fiction is your thing, it may well hook you. <em>HJD</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p> <h2>No Easy Fix </h2> <p>The Atlantic’s 2024 miniseries <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/radio-atlantic/scripts/">Scripts</a> was a powerful look at soaring rates of psychiatric drug use in the US. This <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/radio-atlantic/no-easy-fix/">time round</a>, Ethan Brooks turns his attention to homelessness and addiction in San Francisco and touches on an important paradox: the fact that, despite being all-too visible to those around them, homeless people are often those who have been reported as missing. <em>HJD</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p> <h2>Write Me Dirty </h2>    <p>Another week, another Katherine Ryan podcast. This time, in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7rICbCCHAGGhBP72qE0LLj">each episode</a> she asks two funny guests to make up a very filthy story. First up, Taskmaster alumna Stevie Martin (who dedicates hers to her nana) and Fatiha El-Ghorri are told to set their stories in a car showroom. <em>Hollie Richardson</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p> <h2>The Ballad of Big Mags</h2> <p>Myles Bonnar’s six-parter for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds">BBC Scotland</a> is full of mind-boggling facts about Stirling’s Margaret Haney, whose criminal brood were once dubbed “the family from hell”. Bonnar succeeds in highlighting the contradictions of a woman who was both an anti-paedophile vigilante and a crook – and who may have even been the inspiration for EastEnders matriarch Big Mo. <em>HJD</em><br><em>Widely available, episodes weekly</em></p>
