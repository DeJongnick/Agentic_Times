<p>Fifa is facing new questions over the increasingly fraught World Cup next year, with the issue of how to treat Iran while the country is involved in a conflict with the co-host the US.</p> <p>There are no provisions within Fifa’s regulations to prevent Iran from playing their group matches in the US, despite the country being subject to military action by the Trump administration and Iranian citizens being under a travel ban that prevents them from entering the country. The ban <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/05/donald-trump-travel-ban-includes-exemption-for-world-cup-and-olympic-athletes">contains an exemption</a> that could apply to players, staff or associated families with teams at the 2026 Fifa World Cup.</p> <p>Iran, who faced USA in the group stage of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, qualified in March for their fourth consecutive World Cup. Although 2026 is also being hosted by Canada and Mexico, only by being given a specific slot in group A could Iran avoid playing in the US, with their matches then taking place in Mexico.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/18/fifa-again-under-scrutiny-for-a-world-cups-increased-carbon-footprint">Fifa again under scrutiny for World Cup’s increased carbon footprint</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Iran won that group they would stay in Mexico for their last-32 game and any last-16 match. Should they go further – and they have never reached a World Cup knockout game – they would then play in the US.</p> <p>Fifa did not respond on Monday to a request for comment from the Guardian and will likely be considering its options before the World Cup draw, which is due to take place in December. The decision will be a difficult one for its president, Gianni Infantino, who has associated himself closely with President Donald Trump, who authorised the use of US bombs on Iranian nuclear sites last weekend.</p> <p>Infantino and the Fifa Council will have the final say on inclusion in the competition and the makeup of the draw, but the organising committee for Fifa competitions will be expected to have input. The committee has members from Canada, Mexico and Iran, and its chair is Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin. In 2022, his organisation announced that Ukraine and Belarus would be kept apart in Uefa competition draws, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and his action may provide an example for Fifa to follow.</p> <p>Before the World Cup draw in Qatar, the agreed draw constraints included limitations on where teams could be selected but this related only to a “general principle” that no more than one team from each confederation (excluding Europe) should appear in a given group.</p> <p>• The headline of this article was amended on 25 June 2025 to better reflect the terms of the story.</p>
