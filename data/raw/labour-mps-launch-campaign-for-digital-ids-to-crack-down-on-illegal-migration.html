<p>More than 40 Labour MPs from three influential backbench groups have called on ministers to introduce digital IDs, which they claim would boost productivity in delivering public services and crack down on illegal employment.</p> <p>The open letter – organised by the Rother Valley MP, Jake Richards – has been signed by the co-chairs of the Labour Growth Group, Chris Curtis and Lola McEvoy, as well as Jo White, who convenes the Labour Red Wall Group. Other signatories include Dan Carden and Jonathan Brash, members of the Blue Labour group of socially conservative MPs.</p> <p>The letter, which has been shared with the Home Office, Cabinet Office and Department for Science, Innovation and Technology, has also been signed by some of the most prominent names in the 2024 intake, including MPs Polly Billington, Jess Asato, Mike Tapp, Joe Powell and Emily Darlington.</p> <p>Richards has been an outspoken advocate in parliament for the party to do more to tackle the threat of Reform UK and crack down on illegal migration.</p> <p>The letter called on the government to revive the idea of ID cards – a hugely controversial policy proposal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/aug/04/immigrationpolicy.idcards">during Tony Blair’s era</a> – but said digital IDs were the right route for the modern economy. It said it would mean citizens could “engage with the state more seamlessly”, including booking GP appointments, renewing passports or paying tax.</p> <p>“It is absurd in the 21st century our NHS relies on a physical red book to monitor the health of newborn babies,” the letter said.</p> <p>It said the move would meet the government’s objections of making the state more efficient and crack down on “off-the-books employment, boost lagging public sector productivity, and provide faster, more efficient access to healthcare, welfare and public services”.</p> <p>Privacy groups are likely to raise alarm at the proposals but the letter claimed public polling was in favour of an ID system used in countries such as Estonia, India and members of the EU. “Without a gear shift in this area, we will be in danger of looking back wistfully at a golden, missed opportunity”, it said.</p> <p>The intervention is the first coordinated action of the three major Labour backbench groups. A working group on the issue, which includes signatories of the letter, and members of all three groups, will be led by Richards and McEvoy.</p> <p>Launching the campaign, Richards said: “We know a joined-up digital ID can drive huge gains in public sector productivity, unlock innovation and make it harder for those entering the country illegally to access work or public services.</p> <p>“This is the kind of transformative, commonsense change voters across the UK are crying out for but government has got to move rapidly if we’re going to make it a reality.</p> <p>“Delivering digital ID is the first step in placing our focus on an agenda of rights and responsibilities – across law and order, public services, immigration and welfare. The policy imperative alone is vital but there is also a powerful political case to be built around it.”</p>
