<p>A classical composer signed to experimental UK label <a href="https://warp.net/">Warp</a>, US pianist <a href="https://kellymoran.warp.net/bio">Kelly Moran</a> has more in her fingers than mere canonical elegance. She has accompanied <a href="https://www.pointnever.com/">Oneohtrix Point Never</a> and <a href="https://www.fkatwigsofficial.com/">FKA twigs</a> on tour; her previous works were often for <a href="https://www.classical-music.com/features/works/six-best-pieces-prepared-piano">prepared piano</a>.</p> <p>Moran’s second full-length for Warp was conceived in lockdown. In early 2020, Yamaha loaned her a <a href="https://uk.yamaha.com/en/products/musical_instruments/pianos/disklavier/index.html">Disklavier</a> – a modern version of the ghostly “<a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/player-piano">player piano</a>”, a programmable real instrument – to help her prepare a collaboration. Moran seized the opportunity to experiment. She created a version of herself with more fingers and a greater handspan. On <em><a href="https://warp.net/products/443358-moves-in-the-field">Moves in the Field</a></em>, she duets with this augmented version of herself. These 10 tracks feature what sometimes sounds like one pianist running rings around the other. Superhuman, where Disklavier Moran pirouettes around flesh-and-bone Moran, finds the Disklavier phrases fractalling out into digital-sounding stutters. Dancer Polynomials and Leitmotif suggest systems music being played alongside traditional composition.</p> <p><em>Moves in the Field</em> is named after foundational figure-skating forms, and there is a sense here of Moran honouring poise and classicism – some of her considered strokes evoke Erik Satie – while creating unachievable counterpoints. The greatest satisfaction is that she does not jump the shark: everything here is possible-sounding, humanistic and full of emotion; only slightly uncanny.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Juj9d5_YK0o"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Juj9d5_YK0o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Juj9d5_YK0o">Watch the video for Butterfly Phase by Kelly Moran.</a></figcaption> </figure>
