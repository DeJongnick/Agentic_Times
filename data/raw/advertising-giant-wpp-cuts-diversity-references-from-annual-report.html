<p>The British advertising giant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/wppgroup">WPP</a> has become the latest company to cut the phrase “diversity, equity and inclusion” from its annual report as the policies come under attack from the Trump administration.</p> <p>The agency, which counts the US as by far its largest market, boasts the storied “Madison Avenue” agencies <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/avidan/2020/04/29/ogilvy-as-a-metaphor-for-the-trouble-on-madison-avenue/">J Walter Thompson, Ogilvy and Grey</a> among its top brands.</p> <p>In WPP’s annual report, which was released on Friday, the chief executive, Mark Read, told shareholders that “much has changed over the last year” due to political events.</p> <p>“In today’s complex world, a pressing question for brands and organisations is whether to engage on social issues in a more contested public arena, and how to navigate the expectations of different audiences with competing views on sensitive topics,” he wrote.</p> <p>The same document axed all references of “diversity, equity and inclusion”, “DE&amp;I” and “DEI”. The policy attracted 20 mentions in the previous year’s report. The earlier document mentioned three times that the company was seen as a “diversity leader”.</p> <p>The omissions, which were first reported by the Sunday Times, included changes to how the company reports on measuring top executives’ non-financial performance, which contributes to the size of their short-term bonuses. In the new report, the phrasing has switched to “people and culture”.</p> <p>WPP declined to comment on whether the new wording was a response to anti-DEI policy moves by the Trump administration. The company said that, while the phrasing in its annual report had changed, the way in which executives’ short-term bonuses are calculated was unaltered.</p> <p>Within his first few days in office, Donald Trump instructed US government agencies to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/22/trump-orders-immediate-closure-of-all-us-federal-diversity-offices">shut down their DEI programmes</a> and federal employees working in diversity offices were immediately put on paid leave.</p> <p>Trump signed two executive orders targeting DEI programmes within the federal government. The first executive order largely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/trump-executive-orders-dei">scrapped the DEI efforts that took place under Joe Biden</a>, who had ordered all federal agencies to come up with equity plans.</p> <p>A second <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/">executive order</a> effectively ended any DEI activities within the federal government. This order overturned a handful of executive orders from past presidents, including one from Lyndon B Johnson that was signed during the civil rights era that required federal contractors to adopt equal opportunity measures.</p> <p>The Financial Times recently reported that <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c2320415-dcf6-4b69-acd4-3187507d762c">more than 200 US companies</a> have removed references to “diversity, equity and inclusion” from their annual reports since Trump’s election.</p>
