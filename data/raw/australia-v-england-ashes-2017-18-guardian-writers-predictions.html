<h1>Australia v England, Ashes 2017-18: Guardian writers’ predictions</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2017-11-21T18:12:00Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Vic Marks, Jason Gillespie, Ali Martin, Andy Bull, Geoff Lemon and Adam Collins &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Sport</div>
<h2><strong>Who will win?</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>Vic Marks: </strong>Australia – because they usually do. England have won there once in their last seven tours.</p> 
<p><strong>Jason Gillespie: </strong>Australia will win because I’m not convinced England can take 20 wickets consistently if conditions don’t suit Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson.</p> 
<p><strong>Ali Martin: </strong>Australia to pilfer the urn, with home conditions proving the difference between what are two imperfect teams with near identical win-loss records since the last time they met.</p>

</aside> 
<p><strong>Andy Bull: </strong>Australia. Their fast bowlers are just that much more dangerous in these conditions and England’s batsmen haven’t kicked their bad habit of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/07/ben-stokes-west-indies-england-third-test-day-one-report" title="">collapsing in a heap</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>Geoff Lemon: </strong>With both having weaknesses, home advantage will make the difference. If Australia’s bowlers stay fit, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/20/england-jake-ball-ashes-australia-first-test" title="">they’re too good</a>. Lose two, and things will look different.</p> 
<p><strong>Adam Collins: </strong>Australia on the simple basis they will win the race to 20 wickets more often. Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins make a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/18/australia-england-first-test-ashes-player-guide" title="">trio of world-class brutes</a>. The trick: keeping them fit.</p> 
<h2><strong>And the score?</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>VM </strong>3-1. I fancy England’s chances in Adelaide if they bowl at the right time; they usually struggle in Perth. Then they arrive in Sydney 2-1 down with the Ashes still alive for the first time since 1982-3.</p> 
<p><strong>JG </strong>3-1. England’s best chance for a Test win is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2017/nov/20/why-is-the-first-ashes-day-night-test-a-big-deal-video-explainer" title="">Adelaide under lights</a>, with a draw in Perth or the MCG and Australia to then win in Sydney. Their attack should be too strong.</p> 
<p><strong>AM </strong>3-2. Draws seem passe for both teams and with the roulette wheel of a day-night Test too, a fluctuating series is not out of the question. It would be great fun too.</p>

</aside> 
<p><strong>AB </strong>3-2, because I’m an optimist. The day-night match will be a crapshoot and this Australia side aren’t so good that they’ll be able to sweep the other four Tests.</p> 
<p><strong>GL </strong>4-1. Small chance of rain, and two sets of fallible batsmen who play in fast forward. So forget the draw but England should jag a win.</p> 
<p><strong>AC </strong>3-2. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/04/drubbings-draws-test-cricket-the-spin-andy-bull" title="">Draws are a thing of your granddaddy’s era</a>. Coupling that with the fragility of both batting lists, expect plenty of golf to be played on the fifth days.</p> 
<h2><strong>Man of the series?</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>VM </strong>Mitchell Starc. He may not be quite as quick as Mitchell Johnson but if everything clicks he is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/dec/30/mitchell-starc-leads-australia-to-dramatic-melbourne-test-win-over-p" title="">the most dangerous bowler</a> on either side.</p> 
<p><strong>JG </strong>Josh Hazlewood will be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/02/josh-hazlewood-ashes-glenn-mcgrath-alastair-cook-joe-root-test-match" title="">Glenn McGrath-esque in his consistency</a> and I’m looking at him to finish up around the 30-wicket mark.</p> 
<p><strong>AM </strong>Steve Smith, who has batted on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/18/steve-smith-australia-captain-ashes-england" title="">another level at home</a> in recent times. Which superstar captain at No4 is best set up by their top three – or forced to firefight more often – could be key.</p>

</aside> 
<p><strong>AB </strong>Josh Hazlewood. Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc may be faster, but Hazlewood will be the backbone of the attack and probably finish the series as Australia’s leading wicket-taker.</p> 
<p><strong>GL </strong>Josh Hazlewood. Mitchell Starc is lightning – scary, and never in the same place. The straight man of the attack knows his conditions, hits his length, and will clean up after his strike partner.</p> 
<p><strong>AC </strong>Since the last time these teams met, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/sep/09/how-australias-warner-and-lyon-found-patience-to-rescue-bangladesh-series" title="">David Warner has reconstructed his game</a> to be more suitable for all conditions. “Aggressive defence”, is his new doctrine. He’s also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/08/david-warner-reformed-australia-england-champions-trophy" title="">fitter and more focused</a> than ever. Look out.</p> 
<h2><strong>Most looking forward to …</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>VM </strong>Being proven completely wrong.</p> 
<p><strong>JG </strong>Seeing the speed gun being pushed over that 150kmh (93mph) mark by Starc and Cummins. I love watching the former when it reverses too, going around and getting those yorkers in – it’s one of the great sights in world cricket.</p> 
<p><strong>AM </strong>Seeing whether Mitchell Starc ploughs on with the moustache after Movember is up, a la <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/10/australian-sportsmen-moustache-mitchell-johnson" title="">Mitchell Johnson four years ago</a>.</p> 
<p><strong>AB </strong>The latest instalments of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/sep/08/england-test-cricket-jimmy-anderson-500-wickets-five-best" title="">Jimmy Anderson’s late-career masterclass</a> in the art of bowling medium-fast.</p> 
<p><strong>GL </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/21/ashes-series-captains-example-antagonism" title="">Steve Smith versus Joe Root</a>: two grand appetites at the cricket buffet, as the young captains face off for the first time.</p> 
<p><strong>AC </strong>Moeen Ali and Nathan Lyon having more influence than the cynics will insist. That, and the circus when Ben Stokes is inevitably airlifted in. Grab the popcorn.</p> 
<h2><strong>Least looking forward to …</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>VM </strong>Writing those agonising postmortems if England lose badly. Taking the flak once again.</p> 
<p><strong>JG </strong>Hearing about this fabled fairytale that is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/aug/03/the-spin-spirit-of-cricket-cliche" title="">“the spirit of cricket”</a>. I don’t want to hear that term at all!</p>

</aside> 
<p><strong>AM </strong>Talk of “psychological scars” or “brand of cricket”. Or “whitewash”.</p> 
<p><strong>AB </strong>My grudging admiration for David Warner when he inevitably thrashes England’s attack for 150 somewhere along the way.</p> 
<p><strong>GL </strong>The ECB press release when they rush Ben Stokes over. And the CA press release when they recall Geoff Marsh.</p> 
<p><strong>AC </strong>Australia’s cringeworthy sledging. They’re a nice bunch of blokes, honest. In turn, they really don’t do the mental disintegration thing very well.</p> 
<h2><strong>When it’s over we’ll all say …</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>VM </strong>“Actually I had a sneaking feeling Vince and Ballance would be our leading runscorers.”</p> 
<p><strong>JG </strong>This may be a pipedream, but “this series was on par with the 2005 Ashes”. I’d take a narrow win for Australia if it rivalled that.</p> 
<p><strong>AM </strong>“England comfortably outsung their opponents in the stands.” <strong>AM</strong></p> 
<p><strong>AB </strong>“How good was Ben Stokes’ match-winning century in the fifth Test?”</p> 
<p><strong>GL </strong>“Why did we agree to put predictions in a newspaper? Ah well. Let’s do it all again at your place.” <strong>GL</strong></p> 
<p><strong>AC </strong>“It wasn’t pretty, but because of that, it was the best damn Ashes scrap on Australian soil for a couple of generations.”</p>
