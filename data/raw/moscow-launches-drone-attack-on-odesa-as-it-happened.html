  <p>This blog is closing now but you can find our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/ukraine-zelenskyy-says-trump-living-in-russian-disinformation-bubble">latest full story on the falling out between the US and Ukraine here</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">all our Ukraine coverage here</a>. Here’s a recap of the latest developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The US and Ukraine appear to be heading towards an irreconcilable rift after Donald Trump escalated his attacks on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-europe-latest-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67b5ffa78f08d2b5975a9ace#block-67b5ffa78f08d2b5975a9ace">calling him a “dictator”</a> and warning the Ukrainian leader “better move fast” or he “won’t have a country left.” </strong>The US president also accused Zelenskyy – without evidence – of benefiting from continuing US financial and military support. Trump’s latest comments cast serious doubt on future US aid to Ukraine and mark the most explicit threat yet to end the war on terms favourable to Moscow.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump’s fiery Truth Social rant on Wednesday came after Zelenskyy accused the US leader of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-europe-latest-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67b5b3188f08daacc9e11185#block-67b5b3188f08daacc9e11185">being “trapped” in a Russian “disinformation bubble”</a>. </strong>The Ukrainian president said Trump was pushing “a lot of disinformation coming from Russia,” and accused Washington of bringing Russia out of global isolation through bilateral talks earlier this week in Riyadh. Zelenskyy also disputed Trump’s comments that most of Ukraine’s support comes from the US. US vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-europe-latest-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67b654d98f08d2b5975aa036#block-67b654d98f08d2b5975aa036">warned</a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-europe-latest-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67b654d98f08d2b5975aa036#block-67b654d98f08d2b5975aa036"> </a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-europe-latest-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67b654d98f08d2b5975aa036#block-67b654d98f08d2b5975aa036">Zelenskyy</a> against “bad mouthing”<strong> </strong>Trump, saying criticising the president would not help his cause.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy’s comments at a press conference came in response to Trump’s claims that Ukraine was to blame for Russia’s 2022 invasion, remarks that echoed the Kremlin’s narrative. </strong>Trump said he was “disappointed” that the Ukrainian leader complained about being left out of talks between the US and Russia over ending the Ukraine war, and increased pressure on Zelenskyy to hold elections – echoing one of Moscow’s key demands. Trump’s former vice-president, <strong>Mike Pence, </strong>challenged him in a post that said: “Mr. President, Ukraine did not ‘start’ this war … .

   <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-europe-latest-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-67b63da98f087e0f012c74a2#block-67b63da98f087e0f012c74a2">said he would meet</a> with Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, in Kyiv on Thursday.</strong> Kellogg, who is seen as Trump’s most pro-Ukraine adviser, arrived in Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian leaders on Wednesday. “Together with America and Europe, peace can be more reliable, and this is our goal,” Zelenskyy said in his daily evening address on Wednesday.</p></li>

  <p>Russia has unleashed a mass drone attack on Ukraine’s southern city of Odesa for the second night running, knocking out power for thousands of residents and plunging parts of the city into darkness, the regional governor has said. Reuters reports:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Governor Oleh Kiper, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said the latest night-time strikes had triggered a blackout for some 5,000 residents.</p> 
   <p>Kiper said nearly 90,000 people had been left in the dark in Odesa district in and around the city from the successive nights of attacks. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a similar number was without heating.</p> 
   <p>Kiper also said the strikes had triggered a fire at a restaurant and a storage facility and damaged an administrative building. One person was injured.<br>Photos on social media showed areas of the city in darkness.</p>

  <p>Trump also complains that the US “had a deal [with Ukraine] based on rare earth and things but they broke it” two days ago. This is a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/what-are-ukraines-critical-minerals-and-why-does-trump-want-them">reference to a deal</a> the US pushed Zelenskyy to sign that would have given the US 50% ownership of Ukraine’s rare minerals with no security guarantees for Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>He complains that “Europe gets their money back in the form of a loan but we don’t” and “this war is far more important to Europe than it is to us”. </p> 
  <p>This is mostly not true. On the <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/united-states-america/eu-assistance-ukraine-us-dollars_en?s=253">website</a> of the EU delegation to the US, it says the EU and its member states have committed $145bn in financial, military, humanitarian, and refugee assistance to Ukraine and by 2027, it will have committed over $174bn. In addition, the EU agreed to provide $50bn in loans to Ukraine in October, it says, financed by seized Russian assets. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Donald Trump says Zelenskyy could have gone to Saudi talks if he wanted to</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> also lays into <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> again, saying he’d “better move fast or he’s not going to have a country left” adding that he “could have come [to the talks in Saudi Arabia] if he wanted”, although it does not appear Zelenskyy was invited.</p> 
  <p>He also repeats comments about Zelenskyy’s alleged low poll ratings (in fact levels of trust in the Ukrainian president are high at home) and the lack of elections in Ukraine, which has been under martial law since the war began three years ago. Trump also says,</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s hope that my greatest legacy will be as a unifier and as a peacemaker.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It seems an odd comment given his recent comments on Ukraine and the Middle East, where he was threatened to displace the entire population of Gaza, in what would amount to the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian population.</p>

  <p>Donald Trump has been speaking at a meeting of finance and tech leaders in Miami. He’s gone through many of his favourite topics but now he’s on to Ukraine, where he warns “there’s no profit in having world war three and we’re not so far way from it,” before adding: “now it’s not going to happen.”</p> 
  <p>He thanks Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman – who not long ago was an international pariah over the chopping up of a Washington Post columnist in the Saudi consulate in Turkey – for hosting “historic talks” between Russia and the US over Ukraine, saying they were “very, very well”.</p> 
  <p>“It’s a big step,” he says, adding that satellite images of Ukraine show “a modern day version of Gettysburg”.</p>

  <p>Here’s a bit more analysis on the outburst by the Ukrainian president, who said Donald Trump was living in a “disinformation bubble”, courtesy of our senior international correspondent, Julian Borger:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is hardly surprising Zelenskyy lost his cool. Part of the reason he has a 57% confidence rating in the latest poll (13% above Trump’s own current standing) is because he has led his country through years of war with his heart vividly on his sleeve. Having been subjected to eight years of Russian aggression, followed by an entirely unprovoked full-on invasion which has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian citizens, and then to be told on the world stage that: “You should have never started it”, would be too much for most people.</p> 
   <p>When slighted and sprayed with Trumpian falsehoods, other world leaders, with much less at stake, have resorted to a “smile-and-wave” default strategy, deflecting direct questions and changing the subject to some aspect of relations with Washington that is still functioning normally.</p> 
   <p>Zelenskyy did not do this on Wednesday. Instead, he said out loud the bit that European leaders keep quiet. Trump, he observed, is “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/ukraine-zelenskyy-says-trump-living-in-russian-disinformation-bubble">trapped in this disinformation bubble</a>”. He was stating the obvious, but not even Zelenskyy could have known how fetid the air inside Trump’s bubble has become. Now we know.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Yan Patsenko</strong>, who is originally from <strong>Kyiv</strong> but now lives in Spain, told the Guardian they felt ambivalent about the <strong>Trump</strong> administration-led talks with <strong>Russia</strong> to end the war in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>“I have very mixed feelings about the peace process initiated by the Trump administration. On the one hand, I welcome the willingness of Russians and Americans to start talking to each other because I believe that much of this war’s roots lie in the Cold War-era perceptions they still hold about one another - to everyone’s detriment. I also welcome the intention to end the war in Ukraine through diplomatic means. After three years of bloodshed, this is what our families long for the most.</p> 
  <p>“On the other hand, I worry when I see these discussions happening behind closed doors, solely between representatives of Russia and the US. And I question how much of what they share publicly actually reflects the content of their private conversations.</p> 
  <p>“My biggest concern is that what is being presented as a peace process may, in reality, be nothing more than an attempt to negotiate between two competing imperial ambitions on how to divide Ukraine. I worry that this process remains entirely in the hands of a small circle of politicians who are the least affected by the consequences of their decisions.”</p> 
  <p><strong>30-year-old</strong> <strong>Ivan</strong>, who is currently living in Los Angeles on a student visa, said:</p> 
  <p>“I voted for Zelenskyy last time and will vote for him again.<strong> </strong>So will my entire family and all my friends. There are people both in the country and abroad who are dissatisfied with the president, but in such challenging times, that’s not surprising.”</p> 
  <p>He agreed with many others that Ukrainian elections were impossible to hold while fighting continued. “There are hundreds of thousands of soldiers on the front lines. How would they vote? In the trenches?</p> 
  <p>“It looks like Trump doesn’t care about peace but rather about fulfilling his promise to ‘end the war’ for his voters, who don’t care what price Ukraine has to pay. A ceasefire without security guarantees, on the aggressor’s terms, is not peace - it’s just a short pause for Putin before his next offensive.”</p>

  <p><strong>US</strong> vice-president <strong>JD Vance</strong> warned <strong>Ukrainian</strong> leader <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> against “bad mouthing” <strong>Donald Trump, </strong>saying criticising the president would not help his cause.</p> 
  <p>In comments to the Daily Mail after Zelenskyy said Trump was living in a Russian-made “disinformation space”, Vance said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The idea that Zelenskyy is going to change the president’s mind by bad mouthing him in public media, everyone who knows the President will tell you that is an atrocious way to deal with this administration.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Vance added that Zelenskyy had been getting “bad advice” on how to deal with the Trump administration. “We obviously love the Ukrainian people … but we obviously think that this war needs to come to a rapid close,” he continued.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That is the policy of the President of the United States. It is not based on Russian disinformation. It’s based on the fact that Donald Trump, I think, knows a lot about geopolitics and has a very strong view, and has had a strong view for a very long time.</p>

  <p><strong>Ukranians express support for Zelenskyy after Trump’s comments he is a “dictator”.</strong></p> 
  <p>Former Ukraine prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who leads the Motherland political party, said <a href="https://www.facebook.com/YuliaTymoshenko/posts/pfbid0zfCcBwxsPBwPMunsW4durKurTWf2cieMHBhtrWzdsac4kAZaizXJ3eNbaojn8bRsl">in a statement</a> on Wednesday that “Ukraine is a sovereign state! Volodymyr Zelenskyy is the President of Ukraine. Legitimate until another is elected. </p> 
  <p>“Only Ukrainians can decide when and under what conditions they should change their government. Today, there are no such conditions,” said Yulia Tymoshenko, former prime minister of Ukraine and leader of the mildly oppositional Motherland faction in the Ukrainian parliament.”</p> 
  <p>Tymoshenko underscored that Ukraine’s constitution forbids holding elections during martial law and active warfare due to safety and voting rights concerns. Members of the military, for example, would not be able to cast a vote.</p>

  <p><strong>Britain and France are leading efforts to create a European “reassurance force” intended to prevent future Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities, ports and critical infrastructure in the event of a US-brokered peace deal.</strong></p> 
  <p>The proposal, western officials said, would involve less than 30,000 troops and would be likely to be concentrated on air and maritime defence. Ground forces would be minimal and not deployed near the frontline in the east of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a>.</p> 
  <p>Among the aims of the force would be to ensure the safe reopening of Ukraine’s airspace to commercial flights and to maintain the security of seaborne trade over the Black Sea, critical to the country’s food and grain exports.</p> 
  <p>Ukraine’s electricity and other utilities have been repeatedly bombed by Russia during the near-three-year war, and maintaining their integrity is also deemed critical to the recovery of the country if the conflict is brought to a close.</p> 
  <p>It is unclear whether a force that is relatively small in number would be supported by Ukraine, whose president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/11/zelenskyy-europe-cannot-guarantee-ukraines-security-without-america">has called for the creation of a deterrence force 100,000-150,000 strong</a>, which involves the US.</p>

  <p>All America’s allies, the great majority of Republican leaders who have bowed to him, and a good number of his own cabinet, know full well that Trump is trapped in a disinformation bubble, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/ukraine-zelenskyy-says-trump-living-in-russian-disinformation-bubble">Zelenskyy said it out loud at a press conference on Wednesday.</a></p> 
  <p>In this new world where the foreign policy of the most powerful country on Earth has been rapidly reorganised around the fragile ego of a sullen and resentful old man, you might as well launch missiles at America’s eastern seaboard as utter a few words of rebuke.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy was aware of this. On Tuesday, he had complained that his country was being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/18/us-russia-ukraine-talks-riyadh-saudi-arabia">excluded from talks about its fate between the US and Russia in Riyadh</a>. They were “about Ukraine but without Ukraine”, he said.</p> 
  <p>It was a fair point. What happened in Riyadh was an upending of western policy towards Ukraine, but none of that matters any more. This is year zero as far as Trump, <strong>Elon Musk</strong> and their supporters are concerned. </p>

  <p><strong>Artem</strong>, 44, cybersecurity engineer from Odesa, was among scores of <strong>Ukrainians</strong> who shared with the Guardian how they felt about the <strong>Trump</strong> administration-led talks with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Artem said president Zelenskyy had more than 57% support in Ukraine, and predicted that this would rise after Donald Trump’s calls for new elections. </p> 
  <p>“Get your hands off our president. We will re-elect him after the war,” he said. “Putin has been president for more than 20 years - tell him to be re-elected if you are so brave!”</p> 
  <p>The proposals emanating from the talks so far, Artem said, amounted to “another betrayal of our country by the USA.”</p> 
  <p>“But, to be honest, it didn’t start with Trump’s victory. Since 2014, when Russia started occupation of Ukraine, there were Obama, Trump, and Biden. All of them, alongside Nato, were scared by the possible escalation and economic losses. And all of them pretended to be our friends and take care of us.”</p> 
  <p>A <strong>35-year-old man who left Kyiv</strong> <strong>in 2020</strong> and has since been living in Switzerland was among many who pointed out that it was unconstitutional to have elections while martial law was in place.</p> 
  <p>“It might be suicidal for Ukraine to cancel the martial law unless there is a strong security guarantee to deter any future Russian aggression,” he added. “Once the Ukrainian and Europeans have figured out how to secure such a guarantee, it would be necessary to have the elections.”</p>

   <li><p><strong>Trump’s latest Truth Social post came after Zelenskyy accused the US leader of being “trapped” in a Russian “disinformation bubble”. </strong>The Ukrainian president, in a combative press conference in Kyiv, said Trump was pushing “a lot of disinformation coming from Russia”. He accused Washington of bringing Russia out of global isolation through bilateral talks earlier this week in Riyadh, and rejected any suggestion of making broad concessions to Russia. Zelenskyy also disputed Trump’s comments that most of Ukraine’s support comes from the US.</p></li>

   <li><p><strong>Zelenskyy’s comments were in response to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/trump-ukraine-war-russia-could-have-made-a-deal">a series of inflammatory remarks from Trump </a>on Tuesday evening,</strong> in which Trump first criticised him and suggested Ukraine was to blame for Moscow’s invasion. Trump said he was “disappointed” that the Ukrainian leader complained about being left out of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/18/us-russia-ukraine-talks-riyadh-saudi-arabia">talks between the US and Russia</a> over ending the Ukraine war, and increased pressure on Zelenskyy to hold elections – echoing one of Moscow’s key demands. A French government spokesperson said Paris didn’t “understand the logic very well” of Trump’s suggestion that Zelenskyy was to blame for Russia’s invasion of his country and the resulting war.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The escalating war of words between the two leaders represents the deepest rift between Kyiv and its most powerful ally since Russia’s full-scale invasion nearly three years ago. </strong>The unprecedented escalation comes after senior US and Russian officials met in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to discuss the war in Ukraine as well as economic and political cooperation, talks from which Kyiv and Europe were excluded. Canadian prime minister <strong>Justin Trudeau</strong> urged that Ukraine must be part of any talks about its future.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russian president Vladimir Putin said Ukraine would not be excluded from negotiations to end the war, </strong>and rejected claims that Moscow had rejected talks with Europe or Kyiv. On Trump, Putin said the US president had begun receiving “objective information” about the war in Ukraine, which led him to “change his position.” He added that he was happy to meet with Trump, and said he “highly rated” the results of the Russia-US summit in Riyadh.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said there can be no Russia-Ukraine peace deal without the participation of Ukraine and Europe. </strong>“We are in close contact with our US counterparts. So what they are saying is they are trying to find out whether Russia even wants peace, because so far they haven’t wanted peace,” Kallas told a press conference in Cape Town.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Sweden and Poland agreed to “strengthen and deepen cooperation” politically and in civil protection and civil defence,</strong> citing the worsened security situation across Europe. The statement of intent pledges to work together to improve national resilience and preparedness strategies, provide Ukraine support on strengthening national resilience and improve resilience and security in the Baltic region – particularly on critical infrastructure.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Denmark’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen announced the country needs a “massive rearmament” to avoid war</strong> as she announced Denmark will spend 50bn DKK over the next two years on defence. The investment brings Denmark’s defence spending up to 3% of GDP in the next two years (up from 2.4% in 2024). It comes after coming under huge pressure from the Trump administration over Greenland and its recent comments on cutting support to Europe and Ukraine.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Europe’s leading human rights official criticised US vice-president JD Vance’s “very problematic” speech on European democracy, </strong>offering an implicit rebuke to Vance’s take on free speech and politics across the continent. The Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe, <strong>Michael O’Flaherty,</strong> challenged Vance’s claim that Europe had abandoned its values <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/feb/19/russia-ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskyy-vladimir-putin-donald-trump-europe-latest-news?page=with:block-67b5ef0d8f08d2b5975a99c1#block-67b5ef0d8f08d2b5975a99c1">in an interview with the Guardian.</a></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>EU sanctions against Russia will be extended to cover aluminium imports and dozens more “shadow” vessels covertly exporting Russian oil below a price cap imposed by western allies. </strong>The new package, 16th since the full scale invasion in 2022, includes a ban on imports of Russian aluminium into the EU, said by EU officials to generate significant revenues for Russia. The approval of the package carries extra weight, amid fears in Brussels that Trump will seek to lift US sanctions against Russia as part of his effort to make a peace deal.</p></li>

  <p><strong>Vlad, a 25-year-old lawyer from Kyiv</strong>, was among scores of <strong>Ukrainians</strong> who shared with the Guardian how they felt about the <strong>Trump</strong> administration-led talks with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>“This ‘deal’ [would mean] the capitulation of Ukraine, creating a nonsense precedent of violating international law, and humanitarian law,” he said. He felt incredulous that Russia, the “aggressor and occupier”, could be given control of the occupied territories, without having to pay reparations for the reconstruction of Ukraine, and the prospect of there not being legal prosecution of the Russian government.</p> 
  <p>“I am just enraged with the frustration and injustice I feel right now,” Vlad said. “Thousands of young men, people I know, died, only for this to happen.”</p> 
  <p>President Zelenskyy, he said, had done “a good job on beating the Russian invasion in the beginning”, but had made “lots of mistakes” later on during his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/31/tired-mood-changed-ukrainian-army-desertion-crisis">mobilisation drive</a> and with his appointment of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/26/ukraines-agriculture-minister-detained-in-multimillion-dollar-corruption-probe">certain ministers</a> that were accused of corruption.</p> 
  <p>“However, the EU and the USA did not help us as they planned and told us,” he added. “The impotent policy of [president Biden’s national security advisor] Jake Sullivan and the EU are the main reason the war did not end at the end of 2022, when Russia was at its lowest point.”</p> 
  <p><strong>Anhelina, 27, an administrator from Uman, Cherkasy oblast</strong>, was among scores of Ukrainians who decried that talks about ending the war had so far excluded Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>“The United States plays a significant role in the negotiation process, but the perspectives of European countries and Ukraine must be taken into account. We must ensure that the negotiation process is structured in a way that does not put Russia in a position of strength. We must understand that Putin does not want peace.”</p> 
  <p>Although she said she only supported some of Zelenskyy’s internal affairs policies, she did fully support his foreign policy. “I did not vote for him in the last presidential election and am unsure if I will vote for him in the next one. However, I am not opposed to having him as the president of Ukraine.”</p> 
  <p>Holding elections now, she said, would be “highly inappropriate”, as many were currently serving on the front lines or busy doing volunteer work because of the war.</p> 
  <p>“From what I observe in my surroundings,” she added, “the majority of Ukrainians who voted for him in the past would vote for him again.”</p>

  <p><strong>Italy</strong> is aiming to develop its own low-orbit satellites for government communications, its industry minister said on Wednesday, presenting it as an alternative to systems provided by <strong>Elon Musk</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Prime minister <strong>Giorgia Meloni’s</strong> government had previously said it was considering the use of Musk’s Starlink satellites to provide encrypted communications between officials operating in risky areas, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>But this suggestion was criticised by opposition politicians, who questioned the wisdom of handing a national security contract to a foreign entrepreneur who is also part of the US government under president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>.</p> 
  <p>“We are in fact working on the creation of a national low-orbit satellite system developed independently, with the involvement of the main national players,” minister Adolfo Urso said in the lower house of parliament.</p> 
  <p>Urso, a member of Meloni’s right-wing Brothers of Italy party, said that would offer a competitive alternative to infrastructure provided by other global operators, including Musk.</p> 
  <p>Urso did not give a timing for the development of the project and did not specify which companies the government had called in, but said the national space agency would carry out a feasibility study.</p> 
  <p>Musk has a warm relationship with Meloni and said last month he would be ready to offer his services to Italy.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Leading human rights official criticises Vance's 'problematic' take on Europe</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Europe’s</strong> leading human rights official has criticised <strong>JD Vance’s</strong> “very problematic” speech on <strong>European</strong> democracy, offering an implicit rebuke to the <strong>US vice-president’s</strong> take on free speech and politics across the continent.</p> 
  <p>The Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe, Michael O’Flaherty, told the Guardian that the US vice-president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/14/jd-vance-stuns-munich-conference-with-blistering-attack-on-europes-leaders">speech to the Munich Security Council last week </a>had been “very problematic” and challenged Vance’s claim that Europe had abandoned its values.</p> 
  <p>“Europe, for all its flaws, for all its faults, can pride itself on its sustained effort to deliver on respect for human beings through its commitment to human rights,” he said in an interview in Brussels.</p> 
  <p>Vance, O’Flaherty said, seemed “to demand some kind of absolute free speech”, while European law had always imposed limits on what people can say, for example to avoid attacks on individuals and groups.</p> 
  <p>As well as an attack on Europe’s efforts to curb disinformation, Vance also appeared to suggest that<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/14/munich-car-attack-believed-to-have-had-islamist-motive-says-prosecutor"> a recent attack by an Afghan asylum seeker in Munic</a>h that injured at least 36 people was typical.</p> 
  <p>O’Flaherty responded:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I challenge the implication in Vice President Vance’s speech that migrants are the root of all evil in Europe. This is a much-repeated myth, which is dangerous because it puts people’s lives at risk.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>O’Flaherty works for the Council of Europe, the pan-European human rights organisation, with 46 member countries from Iceland to Azerbaijan.</p> 
  <p>The Irish lawyer is particularly concerned about human rights in Ukraine, at a moment when Donald Trump has opened talks with Vladimir Putin, sidelined Kyiv and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/19/trump-ukraine-war-russia-could-have-made-a-deal">blamed Ukraine for being invaded by Russia</a>.</p> 
  <p>O’Flaherty said he was disturbed by “false attributions of responsibility in the discourse right now”, pointing out this war was “Russian aggression against a sovereign country”.</p> 
  <p>While he said he could not comment on current talks, he stressed “it is essential that human rights are full front and centre in terms of any outcomes for Ukraine”, referring to kidnapped Ukrainian children, Ukrainian prisoners, people living in occupied territories in eastern Ukraine and Crimea, as well as the need for justice, and compensation for those who had lost everything.</p> 
  <p>The Council of Europe has played <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/04/foundations-laid-for-tribunal-to-try-putin-for-ukraine-invasion-eu-says">a leading role in trying to organise an international tribunal that would try Russia for the crime of aggression.</a> The Council of Europe, O’Flaherty said, would continue to “insist on a peace with justice, because a peace without justice is an unreliable thing at risk of unraveling in time”.</p>

   <p>Think of it, a modestly successful comedian, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, talked the United States of America into spending $350 Billion Dollars, to go into a War that couldn’t be won, that never had to start, but a War that he, without the U.S. and “TRUMP,” will never be able to settle.

  <p>Trump called <strong>Zelenskyy</strong> a “dictator without elections” after the <strong>Ukrainian</strong> leader earlier on Wednesday accused Trump of being trapped in a “disinformation bubble.”</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Zelenskyy admits that half of the money we sent him is “MISSING.” He refuses to have Elections, is very low in Ukrainian Polls, and the only thing he was good at was playing Biden “like a fiddle.” A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the War with Russia, something all admit only “TRUMP,” and the Trump Administration, can do. Biden never tried, Europe has failed to bring Peace, and Zelenskyy probably wants to keep the “gravy train” going. I love Ukraine, but Zelenskyy has done a terrible job, his Country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died – And so it continues…..</p>

  <p>He also praised the US-Russia talks, saying their purpose was to increase trust between the two countries, and that the two sides acted without ‘bias or judgment’.</p> 
  <p>We will bring you more of his comments when we have them.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Nordics correspondent</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Sweden</strong> and <strong>Poland</strong> have agreed to “strengthen and deepen cooperation” politically and in civil protection and civil defence, citing the worsened security situation across Europe.</p> 
  <p>The statement of intent, which is not legally binding but was signed by the Polish interior minister <strong>Tomasz Siemoniak</strong> and Swedish civil defence minister <strong>Carl-Oskar Bohlin</strong> in Stockholm, pledges to work together to <strong>improve national resilience and preparedness strategies</strong>, provide Ukraine support on strengthening national resilience and improve resilience and security in the Baltic region – particularly on critical infrastructure.</p> 
  <p>The letter, seen by the Guardian, also said they would cooperate on “<strong>identifying and analysing hybrid threats</strong> and countering its consequences”.</p> 
  <p>The agreement said:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>Our geographical location in Central and Northern Europe, at the shores of the Baltic Sea, entails shared security challenges and calls for joint action.</em></p> 
   <p><em>The fundamentally worsened security situation in Europe following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the new dimension of Poland’s and Sweden’s relationship as allies in NATO, provide further rationale for deepening our partnership.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Both Poland and Sweden have been on the frontline in supporting Ukraine, politically as well as through military and civilian support. We will remain steadfast in our support for as long as it takes.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The letter added that the two countries “have a <strong>clear joint ambition</strong> to contribute to a secure, safe, and prosperous Europe.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Brussels correspondent</em></p> 
  <p>The European Council President <strong>António Costa</strong> has <strong>no plans to call an emergency EU summit to discuss the Ukraine war,</strong> according to EU sources.</p> 
  <p>An emergency summit of the EU’s 27 leaders had been rumoured, in the wake of French President Emmanuel Macron’s decision to host two meetings of EU leaders to discuss the war in response to Donald Trump’s talks with Russia. </p> 
  <p>Macron hosted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/europe-at-turning-point-as-leaders-meet-in-paris-to-discuss-ukraine-crisis">crisis talks at the Élysee on Monday</a>, which brought together the EU’s largest member states and the Nato secretary-general. He is also convening a video conference later on Wednesday with presidents and prime ministers of smaller countries, who were not invited to the first gathering.</p> 
  <p>An EU official said there were no plans “at this point” for a special European Council. </p> 
  <p>“Organising an extraordinary EUCO is not excluded either, but its purpose would be to produce results,” said the official, who added that Costa had begun consultations with EU leaders on two themes – EU support to Ukraine and security guarantees.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Southern Africa correspondent</em></p> 
  <p>There can be no Russia-Ukraine peace deal without the participation of Ukraine and Europe, the European Union’s foreign policy chief <strong>Kaja Kallas</strong> said, after meeting with her South African counterpart <strong>Ronald Lamola</strong> before the two-day G20 foreign ministers meeting starts tomorrow in <strong>South Africa.</strong></p> 
  <p>“We are in close contact with our US counterparts. So what they are saying is they are trying to find out whether Russia even wants peace, because <strong>so far they haven’t wanted peace,</strong>” Kallas told a press conference in Cape Town.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>It’s clear for any kind of peace deal to work it has to have Ukraine and Europe on board, because otherwise it will just not function. Because the implementation is in Europe, is in Ukraine.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump's comments not intended to be accurate, but to shock, UK's ex-PM Johnson says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Former British prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> has sought to defend <strong>Donald Trum</strong>p from criticism about his words on Ukraine, making a somewhat unusual argument that “Trump’s statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action.”</p> 
  <p>Here is <a href="https://x.com/BorisJohnson/status/1892174821368201619">what he said</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>When are we Europeans going to stop being scandalised about Donald Trump and start helping him to end this war? </em></p> 
   <p><em>Of course Ukraine didn’t start the war. You might as well say that America attacked Japan at Pearl Harbor. </em></p> 
   <p><em>Of course a country undergoing a violent invasion should not be staging elections. There was no general election in the UK from 1935 to 1945. </em></p> 
   <p><em>Of course Zelenskyy’s ratings are not 4%. They are actually about the same as Trump’s. </em></p> 
   <p><em>Trump’s statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action. </em></p> 
   <p><em>In particular the US can see $300bn of frozen Russian assets - mainly in Belgium. That is cash that could and should be used to pay Ukraine and compensate the US for its support. </em></p> 
   <p><em>Why is Europe preventing the unfreezing of Putin’s cash? </em></p> 
   <p><em>The US believes Belgium, France and other countries are blocking. It’s absurd. We need to get serious and fast.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Zelenskyy</strong> says the US “have helped Putin to come out of isolation” which he says was “completely fair because of their full scale invasion” on Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>He also rebukes Trump’s comments that most of Ukraine’s support comes from the US.</p> 
  <p>“The truth is somewhere else,” he says, but adds he remains “grateful for the support” and wants “the Trump team to have true facts.”</p> 
  <p>He goes on about the talks:</p> 
  <p>“This isn’t positive for Ukraine. What it does is that they’re bringing Putin out of isolation, and the Russians are happy because the discussion focuses on them,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He adds that Russia seems to be presenting itself “as a victim, and that is something new.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Zelenskyy says Trump 'lives in disinformation bubble' with discord sowed by Russia</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Zelenskyy</strong> now responds to Trump’s comments overnight.</p> 
  <p>He says that he “never comments on popularity ratings, especially my own or other leaders,” but he points out that the latest poll shows 58% of Ukrainian trust him.</p> 
  <p>“So if anyone wants to replace me right now, that will not work,” he says.</p> 
  <p>He also calls out “a lot of disinformation coming from Russia,” as he says that these figures seem to be shared with the US.</p> 
  <p>“Unfortunately, President Trump, with all due respect for him as the leader of a nation that we respect greatly … is living in this disinformation bubble,” he says.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy says he will look into collecting more data on trust in key global leaders to counter Russian disinformation, as he says he warns against “the misinformation circle around President Trump,” which he says includes representatives linked with Hungarian and Slovak governments.</p> 
  <p>“This is all concerning. Everything they are doing is to make sure that Ukraine is weak,” he says.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Russian officials seize on Trump's false claim on Zelenskyy's approval rating</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Russian affairs reporter</em></p> 
  <p>Russian officials on Wednesday seized on Donald Trump’s latest remarks, in which he questioned Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s legitimacy as Ukraine’s president.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on Tuesday evening, <strong>Trump falsely claimed</strong> that Zelenskyy’s approval rating was “at 4%” and described Ukraine as a country “blown to smithereens.”</p> 
  <p>While Zelenskyy’s popularity has declined in recent months, <strong>a fresh February poll</strong> by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) found that <strong>57% of Ukrainians trusted the president</strong>, up from 52% a month earlier.</p> 
  <p>Pyotr Tolstoy, a senior member of Russia’s State Duma, called Trump’s remarks “significant” and suggested they would be “of great interest to those who call themselves politicians in Kyiv.”</p> 
  <p>Russia will be counting on <strong>Trump’s remarks to sow discord among Kyiv’s political elites and society at large,</strong> potentially weakening Ukraine’s ability to resist Russian forces.</p> 
  <p>Putin has previously dismissed negotiations with Zelenskyy, claiming his presidency is “illegitimate.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Russian foreign minister <strong>Sergei Lavrov</strong> is speaking in the Russian parliament in Moscow.</p> 
  <p>He says that Russian diplomacy is “carrying out tasks set by the President, who has talked about it in details at his annual press conference and in many interviews.”</p> 
  <p>But he talks about the broader change in global politics:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>I will tell you <strong>something that is a key issue</strong> for us at this stage of international development, and <strong>that is our move towards a multipolar world</strong>. It is a historic process, and it is to do with the subjective trend of new power centres appearing on the world map.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He continues:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>Our partners in the Global South and in the east are unique civilisations and religions and are members of various integration associations, but all of them are united by a desire towards development, progressive development without external pressure…</em> </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He then turns to attack the West, amusingly trying to portray Russia as the leader of “progressive humanity” revolting against the West’s dominance in global politics.</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>At the same time, we must state that the collective West, although verbally are in agreement and accepting the multipolar realities, in reality, they still want to preserve their former dominance in the West.</em></p> 
   <p>…</p> 
   <p><em>The collective West cannot unite and is unable to renounce the selfish habits that it was governed by in the last five centuries when it ruled the world.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>in Brussels</em></p> 
  <p><strong>EU</strong> sanctions against <strong>Russia</strong> will be <strong>extended to cover aluminium imports and dozens more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/04/us-and-european-shipowners-sold-230-ageing-tankers-to-russian-shadow-fleet">“shadow” vessels</a></strong> covertly exporting Russian oil below a price cap imposed by western allies.</p> 
  <p>The approval of the package carries extra weight, amid fears in Brussels that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will seek to <strong>lift US sanctions</strong> against Russia as part of his effort to make a peace deal.</p> 
  <p>The new package, 16th since the full scale invasion in 2022, includes <strong>a ban on imports of Russian aluminium into the EU,</strong> said by EU officials to generate significant revenues for Russia. A further <strong>73 vessels</strong> believed to be circumventing the oil price cap will be banned from EU ports, although that does not cover all the ageing tankers thought to be helping Russia evade sanctions.</p> 
  <p>A total of <strong>48 people</strong> and <strong>35 entities</strong> face asset freezes and travel bans, although their names have not been revealed. The EU is also removing broadcasting licences from 8 Russian media outlets and excluding 13 banks from Swift international payments system.</p> 
  <p>In an earlier draft the EU planned to stop the sale of games consoles and joysticks to Russia, which are thought to be repurposed for use in drone warfare. Diplomatic sources did not immediately confirm if these items made the final list, ahead of the expected publication of the sanctions next week.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>You just never know where things are going to go with <strong>US president Donald Trump.</strong></p> 
  <p>When he started talking about <strong>Ukraine</strong> last night, at first, he appeared to give his approval to the idea of deploying European peacekeeping forces there (<strong>“all for</strong>” and <strong>“fine”</strong>) and said he had no plans for pulling out US troops from Europe, despite some suggestions that Russia’s Putin would ask him to do that. So far, so good.</p> 
  <p>But the longer his statement continued, the worse it became for Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Trump eventually said that <strong>Zelenskyy “should have never started it,</strong> ... could have made a deal,” as if it was Ukraine who invaded Russia and not the other way round, and repeated Russian key demands for elections in Ukraine, with unfounded allegations on president Zelenskyy’s poor approval rating.</p> 
  <p>This will ring alarm bells in Ukraine and across Europe again.</p> 
  <p>The US president also said last night that he was “much more confident” of a deal after the talks, adding “they were very good,” and that Russia “want to stop the savage barbarism.”</p> 
  <p>(Whisper it, but they can do it quite easily, being the ones who invaded.)</p>

  <p>As <strong>Sean Savett,</strong> who was the spokesperson for the White House National Security Council under then-president <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, said <a href="https://x.com/ssavett/status/1891972009380245505">more bluntly in a social media post:</a> “Sounds like Trump bought Putin’s propaganda hook, line, and sinker.</p> 
  <p>On Tuesday, US state secretary <strong>Marco Rubio</strong> debriefed the Quint – France, Germany, Italy and the UK – and the European Union on the talks, promising they will stay “in close contact as we work to achieve a durable end to the conflict in Ukraine.”</p> 
  <p>But EU foreign policy chief <strong>Kaja Kallas</strong> issued a pointed warning: “Russia will try to divide us. Let’s not walk into their traps.”</p> 
  <p>One issue that was discussed during last night’s talks was a proposed moratorium on attacks on the energy infrastructure of Russia and Ukraine. It was rejected by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, who insisted at his press conference that the Russians would never do that anyway as they only attack legitimate military targets.</p> 
  <p>You will be shocked – <em>shocked!</em> – to hear that Ukraine reported overnight a Russian attack on energy infrastructure in the southern region of <strong>Odesa</strong>, leaving at least 160,000 residents without heating and power. It is -7 degrees Celsius there.</p>

The invitees reportedly include <strong>Norway, Canada, the Baltic states, the Czech Republic, Greece, Finland, Romania, Sweden</strong> and <strong>Belgium</strong>. We are yet to formally hear about it from the Élysée Palace.</p>
