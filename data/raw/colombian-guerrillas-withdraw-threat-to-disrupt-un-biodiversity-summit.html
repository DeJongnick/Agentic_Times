<p>A dissident rebel group has backed down from its threat to disrupt the UN biodiversity summit in Colombia later this year.</p> <p>The Central General Staff (EMC), a guerrilla faction that rejected the country’s 2016 peace agreement, said on Wednesday it would order its militants not to target the Cop16 negotiations that are due to begin in Cali in October.</p> <p>Earlier in July, the EMC <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/18/colombia-safe-un-biodiversity-summit-rebels-threat-aoe">released statements online</a> saying the summit “would fail”, prompting concerns that rebels would attack the conference.</p> <p>The group’s leader, Nestor Gregorio, better known by the nom de guerre Iván Mordisco, said in a video message on X: “We’ve decided, as a gesture of our will for peace, to order our units not to affect the normal development of the Cop16 that will be held soon in the city of Cali.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/18/colombia-safe-un-biodiversity-summit-rebels-threat-aoe">Colombia gives assurances over UN biodiversity summit after rebels’ threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On 16 July, the Colombian defence ministry <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombian-government-calls-off-ceasefire-with-units-emc-armed-group-2024-07-16/">ended a ceasefire</a> with parts of the EMC led by Mordisco, because of rising violence.
