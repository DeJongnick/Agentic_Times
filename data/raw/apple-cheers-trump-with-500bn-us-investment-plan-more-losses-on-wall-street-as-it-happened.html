Merz’s comments suggests the new Germany government is now serious about boosting defence spending to fill the gap potentially left by the US pivoting away from European defence.</p> <p>“The next question will be whether the new coalition government in Germany can sufficiently loosen its fiscal rules to boost defence spending. Germany currently spends a little over 2% of GDP on defence. While this meets the 2% target set by NATO in 2014, it is increasingly seen as inadequate in the current geopolitical climate. Mark Rutte, the current head of NATO, has noted spending will have to go higher than 3%, while the Trump administration is demanding 5%.</p> <p>But with the risk of US disengagement from Europe now so acute, this question moves beyond reaching pre-agreed spending targets and instead becomes: how Europe can develop the capability to defend itself without an American defence backstop?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href="https://click.m.capitaleconomics.com/?qs=09ed82548455b77954a0d35b078c4ef98e07e53d3774c5aac231e038c41505426e236c484c6bff797c4f8a198b6f5d2ea09c76acdae0e4fab1bb8781386bec1e">Neil Shearing</a>,</strong> group chief economist at <strong>Capital</strong> <strong>Economics</strong>, agrees that European governments are likely to face “significant pressure” to lift defence spending.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The head-spinning events of the past two weeks – including the suggestion last night by German Chancellor-elect Friedrich Mertz that Europe should seek “strategic independence” from the US – have led many to declare the end of the post-war trans-Atlantic alliance and the start of a new period of geopolitical realignment.</p> <p>However, thinking through what “strategic independence” might mean in practice reveals the extent of the ties between the US and Europe.

A Grand Coalition is currently viewed as the favorite, as it signifies stability and continuity. </p> <p>While the long-term performance of the DAX is primarily driven by the international competitiveness of its listed companies, the current political outlook provides an additional incentive. Investors believe that Germany may soon have a government capable of initiating new growth impulses, thus bringing an end to the disputes that characterized the previous three-party coalition under the Ampel government.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Stanzl </strong>cautions, though, that caution is warranted: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Despite the optimism, the recent trend of profit-taking that began in the last two weeks could continue. The robust gains in the DAX this morning largely hinge on the perception that a coalition between the CDU/CSU and the SPD is the least problematic in addressing current challenges. At the same time, US President Donald Trump is likely to abandon his relatively gentle stance toward the EU and Germany soon. Whether the new government in Berlin can effectively navigate its relationship with Trump will become clearer in the coming weeks.</p> <p>Friedrich Merz now faces the significant challenge of addressing a multitude of issues—from stagnant economic growth and Russia’s war in Ukraine to the looming threat of a global trade war, which could further burden Germany’s struggling industrial sector. Promptly tackling these challenges will be crucial for the new government’s success.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67bc20e78f086d3992205b68" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-02-24T07:48:26.121Z">7.48am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Just Eat Takeaway to be taken over in €4bn deal</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>There’s also takeover excitement in Europe this morning, with investment group Prosus announcing a bid for Just Eat Takewaway.com.</strong></p> <p>Prosus says it plans to create a “European tech champion” of food delivery, and has made an all-cash offer to buy Just Eat’s shares, currently traded in Amsterdam, for €4.1bn.</p> <p>The deal comes two months after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2024/nov/27/no-need-to-mourn-exit-of-just-eat-takeaway-from-london-stock-exchange">Just Eat delisted from the London Stock Market</a>, after a turbulent few years in which it merged with rival Takeaway.com, then agreed to buy the US-based app Grubhub for $7.3bn, only to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/13/just-eat-takeaway-to-sell-us-arm-grubhub-in-cut-price-deal">sell it four years later for just $650m</a>.</p> <p>Just Eat’s shares have fallen over 85% over the last five years, as the surge early in the Covid-19 pandemic has faded.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-02-24T07:52:01.835Z">at 7.52am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-67bc20a38f086d3992205b66" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-02-24T07:33:46.649Z">7.33am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Germany’s <strong>MDAX</strong> share index, which contains medium-sized, domestically focused companies, is on track to jump 1.25% when trading begins this morning, <em>Reuters reports</em>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67bc1c0c8f086d3992205b4a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-02-24T07:30:51.218Z">7.30am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Deutsche Bank: concerned that grand coalition would not have a constitutional majority</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Analysts at Deutsche Bank are hopeful that Germany will benefit from a “more effective government coalition in the next four years”.</strong></p> <p>But, they are also concerned that a grand coalition between the <strong>CDU/CSU</strong> and the <strong>SPD</strong> would not have a constitutional majority (two-thirds of seats) even if it allied with the <strong>Greens</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Deutsche</strong> say:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This means that any constitutional changes, including to the debt brake, would rely on the support of either the Left or the AfD.

The Left would like to ditch the debt brake. However, its agenda (soak the rich, spend more on welfare and less on defence) is the very opposite of the Merz agenda.
