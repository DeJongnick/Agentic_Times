<p>The artist David Shrigley is right to say that “Stem” – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – should be changed to “Steam” to include the arts (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2024/oct/28/david-shrigley-urges-schools-to-prioritise-arts-with-aid-of-giant-mantis">David Shrigley urges schools to prioritise arts – with aid of giant mantis, 28 October</a>). </p> <p>Birmingham City University is proud to have developed the UK’s first Ofqual-recognised primary Steam teaching qualification, alongside our arts, design and media faculty. The new qualification, trialled successfully in Birmingham and set to launch nationally next year, equips primary school teachers with advanced skills in areas such as computer-aided design, 3D printing and robotics in an innovative learning environment, while bringing design thinking and creative problem-solving to the forefront of primary education.</p> <p>We want to inspire the next generation of innovators and problem solvers, and part of this priority is to give teachers training from industry experts on how to lead interdisciplinary projects, integrate cutting-edge technology, and apply human-centred design thinking in their classrooms.<br><strong>Jan Gilder</strong><br><em>Steam programme manager, </em><a href="https://steamhouse.org.uk/"><em>STEAMhouse</em></a><em>, Birmingham</em></p> <p>• Your report rehearses the familiar argument that children’s creativity is “stymied by the narrow focus on maths and the sciences”. This is not necessarily true – great creativity is taught and required in all subjects. Creativity is not only nurtured from arts teaching. Theoretical physicists can create from a pencil and paper.</p> <p>The narrow focus misses the great new wave of enthusiasm for subjects such as maths, biosciences, computer science, medicine, philosophy and economics. The shift in subjects students choose to take is a reflection of their own background and their own desires, however much governments like to think they have any influence at all.</p> <p>Of course the arts are so important, and I hope all subjects flourish. But do not indirectly damn young students for their choices and their expression of creativity and academic ambition.<br><strong>Neil Mendoza</strong><br><em>Provost, Oriel College, Oxford</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
