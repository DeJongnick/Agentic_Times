<p>Rather than chase after people who have not claimed what they are owed (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/23/benefits-unclaimed-vulnerable-pension-credit-government">Forget ‘benefit cheats’ – £23bn a year is going unclaimed. How do we get that to vulnerable people?, 23 December</a>), the restoration of universal benefits without means tests, for all children and all pensioners, would be simpler and fairer. The better-off then pay their share through higher income tax. That&nbsp;is&nbsp;how a welfare state works.<br><strong>Dr Sebastian Kraemer</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• My husband and I received letters from the DWP recently to say we’d not be getting our fuel allowance this year, total value around £300. However, the same department failed to write and inform me of my six years’ loss of pension, total value in excess of £50,000. Where is the logic in that (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/dec/22/waspi-decision-will-lead-to-voters-deserting-labour">Letters, 22 December</a>)?<br><strong>Kate Rous</strong><br><em>Walpole, Suffolk</em></p> <p>• Poorna Bell doesn’t mention the irritation of being on holiday with someone who has brought all their WhatsApp friends with them (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/27/holidays-voicenotes-whatsapp-ban-notifications">I imposed a holiday WhatsApp ban – but would my friends and family respect it?, 27 December</a>). Constant pings and a seeming need to immediately respond makes one wonder whose company they really prefer.<br><strong>John Warburton</strong><br><em>Edinburgh</em></p> <p>• Why doesn’t WhatsApp offer the&nbsp;“out of office” automatic response that protects us from intrusive work emails?<br><strong>Bill Kingdom</strong><br><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>• Re Joe Cocker’s observations (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/25/theres-no-reason-for-older-people-to-fear-smartphones">Letters, 25 December</a>), at nearly 70, I’m not great with my smartphone, but I get by with a little help from my friends. <br><strong>Phil Sinnott </strong><br><em>Crosby, Merseyside</em></p> <p>• Could your readers trying to spot Eddies, Nobbies, Pottos, Willies and Wiseman dairy lorries on the motorway (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/27/you-need-more-than-nobbies-and-stobbies-for-a-motorway-grand-slam">Letters, 27 December</a>) please concentrate on driving? I’d&nbsp;feel an awful lot safer.<br><strong>Melvyn Ellis</strong><br><em>Harrogate, North Yorkshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Do you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?
