<p>A (small) number of US Senate Republicans issued a legislative rebuke to president Donald Trump’s world-rattling trade tariffs in a rare alignment with their Democratic counterparts.</p> <p>Four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – joined the opposition party, voting 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs on more than 100 nations that the president put into place via executive order.</p> <p>It was the third time the Republicans have voted alongside Democrats on a tariff resolution this week, previously rallying to end tariffs targeting Brazil and Canada.</p> <p>Going against Trump is rare for Republicans in his second term. But despite the opposition in the Senate, the House is unlikely to take any similar action. House Republicans created a rule earlier this year that will block resolutions on the tariffs from getting a floor vote.</p>  <h2>US Senate votes to reject Trump’s global tariffs on more than 100 countries</h2>  <p>The US Senate took a stand against Donald Trump’s global tariffs affecting more than 100 countries on Thursday, voting to nullify the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs.</p> <p>The tariff resolutions are a rebuke to the tariffs themselves and to Trump overstepping his authority and bypassing Congress. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, told reporters that the symbolic opposition should catch the president’s attention.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/senate-vote-trump-tariffs"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US will limit number of refugees and give priority to white South Africans</h2>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is going to restrict the number of refugees it admits into the United States next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans.</p> <p>The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.</p> <p>The administration published the news on Thursday in a notice on the Federal Registry.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-refugee-restrictions-white-south-africans"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump-Xi meeting: US president says rare earths deal and tariff cut agreed</h2>  <p>Donald Trump has described crucial trade talks with the Chinese president in South Korea as “amazing”, saying their dispute over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/trump-and-xi-meet-in-south-korea-for-crunch-talks-on-trade">supply of rare earths</a> had been settled and that he would visit China in April.</p> <p>Xi Jinping has not commented on Thursday’s discussions but noted that the economic and trade teams from both countries had “reached a basic consensus on addressing our respective major concerns” during recent talks in Kuala Lumpur, according to Chinese state media.
