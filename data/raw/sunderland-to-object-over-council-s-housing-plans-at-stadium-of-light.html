<p>Sunderland are preparing a formal objection over council plans to build housing within 23 metres of the Stadium of Light. The club fear the scheme would leave the stadium landlocked, preventing any future capacity increase.</p> <p>Sunderland city council is expected to submit plans this week for 600 apartments and townhouses to be built behind the South Stand of the 49,000-seat stadium, on a former industrial estate.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jul/30/transfer-news-granit-xhaka-sunderland-premier-league">‘I felt the energy’: Granit Xhaka joins Sunderland on three-year contract</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The club recently submitted a pre-planning application for a redevelopment of the South Stand and believe the project would erase an agreed buffer zone. The stadium is vital to the local economy, hosts regular music concerts and has staged England senior football internationals.</p> <p>The former club chair Sir Bob Murray, who oversaw the stadium’s construction, said: “This is not just poor planning, it’s a disgrace. You don’t strangle your greatest asset and call it progress.”</p> <p>The council says there would still be room for stadium expansion. Murray recognises the need for new housing in the area but believes the current plans are sited too close to the stadium. “I helped shape protections,” said Murray of the buffer zone. “The council agreed them and now they’ve torn them up. I’m aware the club will formally object and I fully support their position. The council’s plans are shameful, shortsighted and completely unacceptable.</p> <p>“There’s been no real consultation, no transparency and no accountability. The council is trying to rewrite its own rules behind closed doors – and in doing so it risks sabotaging a major driver of jobs, pride and regeneration for ever.”</p> <p>Murray is demanding the council withdraw the applications. “This isn’t just about football, it’s about Sunderland’s identity, investment and ambition,” he said. “If this plan goes ahead the city will regret it for decades.”</p> <p>Patrick Melia, the council’s chief executive, said: “We have held extensive discussions with Sir Bob Murray in relation to this development and have acknowledged his comments.</p> <p>“Robust assurances have been given that the proposed Sheepfolds development will not impact on any planned future expansion of the Stadium of Light or its ability to host matches, concerts or other events. The council has sought specialist expertise in developing the proposals that are currently out for consultation.”</p>
