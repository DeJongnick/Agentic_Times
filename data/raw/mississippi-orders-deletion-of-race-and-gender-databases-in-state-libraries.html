<p>The Mississippi library commission, which offers services such as specialized research assistance to libraries in the state, has ordered the deletion of two research collections: the race relations database and the gender studies database. The collections were stored in what’s called the Magnolia database, which is used by publicly funded schools, libraries, universities and state agencies in Mississippi.</p> <p>The commission’s executive director, Hulen Bivins, confirmed the deletion to the Guardian, and said: “We may lose a lot of materials.”</p> <p>“All of the states, we are in dire shape,” he said. “We have had a reconsideration of everything with regard to what Doge [is doing].”</p> <p>The so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), which has sent shockwaves through federal agencies and departments since its creation when the second Trump administration began, all but axed the Institute of Library and Museum Services (IMLS) in March by putting nearly all of its employees on administrative leave. The independent federal agency provides resources and support to libraries, archives and museums in all 50 states and territories. Earlier that month, Trump signed <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/">an executive order</a> that called for the IMLS to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law” within seven days.</p> <p>The fallout from losing the IMLS is not restricted to Mississippi, Bivins said, but is something of concern for every state. Washington, which is one of 21 states <a href="https://www.atg.wa.gov/news/news-releases/washington-one-21-states-suing-trump-protect-libraries-museums-and-other-small">suing the Trump administration</a> over the dismantling of the IMLS and other agencies, was notified last Wednesday that it <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/federal-funding-pulled-from-wa-state-libraries/">will not receive a $3.9m grant</a> from the IMLS’s “grants to states program”. California and Connecticut, both of which are also suing the Trump administration, have been notified that they will not receive a <a href="https://www.kcra.com/article/california-state-library-federal-grant-terminated/64390597">$15.7m grant</a> and the <a href="https://www.middletownpress.com/connecticut/article/ct-state-library-federal-grant-money-trump-20267010.php">$1.2m</a> remainder of a $2.2m grant, respectively.</p> <p>“The rest of the states, us included, await our fate. In essence, we’re waiting to find out: do we get any more money between now and June 30?” Bivins said, referencing the end of Mississippi’s fiscal year. “Or are we going to get the allotment that was scheduled to be given to us? We can’t know at this point because IMLS has been totally closed, just like many other entities under the Doge. And with regard to libraries, we don’t know who to contact, who to call, anything.”</p> <p>With federal funding uncertain, state library agencies must look to their respective states for funding. In the <a href="https://www.cswe.org/advocacy-policy/dei-ban-and-restrictions-tracker/">16 states where anti-diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) bills are law</a>, that means complying with whatever that state’s legislature deems necessary.</p> <p>“It’s going to affect every state because every state is going to have to make their own decisions,” Bivins said. “But what will happen is we’re not going to have the resources to help the people that are in the educational process or people’s business needs. If the library doesn’t have support, the library will have to close … If you don’t have libraries, if we defund across the board, we’re going to have a situation where who knows what’s going to happen.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/libraries-trump-administration">Being a librarian was already hard.

We’ve had to stop our statewide e-book network because we don’t have enough money to pay for the e-books between now and the 30th of June,” he said. “Everybody is doing cuts and re-evaluations and looking at everything. It’s a tragic story.”</p>
