 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Thanks for following along with us tonight for the treasurers’ debate, as <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> and <strong>Angus Taylor</strong> went head to head for the first time. Here are the key takeaways from the debate:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>The treasurer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f63eba8f084f01d2573d17#block-67f63eba8f084f01d2573d17">kicked off the debate</a> by saying Labor’s economic plan has Australia well-placed to face “uncertain times in the world,” by building on the progress from the past three years.</p></li> 
   <li><p>In his opening remarks, the shadow treasurer claimed Australians were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f63f268f087f8f33468447#block-67f63f268f087f8f33468447">worse off now</a> than they were three years ago.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Chalmers took aim at the Coalition more broadly, saying the party was “full of these kind of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f63f998f084f01d2573d1e#block-67f63f998f084f01d2573d1e">Doge-y sycophants</a> who have hitched their wagon to American-style slogans and policies”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Taylor, meanwhile, argued Chalmers was overseeing a “lost decade”, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f6418d8f087f8f3346844e#block-67f6418d8f087f8f3346844e">taking aim at Labor’s budget</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The treasurer accused Taylor of being “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f642948f08165382e33478#block-67f642948f08165382e33478">evasive</a>” when asked what the Coalition would cut to fund its nuclear reactors.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Chalmers accused Taylor of using “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f645838f087f8f3346848c#block-67f645838f087f8f3346848c">made up numbers</a>” to attack Labor’s economic credentials, after being asked if he would apologise for Labor’s promise of a $275 reduction in energy prices at the last election.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Taylor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f646f08f084f01d2573da0#block-67f646f08f084f01d2573da0">promised</a> the Coalition would guarantee health and education spending.</p></li> 
   <li><p>He also repeatedly pointed to the Coalition’s fuel excise cuts and its plan to stop wasteful spending.</p></li> 
   <li><p>In closing, Chalmers said the election was a choice between “responsible economic management” or “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f64b368f087f8f334684f4#block-67f64b368f087f8f334684f4">Dutton’s Coalition of cuts and chaos</a>,” repeating his warning against their “secret cuts”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Taylor, instead, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f64bac8f087f8f334684fb#block-67f64bac8f087f8f334684fb">pointed to his experience in business and economics</a> and said Australia “can’t afford another three years like the last three”.</p></li>

  <p>Many times throughout tonight’s debate, the question of whether Australians are better off today than they were three years ago was raised.</p>

  <p><strong>Chalmers and Taylor asked about power of Greens</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> has ruled out a coalition with the Greens, as Labor has repeatedly done throughout this election campaign, after being asked about <strong>Adam Bandt</strong>’s comments at the National Press Club today.</p> 
  <p>Asked if it would be “dangerous” for the Greens to hold more power after this election, Chalmers replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Well, that’s in the hands of the Australian people who’ve got the ability to elect a majority Labor government under <strong>Anthony Albanese.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Angus Taylor</strong> argued it would be “extremely dangerous” for Labor and the Greens to team up, and said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We heard it from <strong>Adam Bandt</strong> today. He wants to do probably what Jim wants to do, because we know he’s asked for Treasury to do modelling on this [negative gearing changes].</p>

  <p><strong>Andrew Clennell</strong> asked <strong>Angus Taylor</strong> why he delayed a decision on electricity price rises past election day:</p>

   <p>Now you’re … releasing modelling claiming your gas reservation policy will cut power prices by a meager 3%, and your only other power price solution is 15 years away in nuclear. Why in 2022 did you hide that price rise from the Australian people?</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Taylor responded “I absolutely didn’t,” and said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In fact, what we saw in my time as energy minister is a cut in electricity prices of between 8% and 10% depending on whether you’re a small business, large business, or a household … If you can get gas prices down, it’s not just gas prices that come down for consumers – they clearly do – but also the price of food, the price of building materials, so much of our economy is energy.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Isn’t this the opposite of your hero <strong>Paul Keating</strong>’s so-called beautiful set of numbers?

  </blockquote> 
  <p>The treasurer responded and said the budget was “$207bn stronger than when we came to office, and that’s made room for those investments”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The deficit this year is half as big. We’ve made a structural difference to the budget in areas like the NDIS and aged care and also interest costs. And so we are getting the budget in much better nick, and we’re doing that without ignoring our responsibilities to people who are doing it tough.</p>

  <p><strong>Jewish Community Forum wraps up in Melbourne</strong></p> 
  <p>All eyes are now on the treasurers’ debate, but we’ve just wrapped up at the Jewish community forum at Temple Beth Israel in St Kilda.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m really proud to be able to stand here and to put my hand up and say that I will stand with the Jewish community here. I will stand with Israel and I will stand as a strong representative for Macnamara in parliament … you know that you have a friend in me.

Now, I love this community. I grew up here. I went to Mount Scopus. I played basketball for Maccabi. Now I am, every time I’m in the newspaper, it says, “Josh Burns, who is Jewish”.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>To this, the same man from earlier interjects, describing Burns’s comments as “useless bullshit”. He was promptly ejected.</p> 
  <p>After a vote of thanks from <strong>Daniel Aghion</strong> from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, just as the event was wrapping up, another man yelled out:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Josh, you are a friend of Israel but your Labor mates are not.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>There’s been some heated moments, but both Burns and Saulo have been highly complimentary of each other and most of the crowd has been respectful, after repeated warnings from moderators and the local rabbi.</p>

  <p><strong>Chalmers says Taylor ‘evasive’ on cuts because he is going to election with three policies</strong></p>

   <p>It’s a very important investment, and we’re proud of it, and we will do it if we win the election in a few weeks.</p>

  <p>He turned the spotlight back on <strong>Angus Taylor</strong> and said the reason he was “so evasive when you asked him to come clean on his cuts” is because he is going to the election with just three policies:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>First of all, to increase income taxes on every Australian taxpayer. Second of all, lower wages. And, thirdly, secret cuts to pay for nuclear reactors. And you can’t find $600bn to pay for those nuclear reactors without coming after Medicare, just like <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> did when he was the health minister.</p>

  <p>At the forum, a question on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (Unrwa) has led to the most heckling from the crowd of <strong>Josh Burns</strong>. Someone in the crowd is unhappy there was $20m allocated in the 2023-24 budget to the aid agency.</p> 
  <p>Back in 2024, Australia was among more than a dozen donor countries to suspend funding to Unrwa in late January, after the Israeli government alleged that 12 Unrwa staff members were involved in the 7 October Hamas-led attacks on Israel. At the time, the foreign minister, <strong>Penny Wong</strong>, said the $20m was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/07/australia-labor-unrwa-funding-gaza-support-pause">delivered prior to the accusations</a>.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Just wait, you might get the answer.</p>

  <p>He then continued with his answer:</p>

  <p><strong>Liberal candidate says he can ‘absolutely’ win seat of Macnamara</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Benson Saulo</strong>, however, says he can secure enough first-preference votes to win the seat:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I want to say here that we can absolutely win the seat. I understand the frustration and the anger towards Labor, and you’re not alone. It’s right across the electorate, the amount of people that have historically voted Labor across Port Melbourne, Middle Park, Albert Park, who look at what’s happening here at the state level, what’s happening at a federal level, and are determined to kick Labor out, and it’s with that that I’m encouraged by the work that we are doing.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Saulo said he has 500 corflutes out across the electorate, 60 billboards and a “significant amount of uplift in our engagement right across the electorate”. He said he would also advocate for issues young people feel passionate about such as climate change and housing:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While Josh points out that there’s a contingent of young voters that are out there that are really passionate about climate change, about housing, this is something that me as an individual within a party, [I’m] deeply passionate about. As an Aboriginal person, I view ourselves as custodians. I’m thinking about what the next generation will inherit.</p>

  <p><strong>Burns takes first question at community forum</strong></p> 
  <p>The first question is to <strong>Josh Burns</strong>, who was asked if he would put the Greens last on his how-to-vote card.</p> 
  <p>Burns said that the unique makeup of the seat means if he doesn’t secure enough first-preference votes, the Greens will come into second place and likely win the seat.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That is the biggest concern … I really like <strong>Benson [Saulo]</strong>. He’s a nice guy, but he’s not the person I’m worried about winning this seat. The only people who can win this seat are me or the Greens …</p> 
   <p>Think about the people who make up this electorate, the young progressive people from Elwood, from St Kilda, from Windsor, from South Melbourne, from Southbank. We are a proud and large Jewish community, but we’re only 10% of the electorate of Macnamara.</p> 
   <p>And the preferences – regardless of what the Labor party says – are not going to the Liberal party from those young people. And they’re Labor-Greens voters who are ultimately decided … I’m asking you not just to keep out the Greens. I’m asking you to support me in this election.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Guardian Australia has reported that the Labor party is likely to run an open ticket in the ultra-marginal Melbourne seat, which would encourage voters to place Burns first on ballots but not dictate preferences.</p>

  <p><strong>Liberal candidate for Macnamara makes opening remarks at forum</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Benson Saulo</strong> is now up, talking about his upbringing, his Aboriginal mother and Papua New Guinean father, who lived in regional New South Wales.</p> 
  <p>He said two things have stood out to him since he settled into the Macnamara electorate after moving back to Australia after his time as a consul general. The first, he said, was the “significant failure” of the government during the voice referendum to not have a “plan B”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There was really nothing beyond this idea of pushing through something that was uncertain, that something was untested, without bipartisan support … then ultimately, for it to fail. I woke up the day after and there was no plan B, there was no vision for what Australia looks like, what reconciliation journey looks like going forward.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said the other thing that stood out was the government’s “silence” after 7 October:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Here in Australia, what the greatest travesty was what we saw on the steps of the Opera House, [when] the Israeli flag was burning, where we heard chants that we’d never think that we would ever, ever hear in our life. And then we heard complete and utter silence. There was silence from our leaders. There was silence from the Labor party. There was silence when we heard these horrible chants that suddenly spewed out from the Opera House on to our streets to … our CBD, week after week.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Saulo said he has spoken to people in the community who he says do not “feel like the government has their back”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What the community here is really hoping for is some clear, tangible action to address antisemitism and clear-sighted leadership, which I believe that only a <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> Coalition government can actually deliver. And I’m really proud to be able to stand with the likes of Peter Dutton, <strong>James Paterson</strong> and also our very own <strong>David Southwick</strong> (MP for the state seat of Caulfield), where we are calling out acts of antisemitism, where we are going to support and work with the community.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As Jews and as Australians, we want our voices to be heard, and in order to be heard, we also need to listen … We recognise that human beings disagree. We can look at the same thing and have many different opinions and it’s not necessarily about right or wrong. It’s about understanding.</p>

  <p>Conyer says disagreement is “healthy”, and continues:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Some of us came here knowing exactly what we want to hear. Some of us came here a bit confused. Some of us came because we’ve got something we need to say. But I ask all of us to remember, as Jews and as Australians, that disagreement is healthy, creating social discourse is healthy.</p> 
   <p>There is no one right way … I hope that all of us can come with an open mind and an open heart and learn and be heard and listen to what is going to be said.</p>

  <p><strong>Greens candidate won’t be speaking at Jewish Community Forum</strong></p> 
  <p>At the last election Labor, the Liberals and the Greens were separated by only a few hundred primary votes. Labor ended up winning off the back of the Greens’ preferences.</p>

  <p>Semmens told Guardian Australia yesterday she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/09/greens-say-macnamara-community-group-facebook-ad-inflammatory-and-untruthful-melbourne-federal-election-campaign-ntwnfb">would now be allowed to attend the event</a> but would not be permitted to answer questions or outline her policies on stage, as a local candidate would generally do at such a forum.</p>

  <p><strong>Jewish Community Forum about to kick off in Melbourne seat of Macnamara</strong></p> 
  <p>As we wait for the debate between <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> and <strong>Angus Taylor</strong> to kick off later this evening, another event is about to begin in the ultra-marginal seat of Macnamara in Melbourne.</p> 
  <p>The Jewish Community forum will hear tonight from the Labor MP, <strong>Josh Burns</strong>, and the Liberal candidate, <strong>Benson Saulo</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The event is hosted each election by the Australian Jewish News, Australia Israel and Jewish Affairs Council, Executive Council of Australian Jewry, Jewish Community Council of Victoria, Temple Beth Israel, Zionism Victoria and the Zionist Federation of Australia.</p> 
  <p>But it has greater significance this year, amid the fallout of the Israel-Hamas war. In Macnamara, 10% of the population is Jewish, making it the second-largest Jewish electorate in Australia.</p> 
  <p>Burns, who is Jewish, is one of Labor’s most pro-Israel voices. He visited Israel after 7 October and criticised his government’s decision to vote at the UN for an end to Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories and to recognise the “permanent sovereignty” of the Palestinians.</p> 
  <p>But he’s been criticised by his community, who have claimed he hasn’t done enough to combat a rise in antisemitism at home.</p> 
  <p>The event tonight is being moderated by <strong>Rebecca Davis</strong> from AIJAC and <strong>Naomi Levin</strong> from JCCV.</p>

   <p>That means that the wholesale price of gas goes down by about 23% and the reason you can’t quantify the exact dollar is that there is that economy-wide benefit to this gas policy.</p>

  <p><strong>DZY lawyers say high court ruling will pave way for more survivors to challenge past settlements made in unfair circumstances</strong></p> 
  <p>Continuing from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/apr/09/australia-election-2025-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-labor-coalition-greens-adam-bandt-debate-gas-prices-cost-of-living-economy-tariffsntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67f6099c8f084f01d2573b68#block-67f6099c8f084f01d2573b68">our earlier post</a>: Lawyers for an abuse survivor say a high court ruling earlier today will pave the way for more survivors to challenge past settlements made in unfair circumstances.</p> 
  <p>The survivor, known as <strong>DZY</strong>, settled for $100,000 when confronted with insurmountable legal barriers to his planned civil action against the <strong>Christian Brothers</strong> in 2012, including a time limit on bringing historical abuse claims and the so-called “Ellis defence”, which the church used to avoid legal liability.</p> 
  <p>But new laws introduced across the country allow survivors like DZY to challenge past settlements made in unfair circumstances. DZY took a case to the high court seeking to have a past decision not to pursue compensation for economic loss set aside.</p> 
  <p>In a ruling today, the court declined to do so. But it also ruled that the power to set aside settlements was not limited to cases where either the time limit or the Ellis defence forced survivors into accepting paltry amounts.</p> 
  <p>DZY’s lawyer, <strong>Judy Courtin</strong>, said the ruling was “good news” for survivors who had entered into “highly inadequate settlements and signed deeds of release which really served only to protect the Church institutions and State bodies from providing genuine compensation to the victims of child abuse”.</p> 
  <p>Courtin told Guardian Australia:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>DZY is delighted that this high court decision will benefit other victim/survivors. It is this admirable unselfishness and towering courage that make DZY a person worthy of great respect and admiration. If only the churches would take a leaf out of his book.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Dutton claims Albanese has ‘sympathy’ for Greens policies</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Peter Dutton</strong> was asked to weigh in on the Greens’ policies outlined today at the National Press Club – including changes to negative gearing – and said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is an enormous amount of sympathy in <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>’s leftwing government for the sorts of things that <strong>Adam Bandt</strong> is putting on the table. I think he would get a receptive hearing to all of the impacts, as you point out, to Forestry, etc, from the Labor party, because that’s what <strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong> believes. And Anthony Albanese is the most left-leaning prime minister or leader of the Labor party since <strong>Gough Whitlam,</strong> and he has a natural sympathy for these arguments as well.</p>

  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> won 44 votes out of 100, Dutton won 35 and 21 people remained undecided.</p>

  <p>A private dinner fundraiser with the Liberal candidate for Bennelong, <strong>Scott Yung,</strong> and former prime minister, <strong>Tony Abbott,</strong> has been cancelled.</p> 
  <p>Invitations seen by Guardian Australia show the private dinner event at Le Montage – which describes itself as a “luxurious venue that embodies resort-style, noir and designer characteristics” – was scheduled to be held on 24 April.</p> 
  <p>The event was a federal fundraiser for the Bennelong Forum. It is not known why the event was cancelled and Yung, the Coalition and Abbott have been contacted for comment.</p> 
  <p>Yung held a similar dinner fundraising event with former prime minister <strong>John Howard</strong> on budget night last month. Tickets were $220 a head according to invites.</p> 
  <p>Bennelong is held by the Labor MP<strong> Jerome Laxale</strong> with a margin of just 0.1%.</p>

  <p>That’s not very much, is it, she asked?</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve got immediate relief that will be tangible and far bigger than Labor’s tax cut in terms of petrol tax relief, and over time that will drive lower prices through reduced gas prices – <strong>and also by transitioning our energy system into a nuclear-powered, emissions-free energy system.</strong></p>

  <p>Speaking to ABC Afternoon Briefing this afternoon, Husic responded to a video from the US, where Democratic senator <strong>Mark Warner</strong> slammed the 10% tariffs on Australian imports as “insulting” and “ridiculous.”</p> 
  <figure class="element element-atom"> <gu-atom data-atom-id="ecb4107d-6035-419f-a673-430848c23515" data-atom-type="media">

  <p>Asked what he made of the comments, Husic joked:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I reckon I might see if I can get an honorary Order of Australia for Senator Warner. Good on him. I like the cut of his jib.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The minister said Warner was right to point to Australia’s trade surplus with the US, and the close relationship between the two countries, and said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Everyone will lose from what the Trump administration is doing here. It is senseless and counter-productive.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>How should Australia respond, then, if the US think they’re running the score? Husic said the US shouldn’t “be engaged in further action against a friend like Australia”.</p>

  <p><strong>Catholic order wins clergy abuse case against survivor who had challenged unfairness of past settlement</strong></p> 
  <p>A Catholic order this morning won a crucial clergy abuse case in the high court against a survivor who had challenged the unfairness of a past settlement.</p> 
  <p>The survivor, known as <strong>DZY</strong>, was confronted with insurmountable legal barriers when he initially sought to sue the <strong>Christian Brothers</strong> over his sexual abuse as a child, including at the hands of <strong>Brother Robert Best</strong>.</p> 
  <p>He was told that two legal barriers gave him poor legal prospects: the then legal time limit on bringing historical abuse claims, and the so-called “Ellis defence”, a now quashed legal precedent allowing the Catholic church to avoid legal liability because it was an unincorporated association.</p> 
  <p>DZY accepted an $80,000 settlement for the sexual assaults he endured, which was topped up with $20,000 when it emerged during a public inquiry the Catholic order had failed to disclose relevant material to his lawyers.</p> 
  <p>State and territory governments across the country have in recent years passed reforms allowing abuse survivors to set aside past settlement amounts if they were made in unfair circumstances and where a court rules it to be just and reasonable to do so.</p> 
  <p>DZY asked the high court to use the new laws in Victoria to set aside an earlier decision by his former lawyers not to claim compensation for the economic loss that he suffered as a result of the abuse and its related trauma.</p> 
  <p>The high court ruled against him.</p> 
  <p>In a decision earlier today, it agreed with a previous court ruling that his decision not to pursue a claim for economic loss was unrelated to the legal barriers he faced at the time. Instead, it was related to concerns that it may have forced him to pay back Centrelink benefits.</p>

  <p>In what the South East Forest Alliance described as a landmark judgment, the court dismissed forestry corporation’s argument that a section of the state’s forestry act prevented groups or individuals that met the common law test for standing from commencing legal proceedings to enforce compliance with logging laws and protect threatened wildlife.</p> 
  <p>The forestry agency has made a short statement to say it is considering the judgment.</p> 
  <p>A spokesperson said the agency’s appeal in the high court “sought clarity on who can bring enforcement action in relation to alleged breaches in forestry operations”. They said the agency was reviewing the judgment and would consider the next steps.</p>

  <p><strong>Successful trial for electric cars to operate as batteries on wheels in Australia</strong></p> 
  <p>Electric cars are finally ready to operate as batteries on wheels in Australia after a successful trial by a team of electricity, technology, research and vehicle firms, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Electricity distributor <strong>Essential Energy</strong> announced the long-anticipated arrival of vehicle-to-grid technology at the Smart Energy Conference in Sydney today in partnership with the <strong>CSIRO</strong>, <strong>Sigenergy</strong> and <strong>AUSEV</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The launch comes six months after the federal government outlined standards for the technology, allowing bi-directional chargers to be approved for use in homes by the <a href="https://cleanenergycouncil.org.au/industry-programs/products-program/inverters">Clean Energy Council</a>.</p> 
  <p>Vehicle-to-grid technology (V2G) works by connecting an electric car to a charger that can manage the flow of electricity, either using it to recharge the vehicle’s battery or feeding it from the car back into the electricity network.</p> 
  <p>In this way, electric vehicles can power a home’s lights during a blackout or support the national grid during periods of high demand.</p> 
  <p>While V2G compatibility will only extend to the converted electric utes initially, which start at $169,900, Essential Energy and CSIRO are in talks to expand trials to other vehicle models.</p>

  <p><strong>Palau president delivers barb at Dutton over ‘water lapping at your door’ hot mic joke</strong></p> 
  <p>The president of Palau has delivered a pointed barb at <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> while strongly backing an Australian bid to host a UN climate conference on behalf of the Pacific, arguing that it would boost regional solidarity and he would be “deeply disappointed” if the attempt was abandoned under the Coalition.</p> 
  <p>Speaking at a renewable energy conference in Sydney today, <strong>Surangel Whipps Jr</strong> described seeing two-thirds of an island in his archipelago country disappear under water in his lifetime.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For those of us in the Pacific who have lived through storm surges, rising ocean levels and increasingly high tides, <strong>the phrase ‘water lapping at our door’ is not a metaphor or a punchline. It’s our fear and reality.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The comment was an apparent reference to a 2015 incident in which Dutton, while immigration minister, was overheard on a hot mic joking with then-prime minister <strong>Tony Abbott</strong> about delays during a visit to Papua New Guinea, saying “time doesn’t mean anything when you’re about to have water lapping at your door”. Dutton <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/13/peter-dutton-apologies-for-water-lapping-at-your-door-jibe">later apologised for the incident</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>3,000 NSW doctors take part in industrial action demanding pay parity and safe working conditions</strong></p> 
  <p>On the second of three days NSW doctors are striking, another 3,000 doctors have participated in industrial action, demanding pay parity with other states and safe working conditions.</p> 
  <p>The NSW Health deputy secretary, <strong>Matthew Daly, </strong>confirmed that – as the doctors’ union promised – patient safety in emergency and critical settings has not been compromised, with emergency departments performing at the national benchmark.</p> 
  <p>However, the walkouts have affected non-urgent services. At a press conference at 1pm, the NSW health minister, <strong>Ryan Park</strong>,<strong> </strong>said 614 elective surgeries had been cancelled since the industrial action began yesterday morning.</p> 
  <p>As part of that cumulative total since yesterday, 4,000 outpatient clinics had been cancelled, including for 445 for cancer patients, Park said.</p> 
  <p>The strike action has resulted in 34 beds closing, with 33 of those beds in short-stay units for patients transferred from an emergency department.</p> 
  <p>Park said the majority of the short-stay bed closures had been at Wyong hospital, which was due to its being a recipient of an emergency department relief package that gave them more of this type of bed.</p> 
  <p>The industrial action has also led to the employment of eight additional locums across metro Sydney, the minister says.</p> 
  <p>Park said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The government understands there are challenges with doctors’ wages in New South Wales compared to other jurisdictions. No one is hiding under a rock and pretending that we’re not aware of discrepancies.</p> 
   <p>But trying to make up 12 years of wage suppression in 12 months is also not feasible and I want doctors to understand that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>If you haven’t already read it, <strong>Juliette McAleer </strong>today shared her perspective on why, after spending six months in hospital as a patient, a system that she believes exploits its workforce also endangers patients:</p>

  <p><strong>Where does the major parties’ merchandise come from?</strong></p> 
  <p>Election campaigns are expensive ordeals.</p> 
  <p>Campaign ads running in marginal seats across the country don’t come cheap and party organisers need cash to pay for them. Beyond donations and private dinners, one way major parties raise money is through merchandise.</p> 
  <p>Among clothes sold by the Liberal party, including sweatshirts with the slogan Back on Track, are T-shirts manufactured by AS Colour. According to the AS Colour website, its products are manufactured in Bangladesh, China and Vietnam.</p> 
  <p>The majority of its cotton products, including T-shirts, are manufactured in Bangladesh. The shirts, including one with the logo “I’m leaving Labor in 2025”, are selling for $40 a pop.</p> 
  <p>Labor is also selling shirts for the same price but its website states they are “designed and printed in Australia”.</p> 
  <p>When asked where the shirt itself was made, a Labor source said its shirts were made by Bluegum and 100% Australian made. That’s saved the party a few blushes, given its Future Made in Australia policy.</p>

  <p>Bandt said his party is trying to “chart a pathway to real change”, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We know that even the Labor party was considering changes to negative gearing under pressure from us during the course of the last year, during the housing debate. Even the Labor party was looking at some of this.</p>

   <p>I would be astounded – as to your question about being able to work together – if the prime minister or anyone else refused to respect the parliament that the Australian people choose. If he can convince 51% of the population to vote for him, then OK, but that’s not what’s happened.</p>

  <p><strong>Bandt says Australia has chance to deepen relationship with countries impacted by US tariffs</strong></p> 
  <p>Sticking with Aukus and Trump, <strong>Adam Bandt</strong> claimed that both major parties have “completely 100% put us in <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s pocket and given us next to no room for manoeuvre at all”.</p> 
  <p>He argued that Australia should be a “force for peace and de-escalation”, and said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are in a position to now start joining with those other countries that Donald Trump is attacking and saying, “We need a new way of doing things that puts peace first” …</p> 
   <p>Economically, there are other countries now that are bearing the brunt of Trump’s tariffs. We should be exploring and deepening relationships with them.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Bandt said Australia has a “not very proud history of following the United States into every war it has chosen to go into”, and right now, shouldn’t be “signing up in advance to go off and join whatever war Donald Trump wants to fight next”.</p>

  <p>A reporter pointed to the Greens’ 2022 campaign launch, where it outlined several policy priorities – such as no new coal and gas, free childcare, dental in Medicare – and said the party wasn’t able to achieve “the vast majority of those during this term of parliament with the balance of power in the Senate”.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW Forestry Corporation high court appeal dismissed</strong></p> 
  <p>The Forestry Corporation of NSW has lost an appeal in the high court that may open the door for community groups to challenge alleged environmental breaches by the state-owned logging company and bring public interest cases involving logging of threatened species habitat in NSW to the courts.</p> 
  <p>The court dismissed forestry corporation’s argument that a section of the state’s forestry act prevented groups or individuals that met the common law test for standing from commencing legal proceedings to enforce compliance with logging laws and protect threatened wildlife.</p> 
  <p>The South East Forest Alliance described it as a “landmark judgment”.</p> 
  <p>The alliance brought the initial proceedings in the NSW land and environment court in 2024 alleging the forestry agency had failed to comply with conditions meant to protect species such as the greater glider during native forest logging operations.</p> 
  <p>Spokesperson <strong>Scott Daines</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This judgment confirms that organisations with a deep and ongoing commitment to environmental protection can hold government-owned entities accountable to the law.</p> 
   <p>Forestry Corporation tried to shut down this case before it even began. That strategy has failed.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The NSW Greens environment spokesperson, and former environmental lawyer <strong>Sue Higginson</strong> said the decision marked the end of “a dark era” and “the end of the rule that only the Environment Protection Authority can prosecute the Forestry Corporation” for alleged environmental breaches.</p> 
  <p>She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The high court has now rightly opened the door for public interest cases to be brought against the continued logging in our native forests.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Dutton says government won’t ‘book any revenue’ from gas policy when asked if it is constitutional</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Peter Dutton </strong>has been coy when asked whether the Coalition’s gas policy would breach constitutional rules.</p> 
  <p>Dutton held a press conference in western Sydney a short time ago, alongside McMahon candidate <strong>Carmen Lazar </strong>and the opposition’s energy spokesperson, <strong>Ted O’Brien.</strong></p> 
  <p>The opposition leader was asked whether the Coalition’s plan to make east coast LNG exporters to reserve more gas for domestic supply would apply to producers in Western Australia and, if the answer was no, if that was constitutional.</p> 
  <p>Dutton didn’t answer directly, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It applies to our east coast market reservation. <strong>And</strong> <strong>we’ve been very clear about the fact that we don’t believe that we book any revenue out of that measure.</strong></p> 
   <p>We’ve been working on this for a long time. We want to get it right, and what we do is we take away the advantage in exporting that gas, and we apply those gas producers who otherwise would have sold our gas to foreign markets to put that gas into the market here.</p> 
   <p>Now, by removing the advantage that they have in exporting the gas, we increase the supply here by 50 to 100 petajoules.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>We reckon this exchange might have something to do with section 51 (iii) of the constitution, which rules out setting different levies/duties for different states on the production or export of goods.</p> 
  <p>Unlike the east coast, WA – which produces most of the country’s gas – already has rules ensuring some of it must be kept for the local market, which has kept prices in the state well below the national average.</p>

  <p><strong>PM says he will revisit environmental law reform if Labor is elected for a second term</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> has said he will continue to “advance” Labor’s agenda for environmental law reform if elected for a second term because it’s in the interest of both extractive industries and the environment.</p> 
  <p>The prime minister said at a press conference this morning - which was held at Sydney’s Paddy’s Markets with the environment minister, <strong>Tanya Plibersek,</strong> and the NSW premier, <strong>Chris Minns</strong>, that he was “hoping to get the numbers in the Senate this time”.</p> 
  <p>It comes after Albanese <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/27/albanese-kills-off-deal-with-greens-to-pass-nature-positive-law-after-intervention-by-wa-premier">killed off a potential deal with the Greens</a> last year to establish an environmental watchdog to manage compliance with national environmental laws after intervention from the WA premier, <strong>Roger Cook</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Albanese confirmed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/31/albanese-says-federal-epa-will-not-be-same-model-as-earlier-one-he-promised-but-didnt-deliver">March that he would revive</a> the plan if re-elected, however, he said it would not be “the same model”.</p> 
  <p>Asked by Guardian Australia this morning about the details of the plan, and whether this commitment could be trusted after he shelved the legislation last year, Albanese responded:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We will continue to advance our agenda ... I discussed with the WA Chamber of Minerals and Energy, I’ve had discussions with environmental groups, and my minister has been leading those discussions.</p> 
   <p>We know that it is in the interests of both the environment and sustainability, but also of industry [for there to be] a proper reform of an Act that is not fit for purpose that has been there since the Howard era.</p> 
   <p>We will deal with that in a second term in an appropriate, consolidated way.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Plibersek, who is also the MP for Sydney, responded to a question earlier in the press conference by claiming that people in her electorate were happy with the Albanese government’s record on the environment. She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When I door knock in Sydney and I talk about Labor’s record on the environment, I get a fantastic reception.</p> 
   <p>Since coming to government, we have protected an extra 100 million hectares of land and ocean in this country.</p> 
   <p>Since coming to government, we’ve added more than one million tonnes of recycling capacity to Australia.</p> 
   <p>Since coming to government, I have approved enough renewable energy to power every single home in Australia. More than 80 projects.</p> 
   <p>We’ve got a fantastic record on the environment. We’re the only party of government that is serious about acting on climate change. That’s why I get such a great response.</p>

  <p><strong>Australian gas industry criticises the Coalition’s election policy</strong></p> 
  <p>Australia’s gas industry has run the rule over the Coalition’s gas policy announced late last night, and they have come out with some heavy criticism.</p> 
  <p>The Coalition says if elected it would set limits on how much gas LNG companies can sell overseas and impose a charge to make selling gas to the domestic market more attractive.</p> 
  <p>But Australian Energy Producers chief executive, Samantha McCulloch, said <a href="https://www.frontier-economics.com.au/assessment-of-coalition-gas-policy-proposals/">the report from Frontier Economics</a> of the Coalition’s price controls “leaves many unanswered questions about how the policy would work and reaffirms industry’s fundamental concerns”.</p> 
  <p>She said it was “yet another heavy-handed intervention that will drive away investment and risk exacerbating the supply pressures in the longer term.”</p> 
  <p>McCulloch pointed to Coalition statements in 2022 when the government introduced price caps, when <a href="https://susanmcdonald.com.au/gas-price-caps-will-smash-supply-and-risk-rationing/">shadow resources minister Susan McDonald said price caps would be a disaster </a>and would damage domestic supply.</p> 
  <p>McCulloch said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Rather than increasing gas supply, the Coalition’s policy risks reducing domestic gas production and supply because there would be no incentive to produce sub-economic gas, and it would damage already suppressed investor confidence.<br><br>The modelling also ignores the material infrastructure constraints that limit how much gas from Queensland can be sent to the southern states, with the pipes already running at full capacity during peak periods – a point the Coalition made less than six months ago.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The climate change and energy minister, <strong>Chris Bowen, </strong>has criticised <strong>Frontier Economics</strong> analysis that claims the Coalition’s policy could lower gas prices, describing it as a “scamphlet”.</p> 
  <p>Giving a media conference at a Smart Energy Council conference in Sydney, Bowen brandished the 15-page report, which he said was “alleged modelling” and included only 135 words on the impact on electricity prices.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’ve seen longer menus in a restaurant than this …[Coalition frontbencher] James Patterson told the Australian people they’ve been working on this for a year, which works out at a very low productivity rate per word.</p> 
   <p>If this is a year’s work, this is a nonsense document filled with holes.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Frontier estimated the Coalition’s policy could reduce domestic gas prices by 7% and electricity bills by 3%. The report does not include the modelling that was used to reach these figures.</p> 
  <p>Bowen said modelling of the Coalition’s nuclear proposal released in December suggested a big fall in gas usage in the energy grid, but four months later it was saying “we need more gas”.</p> 
  <p>He said Coalition frontbenchers had made contradictory claims about the impact on prices today and had “a lot of clearing up to do”.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They’ve retrofitted this document, which was clearly prepared after the budget reply.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Australian share market records steep drop in opening minutes of trade</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Australian shares have fallen by a steep 2% in the opening minutes of trading this morning, erasing yesterday’s bounce as hopes deteriorate that the world’s two largest economies will strike a trade deal.</p> 
  <p>The sharp price moves come shortly before the US is scheduled to hit China with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/china-donald-trump-tariffs-recession--us-stock-market">additional tariffs</a>, due to come into effect just after 2pm (AEST).</p> 
  <p>Taking into account past announcements, Chinese goods entering the US will face a 104% tariff as part of Donald Trump’s new trade regime. Analysts at IG warned on Wednesday that the Australian economy would be hit by the trade barrier, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If China does dig in, tariffs on its imports to the US will rise to a staggering 104%, a dire outcome for Australia’s trade-dependent economy and a potential catalyst for another round of broader risk aversion.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Australia’s benchmark share index fell to below 7,350 points in the opening minutes of trading today, taking it back to the level it closed at on Monday, which was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/07/asx-200-sp-share-market-australian-dollar-sheds-opening-us-tariffs-trade-war-fears">worst trading day in almost five years</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Opposition finance spokesperson spruiks Coalition’s gas policy</strong></p> 
  <p>The opposition’s finance spokesperson, Jane Hume, has also been talking up the Coalition’s gas policy this morning.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to Seven’s Sunrise earlier, Hume said the policy is about “keeping Aussie gas for Aussies”.</p> 
  <p>She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There are three ways that gas is used. It can be used in long-term contracts, it can be used for domestic supply, and it can also be traded on the spot market, using those volatile prices.</p> 
   <p>That’s where this east coast gas reserve will come from, bringing more gas into the system, it will unlock supply and bring prices down over time.</p> 
   <p>We estimate that it’s going to create around a 23% drop in wholesale gas prices that will feed through to industrial it was, to retail gas, and also to electricity prices.</p> 
   <p>What we want to see is more supply into the system, unlocking more supply, bringing prices down by putting pressure on prices down by putting pressure on prices.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Under the proposal, east coast gas producers would be forced to provide 50 to 100 additional petajoules to Australia’s east coast market – known as a gas reservation – in an attempt to bring down the average price from $14 a gigajoule to $10 a gigajoule by the end of the year.</p> 
  <p>Most of the gas produced on the east coast is exported overseas, with enough given to supply gas-fired power generation and industry, commercial and residential users in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The opposition leader, <strong>Peter Dutton</strong>, has said his father is doing well after suffering a heart attack right before last night’s televised leaders’ debate.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on Sydney’s Nova radio earlier this morning, Dutton said he considered pulling out of his first formal debate against <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, which went ahead at a Sky News event in western Sydney.</p> 
  <p>Asked this morning on Nova’s Fitzy, Wippa &amp; Kate Ritchie show how his father was doing, Dutton said:</p>

  <p>Dutton continued:</p>

  <p><strong>Health minister grilled on Labor’s $1bn mental health package</strong></p> 
  <p>The health minister, <strong>Mark Butler</strong>, says Labor will not technically be building new mental health centres under its $1bn mental health promise.</p> 
  <p>Yesterday, Labor pledged $500m for 20 youth specialist care centres, as well as $225m for 31 new and upgraded Medicare mental health centres and $200m for expanding or starting 58 Headspace centres. Speaking to <strong>4BC Radio</strong> earlier, Butler<strong> </strong>said the services will be new but the buildings themselves will not.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>We’re not building them. This is to fund the operations of these centres.</strong> Generally, they will rent existing premises.</p> 
   <p>They won’t be brand-new buildings. What we will do, say, in a particular area of say, north Brisbane or regional Queensland – we say we want to establish - let’s use the word establish other than build.</p> 
   <p>They are new in the sense the service doesn’t exist, and a mental health organisation will then bid to to receive the funding that we’ve made available in yesterday’s announcement.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Butler said the policy also includes rebranding the existing 61 Head to Health centres that the former Coalition government set up by changing them to Medicare mental health centres.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Head to Health – no one knew what it was, okay? </p> 
   <p>We did research. We basically, looked at how the existing services, which had started under the former government, were performing.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In more tariff-related news: Australian shares are poised to fall sharply today as <strong>Donald Trump</strong> presses ahead with plans to hit China with huge retaliatory tariffs.</p> 
  <p>Futures prices are pointing towards a steep 2% loss when the S&amp;P/ASX 200 opens later this morning, erasing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/08/asx-200-australian-stock-share-market-tariff-threats">yesterday’s rebound.</a> The anticipated price move would push the benchmark back under 7,350 points, the level it closed at on Monday after the market suffered its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/07/asx-200-sp-share-market-australian-dollar-sheds-opening-us-tariffs-trade-war-fears">worst trading day in five years</a>.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s latest threat to raise his tariffs on China by an additional 50% if Beijing does not withdraw its own <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/china-donald-trump-tariffs-recession--us-stock-market">retaliatory tariffs</a> is scheduled to come into effect today, just after 2pm (AEST).</p> 
  <p>This equates to a 104% tariff on goods the US imports from China, taking into account past tariff announcements.</p> 
  <p>Global markets have been recording huge swings in response to the US’ new trade regime. The US benchmark index, the S&amp;P 500, fell 1.6% overnight, wiping out an earlier gain of 4.1%.</p> 
  <p>Over the past week, share markets have tended to rebound when there are signs the US will strike trade agreements with key economic partners and fall when trade relations deteriorate. There is growing concern that if the tariff regime is implemented without significant changes, a “full-blown trade war, imminent recession and a liquidity crunch last seen during the early pandemic” may ensue, according to IG analysts.</p>

  <p><strong>Trump trade official defends tariffs against Australia</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Jamieson Greer, </strong>a United States trade representative, has defended the Trump administration’s decision to impose tariffs on Australian imports.</p> 
  <p>In a fiery exchange during a US senate finance committee hearing, Greer was questioned about Australia by <strong>Mark Warner</strong>, a Democratic senator from Virginia. Warner said the tariffs undermined the Aukus defence pact and the strong trading relationship between the two countries and did not make sense given the US had had a longrunning trade surplus with Australia.</p> 
  <p>He said “insulting the Australians undermines our national security and, frankly, makes us not a good partner going forward”.</p> 
  <p>But Greer hit back, saying the tariffs were about “running up the score” and that, despite the free trade agreement that exists between the two countries:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They ban our beef, they ban our pork. They’re getting ready to impose measures on our digital companies. It’s incredible.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He continued:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have a global tariff on everywhere. We’re trying to address the $1.2tn debt that <strong>[Joe] Biden</strong> left us.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Opposition’s energy spokesperson vague on when Australians will see power bill reductions under Coalition’s gas plan</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The opposition energy spokesperson, <strong>Ted O’Brien</strong>, has not confirmed when Australian households would start seeing savings from the Coalition’s gas plan.</p> 
  <p>O’Brien has been interviewed on ABC Radio National Breakfast after the Coalition released modelling for its gas reservation policy, claiming that it would shave 7% off household gas bills and take down electricity bills by about 3%.</p> 
  <p>Modelling by <strong>Frontier Economics</strong>, released yesterday evening, estimated the changes would bring down new domestic gas supplies to $9 or $10 a gigajoule.</p> 
  <p>O’Brien said the plan would result in the wholesale price of gas coming down “very quickly” but there was “likely to be a lag” on when consumers saw a reduction on their power bills.</p> 
  <p>He was asked specifically when households would start feeling these reductions directly through their gas bills, or indirectly through their electricity bills. O’Brien said if a Coalition government were elected, it would immediately introduce legislation to implement the gas policy.</p> 
  <p>He said the savings should start coming through “within the 12 month period” but it “had to be subject to whatever contracts they are on”. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are certainly looking, by the end of this calendar year, that you would start seeing wholesale gas prices coming down.</p> 
   <p>That means that as that then filters through with contracts, then by the end of the first 12 month period, industry [and] households should be seeing the impact.</p>

  <p><strong>Greens say Trump tariff chaos should force another look at property tax concessions</strong></p> 
  <p>Here’s some more detail on the Greens’ proposal:</p> 
  <p>The Greens tried to force Labor to revisit the tax concessions during bitter negotiations on housing legislation before conceding <strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>wouldn’t touch them.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-09-27/jim-chalmers-negative-gearing-modelling/104405060">Treasury officials did</a> examine options last year to redesign the tax breaks before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/sep/27/negative-gearing-law-changes-australia-albanese-government">government decided against</a> resurrecting some version of the policies former Labor leader <strong>Bill Shorten </strong>took to the 2016 and 2019 elections.</p> 
  <p>Albanese and the treasurer, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, have repeatedly ruled out changes in recent months, arguing that boosting supply – rather than winding back concessions for property investors – was the solution to the housing crisis.</p> 
  <p><strong>Adam Bandt</strong> will put the issue back on the agenda today in a speech before the National Press Club, claiming the global stock market turmoil caused by Trump’s tariffs has made reform even more necessary and urgent. The Greens leader is expected to tellsay:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Renters and first home buyers may get smashed even further in the next few months as wealthy investors spooked by Trump leave stocks and shares and pile into property, pushing house prices into the stratosphere.</p> 
   <p>Investors with big money behind them could jump into the housing market because of these incentives and lower interest rates, while first homebuyers with their life savings would be priced out of the already overheated market.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Under the Greens’ proposal, negative gearing and the 50% capital gains discount would be grandfathered and restricted to one property to protect “mum and dad investors”.</p>

Bandt will use a speech to the <strong>National Press Club</strong> to announce the minor party will insist on changes to the tax breaks in a hung parliament.</p> 
  <p>I’ll bring you more on this shortly.</p> 
  <p>Neither <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> or <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> made a major misstep in the Sky News forum in western Sydney as the two leaders held their first debate last night. Albanese was voted the winner in a poll of 100 undecided voters; the PM won 44 votes, Dutton won 35 and 21 remained undecided.</p> 
  <p>The treasurer, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, and the opposition’s treasury spokesperson, <strong>Angus Taylor</strong>, will have their own televised debate tonight.</p>
