<p>An influential Los Angeles man who livestreams <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">US immigration</a> enforcement operations on social media remained hospitalized on Wednesday after he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/21/deputy-marshal-shot-los-angeles">shot and arrested</a> by federal agents.</p> <p>Authorities allege that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok">TikTok</a> creator with a large following online, tried to ram federal agents’ vehicles with his vehicle in an attempt to flee after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car. He was shot in the elbow during the incident while a ricochet bullet hit a deputy US marshal in the hand.</p> <p>Parias was charged with assault on a federal officer and was expected to appear in court on Wednesday, but the US attorney’s office reported that proceedings had been delayed as Parias was still in the hospital.</p> <p>As the Trump administration has waged its aggressive campaign of mass deportations, with raids across southern California, Parias has filmed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/los-angeles-emergency-ice-raids">LA to declare state of emergency over Ice raids to assist affected families</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the TikTok profile Richard LA, Parias has for months been posting videos of federal agents arresting people, along with footage of protests and car collisions.</p> <p>The 44-year-old is a well-known local figure who recently received recognition from the office of Curren Price, a Los Angeles city council member, for his impact on the community and “unfiltered portrayal of real life [that] has fostered a loyal following”.</p> <p>“Richard is a pillar of our community, a fearless citizen journalist whose authentic storytelling has consistently uplifted the unheard voices of South Central Los Angeles,” Price’s office said in a statement.</p> <p>On Tuesday morning, federal agents set up surveillance near his home because he was the “subject of an administrative arrest warrant” and had allegedly evaded capture in the past, according to court documents. As Parias began to drive away, agents boxed his car in, preventing him from leaving.</p> <p>The agents approached Parias and ordered him to exit the vehicle, court documents say, alleging he began moving the car forward and back, “making contact” with the other vehicles. The back of the car began to fishtail and his spinning tires created large plumes of smoke, causing the agents “to fear that Parias would successfully dislodge the Camry … and injure them”, the complaint states.</p> <p>An agent broke a side window on the vehicle, which did not “subdue” Parias, Bill Essayli, the acting US attorney, said in a statement, adding that an agent then opened fire and wounded Parias and a deputy US marshal.</p> <p>A witness told <a href="https://abc7.com/post/man-shot-by-federal-agents-us-marshal-hit-ricochet-bullet-immigration-enforcement-south-los-angeles/18051362/">ABC7</a> that Parias seemed nervous and afraid and agents fired rubber bullets and teargas. Video obtained by the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-22/tiktok-streamer-ice-arrest">Los Angeles Times</a> showed Parias screaming for help after the shooting and firefighters responding to the scene.</p> <p>Essayli said in a statement: “Vehicles are deadly weapons. Anyone who uses them against federal agents risks arrest, imprisonment and life-threatening injuries.”</p> <p>If convicted, Parias could face a sentence of up to eight years in prison.</p> <p>The shooting comes as immigrant rights advocates have said that immigration agents are using increasingly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/04/ice-chicago-extreme-force-protesters-journalists">violent tactics</a> in their operations.</p>
