But in an update at 6pm, iD Mobile told its customers via its website that “3UK engineers have identified and isolated the suspected issue”.</p> <p>Three has about 10.5 million customers in the UK, with many sharing their frustrations on social media about the disruption caused.</p> <p>One person said they had “missed a medical appointment” as a result of being unable to receive calls, while another said their daughter had been left “stranded”.</p> <p>It is unknown if customers will be able to claim compensation for the issues, with Ofcom advising on its website that refunds “may be appropriate”.</p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority gave the green light to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/05/vodafone-and-three-given-approval-to-merge">Three’s merger with former rival Vodafone</a> in a £16.5bn deal last month.</p> <p>In a post on X, Three said: “We’re aware of an issue affecting a small percentage of voice services, our team are working hard to fix this as soon as possible.
