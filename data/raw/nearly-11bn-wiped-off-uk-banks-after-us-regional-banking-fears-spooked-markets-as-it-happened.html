That included almost £11bn knocked off the biggest banks listed in London.</p> <p>The losses were triggered by two US regional banks, <strong>Western</strong> <strong>Alliance</strong> <strong>Bank</strong> and <strong>Zions</strong> <strong>Bank</strong>, who yesterday disclosed alleged fraud by borrowers.</p> <p>Those disclosures fuelled fears that more problems may be lurking, as <strong>Stephen Innes, </strong>managing partner at <strong>SPI Asset Management,</strong> explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Zions’ $50 million charge-off on two supposedly clean commercial loans might sound modest in isolation, but isolation is precisely the problem. Every time one of these “isolated incidents” pops up, the market remembers the old trader’s adage: there’s never just one cockroach in the kitchen.</p> <p>And sure enough, Western Alliance’s $100 million legal tangle suggests the infestation might be spreading.</p> <p>Court filings, cross-exposures, NDFI lending webs—suddenly, every regional’s loan book looks like an attic filled with old wiring and a faint smell of smoke.</p> </blockquote> <p>Wall Street, which fell yesterday, has been calmer today – after Donald Trump backed away from his threat to hit China with 100% tariffs in their rare earths dispute</p> <p>Trump told Fox News that the proposed 100% tariff on goods from China was not sustainable, adding that he plans to meet Chinese president <strong>Xi</strong> <strong>Jinping</strong> in two weeks.</p> <p><strong>Trump</strong> told Fox Business Network:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“It’s not sustainable, but that’s what the number is.</p> <p>They forced me to do that.”</p> </blockquote> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/17/global-stock-markets-fall-and-gold-hits-record-high-amid-jitters-over-us-banks">Bank shares lead global market fall amid jitters over US private credit</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-17T16:56:28.282Z">at 5.56pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68f2726a8f084a54ffa343a6" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-17T16:50:00.910Z">5.50pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>As the <strong>International</strong> <strong>Monetary</strong> <strong>Fund’s</strong> annual meeting draws towards a close, the Fund is facing critisim from indigenous leaders in Ecuador.</p> <p>The leaders are blaming the IMF policies for the current in Ecuador crisis, where <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/protests-over-fuel-price-hikes-104923402.html">protests have been taking place for several weeks over the government’s decision to cut diesel subsidies</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://amazonfrontlines.org/chronicles/they-froze-our-accounts-to-open-your-oil-fields-why-ecuadors-banking-crackdown-signals-investment-disaster-and-confirms-our-resistance-is-stronger-than-ever/">In a letter</a> to IMF chief <strong>Kristalina Georgieva, </strong>a group of indigenous organizations explain that the government of Ecuador has frozen indigenous bank accounts without warning and without any explanation.</p> <p>And they insist they will continue to protect Ecuador’s forests from oil and mining projects, saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Two months earlier, your government partner opened new licensing rounds for oil companies to drill in those same territories. With the banking crackdown, the message is clear: they had to freeze our money before they could open our lands.</p> <p>You should understand what this means, Ms. Georgieva. When a government freezes Indigenous Peoples bank accounts without due process, it shows the same arbitrary power it will use against investors when contracts become inconvenient. We have defended these forests for thousands of years, through Spanish Conquest, through 50 years of oil contamination, through military repression. We expelled military and oil companies when they attempted to drill oil in the early 2000s and then we won in the courts in 2012. We again stopped oil auctions in the courts in 2019. We mobilized hundreds of thousands in 2022 against your economic policies and we won. We got the support of all Ecuadorians in keeping oil in the ground during the Yasuní referendum in 2023. Now your IMF loans demand Ecuador extract more oil to repay debt, so the government must silence us first. But freezing bank accounts doesn’t freeze resistance: it proves our movement threatens their plans. The last 20 years of victories shows that.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68f26e7c8f084a54ffa34327" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-17T16:29:20.931Z">5.29pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Bank of England's Greene sees no case for quarterly rate cuts</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Over in Washington DC, Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Megan Greene has said she did not see a case for the BoE to continue its current quarterly pace of rate cuts.</strong></p> <p>However, <strong>Greene</strong> doesn’t think the rate-cutting cycle is over – Bank rate is currently 4%, having been cut five times since summer 2024.</p> <p><strong>Greene</strong>, speaking at an event hosted by the Atlantic Council think tank in Washington, said a rise in British unemployment reported on Tuesday was in line with her expectations, and reduced the chance of high inflation translating into a wage-price spiral, <em>Reuters reports</em>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68f26d498f084a54ffa3431b" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-17T16:26:01.416Z">5.26pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Another US regional bank, Fifth Third Bancorp, has tried to reassure investors about its financial health today.</strong></p> <p><strong>Fifth Third</strong> said it expects its net charge-off ratio to fall in the fourth quarter in a sign that its seeing less trouble ahead for its loan portfolio, Marketwatch reports.</p> <p>Last month, <strong>Fifth Third</strong> had reported<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/200-million-gone-fifth-third-202204976.html"> it faced a loss of up to $200m</a> due to suspected fraud on two loans.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68f268c08f089fcc1d8ce82f" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-17T16:08:43.616Z">5.08pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">€37bn wiped off the European banking sector</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Financial stocks across Europe were also dragged down by fears over bad loans at U.S. regional banks.</strong></p> <p>The warnings from Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank that they were exposed to alleged fraud by borrowers hit European banks broadly today.</p> <p>Spain’s <strong>Banco</strong> <strong>Sabadell</strong> fell by 6.78%, followed by Germany’s <strong>Deutsche</strong> <strong>Bank</strong> which shed 6%.</p> <p>Overall, more than €37bn was wiped off the European banking sector, as measured by the <strong>Stoxx 600</strong> banks index (which includes the UK banks whose falls we covered a few minute ago).
