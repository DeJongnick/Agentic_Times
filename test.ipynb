It’s an often-heard sentiment these days, but is it really true? Historical comparisons are of limited help.</p> <p>Last week’s 80th anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/memory-hurts-memory-guides-auschwitzs-survivors-gather-for-80th-anniversary-of-camps-liberation\">liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau </a>concentration camp, where 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were murdered by the Nazis between 1940 and 1945, offered a grim reminder of how indescribably brutal life can be when war reigns unchecked. Could things get any worse?</p> <p>The latest readings from the “Doomsday Clock”, which notionally measures proximity to global catastrophe, suggest they could. A panel of international scientists says<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/28/doomsday-clock-closer-than-ever-to-midnight\"> the clock</a> is now at 89 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been to the theoretical point of annihilation.</p> <p>The reasons are familiar: the risk of nuclear war, climate change, pandemics, disinformation, new technologies. The point is, such threats are poorly managed – and are growing inexorably.</p> <p>Perceptions that the world is spinning out of control<strong> </strong>are heightened by environmental and health disasters like the recent Los Angeles wildfires, <a href=\"https://www.alliance-sahel.org/en/press/sahel-climate-change-challenges/\">drought in the Sahel </a>and outbreaks of ebola and other lethal, infectious diseases.</p> <p>The disruptive, destructive behaviour of governments also plays a central destabilising role, through their growing tendency to flout the UN Charter, international borders, basic human rights and the International Criminal Court.</p> <p>When the US president, traditionally the foremost guardian of the post-1945 rules-based order, threatens, unprovoked, to militarily attack a west European ally to seize its sovereign territory, little wonder everyone feels more insecure. Yet that is exactly what Donald Trump is doing in trying to bully Denmark into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/28/olaf-scholz-says-borders-must-not-be-moved-by-force-after-trump-greenland-comments\">surrendering Greenland</a>. Trump’s near neighbours in Panama, Mexico, Colombia and Canada face similar intimidation.</p> <p>The independent, non-profit organisation known as<a href=\"https://acleddata.com/conflict-watchlist-2025/\"> Acled </a>(Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data) compiles information and analysis to help track and reduce violent conflict.</p> <p>It estimates global conflict has doubled over the past five years, that incidents of political violence in 2024 were 25% up on 2023, and that one in eight people worldwide were exposed to conflict. By these measures, the belief that the world is becoming more dangerous is thoroughly justified.</p> <p>While some wars, such as Israel-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine, rightly receive huge media attention, they are exceptions. Most current conflicts, whether they involve wars and invasions in Sudan and Congo, gross human rights abuses in Afghanistan and Tibet, gang warfare in Haiti and Colombia, mass starvation in Yemen and Somalia, or political repression in Nicaragua, Belarus and Serbia, are under-reported, forgotten or ignored.</p> <p>Developing conflicts, such as China-Taiwan and Iran-US-Israel, require closer attention.</p> <p>Taken together, they present a terrifying picture of a world addicted to war.</p> <h2>Snapshots of a world at war</h2>    <p><strong><br>Congo-Rwanda</strong></p> <p>A long-festering conflict along the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/27/m23-rebel-group-goma-drc-democratic-republic-congo-rwanda\">global headlines</a> after the city of Goma was captured by a rebel group known as M23. Rwanda’s president, Paul Kagame, is accused by the UN of arming and directing M23, and sending troops across the border, which he denies.</p> <p>The area, though generally poor, is rich in metallic ore such as coltan that contains minerals much in demand in the west. Thousands have been displaced in the fighting amid sexual violence and a looming public health emergency.</p> <p>This sudden crisis prompted a UN security council meeting, at which the UK and France condemned Rwanda’s behaviour. The US says it supports the DRC’s sovereignty. Germany has suspended aid talks with Kigali. But this may have little effect. One problem is the EU signed a <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-rwanda-minerals-agreement-coltan-ore-mining-conflict-smuggling-rubaya-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-paul-kagame/\">strategic minerals deal </a>with Rwanda last year, even though it knows some minerals are smuggled from Congo. Another is that Britain’s previous government lauded Kagame as a model African leader when it wanted somewhere to send asylum-seekers. More broadly, conflict<a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/crisisgroup.org/new-statement-fall-of-drcs-goma-urgent-action-needed-to-avert-a-regional-war\"> in and around the DRC</a> has continued, on and off, for decades. Millions have died. When this latest crisis subsides, it will probably be left to fester again.</p> <p><strong>Myanmar</strong></p> <p>The past year saw growing armed resistance to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jan/31/myanmar-military-coup-anniversary\">military junta</a> that overthrew the elected government of Nobel peace prizewinner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/aung-san-suu-kyi\">Aung San Suu Kyi</a> in 2021. In response, the generals are resorting to what <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/01/16/myanmar-scorched-earth-tactics-intensify] [https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/01/1159641\">Human Rights Watch</a> calls “scorched earth” tactics. These include indiscriminate airstrikes against civilians, murder, rape, torture and arson “amounting to war crimes and crimes against humanity”.</p> <p>The UN says Myanmar is in “free-fall”; 20 million people will need help in 2025, yet humanitarian aid is often blocked. Involuntary conscription of young adults and children is enforced using abductions and detention. <a href=\"https://burmacampaign.org.uk/aung-san-suu-kyi-reaches-a-total-of-19-years-in-detention/\">Aung San Suu Kyi remains under arrest</a>, one of 21,000 political prisoners. Muslim minority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/rohingya\">Rohingya</a> civilians continue to be targeted in Rakhine state.</p>    <p>The wider context of Myanmar’s nightmare is the lamentable failure of its neighbours, grouped in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, to take effective action against the junta, and China’s connivance in and tolerance for its many abuses.</p> <p>Russia supplies the junta’s weapons. And the west, having imposed sanctions, mostly looks on. Now the generals, hoping somehow to legitimise their position, are talking about<a href=\"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2025/01/30/asia-pacific/politics/myanmar-civil-war-junta-elections/\"> holding elections </a>this year. Any poll is likely to be the focus of intensifying violence – and an obscene mockery of the democratic process.</p> <p><strong>Haiti</strong></p> <p>Described as the poorest country in the western hemisphere, Haiti has a reputation for ungovernability. A series of US-backed <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/14/what-is-the-history-of-foreign-interventions-in-haiti\">international interventions</a> has failed to achieve longterm stability.</p> <p>The country was effectively occupied by the US from 1915 to 1934. In Washington’s last big intervention, Bill Clinton sent 20,000 troops in 1994 to restore order. Any improvement was temporary. UN missions have also come and gone. Haiti’s latest descent into chaos followed the assassination in 2021 of its last elected president, Jovenel Moïse. Ubiquitous armed gangs, living off violence, extortion and kidnappings, rule the roost. Analysts say Haiti is now a failed state.</p>    <p>The most recent outside attempt to help the interim government regain control – a “multinational security support mission” led by Kenyan troops – is under-funded and struggling after a spate of gang massacres killed more than 350 people. These horrors included a Christmas Eve attack on the country’s largest hospital.</p> <p>More than 5,300 people were killed last year while 700,000 are displaced, according to US media. Nearly five million people – half the population – face food insecurity. Yet Haiti’s misery continues largely unremarked. Trump’s threatened foreign aid cuts will hit very hard here.</p> <p><strong>Ethiopia-Somalia</strong></p> <p>Ethiopia’s standing as a poster child for international aid and development efforts has undergone sharp re-evaluation in recent years, coinciding with the rise to power in 2018 of its prime minister, Abiy Ahmed.</p> <p>There has still been no full, public accounting for Abiy’s devastating military campaign in northern Tigray province that ended with a truce in November, 2022. The conflict became notorious for<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/02/ethiopia-atrocities-mar-ceasefire-anniversary\"> gross human rights violations</a> by all sides, but principally by Ethiopian government and allied Eritrean forces.</p>    <p>These abuses reportedly continue. Abiy’s rule has been marked by democratic backsliding, including internet shutdowns and media censorship, and by tensions with neighbouring Somalia over sea access via Somaliland.</p> <p>Concern now surrounds Ethiopia’s Amhara region, where escalating repression and large-scale arrests of government opponents are occurring amid ongoing conflict with armed groups.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/01/ethiopia-urgent-international-action-needed-to-end-mass-arbitrary-detentions-in-the-amhara-region/\">Amnesty International</a> says the world is turning a blind eye: “The international silence over the mass and arbitrary detention of thousands of people in Amhara region is beyond shameful.” It called on Ethiopia’s development partners to demand a return to “the rule of law”. The worry is that, like Tigray in 2020, Amhara could explode into all-out secessionist rebellion in 2025.</p> <p><strong>Iran</strong></p> <p>Iran’s theocratic regime took a severe beating in 2024, coming off&nbsp;worse in direct clashes with Israel and looking on helplessly as key regional allies in Lebanon, Palestine and Syria were degraded, toppled and killed.</p> <p>The regime also faces multiple domestic challenges, not least from a restive, youthful urban population increasingly enraged by official corruption, repressive violence and incompetence.</p>    <p>In the past 15 years, Iran has experienced three major uprisings, in 2009, 2019 and 2022. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/22/menaced-by-foreign-foes-facing-mutiny-at-home-how-long-before-iran-goes-nuclear\">Middle East analysts</a> wonder: when is the next one? Or will all-out war with Israel come first?</p> <p>Mindless repression, particularly of women, is a regime trademark which could prove its undoing. The imposition of a death sentence on Pakhshan Azizi, a Kurdish-Iranian civic activist, on trumped-up charges of “armed rebellion against the state” has prompted&nbsp;an<a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org.uk/urgent-actions/kurdish-woman-activist-sentenced-death\">&nbsp;international campaign</a> to save her. Azizi’s case follows the death in custody in 2022 of Mahsa Amini, accused of violating Islamic<a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/iran-new-compulsory-veiling-law-intensifies-oppression-of-women-and-girls/\"> </a>dress codes.</p> <p>Her murder, which prompted the “Woman Life Freedom” revolt, reflects a long, disgraceful history of persecution by misogynistic mullahs – persecution which continues in 2025. Many other men and women face the death penalty. Overall, Iran <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ced8qw8q62jo\">executed </a>more than 900 people last year, the UN says.</p> <p><strong>Syria-Turkey</strong></p> <p>Wearing a western-style lounge suit in preference to combat fatigues, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/29/rebel-leader-ahmad-al-sharaa-made-transitional-president-of-syria\">Ahmed al-Sharaa</a>, leader of the Islamist rebel group that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December, was named transitional president of Syria. In a series of sweeping changes, an appointed legislative council replaced the former parliament and all armed groups were told to disband and join a new national army. For those who hope Syria will become a “normal” country, it sounded positive. But democratic elections are three or four years away, Sharaa says, and a lot could go wrong.</p>    <p>While welcoming Assad’s overthrow, the US, EU and Gulf states have been <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/1/20/syrians-are-ready-to-rebuild-their-country-but-they-need\">slow to take concrete steps</a> to help, such as lifting sanctions and releasing funds. About 6.7 million vulnerable people need urgent assistance, the UN says. Health services, schools and housing are inadequate. Much of the countryside is seeded with landmines.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Syria’s internal security situation remains fraught amid a national quest for justice, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/26/syrian-fighters-execute-35-in-three-days-war-monitor-says\">revenge killings</a>, limited targeting of religious minorities and clashes between Syrian Kurdish forces and Turkish proxies along the northern border, where <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/01/1159596\">652,000 people are newly displaced</a>. Syria’s rebirth could be stillborn in 2025. Without better international engagement and support, war may yet return.</p> <p><strong>Sudan</strong></p> <p>Media commentators like to refer to the security and humanitarian catastrophe that is present-day Sudan as a “forgotten” conflict. The truth is worse. It’s not forgotten. It’s ignored, and mostly has been since mayhem erupted in 2023.</p> <p>Millions have been displaced and hundreds of thousands face famine conditions as a result of a struggle for control between Sudan’s army and renegade paramilitary forces, known as the RSF. The latter are accused of genocide in western Darfur region through the targeting of non-Arab communities, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/26/hospital-attack-sudan-besieged-el-fasher-who\">killing and sexual violence are rife</a>.</p>    <p>International neglect of Sudan may slowly be coming to an end in 2025. Karim Khan, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, has said he would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/28/icc-prosecutor-seeks-arrest-warrants-over-accusations-of-darfur-atrocities\">seek the arrest</a> of those suspected of committing war crimes and other atrocities in Darfur – assuming they can be caught.</p> <p>In a sense, history is repeating itself. In 2003 Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes perpetrated by Janjaweed militia, forerunners of the RSF. Halting the wider war throughout Sudan is more challenging still. <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/sudan/b204-sudans-calamitous-war-finding-path-toward-peace]\">Crisis Group</a> is calling on outside mediators to redouble efforts to agree a ceasefire. At present, that prospect looks remote.</p> <p><strong>Afghanistan-Pakistan</strong></p> <p>America’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jun/20/catastrophe-stalks-afghanistan-as-the-us-and-uk-dash-for-the-exit\">abandonment</a> of Afghanistan to Taliban extremists in 2021 was shameful – and politically costly. Former president Joe Biden’s domestic approval ratings plunged and never recovered. But the biggest losers were Afghan women and girls, who were again subjected to harshly interpreted Islamist rules denying them personalfreedoms, the right to education and meaningful careers.</p> <p>Last week the International Criminal Court took steps to remedy that abuse, announcing it would <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/01/afghanistan-un-experts-welcome-icc-prosecutors-application-arrest-warrants\">seek the arrest </a>of senior Taliban leaders Haibatullah Akhundzada and Abdul Hakim Haqqani for the crime against humanity of persecution on grounds of gender – a global first.</p>    <p>Afghanistan’s overall stability is in doubt as 2025 opens, with the misgoverned country mired in poverty and prey to outside extremist factions such as Islamic State Khorasan Province.</p> <p>Neighbouring Pakistan also looks deeply unstable following a year of <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/17/pakistans-ex-pm-imran-khan-wife-sentenced-to-jail-in-corruption-case\">political upheaval </a>that left popular former prime minister Imran Khan in jail and an army-backed politician, Shehbaz Sharif, in charge. <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10328\">Analysts </a>say 2024 brought rising levels of violent militancy involving Baloch separatists and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan. “The contentious domestic political situation will likely create more opportunities for militants to make gains by exploiting local angerin 2025,” <a href=\"https://acleddata.com/conflict-watchlist-2025/pakistan/\">Acled warns</a>.</p> <p><strong>Yemen</strong></p> <p>Yemen has been called the world’s worst humanitarian emergency, and perhaps it still is, despite the mounting horrors in Sudan. But since the 7 October 2023 Hamas assault on Israel, global attention has shifted away from Yemen’s domestic crisis and on to its Houthi rebels. Their missile attacks on western shipping in the Red Sea, and on Israel, in support of the people of Gaza, provoked military reprisals by the US, the UK and others.</p>    <p>Following the ceasefire in Gaza, Houthi shipping attacks have largely ceased. But the wider civil war continues to cause <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/1/24/un-suspends-trips-into-houthi-held-areas-of-yemen-after-more-staff-detained\">huge problems</a>, with about 150,000 people killed and 18 million facing food shortages. UN special envoy <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/01/1159036\">Hans Grundberg told the UN </a>security council in January that regional stability depended in part on ending the conflict in Yemen, where the war against a Saudi-backed government-in-exile has raged since 2015. Necessary first steps were a nationwide ceasefire, the release of detainees, new focus on repairing ports and economic and financial infrastructure, and the launching of an inclusive political process, Grundberg said. Two-thirds of Yemen’s food is imported and 90% of medical supplies. The need is great. But as in the past, political will may be lacking.</p> <p><strong>Mexico-US</strong></p> <p>As if Mexico did not already have enough problems, US president Donald Trump’s militarisation of the US-Mexico border, and his puerile demand that the Gulf of Mexico be re-named the Gulf of America, are bound to make them worse.</p> <p>“Trump’s revival of his punitive immigration playbook will overwhelm Mexico’s overburdened state, sandbag regional economic growth and enrich criminal cartels,” the US Council on Foreign Relations <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/article/destabilizing-mexico-would-make-us-less-safe-and-wealthy\">warned last week</a> – rendering both countries less safe and less wealthy.</p>    <p>Trump’s anti-migrant “Remain in Mexico” policy could critically destabilise the country, just as its newly elected president, Claudia Sheinbaum, is pledging a fresh start.</p> <p>Sheinbaum’s biggest domestic challenge is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/22/mexico-sinaloa-cartel-good-narco\">warring gangsters</a>. “[Her] election took place against a backdrop of emerging and intensifying gang disputes, evidenced by an 18% increase in lethal clashes between non-state armed groups compared to 2023,” Acled said.</p> <p>Sheinbaum pledged to address the social causes of cartel-related violence – a policy dubbed “hugs not bullets” – but recently took a tougher line, sending thousands of troops to violence-riven Sinaloa state. Trump should be helping. Instead, as usual, he is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexicos-president-may-be-toughening-fight-with-drug-cartels-2024-12-24/\">making the situation worse</a>.</p>'},\n",

And the media – whether a tabloid newspaper or a cable news network – benefits, too.</p> <p>These days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/trump-intelligence-iran-iraq-wmd-analysis\">Donald Trump’s recent strike on Iran</a> has proved the point once again, with the media’s attention intensely focused on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/iran-nuclear-facility-damage-assessment-new-intelligence-trump-claim\">Operation Midnight Hammer</a>, as it was dramatically dubbed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/13/mainstream-media-trump-universities\">The mainstream media has enabled Trump’s war on universities | Jason Stanley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First the emphasis was on the threat of attacks to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/why-iran-nuclear-programme-essential-to-its-identity\">Iran’s budding nuclear arsenal</a>, then on the possibility of all-out global war, then on the strikes themselves and then the announcement of a supposed ceasefire.</p> <p>All to the greater glory of Trump, at least as he tells it.</p> <p>For those who are trying to bring public attention to other important matters – even matters of life and death – that’s a frustrating reality.</p> <p>Jennifer Mascia knows this all too well.</p> <p>She is a founding reporter for <a href=\"https://www.thetrace.org/projects/how-we-fix-this-gun-violence-solutions/\">the Trace,</a> a non-profit news site dedicated to tracking the epidemic of gun violence in America and trying to do something about it, through exploring solutions.</p> <p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/melissa-hortman-remembered\">elected officials in Minnesota were shot </a>earlier this month – the former state House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were killed, and the state legislator John Hoffman and his wife were wounded – it was a huge story.</p> <p>Huge, but fleeting.</p> <p>“Pitted against a global conflict, domestic news doesn’t really stand a chance,” said Mascia, who previously contributed to the now-defunct Gun Report at the New York Times, begun by the then columnist Joe Nocera.</p> <p>That’s true for domestic news that, in an earlier era, would have commanded the media’s attention for many days, if not weeks. The Minnesota violence was even more newsworthy because of an early manhunt and disinformation swirling around the apparent assassin’s political leanings.</p> <p>Still, coverage seemed to disappear in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>“The Trump era has all but ensured that important news will get smacked out of the news cycle in favor of the latest development in Trumpworld,” Mascia wrote to me in an email, after we had talked by phone.</p> <p>Mascia is quick to clarify that she’s not suggesting that the media ignore what the chaotic president is doing.</p> <p>“It’s important that we cover Trump’s constitutional breaches. We shouldn’t become numb or complacent in the face of eroding democracy,” she said.</p> <p>But it was remarkable to see how quickly the Minnesota shootings faded from media attention. A CNN contributor herself, Mascia is often called in to provide perspective for “Day Two” of coverage after the initial reporting of gun-related news. But often these days, she notes, there <em>is </em>no Day Two.</p> <p>By then, the media has moved on.</p> <p>“Maybe if the Israel-Iran war wasn’t going on, we’d still be talking about it,” she said. “Anderson Cooper would be broadcasting from Melissa Hortman’s funeral. But instead, he’s in Tel Aviv.”</p> <p>And, of course, this extends to all sorts of other subjects, not just gun violence.</p> <p>Those who try to focus attention on voting rights, the rule of law, crucial supreme court decisions, widespread citizen action such as the vast “No Kings” protests – to mention just a few – may get a modicum of attention.</p> <p>But nothing compares to a show of military force.

       " {'thursday-briefing-in-a-year-of-devastating-conflict-how-you-can-help.html': '<h1>Thursday briefing: In a year of devastating conflict, how you can help</h1>\\n<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2024-12-12T06:45:10Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Archie Bland &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Global</div>\\n<p>Good morning. Every year, <a href=\"https://guardian.ctdonate.org/?utm_medium=email_editorial&amp;utm_campaign=CharityAppeal2024FirstEdition&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_term=Email&amp;utm_source=EMAIL\">the Guardian and Observer charity appeal</a> is themed on a subject central to the news agenda, as well as the humanitarian one. This year, the choice was dispiritingly straightforward: conflict.</p> <p>The wars in Gaza and Ukraine are the most familiar, and have exacted a devastating cost. But the bitter civil war in Sudan has also killed tens of thousands, and forced millions from their homes. And from Haiti and Colombia to Myanmar to Ethiopia, it has been a dire year for the civilians who are always the most vulnerable to military violence and its long aftermath.</p> <p>According to ACLED, which <a href=\"https://acleddata.com/conflict-index/\">collects data on the subject</a>, 50 countries rank in its highest categories for armed conflict – and one in seven people in the world have been exposed to the impact of war in 2024. There is more armed conflict across the world today than at any time since the second world war.</p> <p>In different ways, the three charities that will receive donations from Guardian and Observer readers this year are all working to mitigate those harms. For today’s newsletter, <em><strong>Patrick Butler</strong></em>, the Guardian’s social policy editor who coordinates the appeal each year, explains how your money can make a difference. <a href=\"https://guardian.ctdonate.org/?utm_medium=email_editorial&amp;utm_campaign=CharityAppeal2024FirstEdition&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_term=Email&amp;utm_source=EMAIL\">Click here to donate</a> – and here are the headlines.</p> <h2>In depth: ‘A gesture of solidarity with the millions whose lives have been destroyed through war’</h2>    <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/06/guardian-observer-charity-appeal-2024-peace-human-rights-those-affected-by-war\">her piece launching the appeal</a> on Friday, Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner reflected on the importance of charities operating in the face of odds that sometimes seem hopeless. “A charity appeal can feel insignificant in the face of deep-rooted geopolitical enmities and hatred,” she wrote. “We ask you to support the Guardian and Observer appeal in a spirit of optimism and defiance.”</p> <p>Médecins Sans Frontières, War Child and Parallel Histories are all remarkable examples of that spirit, working in very different ways. “They do amazing work,” Patrick Butler said. “We don’t restrict how they use our readers’ donations in any way: we trust them, as the experts, to spend it where it’s most effective. But we have many examples of how important what they do is. I would say to readers: you can’t stop these conflicts, but you can help the people who are doing what they can to ameliorate them for the most vulnerable people.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Médecins Sans Frontières: ‘They risk their lives every day’</strong></p> <p>Also known as MSF or Doctors Without Borders, Médecins Sans Frontières has hospitals or clinics running in 70 countries across the world. Thousands of doctors, nurses, medical support workers and logistics staff risk their lives in places like Gaza, Ukraine, and Sudan.</p> <p>“The money we raise for MSF will be spent on emergency trauma care, in field hospitals where people are being treated for burns and fractures and bullet wounds every day, and in the underreported places as well as the ones that everyone knows about,” Patrick said.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/dec/08/its-a-feeling-of-claustrophobia-as-safe-zones-shrink-the-fight-to-save-lives-as-gang-war-consumes-haiti\">this piece</a> reported from Port-au-Prince, Tom Phillips saw some of MSF’s work to help civilians caught in the crossfire of Haiti’s criminal insurrection. In November, the charity was forced to halt its services in the city for the first time in 30 years after vigilantes and the police attacked one of its ambulances, with two patients with bullet wounds being abducted and murdered.</p> <p>Jean-Marc Biquet, MSF’s head of mission in Haiti, described how important it was that normal service resume soon: the charity’s clinics are some of the only places that “poor people – which is the vast majority of the population – can access and receive treatment”, he said.</p> <p>That is true in many of the places MSF works, including Gaza, where its teams have performed more than 9,000 surgeries and held more than 471,000 outpatient consultations since the war began. “They are a remarkable organisation, and they risk their lives every day,” Patrick said. “They are absolutely on the frontline in the most dangerous places in the world.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>War Child: ‘They are there in the crisis, but they are also there to help pick up the pieces’</strong></p> <p>In just five months this year, War Child reached more than 1.1 million children in 14 countries. The only specialist charity for children affected by conflict, it delivers emergency support – but also seeks to provide the structure that will allow children to rebuild their lives once the violence stops.</p> <p>Donations from Guardian and Observer readers will go towards emergency aid, education and specialist mental health support for children affected by war. “They are there in the crisis, but they are also there afterwards to help pick up the pieces,” Patrick said. “That’s hugely important. They help children who have been indescribably traumatised, who have perhaps lost their parents, and they’re in it for the long haul. We wanted to include them in the appeal because we know that as well as the immediate impact of war, it is absolutely vital to think about what happens next.”</p> <p>War Child frequently channels support through locally led partner organisations. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/07/we-cant-give-up-on-1-million-children-the-charity-bringing-psychological-first-aid-to-gazans\">This piece by Karen McVeigh</a>, on the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme (GCMHP), is a powerful example of how daunting their work is, and how important. Here’s a story told by the charity’s director, Abu Jamei, about a 12-year-old boy at a camp in Deir al-Balah, who had stopped eating or speaking after his friends were killed in front of him:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The social worker went to that tent, to that lovely boy, who had brightly coloured eyes. She said: ‘I know you have not spoken for three days. I am here just to listen to you, to give you space, for whatever comes to your mind.</p> <p>“For 15 minutes, they sat in silence, and then the child started to cry. Then, in the first words he had spoken since the attack, he said: ‘I saw my friends die in an apartment. They told me that they had gone to heaven but one of my friends, when they found him, he was decapitated. How can he go to heaven without his head?’</p> <p>“The psychologist was able to reassure him, telling him heaven is a different reality and he did not need to worry. She persuaded him: ‘Let’s eat something together.’”</p> </blockquote> <p>Abu Jamei says optimism for the future is crucial, and the international community must keep an eye on Gaza: “If you give up on us, and we give up on our people, then what’s going to happen?”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>Parallel Histories: Helping children find a shared understanding of the past</strong></p> <p>Where War Child and MSF are established international players, Parallel Histories is a newer charity operating in a very different sphere: helping schools to teach the contested histories of conflicts in places like Israel/Palestine and Northern Ireland, in the hope that doing so will make future generations better able to bridge those divides.</p> <p>It was established by the late history teacher Michael Davies, and its aims were set out brilliantly in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/oct/06/jewish-arab-history-teacher-muslim-alevel\">a piece he wrote for the Guardian</a> in 2015 about the impact of a school trip to Israel and the West Bank. “My aim is to develop a new curriculum in the UK for teaching this seemingly intractable conflict,” he wrote. “This is early days. I’m in the process of looking for a sponsor for this effort. I really hope it works.”</p> <p>Davies died earlier this year – but Parallel Histories now works with more than 1,400 schools, offering them innovative materials and teacher training courses in pursuit of their founder’s mission. “It resonates, in many ways, with what journalists do,” Patrick said. “It’s about helping children get beyond the very divisive narratives that might be in circulation to try to establish what we know about the truth.”</p> <p>As a small charity, the money that Guardian and Observer readers give to Parallel Histories will have a big impact. “It’s like seed capital,” Patrick said. “It’s almost a startup, doing something genuinely innovative. And we really believe that it’s worth trying to help it grow.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><strong>What it means to donate</strong></p> <p>Since 2015, Guardian and Observer readers have raised more than £13.5m for good causes. They have given to charities supporting refugees, fighting child poverty, and tackling the climate crisis. And every year, readers respond with a humbling generosity that underlines how crucial the values that these charities embody continue to be.</p> <p>“When people donate online, they’re offered the option to send us an email explaining why,” Patrick said. “And what comes through is an incredible belief in this work, and a spirit of generosity. What they often tell us is that these are issues that they’ve been thinking about a lot, and the appeal has crystallised that into an opportunity to do something.”</p> <p>Any journalist who has taken calls on the annual telethon day will tell you the same thing: once they have got over their disappointment that you’re not Marina Hyde or John Crace, the way readers talk about why they’re donating, often at the very limit of what they can afford, is incredibly moving.</p> <p>“I hope the work being done by this year’s charities will have a similar impact,” Patrick said. “It’s amazing how much people want to help.”</p> <p>Look out for more coverage of all three charities over the next few weeks – and if you’re ready to donate, <a href=\"https://guardian.ctdonate.org/?utm_medium=email_editorial&amp;utm_campaign=CharityAppeal2024FirstEdition&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_term=Email&amp;utm_source=EMAIL\">here’s that link again</a>.</p> <h2>What else we’ve been reading</h2>    <ul> <li><p>With Bashar al-Assad’s regime destabilised and public institutions in disarray, <strong>Syria</strong> faces the urgent challenge of resuming basic public services. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/11/syria-civil-servants-public-services-after-assad\">William Christou reports from Damascus</a> on the push to get back to work in the midst of chaos. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>Tuesday’s First Edition, about <strong>Sednaya prison</strong>, mentioned the remarkable project undertaken by Amnesty International and Forensic Architecture to map out the site on the basis of the memories of former detainees. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/dec/11/to-cough-was-to-risk-death-the-artist-who-mapped-syrias-sednaya-prison-with-testimonies-from-its-survivors\">This piece</a> by the lead acoustic investigator, the artist Lawrence Abu Hamdan, is a chilling account of that process.</p></li> <li><p>“Thompson’s murder is one symptom of the American appetite for violence; his line of work is another,” the New Yorker’s Jia Tolentino writes in <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/what-the-murder-of-the-unitedhealthcare-ceo-brian-thompson-means-to-america?_sp=7852f1d4-79f9-49f8-baab-4bbbe37b3864.1733929144665\">this incisive analysis</a> on the public response to <strong>the assassination of the </strong><strong>UnitedHealthcare</strong><strong> CEO</strong> says. <em><strong>Nimo</strong></em></p></li> <li><p>The View from Down Here, a newsletter by writer, campaigner and “card-carrying disabled woman” Lucy Webster, is always excellent.

What are we hearing about the future of warfare? What are we hearing about the transformation that is necessary, right now, as we come out of the last two decades of warfighting?” said the retired brigadier general <a href=\"https://www.americansecurityproject.org/about/consensus/members/paul-d-eaton/\">Paul Eaton</a>, a veteran of the Iraq war. “We’re hearing of DEI purging.”</p> <p>Eaton continued: “We’re hearing about taking a Black four-star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/21/trump-hegseth-joint-chiefs-cq-brown-jr\">out</a> of the seniormost position in the armed forces of the United States; a female four-star removed, who was the first <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/Leadership/Flag-Officer-Biographies/BioDisplay/Article/3148210/admiral-lisa-franchetti/\">chief of naval operations</a>; a four-star female <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/01/adm-linda-fagan-first-female-lead-us-coast-guard\">taken out of the coast guard</a>.”</p> <p>In any national military, fighting cohesion and faith in the chain of command is paramount. But Eaton says Hegseth is a “Saturday showman on Fox News” unfit for the office he occupies and has undermined his troops at every turn.</p> <p>Eaton explained that mass firings and transgender bans have distracted from learning lessons from the war in Ukraine and the coming global conflict many inside the Pentagon have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jul/23/british-defence-chief-vows-to-triple-fighting-power-but-shies-away-from-conscription\">predicting for years</a>. Most of all, Hegseth’s focus on culture war is actively neglecting the “warfighters” he constantly invokes.</p> <p>“What we’re seeing is nibbling around the edges of a culture with a dominant theme that does nothing to prepare the armed forces of the United States to meet its next peer or near peer opponent,” said Eaton.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Secretary Hegseth risks alienating and undermining the women who currently serve</p> <footer> <cite>Caroline Zier, ex-deputy chief of staff to Lloyd Austin</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a period where the Pentagon has struggled to meet recruitment numbers, Hegseth’s dismissal of top female officers and his historical attitude towards gender is not making enlistment a top attraction among women.</p> <p>“Comments that question the qualifications and accomplishments of women in uniform are deeply disrespectful of the sacrifices these service members and their families have made for our country,” said <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/About/Biographies/Biography/Article/3894731/caroline-zier/%5C\">Caroline Zier</a>, the former deputy chief of staff to the last secretary of defense, Lloyd J Austin III, and a <a href=\"https://votevets.org\">VoteVets</a> senior policy adviser. “Secretary Hegseth risks alienating and undermining the women who currently serve, while decreasing the likelihood that other women look to join the military at exactly the moment when we need all qualified recruits.”</p> <p>Hegseth’s office also had social sciences and DEI research axed in a memo <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/4113076/pentagon-culls-social-science-research-prioritizes-fiscal-responsibility-and-te/\">announced in early March</a>. The cost cutting measure will save $30m a year in Pentagon funding of internal studies, “on global migration patterns, climate change impacts, and social trends”.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1898813400949408080\">post on X,</a> Hegseth said: “[DoD] does not do climate change crap. We do training and warfighting.” Those comments match up with his complaint that under the Biden administration the military somehow weakened soldier standards and focused its efforts away from fighting wars in favor of adopting liberal subcultures.</p> <p>“The truth is the United States military is the most lethal fighting force in the history of the world, and the Department of Defense never took its eye off warfighting and meritocracy,” said Zier. “I saw that up close over the course of 15 years working at the Department of Defense, across administrations.”</p> <p>Tough talk about “warfighting” and “lethality” has also followed an obsession within the Trump administration with special forces units – the types that carry out drone strikes or a mission such as the one that killed Osama Bin Laden in 2011. Hegseth and Trump, for example, were dogged defenders of Eddie Gallagher, a Navy Seal pardoned by Trump for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/27/eddie-gallagher-trump-navy-seal-iraq\">war crimes in Iraq</a>.</p> <p>But special operations missions, especially when they have led to civilian carnage, have the propensity to create enemies across the globe if unneeded collateral damage occurs. Which is why new and evolving watchdog policies governing how covert actions are carried out were adopted across the Obama, Trump and Biden administrations of the past. By 2023, Austin instituted <a href=\"https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/300017p.pdf\">new orders</a> surrounding civilian harm mitigation.</p> <p>But Hegseth has closed the Pentagon’s Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response office and the Civilian Protection Center of Excellence, which both handled training and procedures critical in limiting civilian harm in theatres of war. Coupled with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/13/pete-hegseth-pentagon-lawyers-rules-of-war\">plans to overhaul</a> the judge advocate general’s corps to remake the rules of war governing the US military, all signs point to a Pentagon more prone to tragic mistakes.</p> <p>Eaton thinks that is shortsighted and ignores lessons learned.</p> <p>“When I was in Iraq in 2004 developing the Iraqi armed forces,” said Eaton. “I would stand up in front of my Iraqi soldiers and I would make a case for the most important component of the US military: our judicial system and the good order and discipline of the armed forces.”</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What we’re seeing is nibbling around the edges of a culture with a dominant theme that does nothing to prepare the armed forces of the US</p> <footer> <cite>Paul Eaton, retired brigadier general</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But then, Eaton added, something happened that undermined those words: “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,1211872,00.html\">Abu Ghraib</a>”.</p> <p>Not only was Hegseth a veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he was also a major veteran voice that railed against the Biden administration’s handling of withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. Part of that included criticisms of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tChrzNx2Dj8\">abandoning allies</a>, and yet Hegseth’s time at the top of the Pentagon has coincided with the unprecedented undermining of global alliances – suspending things such as offensive cyber missions countering Russia – which has blemished confidence in military interoperability and intelligence sharing.</p> <p>Ukraine, at risk of becoming the new Afghan government cutoff from American military support, is fighting for its national survival against a superior Russian force.</p> <p>In early March, the Pentagon froze critical intelligence and weapons packages as Trump repostured the US position on the conflict.

Even by Bilderberg standards, the security at this year’s conference is intense, but it managed to gear up even more when the Spanish king’s entourage swept into the venue past a traffic jam of police vans.</p> <p>The heightened security is perhaps a reflection of the threats and “challenges” packed into the conference agenda: Russia, China, the Middle East, the climate – while the session on Ukraine, titled Ukraine and the World, has a worrying hint of a wider world war. And when the topic of the Changing Faces of Biology is being discussed by the CEO of Pfizer, the head of the EU Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the man who led the Human Genome Project, you can almost hear the alarm bells over the police sirens.</p> <p>The world of Bilderberg in 2024 throbs with threats; it’s what conference participant Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, recently described as “the weaponisation of everything”. It’s a world of “hybrid attacks” driven by disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence. There’s even a session on AI safety at this year’s gathering, one of two sessions devoted to AI, securing its place at the head of Bilderberg’s agenda.</p> <p>The conference hall is heaving with tech luminaries, including the heads of Google DeepMind, Microsoft AI, Mistral AI and Anthropic, making the event a high-level AI summit in its own right.</p> <p>Many of these AI chiefs are tech optimists; Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, recently raved about AI “spreading consciousness to the stars”. But the contingent of US national security officials, who have flowed in from Washington for these talks, tend to take a more worldly and weaponised view of the subject. They’re led by the deputy national security adviser, Jonathan Finer, and Jen Easterly, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. They are joined by one of the US’s most senior soldiers, the supreme allied commander Europe, Christopher Cavoli, who warned recently that the conflict with Russia was shaping up to be a “long fight”. So the immediate future of war sounds like it’ll be more war.</p> <p>It’s just sad that Henry Kissinger isn’t here to enjoy it. The elder statesman of Bilderberg died in November at the age of 100.</p>    <p>Certainly the world’s military – and the industries that surround it – take Bilderberg seriously. Gen Cavoli is taking time out from leading a “wholesale modernization” of Nato’s defense capabilities to attend the Madrid conference. His boss at Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, is attending his last Bilderberg as secretary general. His successor is hotly tipped to be Mark Rutte, the outgoing Dutch prime minister. Rutte is a Bilderberg regular, and doubtless the group will be delighted, though perhaps not surprised, if yet another of their charmed circle lands a top job.</p> <p>The other prime minister here in Madrid is Estonia’s Kaja Kallas, who said recently that “openness is our greatest weapon” in free societies. “At its core,” she said, “openness represents getting rid of barriers that hinder the flow of information.”</p> <p>Sadly, we won’t know if she talks at Bilderberg about openness, because of all the barriers hindering the flow of information. We do know that Kallas believes that on the battlefield, “Ukraine has out-innovated Russia, fielding entirely new weapons systems” – some of which will have been developed by the tech companies at this year’s conference.</p> <p>Time magazine has dubbed Ukraine “an AI war lab”, and the Economist agrees, describing it as “a testing ground for companies like Anduril and Palantir” – the heads of both of these defense tech companies are here in Madrid.</p> <p>The founder of Anduril Industries is Palmer Luckey, the designer of Oculus VR, who got bored of making headsets and wanted to build autonomous combat vehicles instead – so in 2017 he set up the defense contractor Anduril Industries, with investment from Founders Fund, which is run by the venture capitalist and Bilderberg insider Peter Thiel. Another of Thiel’s happy investments was in Palantir – the AI surveillance giant run by Alex Karp, who sits alongside his mentor, Thiel, on Bilderberg’s steering committee.</p> <p>War is a fantastic opportunity for R&amp;D; as Karp says: “There are things that we can do on the battlefield that we could not do in a domestic context.” Meanwhile in Palestine, Palantir technology is being used by the IDF “in support of war-related missions”. The onslaught has been excellent for the company’s bottom line. “Our products have been in great demand,” enthuses Karp.</p>    <p>Karp’s fellow Bilderberg insider and Pentagon favourite Eric Schmidt, who used to run Google, is said by Forbes magazine to have been so “inspired by Ukraine’s use of drones on the battlefield” that he has spent the past year “working on a secret military drone project”.</p> <p>But for now, if Ukraine is to win the drone war, Schmidt says that it needs “sustained financial and technical support from Kyiv’s allies”. This sentiment will surely be echoed by Ukraine’s representative at the Madrid conference, the foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who will no doubt be doing his best to coax some extra billions out of the crowd.</p> <p>This year’s Bilderberg is thick with senior ministers and EU commissioners, not to mention the heads of the European Investment Bank and the Bank of Spain. The event itself is being hosted by Ana Botín, the executive chair of Banco Santander, and the heads of numerous other finance giants are attending, including Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and Societé Générale.</p> <p>Big business tends to pick up the tab for Bilderberg, because it’s such a high-end investment opportunity. Bilderberg is the boardroom of the western alliance, so they get to participate in the shaping of the grand strategy and hopefully get a jump on the market.</p> <p>It’s looking like next year’s host will be the Swedish billionaire investor Marcus Wallenberg, the chairman of defense company Saab. His senior adviser, Oscar Stenström, has been hovering round the venue as a member of the conference “pre-team”. Stenström was the chief negotiator for Sweden’s successful accession to Nato in March, and what better way to toast the ongoing expansion of the Alliance than with a Scandinavian Bilderberg. <em>Skål</em>!</p>'}]"
