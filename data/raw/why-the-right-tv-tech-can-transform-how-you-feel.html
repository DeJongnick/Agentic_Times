<p>Think about feeling completely engaged at the cinema. Build a mental picture, close your eyes and soak it in.</p> <p>What stood out in your mind? The incredible screen size? The light and colour filling the room? The clarity of focus that the setting brings?</p> <p>If you’re like most people, you probably didn’t think about the technology in the projectors, screen and speakers. When a viewing experience is perfect, we lose ourselves to the moment and just let the story, sound and emotion wash over us. We become immersed.</p> <p>Home entertainment setups have evolved to try to bring that feeling to our living rooms; it’s been a great era for big screens that sit beautifully on the wall. But we’ve also had growing competition for our attention: our ever-present phones. Even as we sit down to enjoy the big screen at home, the lack of deep engagement can lead to us pulling out the small screen and letting it distract us yet again.</p> <p>However, new big-screen technologies can combat that. With their size, brightness and colour, the latest TVs can send us into a cinema-like world in an instant – and help us be engrossed in the moment.</p> <h2>A TV that makes you pay attention</h2> <p>The 116-inch Hisense RGB-MiniLED 116UX TV sets a new standard for immersive viewing at home. The size alone is breathtaking, filling your room and your senses. But it’s the hidden technology within that sends it to a new level.</p> <p>The breakthrough RGB-MiniLED system builds on predecessor MiniLED and OLED technologies, offering a practical balance of subtlety and power for the home.</p> <p>This new backlighting system powers an incredible colour vibrancy, achieving up to 95% of the expansive BT.2020 colour gamut. For the uninitiated, BT.2020 is a colour standard for Ultra HD containing a vast colour range. It’s a difference you’ll see and feel, especially during your next movie night. <br><br>Not a night owl? Daytime screenings are no issue for the Hisense 116UX. The TV achieves 8,000 nits of peak brightness, even with full daylight entering the room. The Anti-Reflection PRO coating and AI Chroma Light Sensor further enhance the picture quality, at any time of day or night.</p> <p>Hisense has also built a 6.2.2 CineStage X Surround sound system directly into the screen. Just as you never see the speakers in a cinema, speakers are hidden in every edge of the TV’s screen, and within the screen panel itself. It’s a complete multi-channel speaker system designed in collaboration with the Opéra de Paris and inspired by opera house acoustics.</p> <p>These technical advances combine to let the viewer step into the story. When you play the latest console games, the variable refresh rate helps you lock in with ultra-smooth gameplay. When you watch sport, the colour saturation is so brilliant you can almost touch the grass, and the action is supported by clear motion AI Sports Mode to reduce noise and keep high-speed movement crystal clear at all times. And when you watch movies you dive into cinematic perfection, with full support for industry standards such as IMAX Enhanced, Dolby Vision and Atmos, HDR10+ adaptive, Filmmaker Mode, DTS and more.</p> <p>There’s something about a truly big screen that can change how you experience entertainment at home. With the Hisense RGB-MiniLED 116UX, the scale and detail draw you in straight away – whether you’re watching a film or TV series, or playing a game. It’s not only about picture quality; it’s about how the latest technology can help shared time feel more immersive, less distracted and more connected.</p> <p><em><strong><a href="https://hisense.com.au/product/116UXAU/?utm_source=Guardian&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=116UXAU" rel="nofollow">Discover colours as they were meant to be with the Hisense RGB MiniLED 116UX</a>.</strong></em></p>
