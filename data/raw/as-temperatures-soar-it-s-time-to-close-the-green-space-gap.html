<p>It has been a summer of heatwaves in western Europe, with record highs of 46C (115F) in Spain and Portugal.</p> <p>An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/09/europe-june-heatwave-study-climate-breakdown-tripled-death-toll">estimated 2,300 people died of heat-related causes</a> across 12 European cities in June, according to a rapid scientific analysis, with two-thirds of those deaths linked to climate breakdown, which has made heatwaves more severe.</p> <p>While green spaces can help mitigate extreme heat, a recent study shows that urban green spaces are not distributed equitably.</p>    <p>Nearly 80% of the population of western Europe live in urban areas, and the <a href="https://ukgbc.org/news/how-the-urban-heat-island-effect-makes-cities-vulnerable-to-climate-change/">urban heat island effect</a> turns those cities into pressure cookers during a heatwave. Street trees, parks and green roofs can significantly lower temperatures, and many cities are planting more trees and creating green spaces.</p> <p>Weiqi Zhou, at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, and colleagues mapped green space creation and compared this with levels of social deprivation in two megacities: Beijing and New York City.</p> <p>Their results, published in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2025EF005976">Earth’s Future</a>, show green space is more likely to be added in high-income areas, exacerbating social vulnerability.</p> <p>They conclude that cities should prioritise the most vulnerable neighbourhoods for urban greening and not just plant trees where it is easy to do so.</p>
