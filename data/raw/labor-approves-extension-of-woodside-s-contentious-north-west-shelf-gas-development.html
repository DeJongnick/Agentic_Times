<p>The environment minister, Murray Watt, has given the green light to Woodside Energy’s application to extend the life of one of the world’s biggest liquified natural gas projects from 2030 to 2070.</p> <p>Watt said he had told Woodside he planned to approve the life extension of the North West Shelf gas processing plant, on the Burrup peninsula in northern Western Australia, with “strict conditions” relating to local air pollution. Woodside has 10 days to respond.</p> <p>Some experts have raised concerns about the impact of pollution from the plant on a globally significant collection of rock art in the Murujuga cultural landscape, which includes the peninsula, and accused the WA government of misrepresenting and tampering with pollution data presented to federal authorities.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/may/25/reliable-energy-or-carbon-bomb-whats-at-stake-in-the-battle-over-australias-north-west-shelf">Reliable energy or ‘carbon bomb’?

They said it made the development a “carbon bomb” that would help put the goals of the landmark Paris climate agreement beyond reach.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/OqFQe/2/" data-alt="Map showing the North West Shelf in Western Australia"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/OqFQe/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The decision is Watt’s first since being appointed environment minister after the 3 May election. His predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, had delayed making a call on the life extension before the poll.</p> <p>In a statement, Watt said the decision followed “the consideration of rigorous scientific and other advice, including submissions from a wide cross-section of the community”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>He said he had been required to consider the potential impact of the plant on the national heritage values of nearby ancient rock art, and economic and social matters.</p> <p>While gas is a fossil fuel, he was not required to consider the impact of the project on the climate crisis. Climate change is not grounds to refuse or limit a development application under Australia’s national environment law.</p>    <p>The decision came despite a highly contested argument over whether local emissions from the plant will irreparably damage Murujuga rock art, which is thought to include the earliest known depiction of a human face.</p> <p>The WA government and the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, a body established by the state government to represent traditional owners, on Friday released a rock art monitoring report prepared last year. In a summary, they said there had been historic damage to rock, but linked it to air emissions from a power plant in the 1970s. They said key pollutant levels had declined since 2014 and there was no evidence that acid rain was affecting the art.</p> <p>But Benjamin Smith, a professor of archeology and a world rock art expert at the University of Western Australia, said while the science in the 800-page report was sound, the government has badly misrepresented what it actually suggested.</p> <p>He said it showed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/27/the-spin-has-been-wrong-rock-art-expert-raises-concerns-over-critical-report-ahead-of-woodside-decision">that local pollution was four times higher now than in the 1970s</a> and that “if we allow what is happening to continue we’re going to very quickly lose the rock art in Murujuga”.</p> <h2>‘Unacceptable interference’</h2> <p>The <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-05-28/scientists-say-wa-government-interfered-with-rock-art-study/105344536">ABC reported</a> that the chief statistician who worked on the monitoring report, Adrian Baddeley, had expressed “grave concern” about “unacceptable interference” by WA government officials in removing some information from a graph in the report summary. He said the summary had incorrectly stated that the research showed current pollution levels were “lower than the interim guideline levels”.</p> <p>He said, in reality, the five monitoring sites closest to industry were experiencing pollution levels about the guideline level.</p> <p>In a complaint email to the state environment department, Baddeley reportedly wrote: “In my opinion, this constitutes unacceptable interference in the scientific integrity of the project.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2025/may/27/will-labor-take-its-chance-to-act-on-climate-full-story-podcast">Will Labor take its chance to act on climate? - podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before Watt’s decision was announced, the WA premier, Roger Cook, told the ABC’s Radio National that some scientists were engaging in a “political frolic”. “We have to strip away the background noise and rely upon the reports to make good decisions on behalf of the people of Western Australia,” he said.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Unesco revealed it planned to defer a decision on a government-backed world heritage bid for the Murujuga cultural landscape due to the impact of local industrial developments, including the North West Shelf.</p> <p>It planned to refer the application back to the Australian government, and to ask it to “ensure the total removal of degrading acidic emissions” affecting the petroglyphs and to develop a decommissioning and rehabilitation plan for the industrial facilities.</p> <p>Watt said the government was disappointed with the Unesco decision and would “work constructively with the World Heritage Centre to ensure the factual inaccuracies that influenced the draft decision are addressed”.</p> <p>Woodside and its partners in the North West Shelf joint venture said they welcomed the decision, and that the application had been through “rigorous assessments and appeals”.<strong> </strong>Woodside’s executive vice-president, Liz Westcott, said it would secure the ongoing operation of the development “and the thousands of direct and indirect jobs that it supports”.</p> <p>The Greens’ leader, Larissa Waters, said Watt had “spectacularly failed his first test in the job” and killed the prospect of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. “Sacrificing the oldest art gallery on the planet for Woodside’s private profits while the Hunter has just experienced a one-in-500-year flood event shows the climate madness this decision is,” Waters said.</p> <p>Several environment organisations said the decision paved the way for a fight over Woodside’s proposal to open up the Browse gas basin, which partly lies under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/28/scott-reef-australia-drilling-plan-oil-gas-woodside-lng-north-west-shelf">Scott Reef, an environmentally rich site about 300km off the northern WA coast</a>.</p> <p>Raelene Cooper, a former chair of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation who last week launched federal court action in a bid to force Watt to act on a two-year-old unreleased report on the importance of Murujuga’s Indigenous heritage before deciding on the North West Shelf, said her response to the government’s decision was “see you in court”.</p> <p>“I’m not on my own. I’m bringing warriors from this <em>ngurra </em>[country] with me,” she said.</p>
