<p>Erik ten Hag, the former Manchester United and Ajax coach, has been announced as Xabi Alonso’s replacement at Bayer Leverkusen. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/25/xabi-alonso-appointed-real-madrid-manager-three-year-contract-bayer-leverkusen">Alonso’s departure to Real Madrid</a>, with the Basque unveiled on Monday, Leverkusen, who finished second in the Bundesliga this season, have alighted on the Dutchman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/manchester-united-sack-erik-ten-hag">sacked by United in October</a>.</p> 
<p>The 55-year-old has signed a contract until 2027 and previously worked in German football as a coach at Bayern Munich.</p> 
<p>Winner of three Eredivisie titles after becoming Ajax coach in 2017, taking them to the semi-finals of the 2018-19 Champions League, he became United’s coach in 2022. After <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/feb/26/manchester-united-newcastle-united-carabao-cup-final-match-report">winning the League Cup</a> and finishing third in his first season, his team’s performances lapsed the following season, and despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/article/2024/may/25/manchester-city-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report">winning the FA Cup in 2024</a>, he was sacked as Premier League performances descended further.</p> 
<p>Alonso led Bayer Leverkusen to the 2023-24 Bundesliga title, unbeaten in the league to collect the club’s first, alongside a German Cup, with only Atalanta in the Europa League final preventing a treble. This season, Bayern Munich were able to reclaim their title but Ten Hag will inherit a squad shorn of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/15/liverpool-negotiating-jeremie-frimpong-transfer-with-bayer-leverkusen">Liverpool-bound Jeremie Frimpong</a> and Florian Wirtz has heavily linked with his own move to Liverpool over the weekend.</p>

<p>“Bayer are one of the best clubs in Germany and also among the top clubs in Europe,” said Ten Hag. “The club offers outstanding conditions, I’ve been very impressed with the discussions of the management. I’ve come to Leverkusen to continue with the ambition shown in recent years. It’s an attractive challenge to set up something together in this period of change and develop an ambitious team.”</p>
