<p>Your report (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/nov/03/uk-university-halted-human-rights-research-after-pressure-from-china">UK university halted human rights research after pressure from China, 3 November</a>) is deeply alarming. Amnesty International UK’s own research shows that attempts by the Chinese state to intimidate and silence people extend far beyond its borders: a clear case of transnational repression, where governments reach across borders to stifle dissent.</p> <p>We have documented how Chinese and Hong Kong students in the UK live in fear of surveillance and retaliation. Some have changed the focus of their study, avoided “sensitive” topics, or dropped research on human rights altogether. Universities are often reluctant to speak up. When student Tara Zhang was detained in China for her overseas activism, Soas University of London’s only public comment was that it was “aware of the reports”, without any public condemnation or&nbsp;calls for her release.</p> <p>If political pressure from a foreign state can shut down legitimate inquiry in the UK, our campuses risk being bought and bullied into silence. Academic freedom cannot survive if truth is negotiable. Both universities and the UK government must act – loudly and publicly – to protect those at risk and resist interference.<br><strong>Sara Rydkvist</strong><br><em>Amnesty International</em></p> <p>• The case of Prof Laura Murphy at Sheffield Hallam University shows how serious the threat is from China to academic freedom at British universities.</p> <p> Pious words from the UK government will mean nothing to Beijing. But it has an opportunity to show China we are serious about defending our liberties. Permission to build the largest Chinese embassy in Europe at Royal Mint Court in London, based on redacted plans and certain to contain the means to further interfere with our national security, must be refused.<br><strong>Francis Bown</strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
