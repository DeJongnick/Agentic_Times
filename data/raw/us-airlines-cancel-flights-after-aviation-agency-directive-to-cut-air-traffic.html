<p>United, Southwest and Delta airlines began cancelling flights for Friday in compliance with the Federal Aviation Administration’s directive that will see reductions in flights at 40 major airports from Friday to help address air traffic controller shortage safety concerns as a result of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-shutdown-longest-trump-republican-senators-democrats-9712df6c11ef19c5df8f18c8a4f7b341">government shutdown</a>.</p> <p>The Associated Press published the list after airline regulators identified “high-volume markets” where the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says air traffic must be reduced by 4% by 6am ET on Friday, a move that would force airlines to cancel thousands of flights and create a cascade of scheduling issues and delays at some of the nation’s largest airports. The FAA is also imposing restrictions on space launches but not imposing any cuts on international flights.</p> <p>On Thursday evening, Delta said it would be cancelling 170 flights on Friday and “fewer” on Saturday because it is a lighter travel day. Southwest said it would cancel 120 flights for Friday and United said it plans to cut 4% of its flights Friday through Sunday.</p> <p>The FAA has said flights are being reduced to maintain air traffic control safety during the ongoing federal government shutdown, now the longest recorded and with no sign of a resolution between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a> to end the federal budget standoff, now in its 37th day. <br><br>Experts predict hundreds if not thousands of flights could be canceled. The cuts could represent as many as 1,800 flights and upwards of 268,000 seats combined, according to an estimate by the aviation analytics firm Cirium.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/list-airports-flight-cuts-faa">List of US airports cutting flights on Friday due to federal government shutdown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The affected airports covering more than two dozen states include the busiest ones across the US – including Atlanta, Charlotte, Denver, Dallas/Fort Worth, Orlando, Los Angeles, Miami and San Francisco. In some of the biggest cities – such as New York, Houston and Chicago – multiple airports will be affected.</p> <p>All three airports serving the Washington DC area – Washington Dulles international, Baltimore/Washington international and Ronald Reagan Washington national – will be affected, inevitably causing delays and cancellations for lawmakers as well as other travelers.</p> <p>Scott Kirby, the United Airlines CEO, said in a statement the goal of regulators “is to relieve pressure on the aviation system so that we can all continue to operate safely. That is the FAA’s highest priority, and ours as well. No matter what environment we’re operating in, we will not compromise on safety.”</p> <p>Kirby added the airline “will continue to make rolling updates to our schedule as the government shutdown continues so we can give our customers several days’ advance notice and to minimize disruption”.</p> <p>Delta Air Lines said it would comply with the directive and “expects to operate the vast majority of our flights as scheduled, including all long-haul international service, and will work to minimize customer impact while keeping safety our top priority”.</p> <p>Delta also said it would provide additional flexibility to customers to change, cancel or refund their flights, including basic economy fares, without penalty.</p> <p>The flight reductions, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/flight-capacity-reduced-10-40-major-airports-faa/story?id=127235525">according to ABC News</a>, will start at 4% on Friday and increase to 10%. The flights affected by these reductions are scheduled during the hours of 6am to 10pm.</p> <p>The likely airspace shutdown comes two weeks before the Thanksgiving holiday – typically the busiest travel period of the year – and raises pressures on lawmakers to reach a deal to end the shutdown.</p> <p>Air traffic controllers, already in short supply, have been working unpaid since 1 October, with many working mandatory overtime and others taking second jobs, according to Sean Duffy, the US transportation secretary, who said the cuts would be to “alleviate the pressure”.</p> <p>“Many of the controllers said, ‘A lot of us can navigate missing one paycheck. Not everybody, but a lot of us can. None of us can manage missing two paychecks,’” Duffy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB0-sD_YZJo">said on Wednesday</a>. He accused Democrats of being responsible for any “mass chaos” that ensues even though the shutdown is the result of both Republicans and Democrats refusing to agree to a deal.</p> <p>In a statement, American Airlines said most customers would be unaffected and long-haul international travel would remain as scheduled, and that customers could change their flight or request a refund. “In the meantime, we continue to urge leaders in Washington to reach an immediate resolution to end the shutdown,” the statement said, adding thanks to “to the air traffic controllers, TSA officers, CBP officers and other federal employees who are working right now without pay”.</p> <p>The agency’s Air Traffic Organization (ATO) is responsible for the scheduling and safety of more than 44,000 flights and more than 3 million airline passengers daily across more than 29m square miles of airspace.</p> <p>The government shutdown has left shortages of up to 3,000 air traffic controllers, according to the administration, in addition to at least 11,000 more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/28/air-traffic-controllers-pay-government-shutdown">receiving zero wages</a> despite being categorized as essential workers.</p> <p>Bryan Bedford, the FAA administrator, said the flight reductions are intended to keep the airspace safe during the shutdown.</p> <p>“I’m not aware in my 35-year history in the aviation market where we’ve had a situation where we’re taking these kinds of measures,” Bedford said. “We’re in new territory in terms of government shutdowns.</p> <p>“Our sole role is to make sure that we keep this airspace as safe as possible. Reduction in capacity at 40 of our locations. This is not based on light airline travel locations. This is about where the pressure is and how to really deviate the pressure,” Bedford added.</p> <p>Geoff Freeman, the US Travel Association president and CEO, said in a statement that the government shutdown was “forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the US air travel experience”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/06/us-government-shutdown-day-37">Democrats encouraged to ‘hold the line’ in talks with Republicans as shutdown enters 37th day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Aviation expert John Nance told ABC that regulators were “probably trying to do their best” to prevent any reduction in the margins of safety. “We’re facing the potential of almost a shutdown of the national airspace … You cannot continue to operate this in a way that ignores the diminution of safety. This is an incredibly serious situation.”</p> <p>From Friday to Sunday evening, at least 39 air traffic control facilities reported potential staffing limits, according to an Associated Press analysis of operations plans shared through the Air Traffic Control System Command Center. The figure, which is probably an undercount, is well above the average for weekends before the shutdown.</p> <p>During weekends from 1 January to 30 September, the average number of airport towers, regional control centers and facilities monitoring traffic at higher altitudes that announced potential staffing issues was 8.3, according to the AP analysis. But during the five weekend periods since the shutdown began, the average more than tripled, to 26.2 facilities.</p> <p>The shutdown may also have other consequences, including slowing the investigation in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/nov/05/ups-plane-crash-louisville-investigation">UPS cargo plane crash</a> on Tuesday in Louisville that killed at least 12 people.</p> <p>“At a minimum, the shutdown will certainly slow down the investigation,” said Matt Stoddard, an Atlanta-based transportation attorney, in a statement to the Guardian. “National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators must interact with other parts of government and those other departments’ responses will certainly be slowed.”</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed </em><em>reporting</em></p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 6 November to correct the number of days the US government has been shut to 37 and update the name of the agency<strong> </strong>managing US airspace to Federal Aviation Administration.</p></li> </ul>
