<p>Distressing as it was to read of the trials and tribulations of Matthew and his family (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/27/husband-viewing-child-abuse-images">We had an ordinary marriage. Then I found out my husband had been viewing images of child abuse, 27 July</a>), it was nevertheless a relief to see that they are getting the help they sorely need. But given the scale of the problem (<a href="https://www.nspcc.org.uk/about-us/news-opinion/2021/indecent-image-offences-online-safety-bill/">NSPCC research</a> in 2021 found more than 100,000 child abuse image crimes recorded by UK police in the past five years), it might be useful for people to know of at least one other source of help; the Portman Clinic in London is an NHS facility that offers psychological treatment and support to those struggling with problematic sexual behaviour. Further information can be found at <a href="https://tavistockandportman.nhs.uk/">tavistockandportman.nhs.uk</a>. Anyone seeking help may self-refer, or go via their GP, before they come to grief vis-a-vis the law.<br><strong>John Woods</strong><br><em>Psychotherapist, </em><em>the Portman Clinic</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
