<p>An ethical super fund is pushing for QBE to overhaul its coverage policies amid criticism the insurer can underwrite fossil fuel projects without restriction while blaming the climate crisis for steep premium rises.</p> <p>The critique comes before QBE’s annual general meeting in Sydney on Friday, and against a backdrop of rapidly rising premiums that has priced some households out of insurance coverage altogether.</p> <p>Homes in flood and fire-prone areas have been subject to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/27/insurance-companies-should-be-forced-to-disclose-calculations-inquiry-says-as-australians-face-rising-premiums">huge insurance cost increases</a>, and in some cases homes have been deemed uninsurable, as climate-driven disasters hit more frequently and with greater intensity.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/02/people-with-insufficient-home-insurance-more-likely-to-risk-their-lives-in-bushfires-experts-say">People with insufficient home insurance more likely to risk their lives in bushfires, experts say</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australian Ethical’s Amanda Richman said QBE’s policies allow it to underwrite new oil and gas projects without any restrictions to at least 2030, and in some cases out to 2040, making it an outlier among insurers.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/sign-up-for-the-clear-air-australia-environment-newsletter-with-adam-morton?CMP=copyembed">Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>She said while QBE says it engages with its fossil fuel clients, the approach appears to be “little more than a data collection exercise that serves to delay accountability”.</p> <p>“We’re not seeing any suggestion that QBE is prepared to escalate where there is a lack of progress,” Richman said.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/mDYap/1/" data-alt="Bar chart showing contribution of insurance to CPI calculations"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/mDYap/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>She said the Australian-based global insurer “was not joining the dots” between support for fossil fuel projects and the need to reduce climate risks.</p> <p>Australian Ethical held $56m worth of QBE shares at the end of January.</p> <p>There are no resolutions listed at QBE’s upcoming AGM specifically targeting the insurer’s underwriting policies.
