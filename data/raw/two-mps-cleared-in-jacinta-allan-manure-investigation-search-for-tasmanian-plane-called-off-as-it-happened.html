  <p><strong>Matt Thistlethwaite: Hamas does not want two states</strong></p> 
  <p>The assistant foreign minister says the government has gone “directly against” what Hamas wants by recognising Palestinian statehood.</p> 
  <p>Speaking with the ABC a short time ago, Thistlethwaite said that as part of a coalition of nations, Australia could make a big impact.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That is why the two-state solution conference at the United Nations in New York is all about: joining 150 other nations to say that enough is enough. There is a humanitarian catastrophe happening in Gaza, people are being denied food and water and medical supplies. Aid workers have been at killed and the hostages, nearly two years on, have not been released.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said the Albanese government had “gone further than any other Australian government has ever gone on it recognition of Palestine” and that it was “using this as a means to try and bring this conflict to an end”.</p> 
  <p>In response to claims the recognition was a reward to Hamas, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Hamas do not want this, they have always said they do not want two states. We are going directly against what they want.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said opposition leader <strong>Sussan Ley’s</strong> letter to the Republicans was “more about her warding off the challenge that has come to her from the right wing hawks in her party” than it was about “good Australian foreign policy”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For them to try and undermine the position of the Prime Minister and the nation of Australia, at an international forum like the United Nations, is a disgrace. I think it says everything about the quality of her leadership.</p>

  <p><strong>Palestinian foreign minister says delegation ‘should have been’ in New York to witness state recognition</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Dr Varsen Aghabekian Shahin</strong>, Palestine’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, says she is frustrated that a Palestinian delegation could not attend the UN General Assembly in New York because their US visas were denied.</p> 
  <p>Speaking with the ABC a short time ago, she said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This was an historic moment and we would have loved to be joining the meeting in New York and celebrating this historic moment … we should have been there.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said recognition was “long overdue” and was a legal, moral and ethical reward for Palestinians.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s their right to have a state of their own. That right is enshrined in international law. And today most of the world is saying yes to recognition and yes to the rights of the Palestinians and yes to the right of people to self-determination and yes to compliance with international law.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said nonrecognition was a “reward to the extremists who do not [recognise] the two-state solution”. But the priority, she said, was a ceasefire, “because our people are being slaughtered on a daily basis”.</p>

  <p>According to Weatherzone, Ragasa - known as locally in the Philippines as Nando - is the first super typhoon to form in the Northwest Pacific region this season. Its eye measured 74km diameter on Monday, with peak wind gusts of around 324 km/h near its core. <strong>Weatherzone</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>One of the standout features in the satellite images of Ragasa is the presence of mesovortices, which are small-scale circulations of air near the typhoon’s eyewall.</p> 
   <p>Mesovortices in the eye of a typhoon can be extremely dangerous as they are capable of producing very destructive winds.</p> 
   <p>Ragasa is expected to move towards the west over the next few days, taking a path that will impact parts of the Philippines, China and Vietnam.</p>

  <p><strong>Hannah Thomas’ lawyer calls alleged police action ‘cowardly, gratuitous’</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Hannah Thomas’</strong> lawyer has released a statement after a police officer was today charged with assaulting her during a pro-Palestine protest in June.</p> 
  <p>Thomas, a former Greens candidate, was arrested and charged alongside four others at the protest in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney">Sydney</a> on 27 June. She sustained a serious eye injury after she was arrested.</p> 
  <p>Thomas’ lawyer, <strong>Peter O’Brien</strong>, says civil action will be filed over what<em> </em>“we allege was a cowardly, gratuitous and compensable act of violence by a serving NSW Police Officer”.</p> 
  <p>He said the alleged conduct of police was an “indictment on the way in which government and police are manoeuvring to criminalise and suppress protest and dissent in this state: this is of significant concern for all interested in the preservation of democracy in NSW.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Tasmanian police have formally suspended a search for a light plane that went missing last month in the state with two people on board.</p> 
  <p>Tasmania police inspector <strong>Craig Fox</strong> said extensive search operations had been conducted for the missing plane since 2 August in Tasmania’s north:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Considerable search efforts have been undertaken, utilising resources such as the Tasmania police helicopter for aerial searching and police vessels out on the water, but unfortunately the light plane, and its two occupants and their dog, have not been located.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Gregory Vaughan</strong>, 72, and his partner, <strong>Kim Worner</strong>, 66, from Deloraine, were in a light sport aircraft that took off from George Town airport about 12.45pm on Saturday, 2 August. The plane did not arrive at its destination in central NSW as scheduled, prompting family members to raise the alarm.</p> 
  <p>Fox said no new search areas had been identified and inquiries suggested the two missing people had not been in contact with anyone or aviation authorities since they left George Town.</p> 
  <p>A report will be prepared for the coroner, police said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Victoria parliament’s new integrity watchdog clears MPs in manure investigation</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Victorian parliament’s new integrity watchdog has botched its first investigation – into the manure dumped out the front of premier <strong>Jacinta Allan’s</strong> office – by issuing defective notices.</p> 
  <p>In a report tabled on Tuesday, the Parliamentary Workplace Standards and Integrity Commission made no finding of misconduct by Liberal MPs<strong> Bev McArthur</strong> and <strong>Nicole Werner</strong>, who assisted an angry farmer to deliver a box of cow manure to the door of Allan’s parliament office on 20 May.</p> 
  <p>They said the duo cooperated fully with their investigation. However, the commission midway through “became aware of a technical issue” with their investigation request notices as they were approved by a commissioner but issued by their staff:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Consequently, in the interests of transparency, fairness, and accountability, the commission has decided not to consider the evidence collected through the original request notices.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The commission decided not to reissue the notices because “repeating investigative interviews and evidence collection is not proportionate to the nature of the alleged conduct”.</p> 
  <p>The Parliamentary Workplace Standards and Integrity Commission was established in late 2024 to investigate all bullying, harassment, sexual harassment and victimisation complaints made against sitting MPs.</p> 
  <p>According to its 2024/25 annual report, tabled on Thursday, it has received 13 referrals since 1 January. Of those, seven were dismissed because they did not fall within the jurisdiction of the watchdog.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A Melbourne police dog named Rocco survived a freeway collision after being ejected from a patrol vehicle on Monday night.</p> 
  <p>Victoria police<strong> </strong>charged a man over the collision, in Melbourne’s north-west, which left Rocco and his handler injured.</p> 
  <p>Police alleged a white Mercedes-Benz collided with the rear of a police vehicle in Tullamarine at about 10.45pm last night. During the incident, Rocco the German shepherd was ejected from the police car.</p> 
  <p>The dog is being treated for non-life-threatening injuries and his handler was treated at the scene for minor injuries and taken to the hospital for observation.</p> 
  <p>The driver of the Mercedes, a 19-year-old man, stopped at the scene and was unharmed. A passenger in the vehicle, a woman, 21, was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</p> 
  <p>The man has since been charged with reckless conduct endangering life, reckless conduct endangering serious injury, driving in a dangerous manner, unlicensed driving and probationary driver using a prohibited vehicle.</p> 
  <p>He was bailed and is due to appear in court in January.</p>

  <p><strong>Two Labor MPS will not recontest their seats in next election</strong></p> 
  <p>Two Victorian Labor MPs have announced they will not recontest their seats at the 2026 state election.</p> 
  <p>Bayswater MP <strong>Jackson Taylor </strong>and Melton MP <strong>Steve McGhie</strong> both announced their plans on Tuesday afternoon.</p> 
  <p>Both MPs were first elected at the 2018 “Danslide” election, with Taylor winning the eastern suburbs seat off the Liberals for the first time since 2006 after having served the local community as a police officer, a police prosecutor and a councillor.</p> 
  <p>He issued a statement on social media saying it was the “right time to step back” ahead of the birth of his second child. Taylor wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Being in politics and public office has given me incredible opportunities to work with our community and achieve things together that I’m immensely proud of. But it has also meant a lot of time away from my family. This hasn’t been an easy decision, but after nearly 10 years in public life, including my time on council – it feels like the right time to step back.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>McGhie, meanwhile, won the western suburbs seat – and fended off challenges since – after 13 years leading the Victorian ambulance union. He wrote on social media that it was time to “pass the baton and create space for fresh energy and new ideas to the next generation”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>From the moment Dan Andrews encouraged me to put my hand up, it has been an absolute privilege to serve. I am grateful to have worked under the leadership of strong Labor Premiers, first <strong>Daniel Andrews</strong> and now <strong>Jacinta Allan</strong>.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Allan issued statements thanking both men for their service. Both will serve until the election. Labor will begin the process of preselecting candidates next week.</p>

  <p><strong>Sydney’s Night Stalker rapist pleads guilty to 13 charges over attacks against women in 1990s</strong></p> 
  <p>A man accused of terrorising women in the early 1990s across Sydney, who was dubbed the Night Stalker, has pleaded guilty to 13 charges.</p> 
  <p>The man appeared before Downing Centre local court on Thursday, weeks after the serial rapist was unmasked as Glenn Gary Cameron. His identity had remained a secret since he was arrested more than 18 months ago due to suppression orders.</p> 
  <p>Cameron, now 61, was accused of assaulting at least eight women while in his 20s between 1991 and 1993 in Sydney’s inner-west and eastern suburbs, specifically Moore Park.</p> 
  <p>Cameron was arrested in February 2024 at Sydney airport after a breakthrough in forensic technology helped police progress the 30-year-old cold case.</p> 
  <p>He had initially faced 36 charges, including 19 counts of aggravated sexual assault involving a threat to inflict actual bodily harm on a victim with a weapon and eight counts of indecent assault.</p>

  <p><strong>Queensland’s premier declares he’s ‘not interested in fairweather friends’ from big corporates</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>David Crisafulli</strong> is giving his first state of the state address, an event organised by the <strong>Committee for Economic Development of Australia</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The premier repeated an oft-heard line about the state being “open for business”, but said that “should not be misconstrued as a chance for corporations to transfer their liabilities and the business downside to Queensland and to the Queensland government”.</p> 
  <p>The state government is currently under pressure by the resources sector to slash coal royalties after a string of coalmine closure announcements last week the mining lobby blamed on the state’s progressive royalties scheme. Crisafulli said:</p>

  <p><strong>Australia’s aerial fire-fighting fleet to ramp up soon</strong></p> 
  <p>The <strong>National Emergency Management Agency’s</strong> acting head, <strong>Joe Buffone</strong>, says Australia’s aerial fire-flighting fleet will ramp up significantly from next month ahead of the summer.</p> 
  <p>Buffone told a media briefing this morning there was just one Black Hawk helicopter in the national fleet at the moment, but <a href="https://minister.homeaffairs.gov.au/MurrayWatt/Pages/more-aircraft-keep-australians-safer-from-disasters.aspx">the remaining 161 aircraft promised in May last year </a>would begin filtering in from early October.</p> 
  <p>NEMA’s boss said it was important that aircraft in the fleet could be utilised for different weather responses. For example, he said, a helicopter last year dealt mostly with flood responses despite having a primary responsibility for fire-fighting.</p> 
  <p>In response to some criticisms about the federal government not yet accepting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/30/australia-must-prepare-for-future-shaped-by-extreme-climate-bushfire-royal-commission-report-warns">recommendations from the 2020 bushfire royal commission</a>, Buffone said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The important thing is that we have the aircraft, the right mix of aircraft, for the season ahead and, in particular, as we said, our focus is shifting to this multi-use capability, which allows us to have aircraft for longer periods of time, more effective and [which can] actually can be used across multiple hazards.</p>

  <p>Their statement continued: </p>

  <p>In a media briefing this morning,<strong> Joe Buffone</strong>, acting head of the <strong>National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA)</strong>, spoke of the increase in adverse weather events in recent years, such as floods and bushfires, but said the agency’s work extended to other crises, including those in national security and biosecurity.</p>

  <p><strong>AI datacentres could force an early water price hike, regulator warns</strong></p> 
  <p>The NSW price regulator just announced a price hike for Sydney water but warned another could come early if new datacentres are quick to arrive.</p> 
  <p>Large volumes of water are used to cool the vast warehouses which store and process data. New AI models such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> make heavy use of them.</p> 
  <p>Open-source <a href="https://www.datacentermap.com/australia/">estimates</a> suggest Australia already has 265 datacentres, with Amazon among the companies investing billions to build the projects in Sydney and Melbourne, and the NSW government has <a href="https://www.afr.com/property/commercial/how-many-data-centres-australia-needs-and-where-they-will-go-20250821-p5moud">reportedly</a> approved 90 more.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sydney Water</strong> told the independent pricing and regulatory tribunal it expected such centres to consume up to 250 megalitres a day, about one-sixth of Sydney’s present water consumption. Local councils argued it could be even more than that.</p> 
  <p><strong>Ipart</strong> warned it may need to hike prices earlier than usual if datacentre installations accelerate before the next scheduled 2029-30 review, but for now it believed existing projects could be covered under the existing system. Its report read:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is a possibility that Sydney Water may need to expand its system capacity materially over the next few years, potentially at significant additional cost. It may also sell more water than we have allowed for in setting prices … [and if so] we may consider reviewing and setting new prices before 2029-30.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Former CMO Paul Kelly: Trump’s announcement ‘cruel’ to pregnant women</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Australia’s former chief medical officer says the Trump administration’s announcement tying paracetamol to autism is “cruel” to pregnant women and unnecessarily puts blame on parents of children with autism, without evidence backing it up.</p> 
  <p><strong>Prof Paul Kelly </strong>told Guardian Australia he believed the announcement was a use of “mal-information” – twisting information to reach a certain end:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I don’t think it’s about protecting children from autism. I do worry that it’s part of a smoke screen for larger announcements which may well involve vaccines, which has been a long-held view of the current secretary for health in the Trump administration, <strong>Robert F Kennedy Jr</strong>.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Kelly also said the announcement goes against the best evidence we have, which was a Swedish study published last year of almost 2.5 million births, “essentially put the issue to bed. There is no link between paracetamol and autism.”</p> 
  <p>What an announcement like this does do is places blame on parents of children with autism “with no evidence that that’s the case.” Kelly said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That feeling of blame and of guilt is really common and incredibly dangerous and not a helpful emotion.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He also says it’s “cruel” to tell pregnant women in real pain or experiencing a fever not to take medication that is safe and effective.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Why are Sydney’s water bills rising by hundreds of dollars?</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>As we reported earlier, Sydney Water has gained permission to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/sep/23/australia-news-live-albanese-new-york-palestine-united-nations-donald-trump-mark-butler-paracetamol-pregnancy-ntwnfb?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68d1ed878f080fb4fddc3a11#block-68d1ed878f080fb4fddc3a11">hike its prices 14%</a> on 1 October.</p> 
  <p>NSW’s independent pricing and regulatory tribunal says the increase is necessary to cover the rising costs of water distribution. The hike will give <strong>Sydney Water</strong> an extra $179m per year to cover its day-to-day operations, including rising costs for water purchase and treatment.</p> 
  <p>The price increase will weigh more on the variable usage charge, which relates to how much water a household uses up, rather than the fixed fee to connect to the water service. As a result, Sydney customers are expected to cut back their water usage in response to the price hike, meaning water usage will stay at about the same level for the next five years despite a growing population.</p> 
  <p>The fee increase will also cover an increased spend on capital works so Sydney Water can replace ageing infrastructure and build new connections, storm water connections near the new Western Sydney airport and network expansions to cover greater use of the city’s desalination plant</p> 
  <p>An extra $180m has been allocated toward works on the city’s ocean-draining sewers, which some experts believe are to blame for thousands of debris balls or “fatbergs” washing ashore in the last year.</p> 
  <p>Difficult weather, among other factors, has made it harder to carry out expansions of networks around the outfall sewers at North Head, Bondi and Malabar. <strong>Ipart</strong> suggested the additional spend after <strong>NSW Health</strong> and the <strong>Environment Protection Authority</strong> called for the sewers to be prioritised. The review read:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have sought, and will continue, to protect consumers from unjustified price increases for water and wastewater services. However, increases in maximum prices are required now to fund efficient expenditure to deliver reliable and safe water services and to reflect a fair contribution between today’s customers and future customers.</p>

  <p>The NSW transport minister, <strong>John Graham</strong>, has given a press conference following the releasing of a “sobering” review into rail safety on Sydney’s train network, as we reported earlier.</p> 
  <p>Graham says since the incident on 20 May a network-wide digital scan has identified 126 additional points of interest on the network, which have now been resolved.</p> 
  <p>The review, led by transport industry expert <strong>Kerry Schott</strong> and commissioned after an overhead wire snapped and fell on to the roof of a train, found the wire was first observed to be beyond its operational capacity – or “condemning limit” – during a network-wide inspection commissioned in 2020.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I do apologise for what they had to experience over those two days. The gaps in process, in technology and in systems, were made very clear by the review team.

  <p><strong>Insurer RACQ allegedly disguised premium hikes with false figures</strong></p> 
  <p>A top Queensland insurance company allegedly disguised premium hikes as high as 40% by overstating how much customers had previously been billed.</p> 
  <p><strong>RACQ</strong> received complaints about the allegedly misleading price claims just two days after it began sharing them but continued to use them for five years, the corporate regulator has alleged.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian securities and investments commission</strong> has taken RACQ to the federal court, as it focuses on insurers’ failures to be fair and show good faith to customers, Asic’s deputy chair, <strong>Sarah Court</strong>, said, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>During a cost-of-living crisis, we believe RACQ misled thousands of customers by including false comparison pricing in their renewal documents. … Customers were potentially left paying more.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>RACQ sent more than 570,000 renewal documents to customers from 2019 to 2024, telling them their new premium alongside their “last period premium,” which Asic alleges was often higher than their actual spend the previous period.</p> 
  <p>Asic alleges one customer had been charged about $5,030 in the prior period but faced a new premium of about $7,030, a 40% hike, but RACQ’s notice quoted a “last period premium” figure of $6,930 incorrectly suggested they were facing a hike of just 1.5%.</p> 
  <p>RACQ said it had clarified its communications, updated its renewal polices and self-reported comparison price notice issue to Asic, and was working with the regulator and conducting a review, adding:</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The government has taken a position in respect of the recognition of Palestine which recognises the legitimate aspiration of the Palestinian people to statehood.

  <p>The climate change minister, <strong>Chris Bowen</strong>, has urged the global community to reject the “all too hard” argument that opponents of climate action are using to justify delays to the green energy transition.</p> 
  <p>In a speech to the United Nations during Climate Week in New York, Bowen said the world was decarbonising at a “very rapid pace” as he challenged the “doom and gloom” about a slowdown in global action to slash emissions. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Climate denial is still with us but it takes new forms. All too hard, they said, it’s all too hard. Or no one else is doing enough. Why should we do this when the rest of the world isn’t moving? And that’s an easy message and narrative for the deniers and the delayers to communicate when there’s plenty of doom and gloom and stories about how the world is not proceeding with action on climate change. We know though it isn’t true. Two trillion dollars of investment in renewable energy, twice the investment in fossil fuels.</p>

  <p>Donald Trump’s return to the White House, and swift decision to again withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, has prompted renewed concerns for the fate of the global goal of limiting temperature rise to 1.5C.</p>

  <p>The new prices will go into effect from 1 October.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sydney Water</strong> and <strong>Water NSW</strong> today received permission to hike their fees, which will see households with an annual bill of $1,220 spending $1,388 in a year’s time and $1,695 in five years’ time.</p> 
  <p>The NSW independent pricing and regulatory tribunal’s decision would see the typical household bill rise by nearly 12%, plus inflation, which is above 2%. Prices will rise just over 5%, plus inflation, for each subsequent year until 2030.</p> 
  <p>The tribunal said it recognised the bill hikes could add to cost-of-living pressures on customers and said it had called for the state government to offer water bill rebates to a wider share of people in need of income support.</p> 
  <p>Sydney Water had asked for an even bigger bill increase of $4.70 a week to fund its proposed $32bn spend on the city’s sewerage system over the next 15 years.</p>

   <p>It is possible to back Australia and still be an effective opposition. And really, it’s time that Ms. Ley and the Liberals understood that. We know we’re strongest when we speak with one voice. We all understand that as Australians and the opposition should understand that too.</p>

  <p><strong>Sharma says Ley’s letter to US Republicans ‘perfectly appropriate’</strong></p> 
  <p>Liberal senator <strong>Dave Sharma</strong>, a former Australian ambassador to Israel, said it was “perfectly appropriate” for opposition leader <strong>Sussan Ley</strong> to tell the United States her government would reverse Australia’s recognition of Palestine. Ley sent the letter to US Republicans ahead of Albanese’s addresss to the UN.</p> 
  <p>Sharma told RN Breakfast he was not bothered by the unusual step:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Firstly, it’s the Labor government that has overturned decades of bipartisan foreign policy consensus on how a Palestinian state should come about. It’s not the Liberals, it’s Labor that’s done that.</p> 
   <p>And secondly, it’s perfectly appropriate and normal for opposition politicians to have relationships with parliamentary counterparts in other parliaments around the world.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Sharma said he didn’t believe the recognition of a Palestinian state was helpful:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>All it’s doing, unfortunately, is hardening opinion on both sides of the conflict, strengthening Hamas, but also, sadly, strengthening hardline voices in Israel’s government as well.</p>

  <p><strong>Penny Wong maintains Australia only sanctions politicians ‘with others’ </strong></p> 
  <p>Foreign minister <strong>Penny Wong</strong> was questioned on RN Breakfast about Australia’s lack of sanctions on Israeli politicians over the ongoing war in Gaza. Wong said the country had imposed sanctions on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/11/australia-sanctions-two-extremist-israeli-ministers-for-inciting-violence-against-palestinians">two Israeli ministers </a>alongside other nations in June for inciting violence against Palestinians, but RN host Sally Sara asked why those sanctions hadn’t been extended to others as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has worsened.</p> 
  <p>Wong said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You may think that that is insufficient. We do this with other parties, and we have worked very closely with the United Kingdom and Canada and others to impose these sanctions.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Sara again noted Australia had not sanctioned any Israeli politicians in connection with Gaza.</p> 
  <p>“And to be clear, neither has any other country”, Wong said. “My point about that is: we sanction with others. That is how we have an effect”. She went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I understand that people are distressed by what is happening in Gaza. I am distressed by it. We all are. But you do what you can, and that is what we are doing: being here now with others, working with other countries, all of whom want to see peace.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Like we did as Australia during the pandemic, we really took strong health advice from doctors, from researchers, and from that medical community and our regulator. So I’d encourage Australians to still do the same.</p> 
   <p>Our chief health officers and medical officers are medical practitioners, and trained in analysing these studies and weighing up the pros and cons and translating that into information that’s understandable by the general public.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Danielle McMullen</strong>, the president of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), said this morning there are no studies showing paracetamol use in pregnancy causes autism.</p> 
  <p>McMullen spoke to RN Breakfast following US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s assertion that the popular painkiller was linked to autism – even though it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/sep/22/can-you-use-tylenol-acetaminophen-paracetamol-during-pregnancy-is-it-safe-explainer">widely considered a safe option </a>to treat pain and fever during pregnancy.</p> 
  <p>McMullen said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>There are no studies showing that paracetamol use in pregnancy causes autism</strong>. There have been some studies showing what we call an association between paracetamol use and autism in children, but there’s also been really large studies showing that there’s no association. And it’s important to remember that association doesn’t mean cause.</p> 
   <p>It could be that there’s a whole range of things that happened during pregnancies, and one of those was that the pregnant mother took paracetamol, but it also could be that she had a fever or there were genetic factors.</p> 
   <p>In fact, <strong>in autism, it’s most likely that autism is linked with genetic factors as its primary driver, but we really don’t know the full cause of autism.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Monique Ryan quits parliament’s sports club over gambling lobby links, describing it as ‘influence by stealth’</strong></p> 
  <p>Crossbench MP <strong>Monique Ryan</strong> has quit federal parliament’s sports club hours after it was listed as an official lobbyist group with clients in the gambling, alcohol and fossil fuel industries.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian Parliament Sports Club</strong> was registered on the government’s lobbyist register on Monday, days after<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/17/gambling-lobby-sponsorship-australian-parliament-sports-club-condemned-by-crossbench-mps-kate-chaney"> Guardian Australia reported concerns about its sponsorship from groups lobbying the government on policy.</a></p> 
  <p>The club allows companies to pay an annual membership fee in return for access to multiple social and formal events, which are regularly attended by federal politicians. Previously the company run by the club’s chief executive, Sports Hydrant, was listed on the lobbyist register.</p> 
  <p>The club has rejected claims its games are anything other than a chance for politicians and staff to relax and exercise and insist all rules have been followed. But Ryan said it provided its corporate members a chance to build “influence by stealth”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>To paraphrase Groucho Marx, I’m not signing up for any parliamentary sports club which serves up gambling industry lobbying with its early morning basketball games. I’m resigning from the club today.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The club’s registration has also drawn criticism from crossbench MPs <strong>Sophie Scamps</strong>, <strong>Allegra Spender</strong>, <strong>Kate Chaney</strong>, <strong>David Pocock</strong> and <strong>Helen Haines</strong>, who pointed out the prime minister’s position as the club’s chair.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While Australians wait for the government to take serious action on gambling harm, the Australian Parliamentary Sports Club – chaired by the prime minister himself – is acting on behalf of clients that include the gambling industry.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Last week, the club said it does not lobby on behalf of any of its corporate members. The prime minister’s office has previously been contacted for comment.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Health minister <strong>Mark Butler</strong> has called on the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) to provide urgent advice on the safety of taking paracetamol during pregnancy, following suggestions – without evidence – by US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> that the popular painkiller is linked to autism.</p> 
  <p>Butler urged pregnant women to seek medical advice before discontinuing taking the drug which is also used to treat fever, which can lead to serious complications during pregnancy, until the TGA had a chance to look at the report Trump had alluded to.</p> 
  <p>Paracetamol is considered a safe option to treat pain or fever during pregnancy, and is widely recommended by doctors for short-term use.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a very widely used drug as everyone knows, and we want to make sure that we look very closely at any announcement from the US, particularly if it comes through the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA.</p> 
   <p>We’ll look at it very closely, our TGA works very closely with the FDA obviously and I want to make sure that we have advice for pregnant women in particular, very quickly.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>During a speech at a <strong>Charlie Kirk</strong> memorial service on Sunday US time, Trump suggested he and his health secretary <strong>Robert F Kennedy</strong> would make an important announcement in the Oval Office on Monday, local time, about a link between Tylenol, a paracetamol brand popular in the US, and autism.</p> 
  <p>The report is expected to recommend taking leucovorin, a form of vitamin B.</p> 
  <p>“I think you’re going to find it to be amazing,” Trump said. “I think we found an answer to autism.”</p>
