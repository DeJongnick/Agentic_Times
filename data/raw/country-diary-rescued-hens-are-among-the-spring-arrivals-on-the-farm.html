<p>The first crocuses have come out&nbsp;this week, the winter jobs have&nbsp;been finished and we are getting ready for lambing. This winter we planted more than 1km&nbsp;of new hedgerows and an orchard of 16 fruit trees: local varieties of apple and damson sourced from a nearby orchard group. We also repaired drystone&nbsp;walls and fenced off some ruined buildings in danger&nbsp;of&nbsp;collapse.</p> <p>Attention now turns to spring&nbsp;and new life. We hopefully&nbsp;start lambing on 12 April,&nbsp;but before then the sheep&nbsp;pens must be disinfected and set up in the shed&nbsp;as a sort of&nbsp;hospital ward for yows who have a difficult birth or find it hard to bond with their lamb. Most yows have a strong mothering instinct and immediately care for&nbsp;their newborns, but we need to have a backup plan for any who&nbsp;struggle.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/01/country-diary-i-love-farming-this-land-but-money-worries-are-on-my-mind">I wrote last month</a>, we have&nbsp;been waiting for the other half of a sustainable farming incentive scheme agreement, and&nbsp;thankfully that came through. But the latest shock from the government is that it is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/11/farmers-in-england-furious-as-defra-pauses-post-brexit-payment-scheme">closing the scheme</a>. It was&nbsp;only luck that I submitted the latest application when I did (I was going&nbsp;to&nbsp;wait until after lambing, but changed&nbsp;my mind). </p> <p>Several of our friends and neighbours hadn’t submitted&nbsp;theirs and now are at a loss as to how they will fund environmental work on their farms. A new version of the scheme is supposed to be coming,&nbsp;but to close a funding scheme with no notice (there was supposed to be six weeks’ notice) makes it very stressful for everyone trying to farm in a nature-friendly way.</p> <p>We have just collected some hens that had been rehomed by&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.bhwt.org.uk/">British Hen Welfare Trust</a>. These are ex-commercial hens that will have a home for the rest of their lives on our farm, where they can be ridiculously free range and entertain us with their antics, dust-bathing in the farmyard and digging up the garden. They will also provide the&nbsp;three generations of our family&nbsp;that live on the farm with&nbsp;tasty eggs for breakfast.</p> <p>• Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-changing-skies-9781783353101/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=article">guardianbookshop.com</a> and get a 15% discount</p>
