<p>This film – the title of which has been translated as Night Courier for English-speaking audiences – has been a huge box office hit on its home turf in Saudi Arabia, which lifted a 35-year ban on cinemas in 2017. It’s a kind of satirical dark comedy about a Deliveroo-style driver called Fahad (Mohamad Aldokhei), who gets mixed up in alcohol bootlegging. Fahad is a bit of a fantasist, and there’s something Robert De Niro-like about the way Aldokhei plays it, with echoes of Travis Bickle and a little Rupert Pupkin. Or, for a more a recent reference of delusional masculinity, Jake Gyllenhaal’s Lou Bloom in Nightcrawler.</p> <p>The movie opens with Fahad losing his job at a call centre. He’s been caught red-handed being rude to customers, but he tries to brazen it out. His posturing is ridiculous, but it tips over when he grabs a fire extinguisher and assaults his line manager. After being fired, Fahad turns his side-hustle delivery work into a full-time job; driving around Riyadh at night making dropoffs to rich people in luxury penthouses, his alienation captured by cinematographer Ahmed Tahoun’s chilly camerawork.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsOmqk9TLIk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RsOmqk9TLIk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Rising-star director Ali Kalthami presents us with a glimpse of Riyadh in transition. The city is modernising, but luckless Fahad is stuck in the past. He misinterprets a female ex-colleague’s friendliness as romantic interest; it’s obvious she views him sweet but sad. Fahad’s sister Sara is opening a cookie business; she doesn’t need his help but he blunders in, casting himself as her protector.</p> <p>Then one night he spots an alcohol dealer, follows him and steals his stash of liquor, idiotically unaware of the likely repercussions. I didn’t feel the movie maintained the dramatic tension enough to work as a lean thriller, but as a portrait of a toxic man who thinks he could be a contender it’s funny and disturbing, with an impressive lead performance by Aldokhei.</p> <p>• Mandoob is in UK and Irish cinemas from 30 August</p>
