<h2><strong>The Iris Affair</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Atlantic</strong></p> <p>There’s a propulsive opening to Niamh Algar and Tom Hollander’s cat-and-mouse thriller. Iris Nixon (Algar) is an elusive puzzle-solving genius who is invited by entrepreneur Cameron Beck (Hollander) to solve her biggest puzzle yet: a mind-blowing piece of technology with terrifying powers. But when Iris finds the device’s activation sequence, she goes on the run with it – and an action-packed chase around Italy ensues. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>Classic Movies: The Story of The 39 Steps</strong></h2> <p><strong>8pm, Sky Arts</strong></p> <p>“If you ever need to make the case for Alfred Hitchcock, there is no better answer than The 39 Steps.” Ian Nathan returns with the series that tells the stories of genre-defining cinema titles, starting with the British thriller about a man and woman who get caught up in an organisation of spies. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Taskmaster</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong></p> <p>The famous faces of season 20 continue to put their all into the warped challenges set by Greg Davies and “Little” Alex Horne. This week sees Reece Shearsmith go into full Eurobaddy mode as he reinterprets Edgar Allan Poe, while Sanjeev Bhaskar makes a statement with a Rube Goldberg machine. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2><strong>How I Made </strong><strong>£1 Million</strong><strong> in 90 Days</strong></h2> <p><strong>10pm, </strong><strong>Channel 4</strong></p>    <p>Can viral stunt-puller Oobah Butler make £1m in three months? He gives it a good shot by launching an “ethical sweatshop”, selling a stick for hundreds of pounds and auctioning himself in New York. But with endless setbacks and depressing decisions leaving him conflicted (“All I think about is money now”), it’s not looking likely he’ll pull this one off. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>Brassic</strong></h2> <p><strong>10pm, Sky Max</strong></p> <p>It’s the final series of the mad-for-it sitcom so you can forgive the creators for getting a little dewy-eyed. This spirited episode is elegiac for the euphoric era of illegal raves, as ex-DJ Curtis Plum (Shameless veteran Dean Lennox Kelly) recruits the gang to locate his fez-wearing, whistleblowing hype man for one last party.<em> </em><em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2><strong>Dreaming </strong><strong>Whilst</strong><strong> Black</strong></h2> <p><strong>10.10pm, BBC Three</strong></p>    <p>A triple bill to round out series two of Adjani Salmon’s dream sequence-peppered comedy about the hurdles facing young Black artists who are just trying to make it. Aspiring director Kwabena (Salmon) is getting stuck into his first big TV gig but is also keen to win back his ex. Will dinner at a swanky restaurant impress her? <em>GV</em></p>
