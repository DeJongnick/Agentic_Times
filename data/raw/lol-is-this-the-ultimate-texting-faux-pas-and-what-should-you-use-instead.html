<p><strong>Name:</strong> “LOL”.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> The Oxford English Dictionary first included <a href="https://www.oed.com/dictionary/lol_v?tl=true">LOL</a> in 1997.</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with</strong>: Loll, which is what dogs sometimes do.</p> <p><strong>So as in “laugh out loud”? </strong>Or laughing out loud, though David Cameron thought it stood for “lots of love” and used to sign off to Rebekah Brooks, the former Sun and News of the World editor, with a LOL.</p> <p><strong>I’m LOL-ing at his LOL mishap.</strong> Well, you shouldn’t.</p> <p><strong>Why?</strong> Because anyone who still LOLs is not cool.</p> <p><strong>Laughing out loud is no longer acceptable?</strong> No, using LOL in a text or a WhatsApp is no longer acceptable.</p> <p><strong>Says who?</strong> It’s according to gen Z. A survey by Sky Mobile has revealed that getting a LOL in a message gives 26% of 18- to 28-year-olds the ick. Their second biggest gripe, in fact.</p> <p><strong>What’s top</strong><strong> of the icks?</strong> Sluggish replies. Related, and not far behind, is an impatient “??” if you don’t get an immediate reply to the first message. Though, interestingly, 79% admitted to ignoring messages.</p> <p><strong>Almost like they hate themselves!</strong> Actually, 61% did admit to being embarrassed by their own texting habits.</p> <p><strong>I’ll probably just stick to a simple </strong><strong>thumbs up</strong><strong> emoji, to be on the safe side 👍 </strong>Again, that’s considered cringe, I’m afraid. Likewise, the see-no-evil monkey 🙈, an awkward grimace 😬, and the happy poo 💩.</p> <p><strong>Ew! And the tears of joy emoji 😂</strong><strong>, as a </strong><strong>LOL substitute</strong><strong>? I’m guessing that’s over too?</strong> Only <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/08/12/using-emojis-text-telltale-sign-old-21401742/">used by oldies</a>. Gen Zs (and below) are more likely to send a skull 💀, or a coffin ⚰️.</p> <p><strong>So </strong><strong>dying</strong><strong> of, not crying with,</strong><strong> laughter?</strong> Exactly.</p> <p><strong>What about abbreviations, like “hru” and “wyd”? </strong>How am I? I’m fine. And I am probably not replying to that, that’s what I’m doing.</p> <p><strong>Rly?</strong> Really. A study published in the <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/xge-xge0001684.pdf">Journal of Experimental Psychology</a> found that while they might save the sender time, the receiver might see using abbreviations as a sign of insincerity. Annoying to young and old alike.</p> <p><strong>God, it’s complicated isn’t it, trying to keep up?</strong> Tell me about it. There’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/video/cringe-cap-yolo-longer-8th-grade-students-108314692">a video on ABC news</a> of school kids telling their teacher that “cringe” is out.</p> <p><strong>“Cringe” is cringe! </strong>And “ick” probably gives them the ick.</p> <p><strong>Does any of it matter? I’m hoping that people will be able to see beyond text speak and emojis</strong><strong> </strong><strong>to the actual person.</strong><strong> </strong>Keep hoping. Going back to that Sky Mobile survey, 58% of these gen Zs confessed they have considered dumping their partner because of what they see as bad phone etiquette. Who’s LOL-ing now?</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> “It was an ironic LOL, obviously …”</p> <p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “Happy Valentine’s Day, Samantha, LOL!”</p>
