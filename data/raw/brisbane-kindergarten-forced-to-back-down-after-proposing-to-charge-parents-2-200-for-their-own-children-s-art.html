<p>A Brisbane kindergarten has been forced to back down after asking parents to pay $2,200 for their own children’s artwork amid a dispute over the management of the childcare centre.</p> <p>Craigslea community kindergarten, a local childcare centre in Chermside West in Brisbane’s north, made national headlines this week after a series of emails to parents. The centre has been in turmoil for weeks and was closed after a mass exodus of staff before the school holidays.</p> <p>On Sunday, the management committee sent parents a 1,000-word email claiming the centre was “insolvent”, owing more than $40,314 to the tax office and employees. It proposed to “wind up” the centre, which has been placed into voluntary administration.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The next day, in a second email the management committee proposed to charge $2,200 for a scrapbook of artwork produced by their children and photographs of them to help pay off the debt.</p> <p>“If you are opposed to the committee using the portfolios as a $2,200 per piece fundraiser to make up for the $40,314 owing to teachers, please complete the below,” it read.</p> <p>“Where there are members that have used the separated parents provision for membership, both need to send it in and jointly accept the postage charge in equal parts.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the state’s Department of Education said the children’s portfolios “are now available for families to collect, free of charge”.</p> <p>“Under the education and care services national regulations, parents can request certain documentation pertaining to their child. The approved provider must make the documentation available on request,” the spokesperson said.</p> <p>According to its website, Craigslea is an “affiliated centre” of C&amp;K Childcare and Kindergarten and receives support from their nationwide firm, but operates as an independent incorporated association managed by a volunteer management committee.</p> <p>Last year’s audited finances for the centre show it made a $45,003 loss in 2024, with a total income of $360,772.</p> <p>“We did not make this organisation insolvent, it was already insolvent,” the management committee said on Sunday.</p> <p>“The association’s solicitors have recommended going into Voluntary Administration under Corporations Act 2001 (cth) part 5.3A, as the business is insolvent.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
