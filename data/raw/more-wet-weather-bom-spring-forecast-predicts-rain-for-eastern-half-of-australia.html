<p>Spring looks set to be wetter than usual for Australia’s entire eastern half, according to the Bureau of Meteorology’s latest long-range forecast, after data showed record heat in the ocean around the continent in July.</p> <p>The bureau’s forecast for spring also pointed to warmer than average night-time temperatures over almost the entire country.</p> <p>Daytime temperatures were also likely to be<strong> </strong>above average across the north and south, with average conditions expected in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales.</p> <p>Tasmania is likely to see maximum temperatures in the top 20% on record, the forecast showed. </p> <p>Global weather models suggested warmer waters in the eastern part of the Indian Ocean off Australia’s north-west were developing – a phenomenon known as a negative Indian Ocean Dipole, which can bring wetter conditions.</p>    <p>Dr Simon Grainger, senior climatologist at the bureau, said: “It looks like we’re in the early stages of that negative IOD.</p> <p>“Historically we have seen that [a negative IOD] tends to favour wetter than average springs, particularly inland from the dividing range in NSW and Victoria.”</p> <p>Spring rainfall is between 60% and 80% more likely to be above average across most of the country’s east and September and October could be particularly wet, Grainger said.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaZtKqqAofs"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RaZtKqqAofs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption>The Bureau of Meteorology’s latest long-range forecast is suggesting a wet spring is likely for Australia’s east</figcaption> </figure>   <p>The increased cloud cover that could bring the rain would also help keep night-time temperatures above average almost everywhere except the south-west corner of Western Australia. </p> <h2>Record ocean heat</h2> <p>In the ocean, the bureau expects warmer than average sea surface temperatures (SST) to the north, east and south-east which could “enhance the severity of storms and rain systems”.</p> <p>Just like on land, global heating – caused mostly by burning fossil fuels – has been pushing up ocean temperatures around the globe.</p> <p>SSTs in July were 0.56C above average for the Australian region – the warmest July on the bureau’s record that goes back to 1900.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/27/australia-weather-forecast-snow-cold-fronts-south-east">Snow flurries forecast across four states as cold weather fronts push through Australia’s south-east</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The region’s SSTs have been at record, or near-record levels, since July last year, the bureau said.</p> <p>Australia’s hotter oceans were “part of a pattern we have seen globally,” said Grainger, where, since March 2023, temperatures have been at record highs.</p> <p>“In a globally warming climate, about 90% of the extra heat goes into the oceans,” he said.</p> <h2>Increased bushfire risk</h2>    <p>Australia’s climate has warmed by 1.5C since the bureau’s official temperature data record started in 1910.</p> <p>Spring 2024 was Australia’s warmest on record and since then, the country has broken a string of heat records.</p> <p>The 12 months ending in March 2025 were 1.61C above average – the hottest of any 12-month period on record.</p> <p>Earlier this week, fire chiefs said despite the expected wet conditions, they were expecting an increased risk of spring bushfires in parts of Victoria and northern and central WA.</p> <p>There was a heightened risk of bushfire for the Dampier Peninsula, Derby Coast and the central Kimberley, Little Sandy Desert and south-eastern Pilbara in WA.</p> <p>In the report, the fire chiefs said there was also increase bushfire risk for south-eastern agricultural areas of the Murraylands in South Australia and parts of Victoria, including south-west Gipplsland. </p>
