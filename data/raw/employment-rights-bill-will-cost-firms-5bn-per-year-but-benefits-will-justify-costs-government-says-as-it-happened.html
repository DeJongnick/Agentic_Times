She said the impact assessment published by the government today says the legislation will be good for growth.</p> <p>But, in an early intervention, the Conservative MP <strong>Graham Stuart</strong> said that document just said the measures might be good for growth. And, if there was a postive impact on growth, it would be small in magnitude according to the document, Stuart said.</p> <p>In the executive summary of<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/67162540d100972c0f4c9abd/Employment_rights_bill_economic_analysis.pdf"> its economic analysis</a>, the government says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We conclude the package could have a direct and positive impact on economic growth, but we expect this to be small.</p> </blockquote> <p>And here is the more considered conclusion, from paragraphs 168 and 169.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>On balance, we believe the impact on growth could be positive (i.e. the positive channels above outweigh the offsetting effects) but the direct impact would be small in magnitude. This is because the package is well targeted at low-paying sectors meaning that many of the channels covered above are less applicable for a large part of the economy. In addition, the evidence between employment rights and growth in the UK is limited, but where we do have strong, policy-specific evidence it often indicates that the policy has had a negligible effect on growth. For example, the national living wage, which has imposed a similar magnitude of costs on a similar part of the labour market in recent years as we expect the bill to have, has had a limited impact on productivity and participation (and by extension growth) in either direction. It is right that there is evidence linking flexible working to stronger productivity and this change will boost productivity for some workers and some employers, but the increase in uptake of ‘making flexible working the default’ is relatively small compared to the number of people employed and therefore, at a macroeconomic level, the impact on average productivity will be small.</p> <p>Whilst we conclude that the direct impact would be small, it is likely that by boosting protections and the quality of work for the poorest in the labour market, the package will enhance lower-paid workers’ share in the benefits of growth and boost equality in work. This is more than just good for equality; it could be good for the economy too as there is evidence that equality is important for ‘sustainable’ growth over the long-term. For example, the OECD note that higher inequality can lead to underinvestment in human capital and weaker adoption of technologies. They estimate that as a result of rising inequality between 1990 and 2010 output in the UK was almost nine percentage points lower than it could have otherwise been. As a result, by increasing the security, quality and equality of work, it’s possible that the bill could also indirectly support the government’s mission to grow the economy beyond a small direct impact, helping to raise living standards across the country.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67166e168f08556b4172d981" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-10-21T15:18:45.477Z">4.18pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Braverman sent government documents to personal email address 127 times as attorney general, FoI case reveals</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Suella Braverman forwarded government documents to her private email accounts on at least 127 occasions when she was attorney general, according to a story by <strong>George Greenwood</strong> <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/suella-braverman-sent-government-documents-to-her-private-email-127-times-d9nnvftn7">at the Times.</a></p> <p>The Attorney General’s Office disclosed the figure after a lengthy Freedom of Information battle culminated in a tribunal finding against the government.

It will significantly strengthen workers’ rights.</p> <p>In its economic analysis, the government says that some of these new regulations will impose new costs on business.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We expect the policies covered within the bill to impose a direct cost on business equivalent to low billion pounds per year. If we take the top-end of the range from our broad order of magnitude cost to business estimates in tables A3, A4, and A5 to get the maximum likely cost this sum to £4.5bn [sic]. As such, we are confident that the total direct cost to business will be less than £5bn annually. This represents a cautious assessment, and we expect the total cost to business to be refined downwards as our evidence improves and the policy development continues</p> <p>Nevertheless, to contextualise the size of this impact, total wage costs in the UK were £1.3 trillion in 2023 in nominal terms, meaning that an annual cost of up to £5bn is equivalent to an uplift of the UK’s total pay bill of up to 0.4%. This cost will be concentrated on employers in lower paid sectors, but even if we assumed all of this cost falls on such sectors, then hypothetically the equivalent uplift in the wage bill for that part of the economy would be up to 1.5%.</p> </blockquote> <p>The report says the empirical evidence about who would pay the cost of stronger employment protections is “ambiguous”. It says firms might pass on higher costs to customers. If they cannot do that, they might cut investment or training costs, or cut employment costs, it says.</p> <p>But the report says giving workers more rights will cut the number of days lost to stress, depression and anxiety, which it implies will more or less compensate for the increase in direct costs. It says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There will be further benefits for those in work from better job satisfaction, as well as improved wellbeing and health, which could be amount to billions of pounds a year. This will benefit their employers too as 17.1 million working days were lost due to stress, depression or anxiety in 2022/233 , equivalent to over £5bn of lost output.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the report says, overall, the impact of the bill will be positive.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>There are clear, evidence-based benefits of government action through the bill. Not acting would enable poor working conditions, insecure work, inequalities and broken industrial relations to persist.</p> <p>The bill will strengthen working conditions for the lowest-paid and most vulnerable in the labour market, increasing fairness and equality across Britain. It will have significant positive impacts on workers who are trapped in insecure work, face discrimination, or suffer from unscrupulous employer behaviour like ‘fire and refire’ practices.

This includes a consultation on our new approach to Statutory Sick Pay, where the Bill will be removing the waiting period and the Lower Earnings Limit.</p> <p>The Bill is expected to benefit people in some of the most deprived areas of the country by saving them up to £600 in lost income from the hidden costs of insecure work. Around 2.4 million people in the UK work irregular patterns like zero or low hours contracts or agency jobs, where insecure hours can mean forking out on expensive childcare or transport to cover last-minute shifts - or losing out altogether if work is changed or cancelled at short notice.</p> <p>New protections like guaranteed hours and giving reasonable notice or compensation for lost work will help shift workers keep up to £600 a year, including workers in the North and Midlands where irregular work is highest.</p> <p>For a cleaner working night shifts on an average annual wage of £21,058, a £600 saving would be worth over £250 more a year than the last two national insurance cuts.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6716591f8f0832d15c5fd225" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-10-21T13:39:41.919Z">2.39pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>MPs will debate the second reading of the employment rights bill later this afternoon.

When the Labour government came into power, <strong>Wes Streeting</strong>, the health secretary, declared on his first day in office <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/statement-from-the-secretary-of-state-for-health-and-social-care">“the policy of this department is that the NHS is broken”</a>. The government is going to publish a 10-year health plan to fix it, and it is due to be published next spring.</p> <p>Streeting has said the plan will involve three main elements: moving from analogue to digital; more focus on primary care, not hospital care; and more focus on prevention. <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2024/sep/12/keir-starmer-nhs-darzi-report-labour-tories-uk-politics?page=with:block-66e2be778f086d5a40e689c8#block-66e2be778f086d5a40e689c8">explained them</a> in a speech on the NHS in September.</p> <p>But today the government is asking people who work in the NHS and use it – the “entire nation”, as the <strong>Department of Health and Social Care</strong> puts it <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-issues-rallying-cry-to-the-nation-to-help-fix-nhs">in its news release</a> – to contribute to a consultation how health service should change. The DHSC explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Members of the public, as well as NHS staff and experts will be invited to share their experiences views and ideas for fixing the NHS via the online platform, <a href="https://change.nhs.uk/en-GB/">change.nhs.uk</a>, which will be live until the start of next year, and available via the NHS App.</p> <p>The public engagement exercise will help shape the government’s 10 Year Health Plan which will be published in spring 2025 and will be underlined by three big shifts in healthcare - hospital to community, analogue to digital, and sickness to prevention …</p> <p>Bold ambitions for the NHS can only be achieved by listening to the expertise and knowledge of its 1.54 million strong workforce. Their understanding of what’s holding them back from performing at their best will help us bring down waiting times and provide the world class care the public deserve.</p> <p>The government has already taken immediate action to address challenges in the health service and deliver an NHS fit for the future. Whether that’s agreeing a deal with resident doctors within weeks, securing a funding increase for GP practices to manage rising pressures or hiring an extra 1,000 GPs into the NHS by the end of this year, there are both short- and long-term reforms working hand in hand.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Streeting</strong> has posted a link to the online consultation page on social media.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/wesstreeting/status/1848247675763732681">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our NHS is broken, but not beaten.<br><br>We want your help to fix it.<br><br>Today the Prime Minister and I are launching the biggest consultation in NHS history!<br><br>Calling all patients, staff and partners - share your views and experiences for our 10 Year Plan 👇🏻<a href="https://t.co/KO12G6CK4d">https://t.co/KO12G6CK4d</a> <a href="https://t.co/YhB7XaXHLm">pic.twitter.com/YhB7XaXHLm</a></p>&mdash; Wes Streeting MP (@wesstreeting) <a href="https://twitter.com/wesstreeting/status/1848247675763732681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>Governments launch consultations for various reasons. Clearly, when ministers are making big changes to large, important institutions, it makes sense to find out first what the public think, and occasionally these exercise throw up ideas overlooked by the thinktank, policy-making world. But that is not the only, or even the main, function of these initiatives like this. Ensuring people <em>feel</em> consulted can be just as important as finding out what they think.</p> <p>More importantly, this is also about pitch-rolling – persuading people that an issue matters, and that change is needed. The public don’t need to be told that the NHS needs rescuing; it is regularly at or near the top of problems that people say matter to them most, according to polling. But we are less than two weeks away from a budget that is set to raise the tax burden by a record amount in cash terms (not necessarily as a proportion of GDP) and it is very, very important for the government to convince people that this is happening for reason (like fixing the broken NHS) and not just out of profligacy. Gordon Brown was the master of this; when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/apr/23/polls.conservatives">put up national insurance to raise money for the NHS</a>, it turned out to be one of the most popular tax rises ever. Today’s NHS consultation is probably more about budget framing than about a scramble for ideas to pad out next year’s 10-year plan.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> Keir Starmer and Wes Streeting, the health secretary, are visiting a health centre in London to launch their public consultation on the NHS’s future.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p><em>2.20pm:</em> Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> <p><em>After 3.30pm:</em> Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister and housing secretary, opens the Commons debate on the second reading of the employment rights bill.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line (BTL) or message me on social media. I can’t read all the messages BTL, but if you put “Andrew” in a message aimed at me, I am more likely to see it because I search for posts containing that word.</p> <p>If you want to flag something up urgently, it is best to use social media. I’m still using X and I’ll see something addressed to @AndrewSparrow very quickly. I’m also trying Bluesky (@andrewsparrowgdn) and Threads (@andrewsparrowtheguardian).</p> <p>I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos (no error is too small to correct).
