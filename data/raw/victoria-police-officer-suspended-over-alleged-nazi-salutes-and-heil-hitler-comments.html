<p>The Victoria police chief commissioner has apologised to the Jewish community after a veteran sergeant allegedly performed a Nazi salute to colleagues at the police academy twice this week.</p> <p>The 65-year-old woman was suspended with pay on Friday evening while police launched a criminal investigation into the alleged incidents, which included her allegedly saying “Heil Hitler” on both occasions, Shane Patton said.</p> <p>The woman has been in the police force for 40 years and was recently posted in the people development command training centre, Patton said.</p> <p>On Tuesday the sergeant allegedly approached two employees, performed the Nazi salute and said “Heil Hitler”, Patton said.</p> <p>The sergeant allegedly again used the salute and phrase on Wednesday while at a debrief with a recruit squad and an instructor.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>The sergeant was interviewed on Saturday by professional standards command detectives. She was released without charge at this stage, police said in a statement. The investigation is ongoing.</p> <p>A brief of evidence will be prepared, with the woman expected to be charged on summons, police said.</p> <p>If charged, the sergeant faces a potential 12-month imprisonment or $23,000 fine. Patton said members found guilty of similar conduct face “a very strong chance of being dismissed”.</p> <p>The people development command, where the suspended sergeant worked, “develops the skills, capability, and confidence of Victoria police members by providing training to sworn members from recruits through to executive leaders”, according to a 2022 report from the Office of the Victorian Information Commissioner.</p> <p>Patton said he was appalled by the alleged incidents. He said, to his knowledge, the woman had “no history of extreme views”.</p> <p>“It’s abhorrent conduct and it doesn’t matter who commits it – we will investigate it and we will investigate it thoroughly.”</p> <p>He acknowledged the alleged incidents occurred at “a time of profound sadness”.</p> <p>“This occurs in a week where we saw people around the world coming together in solidarity to support the Jewish community, the Jewish people, when we’re one year after the worst loss of life they have had since the Holocaust,” Patton said.</p> <p>“This will only exacerbate that grief and pain they’re feeling. There’s simply no place for this type of conduct in our society, let alone in this police force.</p> <p>“For that reason, I want to profoundly apologise to the Jewish community, but also the community as a whole. They will undoubtedly be feeling let down that this conduct has occurred by a police officer.”</p> <p>Patton said “there is no suggestion” the alleged incidents related to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2024/oct/07/marking-a-year-since-7-october-attacks-in-pictures">7 October anniversary</a>.</p> <p>The Executive Council of Australian Jewry could not be reached on Saturday due to it being Yom Kippur.</p>
