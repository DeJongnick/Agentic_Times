<p>Coco Khan’s article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/22/its-great-to-see-pregnant-women-in-the-public-eye-but-must-they-all-be-so-gorgeous">Opinion, 22 October</a>) reminded me of a visit to my GP 30 years ago, after the birth of my son. While waiting to go in, I’d been perusing the usual array of magazines featuring celebrities, several of whom had recently given birth and had seemingly bounced back into shape overnight. When I saw the doctor, a wonderful gentleman edging towards retirement, and quizzed him on how on earth this was possible, his response was quite simple: “Corsetry, my dear.”<br><strong>Sarah Postins</strong><br><em>Catworth, Cambridgeshire</em></p> <p>• I have a question for Rachel Reeves in response to her column (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/28/rachel-reeves-autumn-budget-labour-forecasts-britain"> 28 October</a>). Can&nbsp;she tell us the income threshold at which someone goes from being in the “working people” category to being in the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/oct/16/rachel-reeves-says-those-broadest-shoulders-should-pay-fair-share-tax">broadest shoulders</a>” category? Then everyone will be crystal clear about what is coming for them in November’s budget.<br><strong>Chris Hudson</strong><br><em>Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire</em></p> <p>• I have been wondering how many fewer seats Labour would have won at the last election if it had said that, because of Brexit and austerity, it would be necessary to raise income tax by a penny or two in order to rebuild our country. I suspect the answer is approximately zero.<br><strong>Michael Woodgate </strong><br><em>Bristol</em> </p> <p>• Like Marina Hyde (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/oct/28/sarah-pochin-reform-mp-free-speech-advert">Opinion, 28 October</a>), I am unoffended by the skin colour of people in sofa adverts. What bothers me is that every advert has to have a dog in it. I cannot be the only person to have&nbsp;noticed this. The place for a dog is never on the sofa.<br><strong>Melanie White</strong><br><em>Reading, Berkshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
