<p>Late-night hosts talk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a>’s act of clemency and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> becoming Time’s Person of the Year.</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seth-meyers">Seth Meyers</a> could only laugh on Thursday evening at the image of Trump, just <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/12/trump-time-magazine-person-of-the-year">named</a> Time magazine’s Person of the Year, ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8k3SC5E2fI"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/X8k3SC5E2fI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The incoming president looked delighted – or, as the Late Night host put it, “like a Make-A-Wish kid who faked being sick until he got what he wanted”.</p> <p>“Before he was elected he toured the country telling grandpas in folding chairs he was just like them,” he added, “and as soon as he wins he’s on a fucking marble balcony on Wall Street rocking a bell like he just ate a 72-ounce steak in under an hour.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/dec/12/late-night-hosts-healthcare-ceo-shooting-suspect">Kimmel on suspect in CEO shooting: ‘America’s most unseemly new sex symbol’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for the cover, Meyers had concerns. “My only issue is this glamour shot of Trump in a pose I’ve literally never seen him take before,” he said. “I’ve only ever seen him screaming or hunched over, so apologies if I’m not buying Donnie Contemplation over here.”</p> <p>Moreover, “this guy has pretended for over a decade to be a populist champion of the working class and now he’s on literal Wall Street, getting pats on the back from the richest people in the country,” he said. “The only way that Trump’s hypocrisy could be any more on the nose is if he started doing campaign events with actual fat cats.”</p> <p>Case in point: though Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign to lower grocery prices, he told Time that “it’s hard to bring things down once they’re up … You know, it’s very hard.”</p> <p>“Fuck me, I can’t believe we really have to spend the next four years watching this idiot relearn how hard it is to be president,” said Meyers. “Yeah man, we know it’s hard. Everyone knows.”</p> <p>“Trump’s fake populism was a con and it couldn’t be any clearer,” he added. “The second that he won he started rubbing elbows with his rich Wall Street buddies and admitting that his promises were all BS.”</p> <h2><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkJYw1ZdzfA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkJYw1ZdzfA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>In Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/jimmy-kimmel">Jimmy Kimmel</a> also lamented Trump’s Time magazine cover. “Sadly there’s no one left to roll it up and spank him with it,” he quipped. “Maybe Elon will do it for him? I don’t know.”</p> <p>According to Time, the Person of the Year distinction is bestowed on the person, group or concept that had the biggest impact for good or for ill. “Well, that’s him all right,” said Kimmel. “It was a no-brainer in every sense of the word.”</p> <p>As for Trump’s appearance at the New York Stock Exchange, “he jammed his little finger on that bell like it was the Diet Coke button in the Oval Office,” Kimmel joked.</p> <p>Kimmel also touched on Joe Biden’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/12/biden-grants-largest-single-day-clemency-in-us-history-with-1500-sentences-commuted">last-minute act of clemency</a>, commuting more than 1,500 criminal sentences. “Before this, the biggest act of clemency was on election night on November 5,” said Kimmel.</p> <p>“Joe Biden is handing out pardons like they’re Werther’s Originals,” he added. “He has no more malarkey to give right now.”</p> <h2><strong>Stephen Colbert</strong></h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBtqwvSj-sk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EBtqwvSj-sk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>And on The Late Show, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> also noted Biden’s clemency, in which he also pardoned 39 people. “Wow, I did not know he had 39 sons,” the host joked.</p> <p>The mass commutation is a tradition for all outgoing presidents, but Biden committed the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. “I believe that is an empathetic and generous act of forgiveness and hope – that will be knocked out of the headlines as soon as Trump threatens to bomb Manila because he cut himself on one of their envelopes,” said Colbert. “That’s coming. You know that’s coming.”</p> <p>Colbert also laughed at Pornhub’s year in review, which revealed generational trends, such as the fact that 18-to-24-year-olds spend, on average, 76 fewer seconds than any other age group on videos. “I guess young folks today don’t have the attention span,” Colbert quipped. “Back in the 90s, if you wanted to see boobs on your computer, you had to listen to this,” he added before a dial-up tone.</p> <p>The site also provided a map highlighting the most distinct searches in each state, such as Tennessee’s “chubby milf”, Delaware’s “mature” (“I assume in honor of Joe Biden,” Colbert joked), Maryland’s “girlfriend” (“dorks!”) and Pennsylvania’s “naked women”. “That’s clearly Amish teens on rumspringa getting their first crack at a computer,” Colbert noted.</p>
