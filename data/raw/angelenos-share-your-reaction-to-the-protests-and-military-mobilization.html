<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> is reeling after a series of immigration raids led to widespread protests over the weekend and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> took the extraordinary step of ordering thousands of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-military">US military</a> troops to descend on the city, a move that California leaders have decried as “inflammatory”.</p> <p>Raids on Friday in areas of the city with large Latino populations led to mainly peaceful demonstrations, but the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/los-angeles-protests-visual-guide">protests </a>turned violent when federal immigration authorities used flashbang grenades and teargas against demonstrators. Over the weekend, fiery and chaotic scenes played out in downtown LA, Compton and Paramount, with dozens of people arrested. </p> <p> Trump has been accused of intentionally fanning the flames with his decision on Monday to send in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/los-angeles-protests">700 marines and another 2,000 national guard troops</a> to LA, adding to 2,000 already sent to the city on Saturday. While Trump has said the deployment was essential for maintaining order, the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2025/jun/09/los-angeles-mayor-karen-bass-ice-raids-test-case-experiment">accused the administration</a> of using the city as an “experiment”, while Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, called the decision to send in troops without his permission “purposefully inflammatory”.</p> <p>We would like to hear from people living in LA about the latest events in the city. How do you feel about the immigration raids? What is your reaction to the national guard and marines being deployed?</p> <h2><strong>Share your views and experience</strong></h2> <p>You can send us your thoughts on recent events in LA using this form.</p> <p>Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.
