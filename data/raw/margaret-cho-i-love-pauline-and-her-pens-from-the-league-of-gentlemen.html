<h2><strong>The funniest standup I’ve ever seen</strong></h2> <p>It was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoW415APMzY">Paul Foot</a>’s private show for specially selected audience members at a small pub in London. The show began with Paul seating the audience, then making jokes about each of them. It was incredible.</p> <h2><strong>The funniest sketch I’ve ever seen</strong></h2> <p>I love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9C96py8kyI">Pauline and her pens from The League of Gentlemen</a>. I want to attend Job Seekers with “Mickey love”.</p> <h2><strong>The funniest book I’ve ever read</strong></h2> <p>Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Not just the funniest but the most profound and insane book I’ve ever read. The constant return to the footnotes and the way you read the book forwards then backwards is thrilling and totally crazy.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/nov/29/margaret-cho-review-comedy-box-bristol">Margaret Cho review – queen of lurid bad taste roars back from rehab</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>The funniest film I’ve ever seen</strong></h2> <p>Withnail and I, although I’ve never played the drinking game and I don’t think I ever will now. I can’t see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5EmCKbWS6c">drinking butane lighter fluid</a> in my future but it does look appealing.</p> <h2><strong>The funniest person I know</strong></h2> <p>My mother, who in her 80th year never ceases to amaze and destroy me. She’s a real character and will be making numerous appearances in my show.</p> <h2><strong>The funniest heckle I’ve ever had</strong></h2> <p>A woman would not stop saying “Trump” over and over. It was weird but also funny; we turned it into kind of a sample, like she was singing the hook in a rap song.</p> <h2><strong>The funniest meal I’ve ever eaten</strong></h2> <p>Painkillers out of my own vomit. Maybe not the most appetising meal but it went down well at the time.</p> <h2><strong>The funniest dream I’ve ever had</strong></h2> <p>I can never remember my dreams but I think it was because I smoked a lot of pot. Even now that I’ve quit I still can’t remember them. Maybe I’m a sociopath and don’t dream.</p> <h2><strong>The funniest number</strong></h2> <p>Why was six scared of seven? Because seven ate nine. It’s all these numbers. Funny. So funny.</p> <p><a href="http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/Margaret-Cho-tickets/artist/784761"><em>Margaret Cho plays Edinburgh, 25 November; Bristol, 28 November; Birmingham, 29 November; Salford, 30 November; Sheffield, 1 December; touring to 10 December</em></a></p>
