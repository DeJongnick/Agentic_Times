<p>With Australia’s love of an annual beach holiday comes a revolving door of new “must have” gear: sunshades, blow-up toys, fold-out chairs and endless gadgets to keep us entertained.</p> <p>But how much of it do we really need, and what are the simplest ways to reduce your environmental footprint in the sand?</p> <h2>Invest in a beach shade that lasts</h2> <p>With a new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/jan/12/beach-maximalism-a-frenzy-for-cabanas-and-carts-is-taking-over-australian-shores">type of beach canopy</a> hitting the market every year, it’s worth ignoring the trends and investing in something that will really last. Consider a well-made shade that suits your family’s needs; one that can be repurposed for other occasions such as camping or shading the back yard.</p> <p>Inflatables, beach chairs and swim toys are other hot-ticket items that consumers rush for each year. But it’s worth checking your beach town’s local op shops for items left behind by fellow travellers before splurging on new items that may not be recyclable. </p> <p>Op shops or online marketplaces can also be a good place to find a quality cooler or Esky – another must-have beach item, especially for families and large groups. Try to source ones that are durable, recyclable and long-lasting. If you’re really leaning into eating en plein air, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/26/best-picnic-kit-sustainable-stylish">try picnicking</a> sustainably. Wrap food in silicone wraps instead of Gladwrap, bring keep cups where possible.</p> <h2>Avoid plastic toys and inflatables</h2> <p>Children can entertain themselves for hours making sand sculptures, but small plastic toys can get lost in the moats and turrets of their castles, or drift away to sea. Small beach toys and moulds in particular should be stowed safely to reduce the risk of marine life swallowing them, so keep them in a bag.</p>    <p>Plastic toys are also subject to a lot of use and hot sun. Good quality silicone toys are more durable, and while they are not biodegradable, they are easier to recycle and don’t break down into small, harmful microplastics.</p> <p>Once you’re done with any type of inflatable – like floaties and beach balls with substantial wear and tear – send them to a recycling program where possible. Better yet, donate them to <a href="https://ploys.com.au/pages/donations-pool-inflatables-for-recycling">Ploys</a>, which makes bags, earrings and cushion covers out of old inflatables.</p> <h2>Be a responsible pet owner</h2> <p>We want the whole family with us on holiday, but it’s also important to make sure your pets don’t contribute negatively to the environment when visiting the sea.</p> <p>Areas where there are nesting birds are most commonly restricted, but make sure you scout out the dog-friendly beaches in your area and only let them off-leash where allowed.</p> <p>While owners must pick up after their pet, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/15/poodunnit-dear-fellow-dog-owners-why-do-so-many-of-you-bother-to-bag-pet-mess-then-not-bin-it">some don’t</a>. But dog poo is toxic to marine life, introducing bacteria into the ecosystem, and can take up to a year to break down.</p> <h2>Keep waste out of waterways</h2> <p>The tried-and-tested motto “take out what you bring in” is the simplest way to keep the sea safe.</p> <p>Beaches and parklands surrounding water are in close proximity to many of our waterways. With that comes an increased risk that all your plastic trappings will end up in the sea, and as a threat to marine life.</p> <p>In 2021, UNSW research found that plastic is <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2021/10/life-s-a-beach--finding-trends-in-marine-debris-across-australia">84% of all rubbish found across Australian beaches</a>, with people not taking enough responsibility for their litter.</p> <p>If you can, try not to take any plastic bags or disposable cutlery, two of the most <a href="https://www.marineconservation.org.au/10-of-the-most-dangerous-plastic-products-polluting-our-oceans/">dangerous plastics for wildlife</a>. Plastic straws should also be avoided. Instead, use Tupperware containers, reusable stainless steel cutlery and plates that won’t blow away in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/02/southerly-buster-what-to-know-about-the-wind-that-can-suddenly-drop-temperatures-by-20c">any southerly busters</a>. Most importantly, keep your rubbish and foodstuff with you, and take it home.</p> <h2>Think about giving back to your beach town</h2> <p>With many towns and council areas adopting sustainability targets and initiatives to better the environment, communities often host beach clean-ups or fun initiatives the kids can partake in.</p> <p>Toy libraries across Australia are growing – find one at Stanny beach in the <a href="https://regionillawarra.com.au/the-little-something-that-stanwell-park-beachgoers-are-loving/23724">Illawarra</a>, or in Henley Beach in South Australia.</p> <p>In Sydney, you can join the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seabees.aus/">Seabees</a>, a community of divers cleaning up the ocean, or for family day before a swim, help out at the <a href="https://www.northernbeaches.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/whats-on/cove-collective-cleanup">weekly beach clean up at Manly Cove</a> on Saturday mornings.</p> <p>Or simply go “<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-12/plogging-run-club-cleans-up-byron-bay/9746380">plogging</a>,” – Swedish for “to jog” and “to pick up” – on your next beach outing to clean up the shore.</p>
