<p><strong>Hi Marlon, the Scary Movie franchise is incredibly successful, building on the likes of </strong><strong>Airplane!</strong><strong> Were you always a fan of </strong><strong>Jim Abrahams</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>David and Jerry Zucker</strong><strong>? </strong><em>Sagarmatha1953<br></em>My brother Keenen took me [and other brothers] Shawn and Craig to see Airplane! when we were kids. It was an influence on my life, as was Blazing Saddles. We’re big fans of Mel Brooks. The Zucker brothers are legends – they were pioneers in the parody game. I was definitely influenced by Airplane! but I think our humour was different. We didn’t change the wheel, but we put a rim on the tyre. We have a different way of telling jokes, from how we were raised and our life experience. When it comes to parody, there are formulas you can apply. There’s a difference in how we present the jokes and what the jokes are about. <br><br><strong>What scares you? </strong><em>TurangaLeela2<br></em>Death. I like life. Have you ever seen somebody in a coffin? It doesn’t look like they’re having fun. I don’t wanna be that. If I could die in the same manner of any of the Scary Movie characters, I’d choose having an orgasm. Go out like you came in.<br><br><strong>Your new film </strong><strong>Him is about an American football player wanting to become the </strong><strong>G</strong><strong>oat</strong><strong>. Is there anything that you’re the G</strong><strong>oat at? </strong><em>ShakiraOhYeah</em></p>    <p>Just trying to be the best artist I can be. Just be different. Just be Marlon. We’re a bunch of snowflakes, but each is different. You don’t find two alike. It’s the same for artists. We’re made through our experiences<strong>,</strong> our trials and tribulations. I’ve been blessed to learn how to write, produce, act, direct, do standup. I want to be like Prince, but with comedy, and one foot taller.<br><br><strong>How was it working with </strong><strong>Eddie Murphy</strong><strong> on </strong><strong>Norbit</strong><strong>? Was he an inspiration for playing </strong><strong>multiple</strong><strong> roles in one film? </strong><em>stephenw1979<br></em>Richard Pryor in [1977 film] Which Way Is Up? was an inspiration, as was Eddie in The Nutty Professor. When I did Sextuplets, we tried to do it differently. I was in the same frame, acting with myself, and the camera was moving. Working with Eddie was a dream. He’s always been one of my idols. To do Norbit and make him laugh like I did, I’ll never forget that moment. That was the first time I thought: I could be somebody in this industry.</p> <p><strong>My </strong><strong>11-year-old</strong><strong> daughter adores </strong><strong>White Chicks.</strong><strong> She asks: “What was it like filming with </strong><strong>Terry Crews</strong><strong> [US actor/TV host]?” Are you ever going to make a sequel? </strong><em>GretaO and Pazuzuspetals</em></p>    <p>We’re circling, but not yet. I don’t want to announce it until it actually happens and get people’s hopes up, because they get very violent about White Chicks. I think Terry Crews had a crush on me as the white chick in White Chicks. Every time I was in makeup, he was like: “Hey!” I was like: “Hey man. It’s me, bro. It’s me.”</p> <p><strong>What was it like filming with </strong><strong>Tupac in 1994’s Above the Rim</strong><strong>? </strong><em>duncanmp</em><em><br></em>Tupac was a very hard worker. His work ethic is something that I’ll always remember. We’d shoot Above the Rim 12 hours a day, then he’d go home and work all night, then the next day he’d come to set and play us five songs. We were like: “When did you do that?” He said: “Last night.” When he passed, those songs came out, like Out on Bail and Thug 4 Life, Runnin’ from tha Police … I got a preview of those songs, back in the 90s.<br></p>    <p><strong>Who’s your </strong><strong>favourite</strong><strong> British rapper? </strong><em>ShakiraOhYeah<br></em>That’s a tough question. Skepta. What do I think of British rap? Never mind British rap. I’m a New York guy. New Yorkers don’t even like LA rappers, let alone what’s going on across the pond. We hate everything …<br><br><strong>How funny was it growing up in the </strong><strong>Wayans</strong><strong> household? Have you ever thought of making a movie with all of the actors in your family? </strong><em>ClassicMacGruber and Sp3lCh3k<br></em>We thought about it, but it’s kind of hard to get the band back together. Look how long it took [US R&amp;B group] New Edition to do a reunion tour. It’s very hard to get five<strong> </strong>or six black people to stay in harmony. </p> <p><strong>You give a heartbreaking performance in </strong><strong>Requiem for a Dream.</strong><strong> What are your memories? </strong><em>Absohudson<br></em>I remember walking into the set after Ellen Burstyn and the set felt hot, like somebody had just destroyed it. Darren [Aronofsky, director] was like: “Burstyn was a force of nature. You kids got work to do.” I was like: “OK, let’s lock in.”</p> <p>It’s hard for Hollywood to put its finger on me. They go: “Who is he? This guy does everything.” I want to be believable to the audience in comedy, drama, slapstick, parody. I think dramatic actors can be just as funny as comedy actors, but I don’t know if they can do an hour and a half of standup. <em>That’s</em> the part that’s frightening. A movie’s easy. It’s just acting.</p>    <p> Standup is like jumping out of a plane with no parachute. I do it every weekend. It’s the scariest thing you’ll ever do. You’re being judged, every joke. You don’t know if you’re gonna make people walk out. You don’t know if you’re gonna make people boo. You don’t know if you’re gonna make people laugh. </p> <p>Sometimes<strong>,</strong> your worst set turns out to be one of your best, because you did something different, you changed something up, you told some truth. Sometimes, I go on stage and I don’t wanna be funny. I just wanna tell the truth and see if that truth is funny before I find the funny in it.</p> <p>• Him is in UK and Irish<strong> </strong>cinemas now</p>
