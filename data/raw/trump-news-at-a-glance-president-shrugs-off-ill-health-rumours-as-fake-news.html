Asked about rumours on social media that he may have died, he called them “fake news”.</p> <p>The president complained that he had done several news conferences last week “then I didn’t do any for two days and they said ‘there must be something wrong with him’.”</p> <p>“It’s so fake. ‘Is he OK, how’s he feeling, what’s wrong?’”</p> <p>Speculation about his health swirled on X over the weekend, with posts citing his lack of a public schedule late last week and a JD Vance interview in which the vice-president told USA Today he was confident the president was “in good shape” but suggested he was prepared to step in if anything happened to Trump.</p> <p>Here’s the day’s Trump administration news at a glance.</p>  <h2>Trump illegally deployed national guard to LA, court rules</h2>  <p>A judge has found the Trump administration’s use of national guard troops during southern California immigration enforcement protests was illegal.</p> <p>Judge Charles Breyer ruled on Tuesday that the administration violated federal law by sending troops to accompany federal agents on immigration raids.
