<p>The UK, even today, is not well blessed with festivals devoted to new music. But when the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/huddersfield-contemporary-music-festival">Huddersfield contemporary music festival</a> began, in 1978, the situation was much worse, with no annual showcase here for what living composers were producing. That such an event took root in an unprepossessing West Yorkshire industrial town in the late 70s was remarkable in itself, especially when most of the activity in new music then was centred on London.</p> <p>What began on a modest scale under the aegis of Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) – where the festival’s tireless founding director, <a href="https://research.hud.ac.uk/institutes-centres/cerenem/emeritusprofrichardsteinitz/">Richard Steinitz</a>, was a lecturer in music – grew quickly into one of the most important dates in the British musical calendar. The HCMF really hit its stride in the early 80s, hosting a series of important premieres alongside residencies from many of the senior figures of postwar music, from Olivier Messiaen and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/jan/28/terry-riley-contemporary-music-guide">Terry Riley</a> to Hans Werner Henze and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/06/elliott-carter-remembered">Elliott Carter</a>. Gradually expanding its ambition and range, Steinitz’s programming was never narrowly doctrinal; from the early days, he tried to reflect the spectrum of what was going on across Europe and the US.</p>    <p>Steinitz stood down as director after the 2000 festival. The current director, <a href="https://research.hud.ac.uk/institutes-centres/cerenem/grahammckenzie/">Graham McKenzie</a>, has been there for more than a decade, not only steering the programming towards new generations of composers from across Europe, but also broadening the stylistic scope, including events that touch on jazz, electronica and rock.<br></p> <p>With these changes, so the atmosphere of the festival has altered. This is partly because the generation of postwar composers whose appearances made the early festivals so memorable has all but gone, but also because, in those days, festival audiences had a sense of a shared purpose. Performers and visitors tended to stay in the same hotel, where you might have been confronted with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/may/07/contemporary-music-guide-karlheinz-stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a> and his retinue at breakfast or have found yourself sharing a table for a postconcert Indian meal with<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/apr/23/contemporary-music-guide-xenakis"> Iannis Xenakis</a>. Now, things seem more diffuse. New music has split into so many strands in the past 20 years that perhaps this was inevitable.<br></p> <p>However, the opening weekend of this year’s 40th festival demonstrated the way in which Huddersfield has continued to sustain its longstanding associations, while also spotlighting less familiar names. There were major premieres from two of the senior figures in British music today, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2013/feb/04/contemporary-music-guide-james-dillon">James Dillon</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2012/sep/10/contemporary-music-guide-brian-ferneyhough">Brian Ferneyhough</a>, as well as concerts devoted to the works of the US-born, Toronto-based <a href="http://www.catlinsmith.com/">Linda Catlin Smith</a>. <br></p>    <p>Dillon’s connection with Huddersfield goes back to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/may/10/classicalmusicandopera2">the first festival, when he was awarded the young composer’s prize</a>. A number of his pieces have received their first performances here since, often when his music was otherwise ignored in Britain. The latest, commissioned to open this year’s festival, is his second work for the <a href="http://www.rednoteensemble.com/">Red Note Ensemble</a>, the group that also introduced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/18/red-note-arditti-huddersfield-festival-review">his New York Triptych there four years ago</a>. </p> <p>A 45-minute piece in three movements, Tanz/haus: triptych 2017 came with a cryptic programme note from Dillon himself – just a quotation from Heinrich von Kleist and the etymology of the title. The music, though, was compelling, with electric guitar and accordion adding a distinctive edge to the sound of the nine-piece ensemble. As so often with Dillon, there seems to be an oblique dialogue with the past, with the ghosts of other music flickering around the new work. There are the decaying remains of a funeral march in the first movement, for instance, while the textures and the harmonies create a world that seems constantly to be on the edge of imploding or crumbling away.</p>    <p>Ferneyhough’s Umbrations, brought to Huddersfield by <a href="https://www.ensemble-modern.com/en">Ensemble Modern</a> and the <a href="http://www.ardittiquartet.co.uk/">Arditti Quartet</a>, is a collection of 11 pieces compiled over the past decade, all based on the viol-consort music of the English renaissance composer <a draggable="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Tye">Christopher Tye</a>. There is nothing remotely anecdotal about Ferneyhough’s writing. What he calls an “almost open-ended collection of encounters” interleaves string-quartet movements with ensemble pieces that are typically highly wrought, yet always pungently vivid.<br tabindex="-1"></p> <p>Alongside those scores, Catlin Smith’s music seemed joyously straightforward. Eve Egoyan played two of her piano pieces – The Underfolding, an exploration of dense, dark harmonies, and Nocturnes and Chorales, a sequence of spare miniatures of lonely melodies and lingering harmonic sequences. Quatuor Bozzini played two string quartets, Gondola and Folkestone, which confirmed Catlin Smith’s fondness for constructing large-scale form from musical vignettes, just as her Piano Quintet (in which Philip Thomas joined the Bozzinis) showed how refined her tonal and harmonic palette is. The biggest compliment one can pay any composer in today’s crowded musical world is to say that their music has a distinctive voice. Catlin Smith’s undoubtedly has that.<br tabindex="-1"></p> <p>• Dillon’s Tanz/haus: triptych 2017 performance is available on <a draggable="true" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09g0m2q">BBC iPlayer</a> until 18 December. Ferneyhough’s Umbrations will be broadcast on Radio 3’s Hear and Now on 2 December. <a draggable="true" href="https://hcmf.co.uk/">The Huddersfield contemporary music festival continues until 26 November</a>.</p>
