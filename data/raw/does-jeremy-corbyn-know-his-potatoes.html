<p>“Is this government going to put the nail in the coffin of the joy of digging ground for potatoes on a cold, wet February Sunday afternoon?” Jeremy Corbyn wrote in the Daily Telegraph (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/05/jeremy-corbyn-council-asset-sales-allotments">Jeremy Corbyn warns rules on council asset sales threaten allotments, 5 August</a>). Never trust a man who can’t tell his parsnips from his potatoes: leaving spuds in the ground till February means they’ll have been spoiled by frost or rot [see footnote]. And I say this as a lifelong Labour voter.<br><strong>Dariel Francis</strong><br><em>Tunbridge Wells, Kent</em></p> <p><em>* See footnote</em></p> <p>• A key point not covered in your article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/youtube-tv-destination-children-ofcom-survey">YouTube most popular first TV destination for children, Ofcom finds, 30 July</a>)<strong> </strong>is the extent to which schools, particularly primaries, use YouTube, from movement breaks to educational programmes and quiet-time cartoons before home time.<br><strong>Cat Mehta</strong> <br><em>Weybridge, Surrey</em></p> <p>• While I enjoyed his review of Millet at the National Gallery (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/aug/05/millet-life-on-the-land-review-national-gallery-london">5 August</a>), I do wonder about Jonathan Jones’s inner life. Maybe the potato fork isn’t a phallic symbol. And the sawyers “look as if&nbsp;they are cutting up a giant penis”. Couldn’t it be just a tree trunk?<br><strong>Dave Verguson</strong><br><em>Huddersfield, West Yorkshire</em></p> <p>• Surely one should be surprised if a long-established British university did <em>not</em> have a history of involvement in what are now seen as highly questionable and morally unsustainable theories, such as “racist science” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/04/the-history-of-racist-science-in-british-universities">Letters, 4 August</a>).<br><strong>Harvey Sanders</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p>• How apposite your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/05/wasteland-rubble-dust-graves-how-gaza-looks-from-the-sky">front-page image</a> in the print edition was on Hiroshima Day (From above, Gaza is like the aftermath of an apocalypse, 6&nbsp;August).<br><strong>John Pelling</strong><br><em>Coddenham, Suffolk</em></p> <p>• This footnote was added on 11 August 2025. When Jeremy Corbyn wrote “digging ground for potatoes” in February, he meant “manuring and preparing the ground, before planting the potatoes in March or April”, as he said in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/aug/08/yes-i-know-my-potatoes-dariel">a letter in response to this Dariel Francis’s</a>.</p>
