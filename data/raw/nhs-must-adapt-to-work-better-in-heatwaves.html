<p>Higher temperatures are becoming more frequent with climate change, and our patients are paying the price (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jul/14/profound-concern-as-scientists-say-extreme-heat-now-the-norm-in-uk">‘Profound concern’ as scientists say extreme heat ‘now the norm’ in UK, 14 July</a>). Increasingly, physicians are seeing more patients whose health is affected by extreme heat. During heat periods in the summer of 2022, there were 3,271 excess deaths in England and Wales, and last month’s heatwave alone will cost hundreds of lives.</p> <p>Demand for healthcare will rise as a result of extreme temperatures. It is not only people’s health at risk, but our ability to care for patients too. About 90% of hospitals in England alone are at risk of overheating, making it harder to keep services running safely. We need to get serious about adapting the NHS to cope with changing conditions.</p> <p>The climate crisis is a health crisis. Preventing disruption in the NHS, by investing in building upgrades, workforce preparedness and adequate resilience planning, is no longer optional – it is essential, so the NHS can continue to provide healthcare when needed.<br><strong>Dr Mark Harber</strong><br><em>Special adviser on healthcare sustainability and climate change, Royal College of Physicians</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
