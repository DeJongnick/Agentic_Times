<p>Good morning.</p> 
<p>Vladimir Putin has agreed to face-to-face talks with Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss a peace deal in Ukraine, according to Donald Trump and European leaders, although Moscow has not confirmed the meeting.</p> 
<p>The potential breakthrough came after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-ukraine-putin">a day of tense diplomacy</a> at the White House in which Trump ruled out a ceasefire while Zelenskyy and his allies pushed for US-backed security guarantees as part of any long-term agreement. The Ukrainian president said that security guarantees for Kyiv would be “formalized” within 10 days.</p>

 <li><p><strong>What was the mood of the talks?</strong> Trump’s initial conversation with Zelenskyy went more smoothly than their first encounter in the Oval Office six months ago, when the Ukrainian leader was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-zelenskyy-meeting-transcript">berated</a> by Trump and vice-president JD Vance. This time, doubtless to the relief of European leaders, Zelenskyy gave Trump effusive thanks for the invitation and the pair shared good-humored banter.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>What was discussed?</strong> After meeting the leaders of Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Finland, the European Union and Nato, Trump wrote on Truth Social that there had been discussion of security guarantees and “which guarantees would be provided by the European countries”. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the talks did not include Kyiv surrendering territory to Russia.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Hamas says it accepts proposal for Gaza ceasefire and release of hostages</strong></h2> 
<p>Hamas officials say they have accepted a proposal for a Gaza ceasefire deal that would include the release of half of the approximately 20 remaining living Israeli hostages as part of a phased resolution to the war, as Gaza health officials said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/hamas-gaza-proposed-ceasefire-hostage-release-deal-israel">62,000 Palestinians had now been killed</a> in the 22 months of war.</p> 
<p>The proposed deal follows negotiations between Hamas and Egyptian and Qatari officials that have been taking place in Cairo in recent days, and comes after the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, was confronted on Sunday by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/18/netanyahu-criticises-protests-israel-handling-gaza-war-hostages">Israel’s biggest protests of the war</a>, which called for a deal to secure the release of the hostages.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What are the details of the potential ceasefire?</strong> The latest Gaza ceasefire proposal agreed by Hamas includes a suspension of military operations for 60 days and could be seen as a path to reaching a comprehensive deal to end the nearly two-year-long war, according to Egyptian sources. During the period of suspension, Palestinian prisoners would be exchanged in return for half of the Israeli hostages held in Gaza.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>What is the situation with evacuating sick Gazan children?</strong> An aid group that coordinates medical care in the United States for badly injured children from Gaza has said it is “distressed” by the US state department’s decision <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/gaza-medical-visas-children-laura-loomer-marco-rubio">to stop issuing visitor visas</a> for Palestinians after far-right influencer Laura Loomer complained directly to the secretary of state about their work.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Democrats return to Texas as California kicks off push to pass new electoral map</strong></h2> 
<p>Texas Democrats returned to their state on Monday as California lawmakers kicked off a rapid push for voters to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/texas-democrats-california-electoral-maps-redistricting">approve a new congressional map</a> that could add as many as five Democratic seats in the House of Representatives.</p> 
<p>The Texas Democrats’ return ends a two-week walkout that stalled the Republican effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts to satisfy Donald Trump’s demands to reshape the House map in his favor ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The California plan was drafted in response to Texas’s push to redraw the congressional map there.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What’s the context?</strong> The protest began on 3 August, when dozens of Texas Democrats left the state for Illinois and other blue states in a high-stakes bid to deny their Republican colleagues the quorum needed to approve the redrawn maps. Although the Democrats’ return allows Republicans to advance their redistricting plan, the quorum-breakers have declared their two-week walkout a strategic success that set off a “redistricting arms race”.</p></li>
