<p>Donald Trump escalated his personal insults against Kamala Harris at a Wednesday evening rally in Georgia as he faces growing scrutiny over reports of his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/harris-trump-fascist-hitler-comments-election">praise of Hitler</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein">alleged sexual misconduct</a>.</p> <p>“This woman is crazy,” the former president said at an event in the Atlanta suburb of Duluth, hosted by Turning Point USA, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/02/far-right-youth-group-turning-point-charlie-kirk">far-right youth group</a>. He said voters should stand up to the vice-president and tell her: “You’re the worst ever. There’s never been anybody like you. You can’t put two sentences together. The world is laughing at us because of you.” He also said that in her recent interview with CBS, she “gave an answer that was from a loony bin”, later adding: “She’s not a smart person. She’s a low IQ individual.”</p> <p>The rally, less than two weeks before election day, came after the Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein">published an interview with a former model</a> who accused Trump of groping her at Trump Tower in 1993 after the notorious sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein introduced them, an allegation the Trump campaign denied. Stacey Williams said it felt as if the unwanted touching was part of a “twisted game” between the two men and that it appeared Epstein and Trump were “really, really good friends and spent a lot of time together”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Don’t miss important US election coverage. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-guardian-live-world-news/id409128287?mt=8">Get our free app</a> and sign up for election alerts</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Williams’s account put the spotlight back on the roughly two dozen women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct throughout his career.

John Kelly, Trump’s former chief of staff and a retired Marine general, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html">told the New York Times</a> this week that he believed Trump met the definition of “fascist” and was “certainly an authoritarian”. He also said Trump repeatedly commented: “Hitler did some good things, too.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/harris-trump-fascist-hitler-comments-election">Kamala Harris denounces Trump as ‘fascist’ who wants ‘unchecked power’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a characteristically <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/06/donald-trump-speech-analysis">rambling speech</a>, Trump went on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/07/election-trump-speeches">meandering</a> tangents about Google (“Google is treating us much better.

Trump did not address Kelly at the rally, but on Truth Social called his former chief of staff a “LOWLIFE” and “total degenerate”.</p> <p>In a “faith-focused” town hall in Zebulon, Georgia, earlier on Wednesday, Trump praised Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/08/hungary-viktor-orban-donald-trump-victory-champagne">nationalist prime minister</a> who has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/25/waiting-for-trump-viktor-orban-hopes-us-election-will-change-his-political-fortunes">condemned</a> for undermining <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/05/eu-must-not-appease-viktor-orban-by-unfreezing-billions-earmarked-for-hungary">democratic institutions</a> and aligning with Moscow and Beijing.</p> <p>Asked about his faith, Trump responded: “When you believe in God, it’s a big advantage over people that don’t have that.” He went on to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/20/politics/fact-check-trump-al-capone-indicted-once/index.html">falsely</a> suggest he had endured more investigations than the notorious gangster Al Capone.</p>
