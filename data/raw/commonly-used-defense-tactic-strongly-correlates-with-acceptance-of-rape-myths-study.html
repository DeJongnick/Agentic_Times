<p>A new <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313642">study</a>, released amid controversy over allegations of sexual misconduct against several nominees for Donald Trump’s cabinet, reveals a positive correlation between people accused of wrongdoing who use <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/feb/01/trump-victim-political-strategy-manipulation">Darvo</a> (“deny, attack, reverse victim and offender”) defense tactics and sexual harassment perpetration and acceptance of rape myths.</p> <p>“These findings suggest Darvo isn’t just a response,” said Dr Sarah Harsey, assistant professor of psychology at the Oregon State University-Cascades and study lead author. “It reflects a broader perspective that condones victim-blaming and minimizes accountability.”</p> <p>Published on Wednesday in PLOS One, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0313642">study</a> involved surveys of one group of 602 university students and another group of 325 “community members” – “regular folk”, Harsey said, found through Mechanical Turk, Amazon’s crowdsourcing service.</p> <p>Among students, researchers “found a positive correlation between Darvo use and both sexual harassment perpetration and acceptance of rape myths”. The community group showed “very strong correlations”.</p> <p>Harsey’s co-authors were Alexis Adams-Clark, a University of Oregon doctoral student, and Jennifer Freyd, professor emerit of psychology at Oregon and founder of the nonprofit <a href="https://www.institutionalcourage.org/about-us">Center for Institutional Courage</a>.</p> <p>Freyd coined the term Darvo in the 1990s. She said the idea grew from watching “the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/16/david-brock-clarence-thomas-supreme-court-stench-book">hearings for Clarence Thomas</a> and the response to Anita Hill”, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/28/anita-hill-harris-op-ed">law professor</a> who in 1991 said the then supreme court nominee sexually harassed her, only to see her own reputation dragged through the mud.</p> <p>“Clarence Thomas had a leadership role” in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Freyd said. “So it seemed to me like if there’s anyone who would have had a different response to the accusation, it was him. He would have said something like, ‘My memory is very different than yours. I’m disturbed to hear this is how you experienced things. I know these are very difficult conversations to have, and I want to understand what leads you to say this.’ But instead he and the other people who enabled him, it was a gang that attacked Anita Hill … and then I was seeing it all over.”</p> <p>Introducing their study, Freyd and her co-authors write that they aimed “to extend research on the connections between Darvo and sexual violence. We examined whether people who use Darvo as a means of responding to confrontations involving a range of wrongdoings also engage in behaviors and ascribe to beliefs that contribute to sexual violence.</p> <p>“Findings offer further confirmation of a link between Darvo and sexual violence and suggest this defensive response is part of a larger worldview that justifies participation in sexual violence and blames victims,” they added.</p> <p>The study is published amid new Washington scandal about sexual misconduct, not just regarding the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/25/trump-sexual-misconduct-allegations-timeline">blizzard of allegations</a> against Donald Trump himself but also over accusations against Trump’s first pick for attorney general, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/matt-gaetz-withdraws-ag-nomination">Matt Gaetz</a>; his pick for secretary of health, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/21/rfk-jr-assault-accuser">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>; and Pete Hegseth, the nominee for secretary of defense who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/02/pete-hegseth-non-profit-allegations">accused</a> of sexual assault in 2017.</p> <p>On Sunday, the New Yorker <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/pete-hegseths-secret-history">reported</a> a lawyer’s use of Darvo: insisting Hegseth “was completely innocent” and that his accuser “was the aggressor”, had “tried to blackmail him”, and “had previously brought a false rape charge against someone else, thus undermining her credibility”. The lawyer also <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/25/us-news/pete-hegseth-demands-da-hand-over-prosecution-memo-on-rape-claim-cites-tip-about-more-exonerating-details/">demanded</a> the release of investigative records on Hegseth’s accuser. The New Yorker said it asked authorities for such records, but none existed.</p> <p>Harsey said: “It is easy to find examples of Darvo in the context of sexual misconduct in the news nowadays. We started this project after the first Trump presidency, and now we are about to be faced with a second one. And so I think it’s relevance is pretty noticeable right now.</p> <p>“I hope that after reading the report, people will have words to put to things they already noticed. By naming Darvo, by knowing its associations with things like rape myth acceptance and sexual harassment perpetration … it sort of empowers people to take a step back and think, ‘Wait, this is Darvo. This is something research has looked at.’</p> <p>“Maybe we don’t have to take what [those using Darvo are] saying so seriously, because we know that this is a common tactic. We know that it’s connected to these other sort of undesirable constructs. Maybe we don’t have to believe and endorse these statements when we see Darvo out in the wild.’”</p>
