He also said Maroš Šefčovič, the European Commission vice president who drew up the plans, had to get them agreed in the face of internal EU opposition. Martin said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Maroš Šefčovič has really consulted with people all around. His engagement with the Irish government to get a sense of things, he went north and spoke to people on the ground in Northern Ireland and business and industry, and politically met with all the parties.</p> <p>He has managed to bring through the commission, which is not an easy task in itself because there would be countervailing forces there in terms of some of the advances that have been made in terms of the package that he’s produced.</p> <p>There are very significant advances, on SPS [rules] which would reduce checks by about 80%, and also in terms of customs checks and in respect the medicines, and in building stakeholder engagement for people in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>It demonstrates that the European Commission is in solution mode.</p> </blockquote> <p>In <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/europe/eu-s-brexit-compromise-a-love-letter-to-northern-ireland-1.4699826">a good analysis for the Irish Times</a>, <strong>Naomi O’Leary</strong> quotes a diplomat saying there was “blood on the floor” at the commission because the rows about the package were so brutal. “The commission is pushing at the very edge of what is accepted by member states,” the diplomat told O’Leary.</p> <p>At a news conference, <strong>Martin</strong> also implied he was surprised that the UK government is now making a big issue of European court of justice oversight of the protocol. Previously Boris Johnson seemed most concerned about sausages, Martin said. He explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The main sticking point all along on the ground was around the free flow of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Even with the British PM, in the discussions I have with him in respect of Northern Ireland, it was, emotively, people talking about the sausages getting to Northern Ireland and so on.</p> <p>You know what, the sausages can now get to Northern Ireland.

That requires a robust plan. What the government has put in place is not a robust plan.</p> <p>The core problem here is lack of GPs. In the election of 2019, the prime minister promised us 6,000 new GPs. That was his great pledge. We have now got less than we had in 2019.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He urged the government to help the steel industry cope with soaring gas prices.</strong> It would be “unforgivable” if a short-term price hike led to long-term job losses, he said. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>What the steel sector needs is support and action from the government. What we have got is a government that is missing in action.</p> <p>It is not having discussions that it should be with the sector. It is not doing what is necessary to save the jobs that are at risk. They have put the ‘out of office’ sign up. That is not acceptable.</p> <p>If we have short-term energy prices leading to long-term job losses that is unforgivable by the government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, has<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/11/no-10-backs-kwasi-kwarteng-in-treasury-spat-over-energy-prices"> asked the Treasury to help energy intensive industries like steel, </a>but the Treasury has not responded yet.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer said the government should have had a plan months ago to deal with the supply chain shortages.</strong> He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>What we needed here is a plan that was crafted months ago to deal with these problems.</p> <p>We have seen it with fuel drivers, we have seen it with delivery drivers and with abattoirs and other sectors. All of these shortages were predicted.</p> <p>People will look at pictures of Felixstowe which has got containers that are much unable to move and scratch their heads and say ‘Why is there not a plan to get us through this?’.</p> <p>At the moment the government is sitting back and saying this is somebody else’s problem.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-6168350b8f086e1689385ab0" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2021-10-14T13:54:32.097Z">2.54pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Police commissioner who urged women to be 'streetwise' after Sarah Everard's murder loses non-binding no confidence vote</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The Conservative police commissioner whose comments following the murder of Sarah Everard caused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/oct/01/sarah-everard-murder-police-commissioner-apologises-for-saying-women-should-be-more-streetwise">a national outcry </a>has received a formal, but non-binding, vote of no confidence from local politicians, PA Media reports.

He explained:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The winter as a whole, I regret to say, is going to be exceptionally difficult for the NHS and general practice is going to be absolutely at the forefront of this, unfortunately.</p> <p>That is irrespective of whether we have a relatively low but non trivial amount of Covid, or whether we actually have a further surge in the winter. </p> <p>If you ask 100 modellers, you’re going to get over 100 answers exactly as to how this is going to go out. I think what we’re confident of is the very top end that we would have faced, potentially if things had gone wrong [like] last winter, is not going to happen, barring an extraordinary escape variant ...</p> <p>I think the top end risks are much lower, but we could certainly go up. We are only two to three doubling times away from really quite serious pressure on the NHS - it’s already serious but one that would be very difficult to deal with. </p> <p>So, the margin of error is quite small.</p> <p>Zero Covid over this winter is a completely impossible dream ... What we hope is we can keep it roughly to low levels.</p> <p>But we’ve got flu resurging. There’s a lot of debate about whether we’ll have a low flu year, because a lot of people are actually meeting many fewer people than they did two years ago. Maybe that’ll hold the line. On the other hand, we have less natural immunity in the system, we could have a really serious spike, and we could have a flu vaccine that is not very well matched to the flu we get because there hasn’t been enough flu circulating in the southern hemisphere really to get a proper fix on this.</p> <p>We’ve definitely got some quite serious other respiratory infections going around. And we have all the usual winter pressures on cardiovascular, slips and trips, and everything else that goes with it. </p> <p>So if you layer all of that on top of one another, and then you add on the fact there’s no doubt that we’re now seeing, as we knew from the beginning would happen, people who delayed coming to see doctors coming at a later stage of their disease, and therefore more seriously ill, and the fact that we’ve got to catch up on things like screening, and we’ve got to maintain the vaccination momentum - that’s an extraordinarily tall order when you add all of those up.</p> <p>I wish I could claim the sunlit uplands and it’ll all be fantastic by Christmas but, sadly, I’m afraid [that’s not the case]. But we are in a so much better place than we were before.</p> </blockquote>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2021-10-14T09:49:21.372Z">at 10.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6167f35b8f086e1689385658" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2021-10-14T09:08:23.328Z">10.08am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Record 5.7m people in England waiting for hospital treatment</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The number of people waiting for hospital treatment in England has hit a record high of 5.7 million, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs">NHS</a> struggles to clear the growing backlog of care worsened by the pandemic, my colleague <strong>Andrew Gregory</strong> reports.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/oct/14/record-england-waiting-list-nhs-hospital-treatment-covid-crisis">Record 5.7m people in England waiting for hospital treatment</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6167f2018f086e168938564c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2021-10-14T09:05:41.419Z">10.05am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Whitty</strong> says the winter is going to be “exceptionally difficult” for the NHS.</p> <p>He says the worst predictions are unlikely to materialise, unless there is an extraordinary new variant that can escape the vaccines.</p> <p>But he says flu will be a problem.

On Tuesday morning, following the publication of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/12/covid-response-one-of-uks-worst-ever-public-health-failures">a parliamentary report </a>describing the government’s early handling of the coronavirus pandemic was one of the worst public health failures in UK history, the minister doing the morning interview round on behalf of No 10, <strong>Steve Barclay</strong>, <a href="https://news.sky.com/video/covid-19-minister-declines-11-times-to-say-sorry-over-coronavirus-needless-deaths-12431878">refused to apologise.</a> It did not look good, and since then the line has changed. <strong>Oliver Dowden</strong>, the Conservative party co-chair, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/oct/13/senior-tory-says-sorry-for-mistakes-in-covid-pandemic-handling">did say sorry </a>on Wednesday, and<strong> Sajid Javid</strong>, the health secretary, has been using the same language in his interview round on Thursday. This is what he told the Today programme:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I am sorry for anyone that’s been hurt throughout this pandemic, and especially those people that would have lost their their loved ones, their brother or sister, or mum or dad, perhaps a close friend, and also those people that may not have lost their lives but they’re still suffering with long Covid, which is something I’m particularly concerned about. Of course I’m sorry about that.</p> </blockquote> <p>But saying you are sorry <em>about</em> something is not an actual apology, which requires you to say you are sorry<em> for</em> something you did, and this was made clear when Today’s <strong>Martha Kearney</strong> asked Javid to explain what he was apologising for. Astonishingly, <strong>Javid </strong>could not say what lessons the government has learned from the Covid pandemic. This is how the exchange went.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><strong>MK: </strong>So what are the mistakes you are apologising for?</p> <p><strong>SJ:</strong> I’m always very straightforward with you Martha. I don’t know all the lessons that we are going to have to learn about this. I don’t think anyone does at this point. I think the best place to determine this will be the independent public inquiry.</p> <p><strong>MK:</strong> That’s going to a while off. You are health secretary now and you are prepared to offer an apology. So what is it you think the government got wrong?</p> <p><strong>SJ: </strong> What I’m what I’m saying sorry for is the loss that people have suffered and how they’ve been affected. I don’t think I’m in a position yet to go back and look at every decision that was made and how we can learn from that. </p> <p>My focus so far, I think most people understand this, has been to try and focus on how we can keep the virus at bay, how we can deal deal with that massive backlog in elective care and how we can make the reforms that are necessary for the future.</p> </blockquote> <p>This is surprising because there is near consensus in the medical and scientific community about multiple lessons that can clearly be learnt from the government’s handling of the pandemic. A good starting point was the report published on Tuesday (which was not over-harsh on the government), although Javid also told Today he had not read it in full yet.</p> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9.30am:</em> The latest NHS England waiting time figures are published.</p> <p><em>Around 9.30am:</em> Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, speaks to the Royal College of General Practitioners’ annual conference.</p> <p><em>10am:</em> Lord Goldsmith, the environment minister, gives evidence to a Lords committee about the contributions being made by government departments to the success of Cop26.</p> <p><em>11.30am: </em>Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, is expected to respond to a private notice question in the Lords about the Northern Ireland protocol.</p> <p><em>12pm:</em> Peers debate the problems facing social care.</p> <p>And Sir Keir Starmer is on a visit to a steel plant today to highlight the problems faced by energy intensive industries.</p> <p>I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all.
