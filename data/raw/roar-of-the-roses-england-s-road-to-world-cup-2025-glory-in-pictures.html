<p>Over little more than five weeks, Guardian writers have followed every step of England’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/womens-rugby-world-cup-2025"> 2025 Rugby World Cup</a> journey from the opening match at the Stadium of Light to the final at Twickenham. Here are our favourite pictures coupled with excerpts from our match reports and blogs.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--immersive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/" data-alt="Line break"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Game 1: Pool A</h2> <h2>22 August, Stadium of Light, Sunderland</h2> <p><strong>England 69 </strong><em>Tries</em> Kabeya, Botterman, Muir, Kildunne (2), Dow, Cokayne, Breach (2), Atkin-Davies (2) <em>Cons</em> Harrison (6), Sing <strong><br>USA 7 </strong><em>Try</em> Jarrell-Searcy <em>Con: </em>Hawkins</p>    <ul> <li><p>The two teams take to the pitch for the opening match of the tournament.

The game has come a long way even since they first played. No one who has been in the sport for any length of time seems quite able to believe it, even World Rugby’s higher-ups seem to be a bit bewildered by just how popular the women’s game has become all of a sudden.</p> <p>The question hanging over the team is exactly how they will cope with the occasion given they have never really had to deal with this much attention and expectation. Well, nothing in rugby serves to settle the nerves like a good maul, and the Red Roses rolled out a couple at the first good chance they had. Sadia Kabeya scored off the second, and their World Cup was off and running. <em>Andy Bull</em></p>            <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--immersive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/" data-alt="Line break"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Game 2: Pool A<br>30 August, Franklin’s Gardens, Northampton</h2> <p><strong>England 92</strong> <em>Tries</em> Jones 2, Breach 3, Bern, Feaunati, Atkin-Davies, L Packer, Clifford, Carson, Rowland, M Packer, Moloney-MacDonald <em>Cons</em> Rowland 11<br><strong>Samoa 3</strong> <em>Pens</em> Vatau</p>    <ul> <li><p>Jess Breach runs clear of the Samoa defence.

Half of Samoa’s squad had to fundraise to be able to attend this Rugby World Cup with no contracts in place, and some have taken unpaid leave from their jobs to represent their country. England, on the other hand, have been professional for more than five years and have now swept aside their opponents in 59 of their last 60 matches, that one loss coming in the last World Cup final.</p> <p>Among the try scorers as England reached the quarter-finals was the hat-trick heroine Jess Breach, and the first try was a special one for the 27-year-old as it was her 50th for her country. Breach is only the fifth Red Roses player to score 50 tries, after Sue Day, Nicky Crawford, Emily Scarratt and Marlie Packer. The centre Meg Jones got on the board twice and had not been in the starting XV at the beginning of this week, but an injury to Scarratt led to her promotion. The Cardiff-born centre’s contributions across the pitch were outstanding as her prowess in an England shirt only grows. Another bright spark for England was player-of-the-match Helena Rowland’s kicking from the tee. <em>Sarah Rendell</em></p>          <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--immersive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/" data-alt="Line break"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Game 3: Pool A<br>6 September, Brighton &amp; Hove Stadium</h2> <p><strong>England 47</strong> <em>Tries</em> Breach, Ward, Kabeya 2, Clifford 2, Bern <em>Cons </em>Harrison 6<br><strong>Australia 7</strong> <em>Try</em> Talakai <em>Con</em> Wood</p>    <ul> <li><p>Siokapesi Palu of Australia attempts to go past Rosie Galligan and Alex Matthews of England.

Australia put England under the most pressure they have faced in a long time with a superb first-half performance but the Red Roses pulled away in the second half to seal top spot and a quarter-final against Scotland.</p> <p>The victory was also England’s 30th in a row, equalling their own world record set at the last World Cup. The eventual 47-7 scoreline was not a true reflection of what a battle this final Pool A match was, with Jo Yapp’s Australia executing a successful kicking game to put the Red Roses under huge pressure in the opening half an hour. England did not lead until the 33rd minute and Australia got some reward for their efforts, the result meaning they qualify for the last eight and a meeting with Canada.</p> <p>While the errors made by England will be a worry, what may cause more concern are the injuries sustained to key players in the brutal encounter. Ellie Kildunne was substituted when showing concussion symptoms and will not play in the quarter-final, while Hannah Botterman went off with an acute back spasm. Morwenna Talling also came off for a head injury assessment but passed and is expected to be available for selection. It was another dominant scoreline but opponents who come next will know there are ways to put dents in England’s armour. <em>Sarah Rendell</em></p>          <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--immersive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/" data-alt="Line break"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Game 4: Quarter-final<br>14 September, Ashton Gate, Bristol</h2> <p><strong>England 40</strong> <em>Tries</em> Clifford 2, Talling, Dow, Cokayne, Aitchison <em>Cons</em> Aitchison 5 <br><strong>Scotland 8</strong> <em>Try</em> Lloyd <em>Pen</em> Nelson</p>    <ul> <li><p>Morwenna Talling of England claims a lineout.

The scoreboard answer from a soaking wet Bristol was predictable enough. When bookmakers start quoting 1,000-1 on for a team to win a two‑horse race, the chances of England failing to reach the semi‑finals were roughly on a par with anyone in the stands getting sunstroke. Yet would you absolutely put your mortgage on England hoisting the World Cup in just under a fortnight?</p> <p>Based on the evidence of this particular game, despite the comfortable victory margin and difficult conditions, you may just be inclined to hold fire. The occasionally underrated Morwenna Talling deserved her award for player of the match while Kelsey Clifford, in for the injured Hannah Botterman, also took her starting chance with both hands. Her two no-nonsense first-half tries will have particularly delighted everyone at her first club, Finchley RFC, where her father introduced her to rugby at the age of six. Then there is that fleet-footed marvel Abby Dow, who scored her 50th Test try and played with her usual dash and energy.</p> <p>Maybe it won’t matter when Ellie Kildunne is back. Maybe their mighty pack and extraordinary strength in depth will wear down all-comers and the holy grail will be secured for the first time since 2014. But just maybe England’s future opponents still have a tiny sniff. <em>Robert Kitson</em></p>              <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--immersive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/" data-alt="Line break"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Game 5: Semi-final<br>20 September, Ashton Gate, Bristol</h2> <p><strong>France 17</strong> <em>Tries</em> Konde 2, Arbey <em>Cons</em> Bourgeois<br><strong>England 35</strong> <em>Tries</em> Kildunne 2, Cokayne, Ward, Jones <em>Cons </em>Harrison 5</p>    <ul> <li><p>Ellie Kildunne takes a moment to play the drums after England’s victory against France.

England are into the Rugby World Cup final against Canada and the tournament organisers can breathe again. Had the Red Roses slipped up in the semis, the prospect of a finale likely to yield a record TV audience in Quebec was not quite the dream scenario they had been praying for. But, goodness, the Red Roses made their fans perspire at times.</p> <p>At no stage did France ever back down and, without two scintillating tries from their curly haired golden girl Ellie Kildunne, England might have had a far less enjoyable afternoon. The final scoreline does not reflect how tight the game was for lengthy periods, nor the costly chances that France were crucially unable to convert.</p> <p>Kildunne is certainly box office in anybody’s language. From the opening minutes she was already dancing and skipping past a host of defenders, clearly keen to make up for lost time having been forced to sit out the Scotland game. And then, courtesy of a loose ruck ball which should have resulted in England being penalised for accidental offside, the recent world player of the year was handed another opportunity just on halfway. Away she surged and, 50 metres later, the gleeful dive behind the posts mirrored the joy around most of the stadium. Her second-half effort, also from more than 40m and involving a diagonal surge past more powerless opponents, brought the house down again at a stage of the game when England needed a fresh spark from somewhere. Because, let’s face it, if you keep Kildunne quiet and shut down England’s scrum and maul, the Red Roses can look rather more mortal than they would like.</p> <p>England’s steely defence, though, bails them out of tight corners on a regular basis. Before this game the highest number of points they had conceded in a single match all tournament was eight against Scotland. England’s bench depth also remains another obvious plus. They have the luxury of replacing one outstanding front row with another and, once again, their finishers added a significant gloss to the scoreboard. But will it be enough for them to win the game of their lives? <em>Robert Kitson</em></p>                    <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--immersive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/" data-alt="Line break"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>Game 6: The final<br>27 September, Allianz Stadium, Twickenham</h2> <p><strong>Canada 13</strong> <em>Tries </em>Hogan-Rochester; <em>Pen</em> De Goede <br><strong>England 33</strong> <em>Tries </em>Kildunne, Cokayne, Matthews 2, Ward; <em>Cons </em>Harrison 4</p>    <ul> <li><p>Red Roses fans cheer the England team as they conduct a lap of honour.

And finally, for England’s women, it is now. The last time the Red Roses lifted the World Cup was 11 years ago and defeat on home turf in front of a world-record 81,885 crowd would have been beyond devastating. Hence the tears of relief and shared collective joy at the final whistle as they brought the big one home.</p> <p>Among other things this trophy has brought them the validation they dearly wanted and, in truth, needed. Since the introduction of full-time professional contracts in 2019, the Red Roses have won 74 of the 76 matches they have contested. The number of registered female participants in Canadian rugby would barely fill half of England’s towering citadel.</p> <p>This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity the hosts simply could not afford to squander and their pack, in particular, enthusiastically grabbed it with both hands. When it mattered England delivered by some distance their most convincing 80-minute performance and all the angst of past failures melted away. English rugby has spent years hailing the boys of 2003 and they now have some fresher-faced, modern-day competition.</p> <p>Even the celebs wanted a piece of it all. Justin “Red” Rose sent a message from the Ryder Cup, the Lioness Lucy Bronze was in the crowd and royal best wishes arrived from the palace. Shania Twain, sadly, had a prior engagement and couldn’t make it but, most important of all, Canada turned up big-time out on the field. When they scored the afternoon’s first try through Asia Hogan-Rochester, the same thought flashed through the mind of every English fan. They couldn’t, could they?</p> <p>It was just as well that England had their shaggy-haired secret weapon lying in wait. If any further proof were required, after her brace of semi-final tries, Ellie Kildunne has rocket boosters in her specially designed white boots and four or five would-be tacklers were left in her wake as she swerved and surged away to register a quite brilliant individual score. “Kildunne and dusted” read a handwritten sign in the crowd, but it was still way too early to relax.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Canada, it was also only half the story. Canada could have enlisted every strapping lumberjack in British Columbia and still wouldn’t have stopped the inevitable rumbles that laid the platform for England’s second and third tries and, later on, the two crucial second-half scrum penalties that snuffed out Canada’s comeback. Every time the physical effort took a little bit more out of the legs of Canada’s forwards and made it that little bit harder for them to gallop freely elsewhere.</p> <p>Canada’s gallant mini-fightback, in the circumstances, was even more praiseworthy. For this World Cup they have had to launch a million-dollar crowdfunding drive, supported by among others the Canadian band the Tragically Hip. By the time the next tournament comes around in Australia in 2029, you can only hope that more women’s teams are better funded and more sides are in a position to challenge England’s supreme queens. <em>Robert Kitson</em></p>                                <figure class="element element-interactive interactive element--immersive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/" data-alt="Line break"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2017/apr/divider/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <h2>The Red Roses Champions Party<br>28 September, Battersea power station</h2>    <ul> <li><p>The England players among their joyous fans.
