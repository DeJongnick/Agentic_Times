It will return on Friday morning and run all through the weekend.</p> 
  <p>Here is what made the news headlines today:</p>

   <li><p>The WA premier, <strong>Roger Cook</strong>, said his labelling of <strong>JD Vance</strong> as a “knob” was a “poor” but “extremely popular choice of words” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/06/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-election-campaign-cost-of-living-economy-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67c8b8d38f08024bffe6af3d#block-67c8b8d38f08024bffe6af3d">as he apologised for any offence</a>.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">PM pushes for fixed terms amid election date speculation</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> says repeated questions on the election date, which must be held by 17 May, reinforced the need for certainty on when Australians go to the polls in the future.</p> 
  <p>As <strong>AAP</strong> reports, the prime minister told Sky News earlier:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>These are questions that have been asked this week, this month, last month, the month before. They’ve been asked for a long period of time. <strong>This is why we need four-year fixed terms to provide certainty.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>12 April was firming as the most likely date for this year’s election, ahead of a Monday deadline for Albanese to make the call.</p> 
  <p>If the election is not called for 12 April, Australians are likely to head to the ballot box in May. This is because the only other Saturdays in April – the 19th and 26th – have been ruled out because of the Easter holidays and the Anzac Day long weekend.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">New home approvals surge</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A surge in apartment approvals in NSW has lifted new dwelling consents to the highest level in more than two years, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Australia-wide, 16,579 dwellings were approved in January, up 6.3% on the month prior, the <strong>Australian Bureau of Statistics</strong> revealed.</p> 
  <p>That’s still well below the 20,000 dwellings needed on average each month to meet the government’s target of 1.2m new homes by mid-2029 – and doesn’t factor in a drop-out rate of about 1% to 2% of homes that gain approval but don’t end up being constructed.</p> 
  <p>But today’s update confirms the trend is certainly heading in the right direction, up 30% from the low of 12,836 dwellings approved in April 2023.</p> 
  <p>January’s bounce was driven by a 12.7% rise in private attached dwellings, like apartments and townhouses, said ABS’s head of construction statistics, <strong>Daniel Rossi</strong>.</p> 
  <p>NSW led the way, with an increase in state-significant developments and policies like height bonuses for affordable housing and train station rezonings potentially contributing to the rise in apartments coming through the pipeline, Oxford Economics’ <strong>Michael Dyer</strong> said – but it was still too early to tell, given apartment approvals tend to be pretty lumpy:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We expect further modest improvement over 2025. Cash rate cuts are now in play. This is set to aid the release of pent-up housing demand, supporting a more meaningful double-digit recovery from 2026.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Victoria urged to embrace electric homes over gas</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Victorian Trades Hall Council, Environment Victoria and Victorian Council of Social Services (Vcoss) have called on the government to end the state’s reliance on gas.</p> 
  <p>The Victorian government’s building electrification regulatory impact statement is open for submissions. <strong>Juanita Pope</strong>, the CEO of Vcoss, said in a statement:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Vcoss is a strong supporter of Victoria’s electrification agenda. Electric homes powered by renewables are better for people’s health, their wallets and the planet. Research shows that an all-electric home has less than half the running costs of a fossil fuel home.</em></p> 
   <p><em>In a global cost-of-living crisis and climate emergency, now is the time to support Victorian households to make the switch.</em></p> 
   <p><em>We know that some Victorians – particularly low-income households and renters – will need help to manage the upfront cost of transition to safer, more efficient electric appliances. Prioritising support for these households will mean that all Victorians can enjoy the health benefits and bill savings of electrification.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Heatwave conditions remain for parts of WA, NT and Queensland</strong></p> 
  <p>While much of the weather focus right now is on Tropical Cyclone Alfred, heatwave warnings persist for parts of Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland.</p> 
  <p>According to the <strong>Bureau of Meteorology</strong>, severe heatwave conditions in WA will gradually ease in the north over the next few days.</p> 
  <p>Exmouth is set to reach a top of 43C today before dropping to 36C on Monday.</p> 
  <p>In the NT, severe heatwave conditions are forecast to ease towards the end of the week and into the weekend – but low intensity heatwave conditions may persit for some time.</p> 
  <p>And in Queensland, further north from where Tropical Cyclone Alfred is expected to cross, heatwave conditions are set to ease into the weekend.</p> 
  <p>Gladstone is set to reach a top of 37C tomorrow, and Yeppoon 34C.</p>

  <p><strong>Government has approved enough renewables to power nearly every household, Plibersek says</strong></p> 
  <p>The environment minister, <strong>Tanya Plibersek</strong>, says the government has now approved enough renewable energy projects to power “nearly every single household in Australia” as demand for the projects grows.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, she said three new renewables projects in NSW had been given the green light, including:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>The 1,332 megawatt <strong>Liverpool Range wind farm </strong>near<strong> Coolah</strong>, within the Central West Orana renewable energy cone;</p></li> 
   <li><p>The 700 megawatt <strong>Spicers Creek wind farm project </strong>near<strong> Gulgong</strong>, within the Central West Orana renewable energy zone; and</p></li> 
   <li><p>The 372 megawatt <strong>Hills of Gold wind farm </strong>near<strong> Nundle.</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Plibersek said the three projects would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6.5m tonnes – “equivalent to taking more than 2m passenger cars off the road every year”.</p> 
  <p>She said the government had approved 77 renewables projects, equivalent to powering over 10m homes and the “most renewable energy any government has ticked off in Australian history”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Unlike the climate deniers and environmental vandals of the Liberal and National party, Labor is getting on with the job of transforming Australia into a renewable energy superpower … This is what action on cost of living and climate change looks like.</p>

  <p><strong>Liberal fundraiser cancelled amid cyclone preparations and reports Dutton attended Justin Hemmes event</strong></p> 
  <p>A fundraising event at the Melbourne headquarters of Macquarie Bank featuring <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> and several Liberal MPs was cancelled at the last minute last night without explanation, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tropical-cyclone-alfred">a major storm bore down on the opposition leader’s home state.</a></p> 
  <p>Yesterday, the Australian Financial Review <a href="https://www.afr.com/rear-window/dutton-sneaks-in-sydney-fundraiser-at-justin-hemmes-mansion-20250305-p5lh64">published a story</a> claiming Dutton left what he described as a “very serious” cyclone situation in Queensland for a fundraising soiree at the harbourside home of hospitality entrepreneur <strong>Justin Hemmes</strong> in Sydney on Tuesday night.</p> 
  <p>Dutton was scheduled to provide a keynote address to the Melbourne event shortly after 5pm yesterday. The reason for cancelling the event, and who made the decision, was not made clear, although sources speculated it may have been due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tropical-cyclone-alfred">Tropical Cyclone Alfred</a>.</p>

  <p>A health alert has been sent out for locals near a suspicious fire that ripped through a factory near Melbourne airport, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/06/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-peter-dutton-election-campaign-cost-of-living-economy-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-67c8b8458f0809474cc8d77a#block-67c8b8458f0809474cc8d77a">we reported on earlier in the blog</a>.</p> 
  <p><strong>AAP</strong> reports that Victoria police believe a car was driven into the premises at Tullamarine, in the city’s north-west, and set alight about 3.30am Thursday morning. The building was completely alight when 80 firefighters arrived.</p> 
  <p>Crews managed to stop flames from destroying nearby businesses at the industrial park on Barrie Road. No one was inside the building at the time and there are no reports of injuries related to the fire.</p> 
  <p>Fire Rescue Victoria commander and incident controller, <strong>John Zuccarelli,</strong> said a car detailing business operated from the factory. Crews have not been able to enter the building due to the risk of the structure collapsing, so he could not reveal what was stored inside.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The damage is quite extensive and it be won’t be salvageable.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Gas and electricity to the site were switched off during the fire fight, with nearby power lines posing a danger.</p> 
  <p>The blaze sparked a health alert for smoke for residents living up to 2km away and locals were told to avoid the area. An arson chemist is investigating what took place and a crime scene has been set up at the site.</p> 
  <p>The fire is being probed by local investigators and not taskforce Lunar, a specialist squad investigating more than 100 firebombings linked to conflict between crime gangs over the profits of illegal tobacco.</p>

  <p><strong>Trump slight causes New Zealand to sack top diplomat</strong></p> 
  <p>In some news from across the ditch via <strong>AAP</strong>: New Zealand’s high commissioner to the UK, <strong>Phil Goff</strong>, has been sacked for questioning the US president, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s, grasp of history.</p> 
  <p>Goff, the foreign and defence minister in <strong>Helen Clark</strong>’s government, will leave the role under orders from New Zealand’s foreign minister, <strong>Winston Peters</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The 71-year-old appeared at an event in London on Tuesday with Finland’s foreign minister, <strong>Elina Valtonen</strong>, when he made a thinly veiled attack on Trump:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?</p>

   <p>Phil Goff’s comments are deeply disappointing. They do not represent the views of the NZ government and make his position as high commissioner to London untenable.</p> 
   <p>We have asked the secretary of foreign affairs and trade, <strong>Bede Corry</strong>, to now work through with Mr Goff the upcoming leadership transition at the New Zealand high commission in London.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Goff is yet to comment on the matter. But on social media, Clark said it was a “a very thin excuse for sacking a highly respected former [New Zealand foreign minister] from his post”.</p>

  <p><strong>Cash says PM playing ‘cat and mouse game’ over whether or not he is calling election</strong></p> 
  <p>The shadow attorney general, <strong>Michaelia Cash</strong>, has accused the prime minister of playing a “cat and mouse game” over whether or not he will call an election.</p> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> fielded questions this morning over whether he would call an election this weekend, or early next week, but said his focus was firmly on the Tropical Cyclone Alfred response.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on Sky News, Cash accused the PM of “campaigning” and said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think the prime minister should give a very clear message to Australians, but in particular to Queenslanders, they don’t need to worry about our federal election over the next few weeks.</p> 
   <p>We are scheduled to go back to the parliament. March 25 is when the government has scheduled to bring down the budget. There’s a lot of work that needs to be done …</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said Albanese has the “opportunity to rule out calling an election.”</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Stop playing a game of cat and mouse. Be clear. Don’t call an election.</p>

  <p>A watch and act alert has been issued for Buninyong and Scotsburn, south of Ballarat in Victoria, amid an out of control bushfire.</p> 
  <p>The alert, issued by Forest Fire Management Victoria, says the bushfire at Mount Buninyong has now grown to 47 hectares in size.</p>

  <p>Independent MP <strong>Zali Steggall</strong> said “flexibility is important” when it comes to calling an election, amid Tropical Cyclone Alfred.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on Sky News, she was asked about the timing of <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> calling the election, and said she was assuming a 12 April poll date:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>I think flexibility is important, and there is a very significant disaster unfolding</strong> … I welcome the fact that he and his government are currently focusing on the communities impacted, and they are preparing. </p>

  <p><strong>La Trobe</strong> has become the sixth university to enter an enforceable undertaking with the Fair Work Ombudsman after identifying more than $10.7m in staff underpayments.</p> 
  <p>About 6,700 staff were underpaid, performing across the university’s 10 schools as casual academics and professional staff between 2015 and 2022.</p> 
  <p>The ombudsman said the underpayments were caused by “systemic failures in compliance, central oversight and governance processes”, including incorrectly applying its enterprise agreements.</p> 
  <p>Individual underpayments range from $2 to $91,837, while 35 employees were underpaid more than $20,000.</p> 
  <p>A spokesperson for La Trobe said the casual staff underpayments were identified by the university through an independent review in 2020, and self reported to the ombudsman the following year.</p> 
  <p>Affected current staff had been fully compensated, while La Trobe continued to “proactively seek” some former staff who hadn’t responded.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The underpayments were unintentional, resulting from complex industrial agreements, inefficient and outdated systems and processes. La Trobe has since improved and simplified these systems and processes to prevent future errors.</em></p>

  <p>The Victorian premier, <strong>Jacinta Allan</strong>, has held a press conference in the town hall concourse of her government’s Metro Tunnel project which she says will open later this year.</p> 
  <p>In her media release, Allan said the concourse – which will feature new shops and cafes – would be free to public access without touching on.</p> 
  <p>She said the project – 40 metres below the CBD – was challenging to build. Instead of “opening a massive hole” over Swanston Street, the station has been built using “deep shafts at either side”, which Allan said was akin to “keyhole surgery”. At the press conference, she said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Just as we can’t imagine Melbourne today without the City Loop, in years to come, we won’t be able to imagine Melbourne without the Metro Tunnel, without stations like town hall, because of what it means to be able to get more people in and out of the CBD but also connect people to where they want to go … Doing this complex construction work deep underneath the ground while the city kept moving above ground, and standing here today in this concourse area, you can see the complexity. You can see the size and the enormity of this project.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Circling back to the West Australian election this Saturday: <strong>AAP</strong> reports that the ruling Labor party may be the favourite to win, but the premier, <strong>Roger Cook,</strong> still faces a hefty challenge.</p> 
  <p>Cook is attempting to win a historic third term for his party and an election off his own back, having replaced <strong>Mark McGowan</strong> when he stood down midterm in 2023.</p> 
  <p>Prof <strong>John Phillimore</strong>, the executive director of Curtin University’s John Curtin Institute of Public Policy, said this was a “big test” for Cook as it “gives him a chance to walk out of the shadow of McGowan and be his own man and win an election in his own right.”</p> 
  <p>Experts are tipping a comfortable win for Labor in Saturday’s contest. The party holds 53 of 59 seats in the lower house after an unprecedented landslide victory in 2021 under McGowan.</p> 
  <p>But the party’s massive majority is likely to shrink as the conservatives claim back seats lost in the past two elections. Phillimore said that while it was important for Cook to establish himself as the elected leader “given McGowan’s complete dominance”, he also had to manage expectations about the likely result:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When you’ve got 53 out of 59 seats and 70% two-party preferred of the vote and a majority in your own right in the upper house for the first time in 150 years, guess what – the only way is down.</p>

  <p><strong>Medications out of reach for women as living costs bite</strong></p> 
  <p>Women are twice as likely as men to say they cannot afford a prescription for themselves or their families, <strong>AAP</strong> reports, as pharmacists urge greater funding to help patients access life-saving medication.</p> 
  <p>One in four women could not afford a script over the past three years amid cost-of-living pressures, according to research commissioned by the <strong>Pharmacy Guild</strong>.</p> 
  <p>This rose to one-in-three women for those aged 35-54, according to a survey of more than 2,800 people. The number reporting money as a barrier to accessing medication has also risen by one-third since 2022.</p> 
  <p>Overall, one in five Australians reported skipping a prescription, which increases to one-in-three people in regional areas.</p> 
  <p>The findings have prompted the pharmacy sector to call for the prescription co-payment to be reduced from $30 to $19.</p> 
  <p>Sydney pharmacist and Pharmacy Guild national councillor <strong>Catherine Bronger</strong> said she saw women every day who struggle to pay for prescriptions:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You shouldn’t have to choose between medication, it shouldn’t be a luxury and we shouldn’t be having this conversation.</p> 
   <p>Women tend to be the ones that come into the pharmacy, for their families and for themselves. It can be for a chronic condition like preventative asthma medications, where they would wait a little longer and stretch out their meds a little bit.</p>

  <p><strong>Chalmers welcomes ‘heavy lifting’ of private sector in economy growth</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> also weighed in on yesterday’s GDP numbers and was asked how much of the improvement is due to population growth and people working longer hours.</p> 
  <p>The treasurer said yesterday’s numbers were “encouraging” and show the “economy has turned the corner”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is growing solidly, we did see a solid rebound in growth, and that’s not primarily because of the two things that you mentioned. Per capita growth is positive again after a period of softness in our economy, but <strong>the most encouraging thing – from my point of view – in those numbers yesterday was the fact that the private sector is doing some of the heavy lifting.</strong></p> 
   <p>We want the private sector to take its rightful place as the primary driver of growth in our economy. There are good reasons why public spending was helping to keep the economy ticking over over the last couple of years, but the private sector is rebounding strongly. Growth in our economy is broader. That’s a very good thing.</p>

  <p>Let’s circle back to <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, who also spoke with ABC RN this morning about climate mitigation efforts.</p> 
  <p>Specifically, is enough being done in terms of the budget for climate adaptation to keep up with the disasters the nation is seeing?</p> 
  <p>The treasurer said $1bn over five years had been spent on this:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’ve tried to reorient the budget towards preparation and mitigation as well as responding to natural disasters, and that’s because these disasters are unfortunately becoming more frequent and they’re becoming more severe.</p> 
   <p>I think that’s just a scientific fact and so the onus is on us, the responsibility is on us, and we’ve embraced that responsibility to try and do more where we can to make our communities a bit more resilient.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Chalmers said there would “always be more that needs to be done” and the government would “find as much resources as we can for what is a really important task”.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Roger Cook</strong> warned last year that <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was an economic threat to Western Australia and, if he was elected, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/04/who-is-roger-cook-the-australian-politician-who-called-jd-vance-a-knob-ntwnfb">it would be a “dark road” for the world</a>.</p> 
  <p>Asked if that “dark road” is now rolling out, Cook said no – but it “underpins the point … that we do live in uncertain times”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>And the point that I’ve been making is that in uncertain times you need experienced leadership, someone who has the skills and the team behind them to be able to navigate troubled waters.</p>

  <p>Western Australia is a key part of the Aukus agreement between Australia, the US and the UK. Asked if he trusts Trump to honour the deal, Cook said he wasn’t in the federal government but had been assured by the deputy PM, <strong>Richard Marles</strong>, that “there is still a lot of strength in the relationship, and that the US government considers itself a very strong and long-term ally in relation to these matters”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Now, people should also remember that the Aukus arrangements had their birthplace during the time of the Trump government. These things aren’t put together overnight.</p> 
   <p>And so I think it’s probably true to say that the Trump government probably feels as much ownership of the Aukus arrangements as other administrations of the US government.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But Trump didn’t seem to know what Aukus was last week? Cook said he “won’t criticise him for not understanding every acronym that’s thrown at him”.</p>

  <p>He said Australia’s defence spend will increase around $50bn between now and 2033, and as a percentage of the economy, will go from “around 2% to 2.3%, from memory, in 2033”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That is a very, very substantial pick-up in defend spending and one of the reasons we’re doing that is to be able to work more effectively with our allies and partners like the United States … <strong>We do pay our own way on defence. We are substantially increasing defence spending.</strong></p> 
   <p>We have got a good relationship with the Americans, particularly that economic relationship which is of mutual benefit, and these are the sorts of things that we have been talking about with our American counterparts as they finalise some of the policies on things like tariffs.</p>

   <p>We have a clear choice: act now to build resilience, lower insurance costs and protect lives and livelihoods, or leave Australians and our economy vulnerable to financial ruin... Every dollar spent on resilience saves up to eleven dollars in recovery costs.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">$1bn fund for domestic violence victims opens</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A $1bn fund for crisis accommodation for women and children fleeing domestic violence will open this week, as Labor pledges more support for homelessness advocacy groups if it wins the federal election.</p> 
  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/11/labor-pours-1bn-into-domestic-violence-crisis-housing-and-doubles-homelessness-funding">,</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/11/labor-pours-1bn-into-domestic-violence-crisis-housing-and-doubles-homelessness-funding"> emerged from a national cabinet meeting last May</a> with a major commitment to boost emergency housing for victims of family violence. Almost 12 months on, Housing Australia will open applications for funding to build or convert existing properties into crisis accommodation.</p> 
  <p>The housing and homelessness minister, <strong>Clare O’Neil,</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The biggest reason women and children don’t leave dangerous situations is because they don’t have stable and secure housing to go to. That’s not good enough. Labor is committed to helping some of the most vulnerable Australians secure that most fundamental need – a roof over their heads.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Labor has also pledged $6.2m for homelessness peak bodies to continue their advocacy if it wins the upcoming federal election. O’Neil said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There is more work to do, but these two announcements today will make a real difference to women and children escaping family and domestic violence, and people at risk of homelessness.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Telstra fined over spam law breaches</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Telstra</strong> has paid a $626,000 penalty after sending more than 10 million text messages that breached Australia’s spam laws, the telecommunications regulator said today.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Australian Communications and Media Authority</strong> (Acma) said most of the texts required recipients to provide personal information in order to opt out. Acma member <strong>Samantha Yorke</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Consumers must be able to unsubscribe without giving businesses more personal information than is required.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Australian laws generally prevent businesses from requiring consumers to log into accounts or provide personal information in order to unsubscribe from receiving commercial messages.</p> 
  <p>The regulator said Telstra had self-reported the matter.</p> 
  <p>Acma said its subsequent investigation found that Telstra sent 10,433,812 texts between 2022 and 2024 that breached the relevant spam laws. </p>

  <p>One of our top stories this morning reveals that the top 16 tech companies are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/06/google-microsoft-meta-and-amazon-among-tech-companies-making-27bn-from-australians">collectively making $26.7bn in revenue</a> each year from Australians, prompting the Greens to call for a 3% tax on the biggest players. </p> 
  <p>It comes as the online safety regulator announces that the top tech firms have not implemented technology to automatically detect when terror content is being livestreamed on their services, six years on from the Christchurch terror attacks. More coming up, plus Telstra has been fined $600,000 after spamming Australians with more than 10 million texts.</p>
