<p>Once again, primary schools are expected to “fix” the obesity problem affecting young children (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/23/majority-children-overweight-obese-nine-areas-england-by-2035-study?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">Majority of children will be overweight or obese in nine areas of England by 2035, study shows, 23 June</a>). As a primary teacher and PE specialist, I know that this is largely ineffective. </p> <p>While half an hour or even 45&nbsp;minutes of vigorous exercise a day sounds like the answer, one has only to observe three things that completely undermine this: how the children travel, what is in their lunch box and what they do when they get home.</p> <p>Many children are driven to school and those who do walk often stop at junk food shops on their way home. I’ve seen groups of schoolchildren outside the chippy at 4pm and others walking home with a frappuccino-type drink in their hand.</p> <p>As for lunch boxes, it is often a collection of processed snacks, crisps, fizzy drinks and biscuits. No fibre, no protein – not even a sandwich in sight. And when the pupils arrive home, it’s often straight on the games console for a couple of hours. The concept of playing outside is alien to some of the children I have taught.</p> <p>The education system is invariably under pressure to address literacy, numeracy, behaviour and social interaction. But children’s obesity is not a school issue, it’s a cultural challenge that can only really be&nbsp;resolved by parents and the choices they make.<br><strong>Steve Wilkinson</strong><br><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
