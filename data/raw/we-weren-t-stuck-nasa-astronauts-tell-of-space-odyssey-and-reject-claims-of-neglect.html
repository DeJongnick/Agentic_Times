<p>In the end, whatever Elon Musk and Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jan/29/trump-nasa-astronauts-musk-spacex">liked to insist</a>, astronauts Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Sunita Williams were never stuck, nor stranded in space, and definitely not abandoned or marooned.</p> 
<p>The world heard on Monday, for the first time since their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/18/nasa-astronauts-iss-spacex-dragon-capsule-return-time-sunita-williams-barry-wilmore">return to Earth two weeks ago</a>, from the two <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa">Nasa</a> astronauts whose 10-day flight to the international space station (ISS) last summer turned into a nine-month odyssey. And their story was markedly at odds with the narrative painted from the White House.</p> 
<p>Wilmore and Williams were speaking to reporters at a press conference in Houston, hours after a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370828803112">joint appearance on Fox News</a>, and reaffirmed that they never felt neglected or in need of the rescue the president insisted was necessary.</p> 
<p>Instead, they said, they calmly assumed duties as members of the space station crew – “planning for one thing, preparing for another”, Wilmore said – while a political firestorm over their status raged back on the ground.</p> 
<p>If anything, the pair of veteran space flyers appeared slightly bemused by, or largely ignorant of the furore that followed their enforced and protracted stay on the orbiting outpost 250 miles above Earth, caused by technical failures on board their pioneering Boeing Starliner spacecraft that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/sep/06/boeing-starliner-iss">returned in September without them</a>.</p>

<p>At the press conference Nasa had called to discuss the science activities the astronauts performed during their time in space, Williams and Wilmore gave diplomatic answers to questions designed to elicit their thoughts.</p> 
<p>“The stuck and marooned narrative … yes, we heard about that,” Wilmore said, before reverting to a carefully worded explanation of how their training and preparations allowed them to pivot seamlessly from the roles of new spacecraft test pilots to routine ISS crew members who splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico on 18 March on a routine crew rotation flight.</p> 
<p>“The plan went way off for what we had planned. But because we’re in human spaceflight, we prepare for any number of contingencies. This is a curvy road. You never know where it’s going to go,” he continued.</p> 
<p>Earlier, in the Fox interview, he pushed back on Musk’s false claim, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113909188940119917">amplified by Trump</a>, that the astronauts were “abandoned in space by the Biden administration”. Had they felt stuck, stranded or marooned, the interviewer, Bill Hemmer, wondered.</p> 
<p>“Any of those adjectives, they’re very broad in their definition,” Wilmore said.</p> 
<p>“So in certain respects we were stuck, in certain respects, maybe we were stranded, but based on how they were couching this, that we were left and forgotten in orbit, we were nowhere near any of that at all.</p> 
<p>“Stuck? OK, we didn’t get to come home the way we planned. But in the big scheme of things, we weren’t stuck. We planned and trained. Let me comment back on this other [claim], you know, ‘They failed you’. Who? Who’s they?”</p> 
<p>Williams, too, was reluctant to kick the political football. In orbit, she said, her focus was solely on the work she needed to do.</p> 
<p>“You sort of get maybe a little bit tunnel-visioned … you do your job type of thing, right, and so you’re not really aware of what else is going on down there,” she said.</p> 
<p>“I hate to say that maybe the world doesn’t revolve around us, but we revolve around the world, something like that. But I think we were just really focused on what we were doing and trying to be part of the team. Of course, we heard some things … ”</p> 
<p>The third US astronaut at the press conference, Crew 9 commander Nick Hague, who returned to Earth with Williams and Wilmore, backed up his crewmate.</p> 
<p>“The politics, kind of, they don’t make it up there when we’re trying to make operational decisions,” he said. “As the commander [I’m] responsible for the safety of this crew and getting them back safely.”</p> 
<p>Musk, the founder of SpaceX, a key Nasa contractor, has continued to push the story, <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/the-facts-behind-the-delayed-return-of-u-s-astronauts/">with no evidence</a>, that the astronauts were effectively held hostage in space by Biden for political advantage. It was a SpaceX Dragon capsule that eventually brought them back to Earth, but it was a spacecraft that had been attached to the ISS for months, not one Trump said he directed Musk to “go get the two brave astronauts”.</p> 
<p>The billionaire became embroiled in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/21/elon-musk-butch-wilmore-suni-williams-nasa-astronaut-iss-claims-biden">heated online dispute</a> with Danish astronaut Andreas Mogensen over the claims, and later attacked Mark and Scott Kelly, both retired astronauts and the former now Democratic senator for Arizona, for calling him out.</p> 
<p>As for the troubled Starliner, whose future is questionable as Boeing and Nasa engineers continue to evaluate the helium leaks and thruster control issues that brought its maiden crewed mission to a premature end, both Williams and Wilmore said they would be happy to fly on it again.</p> 
<p>Wilmore, as the Starliner mission commander, said there were questions he wished he’d asked during the flight that he believed might have brought a different outcome, and “some shortcomings in tests, shortcomings in preparation, that we did not foresee”. The astronauts will meet Boeing leadership on Wednesday to give first-hand testimony.</p> 
<p>The whole experience, he said, was a learning curve familiar to those in “the difficult job we all take part in”.</p> 
<p>“Could you point fingers? I don’t want to point fingers. I hope nobody wants to point fingers. We don’t want to look back and say, ‘shame, shame, shame’. We want to look forward and say, ‘Let’s make the future even more productive and better’.</p> 
<p>“That’s the way that I look at it. And what I think the way the nation should look at.”</p>
