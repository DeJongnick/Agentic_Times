<p>Renewable energy accounted for more than 30% of the world’s electricity for the first time last year following a rapid rise in wind and solar power, according to new figures.</p> <p>A report on the global power system has found that the world may be on the brink of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/30/climate-scientists-hail-2023-as-beginning-of-the-end-for-fossil-fuel-era">driving down fossil fuel generation</a>, even as overall demand for electricity continues to rise.</p> <p>Clean electricity has already helped to slow the growth in fossil fuels by almost two-thirds in the past 10 years, according to the report by climate thinktank Ember. It found that renewables have grown from 19% of electricity in 2000 to more than 30% of global electricity last year.</p> <p>“The renewables future has arrived,” said Dave Jones, Ember’s director of global insights. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/solarpower">Solar</a>, in particular, is accelerating faster than anyone thought possible.”</p> <p>Solar was the main supplier of electricity growth, according to Ember, adding more than twice as much new electricity generation as coal in 2023.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/05/renewablesmix-zip/giv-13425Je5iYAmUiECU/" data-alt="Chart showing annual percentage share of global renewable electricity generation since 2000 in three categories: wind and solar; hydro; and other renewables."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/05/renewablesmix-zip/giv-13425Je5iYAmUiECU/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>It was the fastest-growing source of electricity for the 19th consecutive year, and also became the largest source of new electricity for the second year running, after surpassing wind power.</p> <p>The first comprehensive review of global electricity data covers 80 countries, which represent 92% of the world’s electricity demand, as well as historic data for 215 countries.</p> <p>The surge in clean electricity is expected to power a 2% decrease in global fossil fuel generation in the year ahead, according to Ember.</p> <p>“The decline of power sector emissions is now inevitable,” said Jones. “2023 was likely the pivot point – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/oct/05/global-carbon-emissions-electricity-peak-thinktank-report">peak emissions in the power sector</a> – a major turning point in the history of energy. But the pace of emissions falls depends on how fast the renewables revolution continues.”</p> <p>Although fossil fuel use in the world’s electricity system may begin to fall, it continues to play an outsized role in global energy – in transport fuels, heavy industry and heating.</p> <p>A separate study by the Energy Institute found last year that fossil fuels including oil, gas and coal made up 82% of the world’s primary energy.</p> <p>World leaders are aiming to grow renewables to 60% of global electricity by 2030 under an agreement struck at the UN’s Cop28 climate change conference in December.</p> <p>This would require countries to triple their current renewable electricity capacity in the next six years, which would almost halve power sector emissions.</p>
