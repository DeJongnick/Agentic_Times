<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2024-01-25T11:00:46Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p>After what feels like a million years of January, it is finally the last Thursday of the month. You’ve nearly made it to February. Well done. Why not celebrate with 15 questions of varying degrees of topicality, difficulty and sheer bloody-minded obscurity? There are no prizes, it is just for fun. Let us know in the comments how you got on, and whether you spotted any sly references to Doctor Who, which could earn you bonus points.</p>

    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:A - Musician Ashley Beauchamp shared the conversation on social media, with the chatbot replying to one message: “Fuck yeah! I’ll do my best to be as helpful as possible, even if it means swearing.”, 2:C - Traditional poppadoms are zero-rated as they are deemed to be a restaurant food or one that requires further preparation rather than a packaged snack, but the tribunal decided that didn't apply. The Thursday quiz feels quite peckish now., 3:B - They also added another extra man for no readily apparent reason. The event will be held in Baku, 11–24 November 2024., 4:B - Buchanan was creator and presenter of CITV's Art Attack from 1990 until 2007, was in a heavy metal band called Marseille, and to the best of the Thursday quiz's knowledge, has never done a news report about universal credit. BBC social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan may have opinions about the furore., 5:C - Hasbro, which acquired Peppa Pig’s owner for £3.3bn in 2019, has struck a deal with the Lego Group and the theme park group Merlin Entertainments. So it wasn't technically Peppa Pig who inked – or OINKED – the deal, ho ho ho., 6:A - The dog was taken in by the Greenacres Rescue charity, near Haverfordwest, and has been cared for by a foster family. She was named after the character from Disney’s film The Little Mermaid because her partly fused extra back legs were said to resemble a mermaid’s tail. Awwwwww., 7:C - YMMV, but according to Forbes, the 52-week gold price high is $2,121 for an ounce, while the 52-week gold price low is $1,982 for an ounce. Forbes, regrettably, do not give the price of gold in ancient Sumerian cubits. Mark Gatiss played Gold in the audio version of Sapphire and Steel. And yes, this is a new regular science-lite round so why not re-watch some Sapphire &amp; Steel to work out which "elements" are coming up next., 8:D - Not to be confused with the lead singer of U2, Brno is the second biggest city with a population of nearly 400,000 people, compared to Prague's near 1.35 million folks. Košice, of course, is Slovakia's second city behind the lovely capital Bratislava., 9:B - Guinea, Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea are all present and correct. In fact Guinea-Bissau and Equatorial Guinea played each other in Group A already, with Equatorial Guinea running out 4-2 winners, and Equatorial Guinea and Guinea will face each other in the round of 16 on Sunday., 10:C - Apparently if you make a break of 147 you then get a chance to pot a 20 point bonus golden super ball, which, given you've already comprehensively won the frame, seems somewhat superfluous., 11:A - He made Duel for Universal Pictures in 1971., 12:A - Sole traders don't have shares, and an overdraft is a temporary measure. Well done if you picked this option – you've got one point towards your fictitious business studies GCSE., 13:D - Born in 1866 and dying in 1944, he is generally regarded as a pioneer of abstract painting., 14:A - Notoriously unpunctual Madonna is being sued by some fans who had to get up early the next morning. Incidentally the Thursday quiz saw Depeche Mode on Monday and it was great and the Thursday quiz is going again on Saturday., 15:C - Fair fa’ your honest, sonsie face, Great Chieftain o’ the Puddin-race! The Thursday quiz is going all in for a dirty fries with haggis, jalapeños and peppercorn sauce combo tonight, famously a traditional dish in Drumnadrochit in the 18th century.</p>
