I’m glad they are listening. It could go some way to help disabled people stay in the jobs they have, and helps take the pressure of those who were most anxious about the potential impact of the reforms on their lives.</p> <p>However, legislating inequality into our benefits system is not the way to solve this. It will condemn younger disabled people, and those yet to become disabled, to lives of worsening health and needless hardship. The support that disabled people receive is, at best, limited. The ‘concessions’ look more like an attempt to sort a political problem, rather than a serious review of how best to support disabled people and those with long term health issues in their lives and at work. The support you get should depend on need, not when you applied for it. </p> <p>The changes do not tackle the eligibility issues that are at the heart of many of the problems with PIP.</p> <p>The bill should be scrapped and we should start again and put the needs of disabled people at the centre of the process.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685ec2a98f087443bddc70ad" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T16:12:26.559Z">5.12pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Amanda Akass</strong> from Sky News <a href="https://x.com/amandaakass/status/1938494953195450623">says</a> Labour MPs planning to rebel on the welfare bill next week have set up their own WhatsApp group.

He got good access to the PM for the biography he published last year and <a href="https://observer.co.uk/news/politics/article/keir-starmers-deep-regret-over-island-of-strangers-speech">his new interview for the Observer </a>is definitely worth a read.</p> <p>The main news line is probably what Starmer said about his “island of strangers” comment in an immigration speech earlier this year being a mistake. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/jun/27/welfare-bill-cuts-labour-conservatives-keir-starmer-uk-politics-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-685e82188f080e7749712466#block-685e82188f080e7749712466">12.40pm</a>.) Starmer hinted at this in<a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2025/06/what-keir-starmer-cant-say"> an interview with the New Statesman’s Tom McTague </a>recently, but Baldwin got him to admit that it was a big error. Starmer said he was distracted by the arson attack on his home that had just happened, and that as a result he should have “held [the speech] up to the light a bit more” before he delivered it. </p> <p>Starmer also told Baldwin that there were “problems with the language” in his foreword to the immigration white paper published the same day. In the document Starmer said the damage done to the UK by net migration soaring under the Tories<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/may/12/immigration-keir-starmer-labour-reform-visa-foreign-workers-uk-politics-latest-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-6821c37c8f0842af8205cbc2#block-6821c37c8f0842af8205cbc2"> had been “incalculable”</a>. (The document reads as if what he was trying to say was that it was just the damage done to political trust by high migration that was incalculable, but that is not what he said; in the Observer, Starmer does not elaborate on what exactly the “problems” were.)</p> <p>When Sky’s Beth Rigby asked Starmer recently what his biggest mistake was in his first year in office, all she got was the admission that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/keir-starmer-accidentally-admits-his-first-year-has-been-a-failure-b2774402.html">he should have communicated what he was doing better.</a> Speaking to Baldwin, Starmer was forthcoming about other errors too.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Starmer said that what became known as his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0l876r62reo">“things can only get worse” speech</a> in Downing Street last summer was a mistake</strong>. It “squeezed the hope out”, Starmer said. “We were so determined to show how bad it was that we forgot people wanted something to look forward to as well.”</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said he was to blame to appointing Sue Gray as chief of staff. </strong>He said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Not everyone thought it was a good idea when I appointed her. It was my call, my judg﻿ment, my decision, and I got that wrong. Sue wasn’t the right person for this job.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>He said his response to the controversy about accepting clothes donations was not as good as it might have been because his wife was implicated, and he was angry about how she was being attacked. </strong>This clouded his judgment, he suggested.</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Part of the problem is that I got emotionally involved. One thing I’m reasonably good at usually is staying calm. But when they dragged Vic into it through no fault of her own, that made me angry.</p> </blockquote> <p>There was another interesting line about Reform UK.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Starmer defended treating Reform UK, not the Tories, as the main opposition, saying Labour needed to start fighting Nigel Farage’s party now.</strong> He said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If we’re going to have a battle with Reform – a battle for the heart and soul of the country – we’re better off having it now. If we’re to win that battle, we have to be the progressives fighting against the populists of Reform – yes﻿, Labour has to be a progressive political party.</p> </blockquote> <p>For many people, though, the most memorable passage may be where Baldwin describes Starmer going to Leeds after his brother died on Boxing Day last year to clear out his house. Starmer had always been protective of his brother, who had learning difficulties, and this was a job he did not want to delegate to anyone else. <strong>Baldwin</strong> writes:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Starmer asked his armed police bodyguards to wait behind and opened the glass-fronted door. Once inside, he filled black bin liners with rotten food from the fridge and dirty clothes from the floor. Then the prime minister got to work cleaning the bathroom and toilet …</p> <p>Couldn’t he just have got cleaners to sort the house out?</p> <p>“No,” he says, “I didn’t want anyone else there. He was my brother – I didn’t want to let him down.”</p> <p>Nick “hadn’t kept the place very clean”, explains Starmer, suddenly gulping for words before describing how “I was putting what he’d left of his life in a bag”. The prime minister forces himself back into his more familiar and less expressive form before continuing. “But – but – there you go, I suppose.”</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-27T15:45:48.750Z">at 4.45pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-685eadcc8f08ac61dea2f442" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T14:52:03.044Z">3.52pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Starmer describes welfare bill concessions as 'common sense' - while dodging question about how they will be funded</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> has described the compromise welfare bill proposals announced overnight as “common sense” and as striking “the right balance”.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters on a visit, he said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It’s very important that we reform the welfare system, because it doesn’t work and it traps people, and therefore we’re going to press ahead with the reforms.

Some Pip claimants are working. Starmer, though, believes Pip incentivises people not to find work.</p> <p>Asked how the government would pay for the concessions, which will cost about £3bn a year, Starmer replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The funding will be set out in the budget in the usual way, as you’d expect later in the year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685ea9318f08ac61dea2f411" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/geneva-abdul"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T14:31:59.330Z">3.31pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">International development committee says supplying F-35 components for Israel may contravene international law</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Geneva Abdul is a Guardian reporter.</em></p> <p>The UK’s exemption of F-35 components from suspended arms exports to Israel may be incompatible with international law, the chair of the international development committee has warned.</p> <p>In <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/48537/documents/254255/default/">a letter</a> to business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, committee chair <strong>Sarah Champion</strong> raised questions over the government’s contentious decision to exempt parts for F-35 jets to Israel, and whether the carve out decided in September 2024 is compatible with the Arms Trade Treaty, the Genocide Convention and the Geneva Conventions.</p> <p>The letter comes after MPs, lawyers and human rights organisations have for months argued against the continued exports which they describe as a serious violation of humanitarian law. In September, the government suspended 30 arms export licenses, but carved out the supply of components for F-35 jets, warning an embargo could disrupt the global programme and Nato’s peace and security. </p> <p>The UK government, which faces court action over the decision, has justified the continued export of components on reasons of international peace and security. The government has also acknowledged, in court documents, that the supply of F-35 components for potential use in Israel is in breach of its own arms export control laws. Britain supplies 15% of the value of the F-35 jet, mainly through BAE systems.</p> <p>Champion said in her letter:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>If there is the ‘potential’ for an ‘overriding’ risk of serious violations of IHL/IHRL [international humanitarian law/international human rights law], then the UK must not authorise the export.</p> <p>In circumstances where there are prolonged blockades of humanitarian aid including food, water and medicine, as well as evidence indicating the mistreatment of detainees by Israel, there are clearly risks of serious violations of the right to life, health, food security, and the prohibitions on cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and torture. The clear risks of serious IHL and IHRL violations are undisputable.</p> </blockquote> <p>Concerns from the international development committee come days after the UK announced the expansion of its nuclear deterrent by buying 12 F-35A jets, which are capable of carrying conventional munitions and also the US B61-12 gravity bomb. </p> <p>The letter also asks the government several questions including whether the government accepts it has knowledge that Israel is committing internationally wrongful acts and that the export of F-35 components is aiding or assisting these wrongful acts.</p> <p>The government was asked to respond by 11 July. </p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-27T14:52:55.159Z">at 3.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-685ea7978f08ac61dea2f3df" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T14:21:42.675Z">3.21pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here are some pictures from Kemi Badenoch’s visit to Carver Barracks in Essex today.</p>           </div>   </div> <div id="block-685ea63d8f087443bddc6e99" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T14:14:33.656Z">3.14pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Badenoch says welfare U-turn shows Labour 'no longer in control', and bill now 'worst of all worlds'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Kemi Badenoch</strong> has described the welfare bill as “the worst of all worlds” in the light of the concessions announced overnight.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters on a visit to Carver Barracks in Essex, she said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I think we’re seeing a government that is floundering, a government that is no longer in control despite having a huge majority.</p> <p>I don’t see how they’re going to be able to deliver any of the things they promised if they can’t do something as basic as reducing an increase in spending.”</p> <p>It’s a real shame because what they’re doing now with this U-turn is creating a two-tier system … this is the worst of all worlds.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685e96728f08ac61dea2f2b4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T13:25:43.425Z">2.25pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">No 10 should not assume Labour revolt over welfare bill is over, Diane Abbott says</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Diane Abbott</strong>, the veteran Labour leftwinger and longest-serving female MP (“mother of the House), has said that No 10 would be wrong to assume the rebellion against the welfare bill is over.

Some people are feeling quite reassured by what’s been coming out since last night …</p> <p>But many of us still feel that it’s not OK – particularly around the Pip four points scoring criteria, saying that existing claimants will still get it, but new ones may not. </p> <p>There’s a worry there that we’ll create a two-tier system.</p> <p>And it’s looking like they’ll still be billions of pounds of brutal cuts. </p> <p>So it’s just too quick for MPs to be able to understand how these concessions will really work. And I think we should still be pressing pause and looking at this again.</p> </blockquote> <p>Eccles did not offer a firm prediction for how many MPs would vote against the bill. Asked how many backbenchers were, like her, still opposed to the bill, she replied:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>I know some, 50 or 60 that I’m aware of, but I think there’s a whole bunch of people that we’re not aware of who are feeling uncomfortable. We may not know what they will do until Tuesday evening.</p> </blockquote> <p>When it was put to her that the vote could be “really very tight indeed”, she replied: “Yes, I think so.”</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-685e8a858f08ac61dea2f211" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T12:26:00.703Z">1.26pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK and France expected to announce one-in, one-out returns agreement for small boat migrants, reports say</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The UK and France are reportedly expected to announce a one-in, one-out migrant returns deal to crack down on English Channel crossings, PA Media reports.

In <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/cec421ce-7b5b-4d65-a303-21f6351148dd">a recent article</a> for the Sunday Times defending the plan, <strong>John Dalhuisen</strong>, a fellow at the thinktank, argued that this plan would solve the small boats crisis. He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>From an agreed day onwards, the UK would agree with a group of EU countries, ideally including both France and Germany, to swiftly return almost all migrants who arrive irregularly across the Channel. This would reduce crossings to zero within a few weeks. As soon as it became clear that there was no prospect of success, the incentive to undertake a dangerous, costly journey would evaporate. After a few weeks, therefore, the number of transfers back to participating states would also fall to zero …</p> <p>But what’s in it for a Macron [French president Emmanuel Macron], or a Merz [German chancellor Friedrich Merz]? Ultimately, something similar. Mainstream parties in Europe are leaching support to populists promising much more radical solutions to irregular migration. Right now, they have no policies of their own that credibly offer control. Nor are uglier ones that they are already endorsing (pushbacks at external borders from Greece to Poland, and deals with Tunisia and Libya to intercept boats and take them back before they even get there) working particularly well.</p> <p>This deal offers the outline of such a policy. Western European countries have every interest in showing their voters that migration <em>can </em>be controlled lawfully and humanely through safe third-country agreements.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685e85668f08ac61dea2f1c3" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T12:03:31.759Z">1.03pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Disability rights campaigners urge Labour MPs to keep fighting 'impending disaster' welfare bill</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Mencap</strong>, the learning disability charity, issued a statement overnight welcoming the government’s U-turn on the welfare bill.

By pushing the cuts onto future claimants, the government are betraying the next generation of disabled people. Why should someone who needs support to wash in 2025 be entitled to Pip, but not someone who has the same needs in 2035? </p> <p>If the bill passes in its revised form, it will still push more people into poverty and worsen people’s health. We urge MPs to use their power to stop this impending disaster. The bill must be stopped in its tracks.</p> </blockquote> <p>Tim Nicholls, assistant director of policy, research and strategy at the <strong>National Autistic Society</strong>, said: “</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It should not have taken this much pressure to get the government to listen and step back from some of their damaging proposals. Today’s announcement will address some of the fear many autistic people who currently receive Pip felt about losing vital support that makes their daily life more manageable. But autistic people who might need Pip in the future, like autistic children who will become autistic adults, will still be fearful about where they fit in this two-tier system …</p> <p>The government should do the right thing: hit ‘pause'’ on these changes and let disabled people have a meaningful say on the future of disability benefits. We won’t stop campaigning until the benefits system truly works for autistic people.</p> </blockquote> <p>And Helen Walker, chief executive at<strong> Carers UK</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The government has agreed to protect existing claimants on PIP. This will be a huge relief for unpaid carers whose income via carer’s allowance is reliant on the person they care for receiving a relevant disability benefit such as the daily living component of Pip. Many have increased costs and face significant financial challenges because of their caring roles.</p> <p>It’s important that the government has listened and made changes, but we remain deeply concerned about future carers. Around 12,000 people become an unpaid carer every day in the UK. The bill as it stands will still include the new four-point rule for Pip and doesn’t change the fact that many new claimants will lose out – it still represents a reduction in financial support and a bleak outlook for future carers who won’t be entitled.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685e84c98f080e7749712496" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T12:03:27.291Z">1.03pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Earlier the agenda said that Keir Starmer would be speaking at the Welsh Labour conference this morning.

This creates a large difference in treatment depending on the timing of disability onset. Take two people who develop the exact same health problems, but one develops them just early enough (before November 2026) to qualify as an ‘existing claimant’ and one just too late. The first is assessed for Pip and UC health element under the current rules and receives £8,930 in total – £3,850 from Pip and £5,080 from UC health element. The second is assessed under the new rules – because of the tighter criteria they do not qualify for Pip, and they receive the new lower UC health element, which after the freeze will be worth £2,370 (in today’s prices). If the government goes ahead with its proposed plans to scrap the work capability assessment, the second claimant would receive no specific support for health conditions at all. These differences would persist indefinitely, in some cases for many years.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Tom Waters</strong>, an associate director at the IFS, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This [policy] will create big differences – thousands of pounds a year, for many years in some cases – between similar people with similar health conditions who happen to have applied at slightly different times.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685e765a8f08ac61dea2f0b2" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T10:55:14.503Z">11.55am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">What thinktanks say about what welfare bill U-turn will cost</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>The government has refused to say how much its welfare bill U-turn will cost, but the <strong>Institute for Fiscal Studies</strong> and the <strong>Resolution Foundation</strong>, the UK’s two leading public spending thinktanks have both issued statements providing costings. They are both saying the concessions will cost around £3bn a year (although there are some minor differences in the figures they are using).</p> <p>In <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/articles/changes-benefit-reforms-reduce-saving-bill-ps3bn-2029-30-create-huge-difference-support">its analysis</a>, the IFS says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The initial benefit reforms would have saved the government £5.5bn by 2029–30. The revised package of reforms will save only £2.5bn, so will cost the government £3.0bn relative to its previous plans.</p> <p>-The first change is to not apply the new, tighter assessment for existing claimants of personal independence payment (Pip) at the point of being reassessed. This is set to affect 370,000 current claimants in 2029–30, benefiting them to the tune of around £4,150 per year on average (in today’s prices). It will also indirectly benefit around 50,000 claimants of carer’s allowance who look after a Pip claimant, by £4,340 per year.</p> <p>-The second change is to the universal credit (UC) health element, paid to those who have a condition that prevents them working. The previous plan had been to freeze this element for existing claimants and roughly halve, then freeze, it for most new claimants. The precise detail here is slightly ambiguous, but the new policy seems to be to no longer freeze the element for existing claimants (the halving and freezing for new claimants will continue). This will benefit 2.2 million claimants of the benefit in 2029–30 by £450 per year. Some will gain from both this and the Pip policy.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/press-releases/welfare-concessions-will-prevent-current-claimants-from-suffering-income-losses-at-a-cost-of-up-to-3-2-billion-by-the-end-of-the-parliament/">its analysis</a>, the RF says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>These changes are welcome, but could cost between £2.6bn and £3.2bn a year in 2029-30 – making it even tougher for the Chancellor to meet her fiscal rules this autumn ….</p> <p>The key change is that current Pip claimants will no longer lose support, even if they do not qualify for support under the new criteria (scoring at least four points in any single heading for the daily living component of the PIP test). Around 370,000 claimants are expected to have £4,500 protected, on average. This protection also has knock-on effects for their carers, who will continue to receive carers’ allowance. Taken together, this protection comes at a cost of £2.1bn in 2029-30.</p> <p>The government has said existing recipients of the health element of UC will see support protected in real terms. This will insulate 2.25 million people from a loss of between £250 and £500 per year, and will cost between £540m and £1.1bn, depending on how it is implemented.</p> <p>Overall, the changes announced today will cost between £2.6bn and £3.2bn in 2029-30 – reducing the gross savings from the original proposals from £8.1bn to as little as £4.9bn.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-685e6d948f08ac61dea2f024" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-27T10:30:26.714Z">11.30am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Disability rights campaigners say they remain opposed to welfare bill, claiming U-turn creates 'two-tier system'</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Ministers seem to have failed to win over disability rights campaigners with the U-turn announced overnight.</p> <p>Although Mencap, the learning disability charity, issued a relatively supportive comment about the changes agreed late yesterday, most the the disability charities or campaign groups commenting today have said they remain opposed to the bill.</p> <p>James Taylor, director of strategy at disability equality charity <strong>Scope</strong>, said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>It is encouraging that the government is starting to listen to disabled people and MPs who have been campaigning for change for months.

But Labour has lurched from a bad plan to a next-to-nothing plan.</p> <p>The latest ‘deal’ with Labour rebels sounds a lot like a two-tier benefits system, more likely to encourage anyone already on benefits to stay there rather than get into work.</p> <p>We made a serious offer to Keir Starmer in the national interest if he was willing to grip the challenge of getting the welfare bill down and more people into work - making savings to avoid putting up taxes. But instead, he’s done yet another U-turn.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>10.05am:</em> Keir Starmer is expected to speak at the Welsh Labour conference in Llandudno.</p> <p><em>Morning:</em> Kemi Badenoch is on a visit in Essex.</p> <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> <p>If you want to contact me, please post a message below the line when comments are open (normally between 10am and 3pm at the moment), or message me on social media.
