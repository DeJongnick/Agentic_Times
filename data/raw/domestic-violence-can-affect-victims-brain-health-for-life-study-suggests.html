<p>Women who are victims of domestic violence are at a higher risk of traumatic brain injury and mental health conditions for many years after the abuse has ended, a study has found.</p> <p>Almost one in three women around the world experience domestic violence, and researchers say the impact on mental health – such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – can last for decades.</p> <p>The study, by the University of Glasgow and published in the journal BMJ Mental Health, explored the mental health consequences associated with domestic violence and traumatic brain injury.</p> <p>The paper – Intimate partner violence, traumatic brain injury and long-term mental health outcomes in mid-life: The Drake IPV study – looked at data from 632 participants aged between 40 and 59.</p> <p>Fourteen per cent reported having a history of domestic violence with physical abuse.</p> <p>Compared with unexposed participants, those with a history of intimate partner violence-physical abuse (IPV-PA) were associated with a higher exposure of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and a higher lifetime and ongoing diagnoses of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders andPTSD.</p> <p>The analysis also found that even after an average of 27 years since exposure to IPV-PA, the risk of mental health disorders remained just as high.</p> <p>The study concluded: “Among those reporting exposure to IPV-PA, the majority reported a history of repetitive blows to the head and mild TBI. A history of TBI, in turn, was associated with evidence of adverse mental health outcomes.</p> <p>“These observations offer initial insights into the potential lifelong brain health consequences of intimate partner violence with physical abuse.</p> <p>“Given the global prevalence of intimate partner violence, particularly among women, these findings highlight a pressing need for further research in this field, as well as for targeted interventions to raise awareness among policymakers and medical professionals about the potential impact of intimate partner violence with physical abuse on health outcomes across the lifespan.”</p> <p>The work was funded by the Drake Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Medical Research Council, NHS Research Scotland, the Alzheimer’s Society, and the Alzheimer’s Association.</p> <p>Prof Willie Stewart said: “Given its prevalence, these findings highlight domestic violence as a public health issue with potential for long-lasting impacts on brain health. Our work also reinforces the need for more research in this previously neglected area.”</p> <p>Dr Graciela Muniz-Terrera, a co-author of the report, said: “This study highlights the importance of including questions about domestic violence in population research to advance our knowledge about its long-term effects.”</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK, call the <a href="https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/">national domestic abuse helpline</a> on 0808 2000 247, or visit <a href="http://womansaid.co.uk/">Women’s Aid</a>.
