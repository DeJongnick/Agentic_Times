<p>Sky Sports will broadcast every match from the opening rounds of the Championship, League One and League Two live next season, with most kicking off at 3pm on Saturday. The EFL starts a fortnight before the Premier League so the blackout at that time is not in place. </p> <p>The EFL has introduced a split start, with League One and Two kicking off on 1 August and the Championship seven days later.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/25/qpr-appoint-julien-stephan-head-coach-cifuentes-exit">‘Proud and excited’: QPR appoint Julien Stéphan as head coach after Cifuentes exit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the second weekend five games from League One and League Two will be televised.
