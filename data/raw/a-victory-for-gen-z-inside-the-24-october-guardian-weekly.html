It is a story that, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carolinedavies">Caroline Davies</a> reports, the royal family dearly want to draw a line under but one that has continued to make headlines as further details of Andrew’s behaviour and lifestyle are revealed.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM53X">Get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home address</a></strong></p> <p>***</p> <h2>Five essential reads in this week’s edition</h2> <p><em><strong>Spotlight</strong></em><strong> | A far-right fight club on their hands<br></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/ben-makuch">Ben Makuch</a> reports on security service monitoring of ‘active clubs’ as they move across borders to spread extremism, mixing the behaviour of football hooligans with the ideology of the Third Reich</p>    <p><em><strong>Spotlight</strong></em><strong> | Nothing to see here?<br></strong>Due to open within weeks,<strong> </strong>Nigeria’s Museum of West African art is intended to showcase the Benin bronzes and other masterpieces stolen by 19th-century colonisers.
