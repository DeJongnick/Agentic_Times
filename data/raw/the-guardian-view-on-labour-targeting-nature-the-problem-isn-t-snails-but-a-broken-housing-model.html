<h1>The Guardian view on Labour targeting nature: the problem isn’t snails, but a broken housing model</h1>

<p>It began with gastropods. Last Tuesday, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/07/rachel-reeves-clears-planning-blockage-amid-good-relationship-with-developer">told</a> a conference of tech executives that she’d intervened to help a developer build about 20,000 homes in north Sussex that had been held up, she said, by “some snails … a protected species or something”. She added that they “are microscopic … you cannot even see” them.</p> <p>No one could miss the direction the chancellor was headed in. The snail in question, the lesser whirlpool ramshorn, is one of Britain’s rarest freshwater creatures, found in only a handful of locations and highly sensitive to sewage <a href="https://naturebftb.co.uk/projects/little-whirpool-ramshorn-snail/">pollution</a>. But Ms Reeves portrayed it as a bureaucratic nuisance. She then bragged that she’d fixed it – after a friendly developer gave her a call. It’s a bad look for a Labour politician, let alone the chancellor, to boast that green rules can be bent for chums.</p> <p>The scheme was given the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/thousands-of-new-homes-get-the-go-ahead-in-north-sussex">go-ahead</a> a day before <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/drought-declared-in-parts-of-sussex-by-environment-agency">drought</a> was declared in Sussex, potentially giving water companies cover to breach their licence obligations – including measures meant to protect the snails. Ms Reeves won’t like being compared to Liz Truss, but the analogy works. Three years ago, Ms Truss <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/oct/05/liz-truss-anti-growth-coalition-close-fractious-tory-party-conference">railed</a> against an “anti-growth coalition” of environmentalists, lawyers and regulators who, she claimed, were blocking Britain’s path to prosperity. Ms Reeves is framing the issue the same way: growth is the priority, nature the obstacle.</p> <p>But the public don’t agree. Luke Tryl of More in Common told a Conservative conference fringe meeting that most Britons can’t be categorised as “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3l9jdy2q1o">nimby</a>” or “<a href="https://labouryimby.org.uk/">yimby</a>”. They want both: to build and also to protect the countryside. However, when asked whether wildlife should be protected even if it delays or raises the cost of infrastructure, every single voter group – including Labour, Conservative and Reform UK – chose wildlife. Among the general public, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stillwatersrandeep.bsky.social/post/3m2rpkfcwls22">62% prioritised nature protection while 18%</a> sided with building at any cost.</p> <p>The Treasury <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/rachel-reeves-strip-back-environmental-protections-planning-projects-xjxn02crs">reportedly</a> plans to gut green rules with amendments to its planning and infrastructure bill – ditching the precautionary principle, <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/uk/politics/rachel-reeves-planning-infrastructure-bill-hs2-b2809277.html">slashing</a> species protections and curbing <a href="https://www.planningresource.co.uk/article/1929190/government-tear-habitats-regulations-part-new-planning-bill">legal</a> challenges. The bill, currently in the <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3946">Lords</a>, already allows developers to bypass environmental obligations by paying into a fund to offset damage elsewhere. Under its “environmental delivery plans”, ministers could <a href="https://cieem.net/i-am/influencing-policy/planning-and-infrastructure-bill/">disapply</a> environmental protections in exchange for vague promises of ecological improvement within 10 years.</p> <p>Labour, significantly, is turning its back on the work of the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/602e92b2e90e07660f807b47/The_Economics_of_Biodiversity_The_Dasgupta_Review_Full_Report.pdf">Dasgupta review</a>. This argues that nature is not a constraint on growth but its foundation, a form of capital on which the economy depends. Labour is not only rejecting that view but deluding itself by claiming housebuilding will be accelerated by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-clears-path-to-get-britain-building">dismissing concerns</a> around conservation. The <a href="https://www.hertswildlifetrust.org.uk/blog/thewildlifetrusts/myth-busting-bats-newts-and-economy-vs-nature-protections">Wildlife Trusts</a> points out that more than a million homes already have planning permission since 2015, but remain unbuilt. The real barriers to housebuilding are skills shortages, <a href="https://ippr-org.files.svdcdn.com/production/Downloads/Strategic_planning_for_green_prosperity_Feb25.pdf?dm=1738854346">hoarded</a> land and slow delivery. They need sorting out. Blaming snails, it would seem, is easier.</p> <p>Many of Labour’s <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/53137-how-do-britons-see-the-main-political-parties-autumn-2025">younger voters</a> are already <a href="https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/uncategorized/looking-for-labours-lost-voters/">tempted</a> by the Green party, which combines environmentalism and leftwing economics. Now, by mocking green protections and cosying up to developers, the chancellor is giving these voters more reasons to jump ship. The problem isn’t the <a href="https://www.ippr.org/media-office/revealed-1-4-million-homes-left-unbuilt-by-developers-since-2007">planning system</a>. It’s a broken, profit-driven housing model that banks land and starves supply. Scrapping nature protections won’t build <a href="https://fullfact.org/government-tracker/1-5-million-homes/">1.5m homes</a>, it will just bulldoze public trust and the countryside.</p>
