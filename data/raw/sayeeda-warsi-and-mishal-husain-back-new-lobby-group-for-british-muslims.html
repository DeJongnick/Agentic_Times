<p>Prominent British Muslims in politics, media, business and sport have come together to influence government policy on behalf of 4 million British Muslims.</p> <p>The minister for faith Wajid Khan, the Tory MP and deputy speaker Nusrat Ghani, the former Conservative party chair Sayeeda Warsi, the broadcaster Mishal Husain, the ex-England cricketer Azeem Rafiq and the anti-racism group Hope Not Hate are backing the newly formed British Muslim Network (BMN).</p> <p>The Muslim Council of Britain has been the main representative body for Muslims for about 30 years, but successive governments have had a policy of <a href="https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2024-02-26/15545/">“non-engagement”</a> with the MCB dating back over a decade.</p>    <p>Akeela Ahmed, co-chair of BMN, told the Guardian this meant policies concerning British Muslims were being made without their voices being heard, affecting cohesion, while insisting BMN aimed to “complement” organisations like the MCB, rather than replace them.</p> <p>BMN aims to bring together practitioners and experts to identify challenges British Muslims face to policymakers, in areas including health, education, immigration, equalities and the economy, aligning research with government’s goals, while growing its membership nationwide.</p> <p>It also aims to counter negative attitudes by highlighting contributions made by British Muslims to society, and encourage Muslims to take up positions on boards and vote.</p> <p>The establishment of BMN marks a shift towards promoting the interests of the UK’s Muslims as a diverse British social identity, rather than purely as a faith group, and comes after a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2025/feb/19/uk-islamophobic-assaults-surged-by-73-in-2024-anti-hate-charity-reports"> surge in Islamophobic incidents, revealed by charity Tell Mama</a>.</p> <p>Co-chair Qari Asim, one of the UK’s most prominent imams, said BMN’s mission went beyond tackling anti-Muslim prejudice, and that it was “not being set up just to be a conduit to talk to the government,” but would link “activists, strategists, professionals and policymakers for the benefit of British society.”</p> <p>Ahmed said: “There’s a lot of misconceptions and negative attitudes attached to British Muslims … some from particular politicians and their rhetoric.</p> <p>“Of course, there are challenges within the Muslim community, like with any community, like in British society, but some of those challenges have been weaponised, I think, to really paint a very negative picture of British Muslims.</p> <p>“So the British Muslim Network, we’re hoping to overcome some of those negative attitudes, to really put into the public sphere and the public conversation the reality of the lived lives of British Muslims around the UK and that they are overwhelmingly, just like any other person in the UK, just trying to live their lives.</p> <p>“They care about education, they care about employment, they care about health, they care not just about their local communities, but the wider challenges facing the country. We really want to put forward a positive and confident narrative around British Muslims and their role in British society.”</p> <p>The founding of BMN follows months of discussions between leading British Muslims, amid concerns of a “growing sense of alienation,” a spokesperson said.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of BMN’s launch event, Sayeeda Warsi, the peer who was the first Muslim woman to serve in cabinet, said: “For too long British Muslims have been made to feel their voices do not matter … The British Muslim Network is part of a much-needed effort to change that.”</p> <p>Nusrat Ghani said British Muslims were “making contributions across the UK and I am pleased to play a role in highlighting that”, while Sunder Katwala, the director of the British Future thinktank, said: “Britain will be a more inclusive country once every institution of power and influence can confidently engage with all parts of society.”</p> <p>The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government has been approached for comment.</p>
