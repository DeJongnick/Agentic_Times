<p>The family of a nurse whose body was found in a river after a three-week search have said she was failed by “systemic neglect and under-resourcing in mental health services”.</p> <p>Victoria Taylor, 34, was described at an inquest as a “devoted mother, a loving fiancee and a fiercely loyal sister”.</p> <p>She went missing from her home in Malton, North Yorkshire, on 30 September last year. Her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/oct/22/body-found-in-search-for-missing-woman-victoria-taylor">body was recovered from the River Derwent</a> on 22 October after an extensive search.</p> <p>The inquest into her death in Northallerton heard that Taylor struggled with alcohol and mental health problems related to a childhood trauma.</p> <p>Coroner Catherine Cundy said the trauma left “an indelible mark” on Taylor’s life “in the form of depression, anxiety and chronic feelings of worthlessness”. Recording a narrative verdict, Cundy said she could not be sure of Taylor’s intentions when she went into the river.</p> <p>In a statement issued afterwards, Taylor’s sister, Emma Worden, said she hoped the inquest would be a turning point. She said: “Vixx was a devoted mother, a loving fiancee and a fiercely loyal sister. She showed up for those she loved with warmth, humour and a deep sense of care.</p> <p>“Her relationships were central to her identity, and she gave everything she had to protect and support the people around her. She also lived with challenges, these were not hidden.</p> <p>“She reached out for help. She made herself visible to services. And yet, time and again, she was failed and left without the support she needed. The failures in her care were not isolated incidents. They were part of a wider pattern of systemic neglect and under-resourcing in mental health services.</p> <p>“Vixx deserved better. She deserved to be seen, heard and supported. Instead, she was left to carry burdens alone. Her death is a tragedy, but it must also be a turning point. Let this inquest be a step toward accountability, learning and change.”</p> <p>During the daylong inquest Worden turned to representatives of Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS foundation trust (TEWV) saying they were going “round in circles”. She said: “Nobody looked her in the eye and said: ‘We will help you,’ and she’s not here now because you failed her.”</p> <p>The coroner said she would be writing to TEWV and a number of other agencies with her concerns over the support Taylor was given.</p> <p>She said she found it “difficult to understand” why community mental health services repeatedly declined to offer Taylor support as her situation deteriorated during 2024.</p> <p>Cundy said she believed this was partly because Taylor was treated as an alcoholic when she was not dependent on alcohol, instead being someone who binged on wine when her emotions relating to her traumatic past overwhelmed her.</p> <p>Elspeth Devanney, the group director for nursing and quality at TEWV, said: “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Victoria’s family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.</p> <p>“Following Victoria’s tragic death, we completed a review and have made changes to improve our services. We will respond to the coroner’s report and take action to continue to improve and provide high-quality care to the people in our communities.”</p> <p>• In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
