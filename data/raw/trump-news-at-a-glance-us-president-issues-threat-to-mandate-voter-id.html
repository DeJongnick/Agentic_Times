<p>Donald Trump has said he will issue an executive order to mandate voter identification at all US elections, with “no exceptions”. </p> <p>“Voter I.D. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!!,” the US president said on Truth Social late on Saturday.</p> <p>Any such move is likely to be challenged in court as unconstitutional.</p> <p>The US constitution <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/news-alerts/trump-says-he-plans-to-issue-unconstitutional-order-requiring-voter-id-and-banning-mail-ballots/">grants</a> primary authority to regulate elections to the US states, while empowering Congress to enact election laws or regulations. It gives no explicit authority to the president to regulate voting.</p> <p>Voter fraud is incredibly rare and voter ID laws have been shown to disproportionately impact minorities, low-income individuals and disabled voters. “As many as 11% of eligible voters do not have the kind of ID that is required by states with strict ID requirements, and that percentage is even higher among seniors, minorities, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students,” the Brennan Center for Justice <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/voter-id">states</a>.</p>  <h2>Trump wants to ban mail-in voting</h2>  <p>The US president also stated he wants to ban all voting by mail except for those who are very ill or in military service.</p> <p>The voting change push by Trump stems from baseless claims that the 2020 election he lost was stolen from him. Earlier this month, Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/18/trump-mail-in-ballots-voting-machines-2016-midterms">falsely claimed</a> only the US uses mail-in voting.
