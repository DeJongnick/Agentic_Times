<p>Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group has criticised the management of Mulberry as it walked away from its attempts to take over the luxury handbag maker after a series of rejected offers.</p> <p>Frasers, which is Mulberry’s second-largest shareholder with a 37% stake, had made several offers for the fashion brand, culminating in a £111m bid this week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/oct/13/mulbery-owner-rejects-increased-bid-from-mike-ashley-frasers-group">all of which have been rebuffed</a>.</p> <p>Mulberry’s largest shareholder, Challice, a group controlled by the Singaporean entrepreneur Christina Ong and her husband, had previously said it had no interest in selling its shares. Challice has a 56% stake, meaning it is able to block any deal.</p> <p>In its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/oct/22/mulberry-rejects-increased-bid-from-mike-ashley-frasers-group-as-untenable">final bid, Frasers</a>, which owns the Sports Direct chain, offered 150p a share on Tuesday. This was rejected by Mulberry’s board.</p> <p>The board said it had unanimously decided the offer was “untenable and that the company should focus its attention on driving the commercial performance of the business”.</p> <p>Walking away from its pursuit of Mulberry on Wednesday, Frasers continued to criticise the management of the luxury handbag maker, saying it remained “concerned about the governance of Mulberry”. In a statement to investors, it added: “Frasers continues to believe that market headwinds, and a clear lack of commercial plan, place the company in a very difficult financial position.”</p> <p>The retail group said it remained a “long-term supporter” of Mulberry, and called on the company to present “a credible plan in the near term”, as it reiterated its request for a seat on Mulberry’s board.</p> <p>Mulberry’s shares were trading more than 6% lower on Wednesday afternoon, but had pared some losses from earlier in the day.</p> <p>Frasers also owns <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/house-fraser">House of Fraser</a> department stores, Evans Cycles and the Flannels luxury streetwear chain. It first made an offer for Mulberry after the handbag maker said it needed to raise cash after a slide in sales led to a £34m pre-tax loss in its last financial year. Mulberry warned that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2024/may/01/mulberry-hit-by-fall-in-sales-as-wealthy-shoppers-slow-spending">spending was slowing among well-off shoppers</a> in the UK and Asia.</p> <p>Its board has previously said the recent appointment of Andrea Baldo as chief executive, along with an emergency £10.75m share placing, had provide the company with a “solid platform to execute a turnaround”.</p> <p>Frasers said it had first made a bid for Mulberry as it would “not accept another Debenhams situation” in which a perfectly viable business was “run into administration”, a reference to the £150m loss it sustained from the collapse of the department store chain where it was a shareholder.</p> <p>Under UK takeover rules, Frasers was required to make a firm offer for Mulberry by 5pm on 28 October or walk away.</p> <p>Frasers is now prevented from making a further offer for the handbag maker for six months unless certain conditions are met, including Mulberry’s board agreeing to such an offer, or if there is a material change in circumstances at the company.</p> <p>Mulberry has been contacted for comment.</p>
