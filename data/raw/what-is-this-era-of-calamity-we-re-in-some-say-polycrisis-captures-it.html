<p>Two months into 2025, the sense of dread is palpable. In the US, the year began with a terrorist attack; then came the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/wildfires">fires</a> that ravaged a city, destroying lives, homes and livelihoods. An extremist billionaire came to power and began proudly dismantling the government with a chainsaw. Once-in-a-century disasters are happening more like once a month, all amid devastating wars and on the heels of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">pandemic</a>.</p> <p>The word “unprecedented” has become ironically routine. It feels like we’re stuck in a relentless cycle of calamity, with no time to recover from one before the next begins.</p> <p>How do we make sense of any of this – let alone all of it, all at once?</p> <p>A number of terms have cropped up in the past decade to help us describe our moment. We’re living in the <a href="https://hadlylab.stanford.edu/anthropocene">anthropocene</a> – the era in which humanity’s impact is comparable to that of geology itself. Or we’re in the “post-truth” era, in which we no longer share the same sense of reality. We’re facing a <a href="https://blog.collinsdictionary.com/language-lovers/a-year-of-permacrisis/">permacrisis</a>, an endless state of catastrophe.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/there-are-no-climate-havens">There were never any climate havens: floods in the midwest, hurricanes in Appalachia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But perhaps the word that best describes this moment is one that emerged at the turn of the millennium, picked up steam in the 2010s and has recently been making the global rounds again: polycrisis.</p> <p>Not to be confused with a “perfect storm” or the perhaps less scientific “clusterfuck”, “polycrisis” – <a href="https://polycrisis.org/lessons/where-did-the-term-polycrisis-come-from/">a term coined</a> by the authors Edgar Morin and Anne Brigitte Kern – refers to the idea that not only are we facing one disaster after another, but those messes are all linked, making things even worse. Or, as Adam Tooze, a Columbia University history professor and public intellectual who has championed the term, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/498398e7-11b1-494b-9cd3-6d669dc3de33">put it</a>: “In the polycrisis the shocks are disparate, but they interact so that the whole is even more overwhelming than the sum of the parts.”</p> <p>Our globalized world is built on interconnecting systems, and when one gets rattled, the others do too – a heating climate, for instance, increases the risk of pandemics, pandemics undermine economies, shaky economies fuel political upheaval. “There’s a kind of larger instability, or a larger system disequilibrium,” the researcher Thomas Homer-Dixon says. To illustrate the situation, Homer-Dixon uses a video of metronomes on a soft surface. Though they’re all started at different times, they end up synchronized, as each device’s beat subtly affects the rest. When people see it for the first time, “they don’t actually see what’s happening properly. They don’t realize the forces that are operating to cause the metronomes to actually synchronize with each other,” Homer-Dixon says.</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5v5eBf2KwF8"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5v5eBf2KwF8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>In much the same way, it’s often unclear even to experts how global systems interact because they are siloed in their disciplines. That limits our ability to confront intersecting problems: the climate crisis forces migration; xenophobia fuels the rise of the far right in receiving countries; far-right governments undermine environmental protections; natural disasters are more destructive. Yet migration experts may not be experts on the climate crisis, and climate experts may have limited knowledge of geopolitics.</p> <p>That’s why Homer-Dixon thinks better communication is essential – not just to create consensus around what we <em>call </em>our current predicament but also how to address it. He runs the Cascade Institute, which is fostering “a community of scholars and experts and scientists and policy makers around the world who are using this concept [of polycrisis] in constructive ways”.</p> <p>“Constructive” is a key word here. “You’ve got to get the diagnosis right before you can go to the prescription,” he says. Finding that diagnosis means looking at how stresses on various systems – climate, geopolitics, transportation, information, etc – intersect and identifying what his team calls “high leverage intervention points”: “places where you can go in and have a really big impact for a relatively low investment”.</p> <p>The <a href="https://cascadeinstitute.org/technical-paper/defending-canadas-democracy/">Cascade Institute’s proposals</a> target what they have identified as key drivers of the polycrisis, such as polarization and climate change, by, for instance, improving school curricula to bolster students’ understanding of disinformation and expanding the use of deep geothermal power.</p> <p>In addition to bringing people with disparate expertise together, the Cascade Institute, part of Royal Roads University in British Columbia, has developed an analytical framework for understanding the polycrisis, and it operates a website, polycrisis.org, which serves as a hub for the latest thinking on the issue – including critiques of the concept, Homer-Dixon says. The site contains a compendium of resources from academia to blogposts that explore the polycrisis, reflecting, for instance, on <a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/polycrisis-2025/">what’s already happened in 2025</a> (a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza, California wildfires, Trump upending the global order, an AI-bubble selloff, and the outbreak of bird flu).</p>    <p>There has been some backlash to the idea of the polycrisis. The historian Niall Ferguson has <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23920997/polycrisis-climate-pandemic-population-connectivity">described it as</a> “just history happening”. The political scientist Daniel Drezner says its proponents “assume the existence of powerful negative feedback effects that may not actually exist” – in other words, when crises overlap, the outcome might not always be bad (for instance, the pandemic lockdowns might have had some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/29/could-covid-lockdown-have-helped-save-the-planet">short-lived environmental benefits</a>). Some point to past crises as evidence that what we are experiencing is not new.</p> <p>Homer-Dixon disagrees. “We’ve moved so far and so fast outside our species’ previous experience that many elites don’t have the cognitive frame to grasp our situation, even were they inclined to do so,” he wrote in 2023, when the term was the talk of Davos.</p> <p>It’s all a bit overwhelming, as Homer-Dixon acknowledges. “If you’re not really scared by what’s going on in the world, you’re braindead,” he says.</p> <p>On the other hand, “t​​he crisis can actually be a moment for really significant change,” he says, “because it kind of delegitimizes the existing way of doing stuff, the existing vested-interest stakeholders who are hunkered down and don’t want anything to change”. For instance, while Homer-Dixon sees <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> as an “abominable” figure, he also notes that, “like an acid”, the president dissolves norms around him. That creates the risk of disaster but also offers opportunities to change the world for the better.</p> <p>“This really is a critical moment in human history and things can be done,” Homer-Dixon says. “We don’t know enough about how these systems are operating to know that it’s game over.”</p> <p>And the term itself, as terrifying as it is, can also be a strange comfort. “I think that’s useful, giving the sense a name. It’s therapeutic,” Tooze told <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/03/polycrisis-adam-tooze-historian-explains/">Radio Davos</a>. When the world feels like a nightmare, identifying the condition gives us something to hold on to – a kind of understanding amid the chaos.</p>
