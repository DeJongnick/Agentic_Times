  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/israel-attacks-irans-arak-heavy-water-reactor-as-iran-hits-israeli-hospital">set a two-week deadline</a> to decide whether the US will join Israel’s war with Iran, allowing time to seek a negotiated end to the conflict, the White House has said</strong>. The decision to leave a window for diplomacy came after Israel’s defence minister openly embraced regime change in Tehran as a war aim.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel Katz said on that Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “can no longer be allowed to exist” after Soroka hospital in southern Israel was hit during an Iranian missile attack.</strong> The Israeli defence minister said that <strong>“</strong>Khamenei openly declares that he wants Israel destroyed – he personally gives the order to fire on hospitals … such a man can no longer be allowed to exist.” Israeli has routinely attacked hospitals in Gaza, claiming they are used as bases by Hamas.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Foreign ministers from the UK, France and Germany are set to meet their Iranian counterpart Abbas Araqchi in Geneva on Friday aiming to create a pathway back to diplomacy over its nuclear programme</strong>. UK foreign secretary David Lammy, speaking after a meeting with his US counterpart Marco Rubio on Thursday, said there was a two-week window to “prevent a regional escalation that would benefit no one.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>At least 22 Palestinians have been killed after Israeli forces opened fire on aid seekers near the Netzarim axis in central Gaza, Al Jazeera reported early on Friday, citing a source at al-Awda hospital in Deir al-Balah</strong>. On Thursday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/dozens-more-people-killed-or-injured-seeking-desperately-needed-aid-in-gaza">Israeli attacks on Gaza</a> killed at least 72 people, including 21 who had gathered near food distribution sites set up by the “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation” (GHF). The dead included women and children, according to Al Jazeera reporter Anas al-Sharif, who posted footage of the bodies of children scattered in the street after an Israeli attack on tents housing displaced Palestinians near Gaza City.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel carried out strikes on Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor, its latest attack on Iran’s sprawling nuclear program</strong>. Iranian state television said there was “no radiation danger whatsoever” and that the facility had been evacuated before the attack. Israel also targeted the Natanz site, which has been hit several times.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A week of Israeli strikes on Iran have killed at least 657 people and wounded 2,037 others, a human rights group said</strong>. The Washington-based group Human Rights Activists said of those dead, it identified 263 civilians and 164 security force personnel being killed. Iran has not given regular death tolls during the conflict and has minimized casualties in the past. Its last update on Monday, it put the death toll at 224 people and 1,277 wounded.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>At least 240 people were wounded by Iranian missile strikes on Israel on Thursday morning, the AP reported. </strong>The outlet said that four individuals has been seriously wounded, citing Israel’s health ministry.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran</strong> <strong>on Thursday accused the UN’s nuclear watchdog of acting as a “partner” in what it described as Israel’s war of aggression</strong>. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) accused Iran in a report prior to the start of the Iran-Israel war of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/is-iran-as-close-to-building-a-nuclear-weapon-as-netanyahu-claims#:~:text=On%20the%20first%20point%2C%20the,to%20have%20ended%20in%202003.">non-compliance with its obligations in its nuclear programme.</a></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iraq’s top Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani</strong> <strong>warned against targeting Iran’s leadership and said that the Iran-Israel war could plunge the whole region into chaos</strong>. Sistani said in a statement on Thursday that any targeting of Iran’s “supreme religious and political leadership” would have “dire consequences on the region”.</p></li>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Violence against children caught in multiple and escalating conflicts reached “unprecedented levels” last year, with the highest number of violations in Gaza and the West Bank, Congo, Somalia, Nigeria and Haiti, according to a UN report released late Thursday. AP reports:<br><br>Secretary-General António Guterres’ annual report on Children in Armed Conflict detailed “a staggering 25% surge in grave violations” against children under the age of 18 from 2023, when the number of such violations rose by 21%.<br><br>In 2024, the UN chief said, “Children bore the brunt of relentless hostilities and indiscriminate attacks, and were affected by the disregard for ceasefires and peace agreements and by deepening humanitarian crises.”<br><br>He cited warfare strategies that included attacks on children, the deployment of increasingly destructive and explosive weapons in populated areas, and “the systematic exploitation of children for combat.”<br><br>Guterres said the United Nations verified 41,370 grave violations against children – 36,221 committed in 2024 and 5,149 committed earlier but verified last year. The violations include killing, maiming, recruiting and abducting children, sexual violence against them, attacking schools and hospitals and denying youngsters access to humanitarian aid.<br><br>The UN kept Israeli forces on its blacklist of countries that violate children’s rights for a second year, citing 7,188 verified grave violations by its military, including the killing of 1,259 Palestinian children and injury to 941 others in Gaza. The Gaza health ministry has reported much higher figures, but the UN has strict criteria and said its process of verification is ongoing.<br><br>Guterres said he is “appalled by the intensity of grave violations against children in the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel,” and “deeply alarmed” by the increase in violations, especially the high number of children killed by Israeli forces.<br><br>He reiterated his calls on Israel to abide by international law requiring special protections for children, protection for schools and hospitals, and compliance with the requirement that attacks distinguish between combatants and civilians and avoid excessive harm to civilians.<br><br>The UN also kept Hamas, whose surprise 7 October 2023 attack in southern Israel sparked the ongoing war in Gaza, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad on the blacklist.<br><br>Israel’s UN Mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.<br></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israeli attacks kill 72 Palestinians in Gaza, including at least 21 aid-seekers</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>While the world focuses on its conflict with Iran, Israel has kept up its attacks on Gaza, killing another 72 people on Thursday alone, including 21 who had gathered near food distribution sites set up by the “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation” (GHF). </p> 
  <p>Israel has blocked the UN and other aid agencies from delivering aid and backed the GHF, which has resulted in the killing of at least 300 desperate civilians in recent weeks as Israeli forces open fire on crowds of hungry people. </p> 
  <p>AFP reports:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that six people were killed while waiting for aid in the southern Gaza Strip and 15 others in a central area known as the Netzarim corridor, where thousands of Palestinians have gathered daily in the hope of receiving food rations.</p> 
   <p>The Israeli army told AFP that its troops in Netzarim corridor – a strip of land militarised by Israel that bisects the Palestinian territory – had fired “warning shots” at “suspects” approaching them, but that it was “not aware of any injured individuals”.</p> 
   <p>The army did not comment on the incident reported in the south.</p> 
   <p>In northern Gaza, Bassal said that nine separate Israeli strikes killed another 51 people, updating earlier tolls provided by his agency.</p> 
   <p>Bassam Abu Shaar, who witnessed the shooting incident in the Netzarim area, said thousands of people had gathered there overnight in the hope of receiving aid at the US- and Israeli-backed distribution site when it opened in the morning.</p> 
   <p>“Around 1:00 am (2200 GMT Wednesday), they started shooting at us,” he told AFP by phone, reporting gunfire, tank shelling and bombs dropped by drones.</p> 
   <p>Abu Shaar said that the size of the crowd had made it impossible for people to escape, with casualties left lying on the ground within walking distance of the distribution point, which is run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.</p> 
   <p>“We couldn’t help them or even escape ourselves,” he said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israel says Iran fired cluster bomb-bearing missile</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Iran</strong> fired at least one missile at <strong>Israel</strong> that scattered small bombs with the aim of increasing civilian casualties, the Israeli military said, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>Israeli news reports quoted the Israeli military as saying the missile’s warhead split open at an altitude of about 4 miles (21,000ft) and released around 20 submunitions in a radius of around 5 miles over central Israel.</p> 
  <p>One of the small munitions struck a home in the central Israeli town of <strong>Azor</strong>, causing some damage, the Times of Israel reported. There were no reports of casualties from the bomb.</p> 
  <p>Cluster bombs are controversial because they indiscriminately scatter submunitions, some of which can fail to explode and kill or injure long after a conflict ends. The Israeli military released a graphic as a public warning of the dangers of unexploded ordnance.</p>

  <p>Germany is a staunch ally of Israel.</p>

  <p><strong>Israel’s attack has exposed Iran’s lack of firepower but the conflict could yet turn in Tehran’s favour. </strong></p> 
  <p>The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh reports: </p> 
  <p><em>It is a week since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> began its largest attack ever on Iran, and in conventional military terms it is clear that Tehran is under extreme pressure. Israel has been able to achieve superiority over Iran’s skies at extraordinary speed, within hours of launching its surprise assault. Its military claimed on Monday to have knocked out 120 Iranian air defence systems through a mixture of air and drone strikes, about a third of Tehran’s pre-war total.</em></p> 
  <p><em>In response, Iran’s most effective weapon has been its stock of high-speed ballistic missiles, estimated at about 2,000 by Israel’s Defence Force (IDF) at the outset of hostilities last week. But the heavy targeting by Israel of launch sites in western <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>, in underground bases such as at Kermanshah – coupled with Israel’s grimly effective targeted killing of Iran’s top military commanders – have left Iran struggling to respond militarily and presenting a significant threat.</em></p> 
  <p><em>Iran has so far launched more than 400 missiles at Israel, but half, about 200, were launched in the initial retaliatory barrages last Friday. Since Monday the size of its missile barrages has reduced to a maximum of 15 to 20 (including 15 on Thursday afternoon), compared with up to 40 during the weekend, according to a count compiled by a US thinktank, the <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-special-report-june-18-2025-evening-edition">Institute for the Study of War</a>. Iran’s ability to manufacture new weapons is also likely to be limited, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/12/israel-strike-iran-response-witkoff">estimated by the US to be 50 a month</a> before the hostilities broke out.</em></p>

  <p><strong>The body of a Ukrainian mother who had travelled to Israel for her daughter’s leukemia treatment was recovered on Thursday from a building struck by an Iranian missile four days earlier, Israeli officials said.</strong></p> 
  <p>Agence France-Presse reports: </p> 
  <p><em>The city of Bat Yam, close to Tel Aviv, announced that “in the past few minutes, a body was found at the site of the missile impact”, identifying the victim as 31-year-old Maria Peshkarova, 31, also known as Marina.</em></p> 
  <p><em>Peshkarova had travelled to Israel in December 2022 on a medical visa to seek life-saving treatment for her daughter Anastasia, 8, who was killed along with her grandmother in the destroyed apartment bloc in Bat Yam, according to the mayor’s office.</em></p> 
  <p><em>Peshkarova’s husband is fighting in Ukraine’s war against Russia, according to the Israeli news website Ynet.</em></p> 
  <p><em>Israeli authorities had previously released the names of eight people killed in the strike and had stated that one person was missing. Peshkarova’s confirmed death takes the total deathtoll in Israel to 25 since the war with Iran started on Friday, according to authorities.</em></p> 
  <p><em>Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced Sunday that five of its nationals were killed in the Iranian strike on Bat Yam near Tel Aviv, including three minors. Ukraine on Tuesday urged its citizens to leave Israel and Iran as soon as possible amid the spiralling conflict between the two countries.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s</strong> defence minister said on Thursday that <strong>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei</strong> “can no longer be allowed to exist” after <strong>Soroka hospital</strong> in <strong>southern Israel</strong> was hit during an Iranian missile attack, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. <strong>Israel Katz</strong> told journalists in <strong>Holon</strong> near <strong>Tel Aviv: “</strong>Khamenei openly declares that he wants Israel destroyed – he personally gives the order to fire on hospitals. He considers the destruction of the state of Israel to be a goal, such a man can no longer be allowed to exist.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Speaking at Soroka hospital in Beersheba, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked about Donald Trump’s intentions and whether Israel expected the president to join the bombing campaign against Iran. </strong>The president said at the hospital: “That’s a decision for the president to make, but I can tell you that they’re already helping a lot, because they’re participating in the protection of the skies over Israel and its cities.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A missile struck the base of a skyscraper on Jabotinsky street in Ramat Gan, close to central Tel Aviv and about 200 metres from the city’s diamond exchange. </strong>Local people said a takeaway pizza business took the full force of the strike, but some older apartment blocks across the road were also wrecked by the force of the blast, which had smashed windows across the district.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Associated Press (AP) reports that at least 240 people were wounded by the Iranian missile strikes on Thursday morning. </strong>The outlet said that four individuals has been seriously wounded, according to Israel’s Health Ministry.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <strong>Israeli military</strong> said on Thursday that <strong>Iran</strong> used a missile with <strong>multiple warheads</strong> in its attack, posing a new challenge to its defenses, the Associated Press (AP) reports. Instead of having to track one warhead, missiles with multiple warheads can pose a more difficult challenge for air defense systems, like <strong>Israel’s Iron Dome.</strong></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araqchi have spoken by phone several times since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> began its strikes on Iran last week, in a bid to find a diplomatic end to the crisis, three diplomats told Reuters. </strong>According to the diplomats, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, Araqchi said Tehran would not return to negotiations unless Israel stopped the attacks, which began on 13 June.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>German chancellor Friedrich Merz had a phone call with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which Merz called for moderation in Israel’s campaign against Iran, a German government source told Reuters on Thursday. </strong>Merz voiced Germany’s support in principle for Israeli military attacks on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure during the call on Wednesday evening but stressed the importance of seeking diplomatic solutions to the conflict, the source said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran could shut the strait of Hormuz as a way of hitting back against its enemies, a senior lawmaker said on Thursday, though a second member of parliament said this would only happen if Tehran’s vital interests were endangered. </strong>Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait of Hormuz to traffic in retaliation for western pressure, and shipping sources said on Wednesday that commercial ships were avoiding Iran’s waters around the strait, Reuters reported.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <strong>US</strong> special envoy for <strong>Syria, Tom Barrack,</strong> on Thursday warned <strong>Lebanese group Hezbollah</strong> against getting involved in the war between its main backer <strong>Iran</strong> and <strong>Israel, </strong>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Barrack, who is also the US ambassador to <strong>Turkey,</strong> is on his first visit to <strong>Beirut,</strong> where he met top Lebanese officials including parliament speaker <strong>Nabih Berri,</strong> an ally of Hezbollah.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 25 people on Thursday, including 15 who had gathered near an aid distribution site. </strong>Civil defence official <strong>Mohammad al-Mughayyir</strong> told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that <strong>15 people were killed and 60 wounded</strong> while waiting for aid in <strong>central Gaza’s Netzarim corridor,</strong> where thousands of people have gathered daily in the hope of receiving rations.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araqchi confirmed on Thursday he would meet his British, French and German counterparts as well as the European Union’s top diplomat on Friday in Geneva, Iranian state media reported, according to Reuters. </strong>He said the meeting had come at the request of the three European states.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran</strong> on Thursday accused the <strong>UN’s nuclear watchdog</strong> of acting as a “partner” in what it described as <strong>Israel’s</strong> “war of aggression”. The <strong>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</strong> accused Iran in a report prior to the start of the Iran-Israel war of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/is-iran-as-close-to-building-a-nuclear-weapon-as-netanyahu-claims#:~:text=On%20the%20first%20point%2C%20the,to%20have%20ended%20in%202003.">non-compliance with its obligations in its nuclear programme.</a></p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iraq’s top Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani</strong> warned against targeting <strong>Iran’s</strong> leadership and said that the <strong>Iran-Israel war</strong> could plunge the whole region into chaos, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports. Sistani said in a statement on Thursday that any targeting of Iran’s “supreme religious and political leadership” would have “dire consequences on the region”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ottawa is planning commercial options for Canadians in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, the West Bank and Iran to leave the region via neighbouring countries, foreign minister Anita Anand said on Thursday. </strong>“We are developing further options with our allies,” she said in a post on X, but gave no details.</p></li>

  <p><strong>The leader of the opposition in the UK, Kemi Badenoch, has said she would “in principle” support the US using the UK-controlled Diego Garcia base in the Chagos Islands in a potential strike on Iran.</strong></p> 
  <p>Asked if Keir Starmer should allow the US to use the base if necessary, she said: “So I haven’t seen the security briefings.</p> 
  <p>“But in principle, I think that that’s absolutely something that we should do. I don’t think the US or Israel would be rushing into something unless there was a serious threat to global security.</p> 
  <p>“But what is astonishing is that we now have to get permission from Mauritius, who are an ally of China and ally of Iran.</p> 
  <p>“That is a situation we should not have been in. And I’m also worried about us not being ready for the more dangerous world that we’re living in.”</p>

  <p><strong>At the Soroka hospital in Beersheba, Netanyahu called for the Iranian people to rise up and overthrow their government,</strong> saying <strong>Israel</strong> might create the conditions for regime change with its bombing campaign while insisting that was not the objective.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>People ask me – are we targeting the downfall of the regime.</em></p> 
   <p><em>That may be a result, but it’s up to the Iranian people to rise for their freedom. Freedom is never cheap. It’s never free. Freedom requires these subjugated people to rise up, and it’s up to them.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Speaking at Soroka hospital in Beersheba, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was asked about Donald Trump’s intentions and whether Israel expected the president to join the bombing campaign against Iran.</strong></p> 
  <p>The president said at the hospital:</p>

   <p><em>That’s a decision for the president to make, but I can tell you that they’re already helping a lot, because they’re participating in the protection of the skies over Israel and its cities.</em></p>

   <p><em>But I have to say that the partnership with the United States, the partnership with President Trump, with whom I speak to almost every day, is incredible.</em></p>

  <p>Netanyahu said he had praise for Trump’s “resolve, his determination, and his clarity when he says Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon – and for that to take place, Iran cannot enrich uranium.”</p> 
  <p>He added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>It’s as simple as that. He gave them the chance to do it through negotiations.</em></p>

  <p><strong>Iran could shut the strait of Hormuz as a way of hitting back against its enemies, a senior lawmaker said on Thursday, though a second member of parliament said this would only happen if Tehran’s vital interests were endangered.</strong></p> 
  <p>Iran has in the past threatened to close the strait of Hormuz to traffic in retaliation for western pressure, and shipping sources said on Wednesday that commercial ships were avoiding Iran’s waters around the strait, Reuters reported.</p> 
  <p>“Iran has numerous options to respond to its enemies and uses such options based on what the situation is,” the semi-official Mehr news agency quoted Behnam Saeedi, a member of the parliament’s National Security Committee presidium as saying.</p> 
  <p>“Closing the strait of Hormuz is one of the potential options for Iran,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Mehr later quoted another lawmaker, Ali Yazdikhah, as saying Iran would continue to allow free shipping in the Strait and in the Gulf so long as its vital national interests were not at risk.</p> 
  <p>“If the United States officially and operationally enters the war in support of the Zionists (Israel), it is the legitimate right of Iran in view of pressuring the U.S. and western countries to disrupt their oil trade’s ease of transit,” Yazdikhah said.</p>

  <p>The <strong>US</strong> special envoy for <strong>Syria, Tom Barrack,</strong> on Thursday warned <strong>Lebanese group Hezbollah</strong> against getting involved in the war between its main backer <strong>Iran</strong> and <strong>Israel, </strong>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.</p> 
  <p>Barrack, who is also the US ambassador to <strong>Turkey,</strong> is on his first visit to <strong>Beirut,</strong> where he met top Lebanese officials including parliament speaker <strong>Nabih Berri,</strong> an ally of Hezbollah.</p> 
  <p>“I can say on behalf of President (Donald) Trump … that would be a very, very, very bad decision,” Barrack said after his meeting with Berri, responding to a question on what the US position would be on any involvement by Lebanese armed group Hezbollah in the war.</p>

  <p>Hezbollah suffered devastating losses in its war against Israel last year, which ended with a ceasefire agreement in November.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israeli fire kills at least 25 people in Gaza</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 25 people on Thursday, including 15 who had gathered near an aid distribution site.</strong></p> 
  <p>Civil defence official <strong>Mohammad al-Mughayyir</strong> told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that <strong>15 people were killed and 60 wounded</strong> while waiting for aid in <strong>central Gaza’s Netzarim corridor,</strong> where thousands of people have gathered daily in the hope of receiving rations.</p> 
  <p>The Israeli army told AFP it was “looking into” the reports.</p> 
  <p>Witness <strong>Bassam Abu Shaar</strong> said thousands of people had gathered overnight in the hope of receiving aid at the <strong>US</strong> and <strong>Israeli-backed</strong> distribution site when it opened in the morning.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Around 1:00am (22:00 GMT Wednesday), they started shooting at us. The gunfire intensified from tanks, aircraft and quadcopter bombs.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said the size of the crowd had made it impossible for people to escape the Israeli fire near <strong>Shuhada Junction,</strong> and dead and wounded were left lying on the ground within walking distance of the distribution point run by the <strong>Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.</strong></p> 
  <p>“We couldn’t help them or even escape ourselves,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Mughayyir said the casualties had been taken to the <strong>Al-Awda and Al-Aqsa hospitals,</strong> in north and central Gaza respectively.</p> 
  <p>Dozens of <strong>Palestinians</strong> have been killed in recent weeks while trying to reach aid distribution points in Gaza, which is suffering from famine-like conditions, according to UN agencies operating in the territory.</p> 
  <p>Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.</p> 
  <p>Elsewhere in Gaza, <strong>another 10 people were killed</strong> by Israeli fire on Thursday, the civil defence agency said.</p> 
  <p>Three were killed by Israeli shelling of a residential building in <strong>Gaza City,</strong> while seven were killed in a strike on <strong>Al-Shati refugee camp</strong> to its west.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>A missile struck the base of a skyscraper on Jabotinsky street in Ramat Gan, close to central Tel Aviv and about 200 metres from the city’s diamond exchange.</strong></p> 
  <p>Local people said a takeaway pizza business took the full force of the strike, but some older apartment blocks across the road were also wrecked by the force of the blast, which had smashed windows across the district.</p> 
  <p>There were no immediate reports of casualties. After six days of war, residents were accustomed to rushing to their shelters.</p> 
  <p>“It was like an atom bomb. An earthquake,” said <strong>Asher Adiv,</strong> a 69-year-old who lives in a nearby apartment block. His mother was an <strong>Iranian</strong> Jew from <strong>Isfahan</strong> and <strong>Asher</strong> grew up speaking <strong>Farsi.</strong> He had strong ideas about what should happen next.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The Iranian people should make a revolution, and kick out the ayatollahs,” Asher said. “We are not just fighting for Israel. We are fighting for the whole world. We ask Trump to go inside and finish the problem.</em></p>

  <p>Asher’s wife, <strong>Anny,</strong> an immigrant from <strong>Morocco</strong> who came to <strong>Israel</strong> in 1969, said she thought Israel would prevail even without US intervention.</p> 
  <p>She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Tell Donald Trump to be beside us. He has to bomb them to finish the nuclear sites.</em></p> 
   <p><em>We are innocent citizens, but they threaten us all the time and say they want to kill us. We didn’t have any choice. We saw what happened on 7 October.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israeli president Isaac Herzog praises Soroka hospital director general</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Israel’s president Isaac Herzog has been visiting the Soroka medical centre in Beersheba, which was hit this morning by an Iranian missile.</strong></p> 
  <p>Standing in front of the scorched surgery building which had taken the full force of the impact, Herzog praised the hospital’s director general for taking the decision the night before to evacuate the building on grounds it was insufficiently protected.</p> 
  <p>“Luckily, it was truly a miracle no one was hurt by this cruel Iranian missile which landed on a hospital,” he said, adding that the staff and patients were both Jews and Muslims.</p> 
  <p>He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>They’re all treated here, treated beautifully. But this missile, – those who launched, they don’t care. They would kill anybody, so long as it’s in Israel.</em></p> 
   <p><em>So we have answers for them.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Your crimes against humanity, your war crimes, won’t deter us.</em></p> 
   <p><em>The reality is when you go into this hospital and you see how Jews and Muslims dwell peacefully together, do good together, be treated together, and change the world together. And that’s the future of this region</em></p> 
   <p><em>For that, you need sometimes to go to war in order to hit hard at the head of the snake, the head of the empire of evil… those who decided to run to a nuclear program to annihilate this place, those who decided to spread havoc and terror over all the world,</em></p> 
   <p><em>No way guys. We are here forever, and we shall overcome.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The president then left the hospital without taking questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Iraq’s top Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani</strong> warned against targeting <strong>Iran’s</strong> leadership and said that the <strong>Iran-Israel war</strong> could plunge the whole region into chaos, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.</p> 
  <p>Sistani said in a statement on Thursday that any targeting of Iran’s “supreme religious and political leadership” would have “dire consequences on the region”.</p> 
  <p>He warned that it could spark “widespread chaos that would exacerbate the suffering of its [the region’s] people and severely harm everyone’s interests”.</p> 
  <p>Sistani urged the international community to “make every effort to end this unjust war and find a peaceful solution” to Iran’s nuclear programme.</p> 
  <p>Sistani, an Iranian, is the highest religious authority for millions of Shia Muslims in <strong>Iraq</strong> and around the world, with the power to mobilise a huge portion of that base in Iraq.</p> 
  <p>With warnings of all-out regional war intensifying following Israel’s surprise assault on Iran last week, fears are growing over an intervention by Iran-backed Iraqi factions, mostly against American interests in the region.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba has been hit by a ballistic missile, Israeli officials have said, after Iran launched its latest wave of retaliatory airstrikes on the country.</strong> The medical centre has over 1,000 beds and provides services to the approximately 1 million residents of Israel’s south. A hospital statement said several parts of the medical centre were damaged and that the emergency room was treating several minor injuries.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s Magen David Adom rescue service said on Thursday that at least 47 people were injured in Iran’s other missile strikes, updating an earlier toll and reporting 18 more injured “while running to shelter”.</strong> Three people are in serious condition, and two are in moderate condition, an MDA spokesperson said in as statement reported by Agence France-Presse.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> will exact the full price from the “tyrants” in Tehran. </strong>“This morning, Iran’s ‘terrorist tyrants’ launched missiles at Soroka hospital in Beersheba and at a civilian population in central Israel,” he said in a <a href="https://x.com/netanyahu/status/1935581234001809807">post on X</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s defence minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> Katz said on Thursday that Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei would be “held accountable” after the Iranian strike on Soroka hospital in Israel. </strong>The minister added that he had ordered the army to “intensify strikes” on the Islamic republic.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel attacked Iran’s Arak heavy water reactor early on Thursday, Iranian state television has reported.</strong> The report said there was “no radiation danger whatsoever” and that the facility had been already evacuated before the attack. Israel’s military warned people to evacuate the area around the heavy water reactor in the regions of Arak and Khondab just a couple of hours before it launched its attack.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump has suggested to defence officials it would make sense for the US to launch strikes against Iran only if the so-called “bunker buster” bomb was guaranteed to destroy the critical <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/us-military-assets-missile-launch-sites-iran-fordow">uranium enrichment facility at Fordow</a>, according to people familiar with the deliberations. </strong>Trump was told that dropping the GBU-57s, a 13.6-tonne bomb would effectively eliminate Fordow but he does not appear to be fully convinced, the people said, and has held off authorising strikes as he also awaits the possibility that the threat of US involvement would lead <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> to talks.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US president also told reporters that “a deal could still happen” and that he thinks “Iran was a few weeks away from having a nuclear weapon.” </strong>The news came shortly before several US media outlets reported that Trump approved plans to attack<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran"> Iran</a> on Tuesday, but has not yet given the final order to do so. US intelligence sources briefed US senators on Monday that Iran was not working to develop a nuclear weapon.</p></li>

  <p>Only the <strong>United States</strong> has the clout to engage <strong>Israel</strong> and <strong>Iran</strong> in negotiations as the two countries continue to trade air attacks, <strong>Greek</strong> prime minister <strong>Kyriakos Mitsotakis</strong> said on Wednesday, Reuters reports.</p> 
  <p>Mitsotakis said in an interview on the sidelines of an energy conference in <strong>Athens:</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Europe alone does not have the necessary influence to bring the parties concerned to the (negotiation) table. Only the United States can do that. So I think it is up to the President of the United States to decide which path to take.</em></p> 
   <p><em>We are all very concerned about any factor that will push inflation up and significantly disrupt energy markets</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The foreign ministers of <strong>Germany, France</strong> and the <strong>UK</strong> plan to hold nuclear talks with their Iranian counterpart on Friday in <strong>Geneva,</strong> a German diplomatic source told Reuters.</p> 
  <p>Mitsotakis said Greece was also very worried about the safety of around 180 Greek-flagged and Greek-owned ships that sailed in the wider <strong>Persian Gulf region</strong> when Israel first attacked Iran last week.</p> 
  <p>Greek owners control the world’s largest fleet of oil tankers. Commercial ships are being advised by maritime agencies to avoid Iran’s waters around the <strong>strait of Hormuz,</strong> shipping sources said on Wednesday.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Legal advice is for the Prime Minister, and I think that’s where it will stay and you can understand why I won’t comment on that.</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump's caution on Iran strike linked to doubts over ‘bunker buster’ bomb, officials say</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump has suggested to defence officials it would make sense for the US to launch strikes against Iran only if the so-called “bunker buster” bomb was guaranteed to destroy the critical <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/us-military-assets-missile-launch-sites-iran-fordow">uranium enrichment facility at Fordow</a>, according to people familiar with the deliberations.</strong></p> 
  <p>Trump was told that dropping the GBU-57s, a 13.6-tonne bomb would effectively eliminate Fordow but he does not appear to be fully convinced, the people said, and has held off authorising strikes as he also awaits the possibility that the threat of US involvement would lead Iran to talks.</p> 
  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/archive-zip/giv-32554jtO2e7n07YPd/" data-alt="Satellite images of Fordow."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/06/archive-zip/giv-32554jtO2e7n07YPd/">Interactive</a> 
  </figure> 
  <p>Taking Fordow offline – either diplomatically or militarily – is seen as central to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) found the site had enriched uranium to 83.7% – close to the 90% needed for nuclear weapons.</p> 
  <p>Any effort to destroy Fordow, would require US involvement because Israel does not possess the ordnance to strike a facility that deep or the planes to carry them</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israel bombs Iranian heavy water reactor, Iranian media reports</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Israel attacked Iran’s <strong>Arak</strong> heavy water reactor early on Thursday, Iranian state television has reported. The report said there was “no radiation danger whatsoever” and that the facility had been already evacuated before the attack.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s military warned people to evacuate the area around the heavy water reactor in the regions of Arak and Khondab just a couple of hours before it launched its attack. The warning came in a social media post similar to those it has issued for Gaza and included a satellite image of the plant in a red circle. </p> 
  <p>The Arak heavy water reactor is 250km southwest of Tehran.<br><br>Heavy water helps cool nuclear reactors, the Associated Press reports, but it produces plutonium as a byproduct that can potentially be used in nuclear weapons. That would provide Iran another path to the bomb beyond enriched uranium, should it choose to pursue a weapon.<br><br>Iran had agreed under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers to redesign the facility to relieve proliferation concerns.</p> 
  <p>As part of negotiations around the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to sell off its heavy water to the west to remain in compliance with the accord’s terms. <br><br>Britain at the time was helping Iran redesign the Arak reactor to limit the amount of plutonium it produces, stepping in for the US, which had withdrawn from the project after president Donald Trump’s decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw America from the nuclear deal.</p> 
  <p>In the last week, Israel’s campaign has targeted Iran’s enrichment site at Natanz, centrifuge workshops around Tehran and a nuclear site in Isfahan.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome and summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s continuing coverage of the Israel-Iran war.</p> 
  <p>A hospital in southern Israel has been hit by a missile after Iran launched a round of retaliatory strikes on the country early on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>Soroka Hospital in Beersheba was among several areas to be directly hit after Iran fired around 20 ballistic missiles at Israel, an Israeli military official said. There was no immediate information on any casualties.</p> 
  <p>Israel’s military has meanwhile warned people to evacuate the area around the Iranian city of Arak’s heavy water reactor. The warning came in a social media post and included a satellite image of the plant in a red circle.</p> 
  <p>The Iranian Student News Agency (ISNA) later reported that the area had been hit but that the area had been evacuated beforehand and that there was no radiation risk. It was not possible to independently confirm the report.</p> 
  <p>In the past week, Israel’s campaign has targeted Iran’s enrichment site at Natanz, centrifuge workshops around Tehran and a nuclear site in Isfahan.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump said he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/iran-threatens-us-with-irreparable-damage-if-trump-joins-war">has not decided whether or not to take his country into Israel’s war with Iran</a> and said he was still open to reaching a deal with Iran.</p> 
  <p>The president has reportedly suggested to defence officials it would make sense for the US to launch strikes against Iran only if the so-called “bunker buster” bomb was guaranteed to destroy the critical uranium enrichment facility at Fordow, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/19/trump-caution-on-iran-strike-linked-to-doubts-over-bunker-buster-bomb-officials-say">according to people familiar with the deliberations</a>.</p> 
  <p>Elsewhere today:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump told reporters that “a deal could still happen” and that he thinks “Iran was a few weeks away from having a nuclear weapon.” The news came shortly before several US media outlets reported that Trump approved plans to attack <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> on Tuesday, but has not yet given the final order to do so. </strong>US intelligence sources briefed US senators on Monday that Iran was not working to develop a nuclear weapon.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel had made a “huge mistake” by launching the war and warned the US against becoming involved,</strong> in his first comments since Friday. “The Americans should know that any US military intervention will undoubtedly be accompanied by irreparable damage,” he said in a statement read out by a presenter on state TV.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>European leaders are pushing for diplomacy between Israel and Iran, with officials <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/british-german-and-french-foreign-ministers-plan-meeting-with-iranian-counterpart">set to meet with Iran’s foreign minister</a> in Geneva on Friday. </strong>The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain, as well as EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, will join the nuclear talks.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran announced that it had fired ultra-heavy, long-range, two-stage missiles at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, while Israeli strikes hit targets across Iran, including the police central command building in Tehran. </strong>French president Emmanuel Macron has voiced concerns that Israeli strikes are “increasingly targeting sites unrelated to Iran’s nuclear and ballistic programs”, leading to “a growing number of civilian casualties”. So far, more than 224 people in Iran and more than 24 in Israel have been killed in the conflict. Rights groups suspect the death toll in Iran may actually be closer to 600.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Longtime supporters of Donald Trump have voiced their disapproval of the possibility that the president may seek to involve the United States in the Israel-Iran conflict, a rare break within the deeply loyal Make America Great Again coalition. </strong>Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon said “this is not something you play around with” while Republican senator Rand Paul told reporters that Trump would need congressional approval to bomb <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>. At the same time, some Trump allies voiced their support for the president, with Republican senator Ted Cruz<strong> </strong>saying the US could “quite reasonably” strike an underground nuclear facility in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>, but that “there is zero possibility of American boots on the ground”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Internet connection across all of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> has slowed to a near halt.</strong> The reduction in internet speeds comes after an anti-Iranian government hacking group with potential ties to Israel claimed that it hacked Iran’s state-owned Bank Sepah. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran’s government, said on X that officials in Tehran had restricted internet access to ward off additional cyberattacks.</p></li>
