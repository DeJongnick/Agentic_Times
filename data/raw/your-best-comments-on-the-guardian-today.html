The people-watching </a></h2>    <p>In this month’s food column, Jay Rayner wrote that: “The pleasures of eating alone are obvious. You get to eat what you want, how you want. It is one of adulthood’s great indulgences. But who admits to its other profound pleasure, the licence it gives you to spy on people?” You responded with some of your own experiences.<br></p> <h2>‘I’ve met some interesting people that way’<br></h2>  <figure class="element element-comment" data-canonical-url="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/108665044">  <div class="d2-comment-embedded" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <div class="d2-left-col"> <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4427523" title="View ampocarbuile’s profile"> <img class="d2-avatar" src="https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/4427523" height="40" width="40" alt="User avatar for ampocarbuile"> </a> </div> <div class="d2-right-col"> <div itemscope itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <a class="d2-username" href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/4427523" title="View ampocarbuile’s profile" itemprop="url"> <span itemprop="givenName">ampocarbuile</span> </a> </div> <div class="d2-permalink"> <a class="d2-datetime" href="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/108665044" title="Link to this comment" itemprop="datePublished">23 November 2017 1:04pm</a> </div>  <div class="d2-pick d2-hidetext" title="This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate">This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate</div> <div class="d2-body" itemprop="text"><p>I love eating alone, with a good book in case the restaurant is empty.

Before marriage, it was an uncomfortable reminder of my loneliness. Besides which, good eating for me is inextricably linked with good company ;the sharing of food and taking pleasure in the sharing of food making up a good part of the joy of mealtimes. Even a take-a-way, seldom eaten in the company of strangers, felt wrong because it's doubly lazy not to cook for oneself. The exceptions to this could be found in a handful of restaurants that have the wisdom, by accident or design, to make spaces (and prices) that attract a host of single diners ; my favourite being the legendary <i>Wong Kei</i>'s in London's China town. At any time of day, the ground floor is packed with people tucking in to a £5 plate, heaving with rice and meat. I would enter into conversation with people here on occasion but more often than not, I would share a table and a few pleasantries but little more. <i>Stockpot</i>, which closed two years ago, was my other solo dining haunt and here you could eat and people watch, guilt free and inexpensively ; it's place in theatreland and on London's foremost gay thoroughfare would guarantee a stage and cast for the imagined biographies Jay talks about about above. Don't enter the world of fine dining alone, unless you're very secure, however: there the emotional tumbleweed blows.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>‘I take a good book and do some people-watching’<br></h2>  <figure class="element element-comment" data-canonical-url="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/108668281">  <div class="d2-comment-embedded" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <div class="d2-left-col"> <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3753300" title="View roola’s profile"> <img class="d2-avatar" src="https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/3753300" height="40" width="40" alt="User avatar for roola"> </a> </div> <div class="d2-right-col"> <div itemscope itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <a class="d2-username" href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/3753300" title="View roola’s profile" itemprop="url"> <span itemprop="givenName">roola</span> </a> </div> <div class="d2-permalink"> <a class="d2-datetime" href="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/108668281" title="Link to this comment" itemprop="datePublished">23 November 2017 1:53pm</a> </div>  <div class="d2-pick d2-hidetext" title="This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate">This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate</div> <div class="d2-body" itemprop="text"><p>Dining alone?

This job taught me some things about our society that I strongly criticise and hate. 1. How abandoned are may elders from their relatives. It seems that keeping a dad or mum with them instead of leaving them alone to their own fate won't match the deco in their living room. They're a nuisance that prevents them enjoying their lifestyle and that's why they keep them apart as though they were broken toys. They'll at the very best call on them at Christmas time, on Mother's or Father's Day, bringing them a bottle of levander, but also expecting a present from them.... I've seen people in nursing homes that could have been living with their relatives and in the same neighbourdhood they had always lived. Lack of Christian practice, I'd say!</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>‘Daily living aids and assistive technology can help people continue to live their lives with dignity’</h2>  <figure class="element element-comment" data-canonical-url="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/108667162">  <div class="d2-comment-embedded" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <div class="d2-left-col"> <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18354053" title="View dlfteam’s profile"> <img class="d2-avatar" src="https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/18354053" height="40" width="40" alt="User avatar for dlfteam"> </a> </div> <div class="d2-right-col"> <div itemscope itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <a class="d2-username" href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18354053" title="View dlfteam’s profile" itemprop="url"> <span itemprop="givenName">dlfteam</span> </a> </div> <div class="d2-permalink"> <a class="d2-datetime" href="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/108667162" title="Link to this comment" itemprop="datePublished">23 November 2017 1:36pm</a> </div>  <div class="d2-pick d2-hidetext" title="This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate">This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate</div> <div class="d2-body" itemprop="text"><p>Daily living aids and assistive technology can help people to continue to live their lives with dignity and stay independent for longer, in their home.

And end to light directed upward to the sky - of zero benefit to anyone, and environmentally harmful.</p> <p>2. The use of lower colour-temperature in LED lighting (i.e. less blue-light component) - mainly for its <i>proven </i>health impact, but also because blue light is scattered FAR more widely than longer wavelengths due to the nature of Rayleigh scattering. Warmer coloured LEDs can be just as effective for illuminating the things that need to be illuminated.</p> <p>3. Better lighting pattern design: &quot;dim, closely spaced lights tend to provide better visibility than bright lights that are more spread out&quot;.</p> <p>The 1st and 3rd of these would have side benefits of being lower cost and less polluting in terms of their electricity demands.</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <h2>‘A recent school assignment for one of the kids almost came to nought because we couldn’t see the moon’</h2>  <figure class="element element-comment" data-canonical-url="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/108644447">  <div class="d2-comment-embedded" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <div class="d2-left-col"> <a href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18059082" title="View CaptainFlacid’s profile"> <img class="d2-avatar" src="https://avatar.guim.co.uk/user/18059082" height="40" width="40" alt="User avatar for CaptainFlacid"> </a> </div> <div class="d2-right-col"> <div itemscope itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <a class="d2-username" href="https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/18059082" title="View CaptainFlacid’s profile" itemprop="url"> <span itemprop="givenName">CaptainFlacid</span> </a> </div> <div class="d2-permalink"> <a class="d2-datetime" href="https://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/108644447" title="Link to this comment" itemprop="datePublished">23 November 2017 2:23am</a> </div> <div class="d2-body" itemprop="text"><p>As someone that likes to look at the stars and wonder what's out there it's certainly annoying.
