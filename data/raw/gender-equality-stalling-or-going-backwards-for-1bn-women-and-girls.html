<p>More than 850 million women and girls are living in countries rated as “very poor” for gender equality, says a new report, subjecting them to a litany of potential restrictions and abuses, including forced pregnancies, childhood marriage and bans from secondary education.</p> <p>The SDG Gender Index, <a href="https://equalmeasures2030.org/2024-sdg-gender-index/">published today</a> by Equal Measures 2030, a coalition of NGOs, found that no country has, so far, achieved the promise of gender equality envisioned by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jan/19/sustainable-development-goals-united-nations">UN’s 2030 sustainable development goals</a> (SDGs). <br><br>Between 2019 and 2022, nearly 40% of countries – home to more than 1 billion women and girls – stagnated or declined on gender equality.</p> <p>The SDG index, which benchmarks gender equality across 139 countries, gave 45 countries – including large parts of west, central and sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and countries in Asia including Bangladesh and Myanmar – its worst rating of “very poor”.</p> <p>In addition to the 857 million women and girls living in countries rated “very poor”, 1.5 billion lived in countries rated “poor”. Only one country, Switzerland, was rated “very good”.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/09/gender_inequality_map/giv-13425YBg38B9ArHdx/" data-alt="A map showing that progress towards gender equality has stalled or reversed in many countries"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2024/09/gender_inequality_map/giv-13425YBg38B9ArHdx/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The report said the “dismal scenario” means global gender inequality could be worse in 2030 than when the goals were set in 2015, as armed conflict, accelerating climate breakdown, anti-gender campaigns and threats to democracy stall or reverse progress. If current trends continue, equality will not be achieved until the 22nd century.</p> <p>“From the explosion of domestic violence during the pandemic to the Taliban getting back into power in Afghanistan, from the brutal repression of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/23/how-iran-erupted-after-mahsa-amini-death-protests">Woman, Life, Freedom</a> movement in Iran and the repeal of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roe-v-wade">Roe v Wade</a> in the US, women’s rights are being eroded,” said Chiara Capraro, the programme director for gender justice at Amnesty International UK.</p> <p>Almost every country in the world agreed to targets to achieve gender equality by 2030 as part of the UN’s SDG initiative.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/26/taliban-bar-on-afghan-women-speaking-in-public-un-afghanistan">‘Frightening’ Taliban law bans women from speaking in public</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet in the past few years there has been a widespread failure concerning progress on women’s rights, which have declined in a number of countries including Poland, the US and Afghanistan.<br><br>Both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/dec/14/poland-violated-human-rights-of-woman-in-abortion-case-european-court-rules">Poland</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state">US</a> have taken regressive steps on abortion rights.

The report said 614 million women and girls were living in conflict-affected countries in 2022 – 50% higher than the number in 2017.<br><br>Heather Barr, an associate director of the women’s rights division at Human Rights Watch, said: “We have seen a number of conflicts which have had a devastating impact on women and girls and set back progress in those countries. We can see that with the horrific reports of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/22/women-forced-to-have-sex-with-soldiers-for-food-in-sudanese-city">sexual violence in Sudan</a>, the rise in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/aug/13/women-war-combat-ptsd-ukraine-domestic-violence-gender">domestic violence in Ukraine</a> and restrictions on abortion access.”<br><br>Barr also pointed to the recent emergence of authoritarian governments taking power in countries “working from a playbook that reverses hard-won gains on women’s rights under the pretext of supporting ‘traditional values’”.<br><br>Accelerating progress on women’s rights required more women in positions of power, said Barr.<br><br>“Women’s participation – bringing women into decision-making positions both in national governments and internationally in organisations like the UN – is key,” she said.</p> <p>“This is the best way to ensure that we bring about the real changes needed to achieve gender equality, rather than just talking about it.”</p> <p>The SDG Gender Index precedes the annual <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/sep/07/women-and-girls-being-failed-by-lacklustre-commitment-to-gender-equality-says-un#:~:text=In%20a%20snapshot%20report%2C%20published,UN%20member%20states%20in%202015.">UN Women snapshot report</a>, to be published later this month, which is expected to document another year of poor progress.</p>
