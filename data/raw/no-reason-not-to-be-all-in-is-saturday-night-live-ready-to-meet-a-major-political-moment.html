<p>Paul Simon sang The Boxer. New York mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared with firefighters. When producer Lorne Michaels asked: “Can we be funny?”, Giuliani replied: “Why start now?”</p> <p>It was September 2001 and, just 18 days after the worst terrorist attack in US history, Saturday Night Live’s blend of satire, silliness and live music was back on the air. “In bad times, people turn to the show,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/saturday-night-live-9-11-oral-history-1221336/">Michaels told Rolling Stone magazine</a> 20 years later.</p> <p>SNL <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/feb/17/saturday-night-live-50th-special">turns 50 this month</a> and must once again try to meet the moment. This time, the crisis is not external but taking place in late-night TV comedy itself. In recent weeks, the genre has become the canary in the coal mine of US democracy.</p> <p>Over the summer, CBS <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/jul/19/paramount-cbs-trump">announced the cancellation</a> of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ostensibly for financial reasons, though notably Colbert is a longtime Trump critic and CBS owner Paramount had been seeking government approval of an $8bn merger with Skydance.</p> <p>On 17 September, ABC <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/18/jimmy-kimmel-live-suspended-indefinitely-after-hosts-charlie-kirk-comments">suspended Jimmy Kimmel’s show</a> over comments he made after the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. Hours before the suspension, the Federal Communications Commission chair, Brendan Carr, warned that local broadcasters who aired Kimmel could face fines or loss of licences and said: “It’s time for them to step up.”</p> <p>The move prompted an outcry over freedom of speech. ABC parent Disney faced pressure from Kimmel’s fans, some of whom cancelled subscriptions to the company’s streaming services Disney+ and Hulu. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/sep/26/jimmy-kimmel-trump-ratings-escalator">Kimmel returned to the air</a> six days later and mocked Trump: “He tried his best to cancel me and instead he forced millions of people to watch this show.”</p> <p>Now the spotlight shifts from CBS and ABC to America’s other major network: NBC. When <a href="https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/saturday-night-live-season-51-premiere-date-cast-hosts">SNL returns on 4 October</a>, Bad Bunny will host with Doja Cat as the musical guest and five new featured players following several cast departures. But no moment will matter more than the “cold open” in how it deals with the current climate.</p>    <p>“This would be one of the biggest, most important cold openings in the 50-year history of the show,” says <a href="https://cas.umw.edu/polisci/about-the-faculty/stephen-farnsworth/">Stephen Farnsworth</a>, a co-author of Late Night With Trump: Political Humor and the American Presidency. “But in the past, when Saturday Night Live has faced a major challenge, like they did in the wake of 9/11, they’ve risen to the occasion.”</p> <p>SNL’s mockery of Trump has at times earned the wrath of his supporters and the president himself, but Farnsworth advised against pulling punches, saying: “Saturday Night Live will face charges that it isn’t going far enough or that it went too far pretty much no matter what they do, so there’s no reason not to be all in.”</p> <p>Farnsworth, the director of the Center for Leadership and Media Studies at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Virginia, adds: “It’s striking that a man who desires the spotlight as much as the president does, who wants to be a public figure as badly as he has over the years, doesn’t understand that criticism is part of the package that comes with power.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.nbc.com/nbc-insider/watch-the-first-episode-of-saturday-night-live-host-musical-guests">Launched a year</a> after the Watergate scandal toppled Richard Nixon, SNL features sketches and live musical performances. But it is also known for covering politics and featuring politicians. The weekend update segment provides ongoing commentary while cast members often parody presidents, candidates and other figures.</p> <p>The most famous include Gerald Ford (Chevy Chase), George HW Bush (Dana Carvey), Bill Clinton (Darrell Hammond), George W Bush (Will Ferrell), Sarah Palin (Tina Fey), Donald Trump (Alec Baldwin) and Joe Biden (various cast and guest actors). Trump is now portrayed with aplomb by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Austin_Johnson">James Austin Johnson</a>.</p> <p>Susan Morrison, author of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/532520/lorne-by-susan-morrison/">Lorne</a>, a biography of Michaels, recalls: “When Alec Baldwin was doing him, Trump was furiously tweeting right about SNL: it wasn’t funny, FCC should investigate, Lorne was over. Watching Alec Baldwin do his thing, it almost felt like bear baiting. It was so fun to watch the back and forth, and don’t anticipate that they’re going to pull back.<em>”</em></p> <p>Politicians have also appeared as hosts or in cameos. Al Gore, John McCain, Jesse Jackson and Sarah Palin have all featured. Trump hosted in 2004 and, more controversially, in 2015 during his presidential run. Hillary Clinton appeared multiple times, including alongside her impersonator, Kate McKinnon, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/03/kamala-harris-finds-herself-on-saturday-night-live-amid-riff-to-end-the-drama-la-in-us-politics">Kamala Harris took part</a> before last year’s election.</p> <p>The show picked up 12 Emmys recently for its 50th season and anniversary programming, including an award for outstanding variety special. Saturday’s episode will be scrutinised closely for how it deals with Trump’s attack on comedy, free expression and democracy – and whether it can make a serious point in a funny, unsanctimonious way.</p>    <p>Morrison continues: “Lorne and his very smart writers will come up with some clever but on-the-nose way of dealing with this. The thing that it’s important to remember about Lorne is he’s been doing this for so many decades. He’s outlasted so many slates of executives. He’s a survivor. As Conan [O’Brien] told me, in the Game of Thrones of show business, Lorne would be the last man standing.</p> <p>“That isn’t to say that he’s going to cave but he will figure out a way to address this and stay on the air. I also don’t think the people at NBC or Comcast or the FCC are going to mess with him. He’s too much of a statesman in the TV business. But he’s going to come up with a way of dealing with it and addressing it and he’ll be funny about it.<em>”</em></p> <p>Conservatives have long accused SNL of bias, arguing that the show disproportionately lampoons right-leaning figures while going easier on Democrats. Former head writer Tina Fey openly acknowledged a “liberal bias” <a href="https://www.thebeliever.net/an-interview-with-tina-fey/#:~:text=This%20interview%20was%20conducted%20by,about%20asking%20her%20for%20details.">in a 2003 interview</a>, fueling the narrative. But Michaels insists that it is nonpartisan and willing to mock both sides.</p> <p>Morrison adds: “It isn’t to say he would ever be an apologist for the Trump regime; nobody could have expected that politics would jump the shark in quite this way. But he certainly would not hesitate to make fun of Democrats even now if they merit it and that’s part of it.</p> <p>“To quote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Downey_(comedian)">Jim Downey</a>, one of the show’s longtime writers, you never want the show to seem like it’s the comedy division of the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. Lorne is committed to that and that will help here as well.”</p> <p>David Litt, a<em><strong> </strong></em>former speechwriter for Barack Obama dubbed “the comic muse for the president” for his work on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/27/white-house-correspondents-dinner">White House Correspondents’ Association dinner </a>monologues, acknowledges that he has been on the receiving end.</p> <p><em>“</em>I was in the audience at SNL when their cold open was about the Obamacare website crashing,” he said. “I was working at the White House at the time and I remember thinking, I’m not having fun. Everyone else in the audience seemed be having a better time than I was.”</p> <p>Writing comic material under time pressure is tough, Litt says, and that will be the SNL team’s top priority for the new season. He said: “This is a show that rises to a pretty intense challenge every week and I assume they’re going to be thinking about rising to the exact same challenge, which is, how do we turn around a show that is good and funny because that’s hard enough without having the president of the United States breathing down your neck.</p> <p>“That’s part of what infuriates Trump so much about comedians. It’s not that they’re making fun of him, it’s that the audience is laughing. It’s connecting. If Kimmel or Colbert or weekend update was making a joke about Trump and the audience was rejecting that joke, I don’t think Trump would care. It’s the fact that it exposes him as still, despite everything, a fundamentally laughable person, or at least a human person.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN3q8jZ04_E"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FN3q8jZ04_E?wmode=opaque&start=161" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Litt, whose new book, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/21/david-litt-book-its-only-drowning">It’s Only Drowning</a>, is about his unlikely friendship with a Joe Rogan fan, adds: “I can’t imagine that people are going to be sitting around a writers’ room saying, how do we address this as though they were journalists. I think they’re saying, how do we do funny stuff? Because doing funny stuff is really hard.”</p> <p>SNL has already used up one potential Trump gag. Its cold open on 9 November last year, the first weekend after Trump won the presidential election, was entitled SNL for Trump and had cast members sarcastically trying to get on Trump’s good side, singing: “We will, whatever you want.” The sketch was a satirical take on the public figures and institutions that had shifted their stances or expressed deference to Trump for political or personal gain.</p> <p><a href="https://latenighter.com/author/billcarter/">Bill Carter</a>, author of the book The Late Shift and executive producer of the CNN docuseries The Story of Late Night, says: “The gauntlet has been thrown now and, if they don’t do something, they will disappoint people. People will be expecting their take and their take won’t be the most obvious one. It’ll be some creative way of approaching it. They have a very good Trump right now so they ought to use him.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/may/21/snl-best-sketches-50th-season">Saturday Night Live: the 10 best sketches from the 50th season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has frequently railed against SNL over the years and is likely to be watching its return with fingers poised for a hot take on the cold open. But like Morrison, Carter thinks it unlikely that SNL will suffer the same fate as Colbert or Kimmel.</p> <p>“Unlike those shows, Trump cannot say this has terrible ratings and does not make money,” he says. “Saturday Night Live does not have terrible ratings. In fact, with the right host, it will often be among the most watched shows on television. And it has the best demographics on any show on television except for sports.</p> <p>“The idea that they would abandon that show is nuts, because if they did, some streaming service would say, we’ll put on Saturday Night Live. It’s 50 years that show’s been on. It’s had an audience all those times of a new generation of viewers. It continues to do that so it’s a tremendously valuable franchise. NBC is not walking away from that show. I don’t care what pressure they put on it.”</p>
