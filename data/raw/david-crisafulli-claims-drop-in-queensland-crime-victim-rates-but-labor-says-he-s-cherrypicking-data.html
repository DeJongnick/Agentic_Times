<p>Queensland’s LNP government has released figures claiming a substantial drop in the state’s<strong> </strong>victims of crime rate, as the Labor opposition accuses it of cherrypicking data.</p> <p>During last year’s state election campaign, the premier, David Crisafulli, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/04/queensland-state-election-david-crisafulli-lnp">staked his leadership</a> on reducing the crime victim rates each year of his first term in government. He initially vowed to resign if crime victim numbers did not reduce under a government led by him, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/25/queensland-election-david-crisafulli-lnp-crime-numbers-policy">later walked that back</a>, claiming that he was referring to per capita rates, and not the overall number of victims.</p> <p>The government released police statistics on Tuesday, which Crisafulli claimed show crime victim rates had fallen by almost 6% in the first six months of the 2025 calendar year, compared to the first six months of 2024.</p> <p>He said there were 75,084 victims in the first half of 2024 compared to 72,588 this year. This represented about a 5.7% fall when adjusted for population growth.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kOxIA/1/" data-alt="Total victims of crime in Queensland for January to June each year from 2023 to 2025"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/kOxIA/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Crisafulli said he had done “a little better” than his electoral commitment.</p> <p>“A reduction of five and a bit per cent, it can only be described as the first step in the journey, because we are still off such historically high bases,” he said.</p> <p>“So if you’re asking whether or not I’m popping champagne corks, we’re a long way off that.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>The state’s victims of crime data is particularly significant politically, because during last year’s election campaign the premier <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/03/queensland-lnp-leader-david-crisafulli-says-he-would-quit-after-a-term-if-target-not-met">vowed to resign if the number went up</a>.</p> <p>But these numbers do not include the largest category of crime captured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics – “other theft” – which measures offending like shoplifting. There were more than 150,000 victims of “other theft” in the latest ABS data, from 2023, more than half the overall number.</p> <p>More than half of other theft offences occurred at a retail location, such as shoplifting, but the category also includes a broad range of other offences.</p> <p>“Robbery is down 13.2%. Break and enters are down 12%. Stolen cars are down 6.4%,” Crisafulli said.</p> <p>“Just to be clear, the information that we are presenting is Queensland police service data. It’s been there since 2001, so it is apples with apples.”</p>    <p>In an estimates hearing on Tuesday, the Labor leader, Steven Miles, accused the government of cherrypicking victim numbers.</p> <p>“Tens of thousands of Queenslanders are no longer considered victims in the eyes of David Crisafulli,” he said.</p> <p>“His victim data isn’t worth the paper that it’s printed on, because he’s cut corners, cherrypicked, and removed offences that should matter.</p> <p>“Victims of other theft could be the local independent grocer who has had stock swiped from their shelves, or someone who’s had items stolen from their car.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/15/domestic-violence-case-management-not-core-business-of-police-queenslands-top-cop-says">Domestic violence case management not ‘core business’ of police, Queensland’s top cop says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Crisafulli said the commonwealth methodology included crimes “that don’t relate to a victim”.</p> <p>“You’re counting a street sign as a victim of crime,” he said.</p> <p>The premier said the broader statistics “will be released” and the new numbers were simply an “additional tool – so not to replace it”.</p> <p>The new data also revealed the effect of the state’s brand <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/mar/06/coercive-control-stealthing-criminal-offences-law-queensland">new statute banning coercive control.</a></p> <p>There were just 42 registered victims of the crime since it became an enforceable offence in May.</p> <p>The release of the latest crime statistics came as the government announced a deal with the police union, hailed as the “largest ever” by the police union general president, Shane Prior.</p> <p>Police would receive an increase in base pay of at least 8% over the next three years, plus an $8,000 “retention bonus” and additional bonuses for working in a regional or rural area, or for working night or evening shifts.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
