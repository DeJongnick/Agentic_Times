Corot does not view their lives with either sentimentality or rage. This seems a genuine document of what he saw one early morning in the western Burgundy region when country folk were at work under the trees and a goose was walking by. What gives it such a matter of fact conviction is Corot’s brilliant eye for passing light. From the town silhouetted against the morning sky to the play of sunlight and shadow on rocks in the foreground, there’s a feel of fluid, ever-changing sunshine here that anticipates the impressionists.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/jean-baptiste-camille-corot-peasants-under-the-trees-at-dawn">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in Touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
