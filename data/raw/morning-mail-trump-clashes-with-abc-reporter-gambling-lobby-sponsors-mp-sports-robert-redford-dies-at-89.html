<p>Morning everyone. Donald Trump has had a testy exchange with the veteran ABC reporter John Lyons outside the White House after the journalist challenged the US president about his business dealings. Incidentally, Trump appeared to confirm an upcoming meeting with Anthony Albanese.</p> 
<p>We have an exclusive on the gambling industry’s sponsorship of the federal parliamentary sports club, and we’re also looking at Sussan Ley’s plans for welfare reform cuts.</p> 
<p>Robert Redford, who has died aged 89, has been hailed as one of the giants of cinema. And Jessica Hull earned a battling bronze in the 1500m in Tokyo.</p>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>After the huge far-right rally in London at the weekend, our UK chief reporter Daniel Boffey <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/sep/16/far-right-march-london-transatlantic">traces the links</a> between the British protest and nativist movements in the US, Germany and beyond. In particular, the shooting of Charlie Kirk provided a touchstone as “stories of social conflict or moral panic in one country are used to boost a political claim in another”.</p>
