Surely her time will come. The pain of coming so close again will sting for a while, but once it subsides she’ll be proud: she certainly wasn’t expecting too much coming into this week, after illness and injury. Yes, she’ll be back. Hats off as well to Mimi Rhodes, who made that snooker-loopy ace on the 5th, caroming her ball off Steph Kyriacou’s, the Aussie becoming the first player in golf history to record a hole-in-one (she aced the 8th on Friday) and an assist for someone else’s ace at the same major. Traditionalists needn’t bother arguing the toss, because she did do that, so assists are a new thing now.

Even then, she made two huge par saves, at 13 and 14, to keep things going. Kim A-lim briefly joined her at the top, and Charley Hull launched one of her trademark chases, but each time they got close, Yamashita held her nerve and her position. Just the one dropped shot, on 17, and even that wasn’t too egregious. A thoroughly deserved victory for a player who came so close at last year’s PGA, but has now gone one better.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-688f9e468f083d65b8bf2a8a" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-03T17:40:12.445Z">6.40pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Miyū Yamashita wins the 2025 Women's Open!</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Two careful putts, and Miyū Yamashita finishes with a round of 70.

Hats off to him for that, the man will forever be one of the great Open heroes.<sup>†</sup> So hats off also to Miyū Yamashita, who could take a careful iron out of the rough to take some greenside bunkers out of play, but instead lashes a wood for full effect. She tugs it a bit, and is fortunate to miss those aforementioned bunkers. But fortune favours the brave. The ball skips to the left of them, and she’ll have a wedge from light rough to reach the green in regulation.</p> <p><sub>†: Winning’s not everything.

Unless her compatriot Yamashita collapses in the Jean Van de Velde style, she’ll finish in a tie for second with Charley Hull.

Short-sided, with added undulations for extra misery.

First up, on the tee at the 184-yard par-three 5th, Steph Kyriacou, who whips her iron straight at the flag. It’s rolling towards the cup … but on it’s very last rotation, the ball turns to the left and stops at the side of the hole. Rhodes takes her turn, and sends an almost identical shot straight at the pin. This one’s going to miss the hole on the left … but it doesn’t miss Kyriacou’s ball, and kisses off it, snooker style, and in for an ace! That’s an outrageous sequence of events! Odds infinitesimal! Rhodes points to herself in disbelief, as if to ask: was that my ball that went in? And also: did that really happen?!?! Yep! She high-fives with Kyriacou, the pair grinning with delight. As Rhodes continues to cavort, Kyriacou walks off towards the green and shares a theatrical – and extremely good-humoured – joke with her caddie, both waving their arms in the dash-darn-god-damn-it fashion.
