<p>Good morning.</p> 
<p>JD Vance has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/21/jd-vance-arrives-in-israel-as-us-attempts-to-shore-up-fragile-gaza-ceasefi">expressed “great optimism”</a> over the Gaza truce plan, which he described as “durable” and “going better than expected” during a visit to Israel on Tuesday, two days after Israeli airstrikes killed 26 Palestinians.</p> 
<p>The vice-president’s trip, as part of the Trump administration’s efforts to strengthen the ceasefire agreement, came as Hamas officials joined talks in Cairo aimed at bridging outstanding differences with Israel.</p> 
<p>Gaza’s media office said Israel had violated the ceasefire <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/21/britain-sends-small-number-of-troops-to-monitor-gaza-ceasefire">80 times</a> and killed at least 80 Palestinians since the agreement took effect. On Tuesday the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, condemned Israel’s “continued violation” of the ceasefire.</p>

 <li><p><strong>What are </strong><strong>the ceasefire violations? </strong>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/21/britain-sends-small-number-of-troops-to-monitor-gaza-ceasefire">Israel launched lethal airstrikes</a> in Gaza that killed 26 Palestinians after two Israeli soldiers were killed in an attack the army blamed on Hamas. The militant group said it was not responsible because it had not had contact with fighters in the area since communications were cut off in March. The Israeli military later said it had resumed enforcing the ceasefire.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>What is Israel alleging about Hamas?</strong> Israel has accused Hamas of delaying the return of hostages’ bodies. Hamas has sent back 15 bodies but still needs to hand over 13 more. The group has said locating the remains will take time as many are buried under rubble.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Trump nominee to lead whistleblower office drops out after racist texts surface</strong></h2> 
<p>Paul Ingrassia, Donald Trump’s nominee to oversee federal whistleblower protections, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/21/trump-nominee-paul-ingrassia-racist-texts">dropped out after racist text messages</a> he sent surfaced this week.</p> 
<p>Ingrassia, a White House liaison at the Department of Homeland Security, allegedly described himself as having “a Nazi streak” and suggested Martin Luther King Jr Day should be “tossed into the seventh circle of hell”, according to texts leaked by Politico on Monday.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What did Ingrassia say?</strong> “I will be withdrawing myself from Thursday’s HSGAC hearing to lead the Office of Special Counsel because unfortunately I do not have enough Republican votes at this time,” he posted on Truth Social.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>Why did he drop out?</strong> John Thune, the Senate majority leader, was asked if the administration should pull Ingrassia’s nomination. “I think so. He’s not going to pass,” Thune said on Monday. By late afternoon on Tuesday, at least five Senate Republicans told the Washington Post they opposed Ingrassia’s nomination.</p></li>

<h2><strong>CIA playing ‘most important part’ in US strikes in the Caribbean, sources say</strong></h2> 
<p>The Central Intelligence Agency is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/21/us-strikes-caribbean-cia-role">providing the bulk of the intelligence</a> used to carry out lethal airstrikes by the Trump administration against small, fast boats in the Caribbean Sea suspected of carrying drugs from Venezuela, according to three sources familiar with the operations.</p> 
<p>The CIA’s main role in the boat strikes has not previously been disclosed. The administration has publicly announced seven<strong> </strong>strikes since September without disclosing details other than the number of people killed and the allegation that the boats carried narcotics.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What </strong><strong>is the CIA doing?</strong> The sources said the agency was providing real-time intelligence collected by satellites and signal intercepts to detect which boats it believes are loaded with drugs, tracking their routes and making recommendations about which vessels should be hit by missiles.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>What does it mean for holding the administration to account?</strong> “They are going to claim it’s classified and they are not going to release it publicly,” said Mark Lowenthal, a former CIA assistant director for analysis.</p></li>
