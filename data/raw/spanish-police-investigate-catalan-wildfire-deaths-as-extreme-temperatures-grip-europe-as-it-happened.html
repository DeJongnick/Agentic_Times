<p>Materials experts have used artificial intelligence <strong>to formulate new coatings that can keep buildings between 5C and 20C cooler than normal paint after exposure to midday sun</strong>.

That equates to 1.8 million fewer litres of milk each day, Coldiretti warns. Farmers have been forced to <strong>install fans and cooling sprays inside barns</strong> to help cows cope with the extreme heat, while adjusting feed with added minerals and potassium.</p> <p>In Piedmont, the heat has <strong>accelerated ripening</strong> by up to two weeks for key crops such as wheat, barley, tomatoes and grapes. Growers in the province of Turin are using protective nets to shield fruit from sun damage, amid a rise in infestations of <strong>Popillia japonica, a Japanese beetle</strong> that poses a growing threat to vineyards and orchards.</p>    <p>In the central and southern regions, the toll is mounting. In Tuscany’s Maremma countryside, hundreds of kilos of <strong>melons have been effectively “cooked” on the vine</strong>, rendering them unsellable. Concerns are growing for watermelons, peaches, plums, tomatoes and aubergines, as relentless heat and dry soils accelerate stress.</p> <p>Umbria has already seen <strong>spring crops like sunflowers and maize suffer</strong> under prolonged heat. In Molise, some dairy farms have recorded production losses of up to 30%. In Sardinia’s Nurra region, <strong>irrigation for forage crops like alfalfa has been suspended</strong> due to water shortages — leaving livestock farmers scrambling for alternatives.</p> <p>Puglia is seeing declines not just in milk, but also in egg and honey production. The collapse in oats and barley yields — essential feed for animals — has added further strain.</p> <p>Yet it is the south’s drought that looms largest. National reservoirs are running 164 million cubic metres below capacity. In western Sicily, water supply to farms is intermittent at best, and milk yields are falling. <strong>Vineyards in the Trapani region are on alert for outbreaks of downy mildew</strong>, a disease triggered by a mix of humidity and heat.</p> <p>While the south bakes, the north faces its own extremes. In the Aosta Valley, Coldiretti reports <strong>a string of night-time hailstorms</strong>, as well as landslides and mudflows caused by unstable weather patterns.</p> <p>Italy’s farmers, already on the frontlines of climate volatility, are bracing for what could be a devastating summer season.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686525ed8f08b4eac5f8d9a6" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/lorenzo-tondo"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-02T12:30:05.605Z">1.30pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>A <strong>70-year-old lorry driver</strong> has been found dead inside his vehicle in <strong>northern Italy, </strong>with at least three fatalities linked to the ongoing heatwave.</p> <p>The man was discovered shortly after 6.30am on Wednesday, parked at a motorway rest area between <strong>Sirmione</strong> and <strong>Peschiera del Garda</strong>, in the province of Brescia. <strong>Emergency services</strong> arrived at the scene, including fire crews, medical responders and officers from the Padova Sud motorway police unit, but were unable to revive him.</p> <p>Initial reports suggest the man died of a sudden illness, and while the exact cause has yet to be confirmed, doctors believe the <strong>extreme heat may have been a contributing factor</strong>.</p> <p>Earlier, there were separate reports about a 47-year-old construction worker who collapsed and died near Bologna while working in extreme heat, and of a woman in Sicily.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-07-02T12:53:02.201Z">at 1.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68651b928f08b4eac5f8d91b" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-02T12:21:00.949Z">1.21pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Leaders should remind the public why ambitious targets matter - The Guardian's view</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>The Guardian’s view</em></p> <p>At times like now, with dangerously high temperatures in several European countries, <strong>the urgent need for adaptation to an increasingly unstable climate is clearer than ever.</strong></p>    <p>Could <strong>the current dangerous heat help to refocus minds</strong>? Portugal and Spain both recorded new records at the weekend, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/30/spain-records-highs-of-46c-and-france-under-alert-as-europe-swelters-in-heatwave">temperatures over 46C</a>. This week, scientists at a conference in Exeter are gathering to discuss climate tipping points. Generally this term refers to the passing of dangerous limits – such as melted ice sheets – after which catastrophe becomes much harder to prevent. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2025/jun/28/tipping-points-social-expert-on-fixing-climate-crisis">Prof Timothy Lenton</a> points out that it can also be used positively. Two examples are the accelerating uptake of solar power and electric vehicles.</p> <p>As well as supporting people to cope with the heat, and promoting adaptations of various kinds (for example, in building and urban design), <strong>European leaders should use current conditions to remind the public how much is at stake, and reinforce the importance of ambitious, achievable targets.</strong></p> <p>Climate despair is deadly, but the anxiety produced by recognition of the risks can be harnessed to positive effect.

More homes in the south of France have air-conditioning with comparatively few in the Paris area or the east of France.</p> <p>The <strong>government attacked the far-right as ignorant and “incompetent” for suggesting air-conditioning was a solution to the climate crisis.</strong> The environment minister, <strong>Agnès Pannier-Runacher</strong>, said air-conditioned spaces in care homes for elderly people had been obligatory in France for 20 years. She said that, although vulnerable people should be protected from the heat, air conditioning “must not be installed everywhere” because it generated a rise in temperatures outside and was “the wrong answer”.</p> <p>The Green leader, <strong>Marine Tondelier</strong>, attacked Le Pen for an environmental policy limited to “buying air-conditioning units”. Tondelier said there had to be progress made on green spaces in cities and proper insulation of buildings.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-686513558f0855feb5563cef" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/samjones"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-07-02T11:32:54.378Z">12.32pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Police investigating two deaths in Catalan wildfire</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Officers from <strong>Catalonia’s</strong> regional police force, <strong>the Mossos d’Esquadra</strong>, are <strong>investigating the deaths of the two men</strong> whose bodies were found on Tuesday by firefighters tackling the blaze near the town of <strong>Coscó in Lleida</strong> province.</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="5dd632bf87b0401dba57ff89c9bed69f63e38c83"> <img src="https://media.guim.co.uk/5dd632bf87b0401dba57ff89c9bed69f63e38c83/0_0_1200_960/1000.jpg" alt="In this photo released by Agents Rurals de Catalunya, uncontrolled fire rages across the grasslands in the Segarra region, in the rural province of Lleida, Spain." width="1000" height="800" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">In this photo released by Agents Rurals de Catalunya, uncontrolled fire rages across the grasslands in the Segarra region, in the rural province of Lleida, Spain.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Agents Rurals de Catalunya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>According to the Catalan interior minister, <strong>Núria Parlon</strong>, the two victims were <strong>farm workers who had been trapped by the flames as they tried to reach their vehicles.</strong></p> <p>In a statement, the regional fire department said <strong>the wildfire had shown “extremely violent and erratic behaviour due to the influence of the nearby storms”</strong>, adding that the arrival of rain had helped bring the blaze under control.</p> <p>“Like yesterday, today is going to be complicated with regard to the risk of forest fires,” the service said on Wednesday morning. “The arrival of the storms that have been forecast for this afternoon could make extinguishing the fires more complicated.
