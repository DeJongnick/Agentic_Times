<p>Multiple maternal and child health programs have been eliminated or hollowed out as part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) layoffs, prompting alarm and disbelief among advocates working to make Americans healthier.</p> <p>The fear and anxiety come as a full accounting of the cuts remains elusive. Federal health officials have released only broad descriptions of changes to be made, rather than a detailed accounting of the programs and departments being eviscerated.</p> <p>“Pediatricians, myself included, are losing sleep at night – worried about the health of the nation’s children,” said Dr Sue Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p> <p>“The one that stands out to me is the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. There is no way to make our country healthier by eliminating expertise where it all starts, and it all starts at maternal and child health.”</p> <p>The health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, announced HHS would eliminate 10,000 jobs as part of a restructuring plan. Together with cuts already made by Elon Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”, HHS is likely to lose 20,000 workers – roughly one-quarter of its workforce.</p> <p>“We aren’t just reducing bureaucratic sprawl,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/rfk-jr-health-department-cuts">Kennedy said</a>. “We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.”</p> <p>Piecemeal and crowd-sourced information, which has filled the vacuum left by a lack of information from the health department, appears to show maternal health programs slated for elimination, many without an indication of whether they will be reassigned. The Guardian asked HHS to comment on the cuts but did not receive a response.</p> <p>The picture of cuts was further muddied on Thursday when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/rfk-jr-doge-cuts">Kennedy told reporters</a>, according to Politico: “We’re going to do 80% cuts, but 20% of those are going to have to be reinstalled, because we’ll make mistakes.”</p> <p>In the aftermath of the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, there’s been much conservative criticism of public health agencies, particularly the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/07/election-trump-antivax-movement">Pandemic policy</a> continues to be an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/vaccine-disinformation-trump-measles-covid">animating force</a> within the Republican party, whose supporters are cynical about the value of federal public health programs following federal vaccine mandates.</p> <p>The cuts to maternal health programs may serve a second purpose for Republicans.</p> <p>Such programs have <a href="https://stateline.org/2025/01/15/maternal-death-reviews-get-political-as-state-officials-intrude/">come under fire</a> in some conservative states, in part because the experts involved investigate deaths that could have been prevented with abortion services – now illegal or severely restricted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/29/abortion-laws-bans-by-state">nearly two dozen conservative states</a>.</p> <p>As part of the restructuring, the administration announced 28 divisions would be folded into 15, including the creation of a new division, called the “Administration for a Healthy America”, or “AHA”.</p> <p>The administration argued the “centralization” would “improve coordination of health resources for low-income Americans and will focus on areas including, primary care, maternal and child Health, mental health, environmental health, HIV/Aids and workforce development”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, experts in HIV/Aids, worker health and safety, healthcare for society’s most vulnerable, and experts in maternal and child health have received “reduction in force” notices, a federal term for layoffs, or have been placed on administrative leave with the expectation of being eliminated.</p> <p>“It certainly appears there was a particular focus on parts of HHS that dealt with women’s or reproductive health,” said Sean Tipton, chief policy officer at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, about the cuts.</p> <p>He added: “How in the world you can justify the CDC eliminating the division of maternal mortality is beyond me.”</p> <p>Among the divisions hard-hit was the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), an operating division of HHS like the CDC, which housed the the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. HRSA lost as many as <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/01/kennedy-lays-off-thousands-across-the-health-bureaucracy-00262913">600 workers</a>.</p> <p>The CDC’s division of reproductive health, which studies maternal health, appeared to have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/health/cdc-layoffs-kennedy.html">nearly eliminated</a>, according to multiple reports, with some of the division’s portfolio also expected to be folded into AHA.</p> <p>The entire staff of a gold-standard maternal mortality survey, a program that was called the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, was also put on leave, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/prams-maternal-mortality-cdc-layoffs/">Stat reported</a>. The epidemiologist in charge of the CDC survey, Jennifer Bombard, wrote to colleagues on Tuesday: “[T]he entire CDC PRAMS team, including myself, has received the Reduction in Force (RIF) notice from HHS today.”</p> <p>Staff that oversaw an HRSA hotline that fields calls from new moms seeking mental health support were also cut, <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/03/national-quit-line-mental-health-hotline-hhs-cuts/">Stat</a> reported, although the hotline remains operational. Layoffs at the Administration for Children and Families have jolted providers of federally backed high-quality childcare for low-income families, a program called <a href="https://apnews.com/article/head-start-office-closures-hhs-trump-00b1a6b33ef918cb66e59b7ffb07ac13">Head Start</a>.</p> <p>The CDC’s only experts on infertility were laid off, just days after Trump described himself as the “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/trump-touts-ivf-expansion-calls-himself-fertilization-president-at-women-s-event-235451973833">fertilization president</a>” at an <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/trump-fertilisation-president-women-history-month-b2722241.html">event</a> marking Women’s History Month. The team had collected congressionally mandated statistics on fertility clinics’ success rates. Without the workers, it is unclear who at the department will help fertility clinics comply with the law.</p> <p>“I’m astounded, sad, perplexed,” said Barbara Collura, president of Resolve: The National Infertility Association. “Infertility impacts one in six people globally, and now we don’t have anybody at the CDC who knows anything about infertility and IVF?”</p> <p>A division of the CDC called the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention also appeared to be gutted, with the director Jonathan Mermin placed on <a href="https://x.com/samstein/status/1907085717102059620">administrative leave</a>. Among the center’s many tasks, it worked to curb the spread of congenital syphilis, a debilitating disease that is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/oct/17/congenital-syphilis-crisis-us-biden-administration">on the rise</a> in the US.</p> <p>The March of Dimes, an influential non-profit whose mission is to improve the health of mothers and babies, said the cuts “raise serious concerns” at a time when maternal mortality rates remain “alarmingly high”.</p> <p>“As an OB-GYN and public health leader, I can’t overstate the value these resources and programs – and our partners across CDC, HRSA, and NIH – have brought to families and frontline providers,” said Dr Amanda Williams, the interim chief medical Officer at the March of Dimes.</p> <p>“We rely on the data, research, clinical tools and partnerships built by the Division of Reproductive Health (DRH) and HRSA to protect maternal and infant health – especially in communities hit hardest.”</p> <p>Heads of National Institutes of Health (NIH) centers were also forced out – and, apparently, offered reassignment to the Indian Health Service to be stationed in Alaska, Montana or Oklahoma, the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01016-z">Nature</a> reported. Such large-scale reassignments are unprecedented, according to <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/nih-rif-1200-layoffs-raise-concerns-health-medicine-biomedical-research/">Stat</a>.</p> <p>Among those to be placed on leave was one of the federal government’s pre-eminent leaders of research, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/director">Dr Jeanne Marrazzo</a>. Marrazzo had expertise in sexually transmitted infections and women’s reproductive tract infections – a background that gave health advocates hope of curbing the US’s sky-high STD rates. Dr Diana Bianchi, director of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, was also forced out.</p> <p>“These cuts are significant,” Kressly said. “And the policy and program changes that are made because the cuts impact real people in real communities, and I’m not just talking about the people who lost their jobs.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 April 2025 to clarify that while staff that oversaw an HRSA hotline were cut, the hotline remains operational.</p>
