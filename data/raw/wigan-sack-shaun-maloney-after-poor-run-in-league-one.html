<p>Wigan Athletic have sacked Shaun Maloney after a 2-1 home defeat by Reading left the club 15th in League One and with only one win from the past seven league games.</p> <p>Maloney took charge of the Latics in January 2023 and comfortably kept the club in the third tier despite an eight-point deduction. But despite this achievement, the board feels the club has gone backwards and that a new manager is necessary to improve results.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/feb/25/proposed-sale-reading-robert-platek-conflict-of-interest-concerns-efl">Proposed sale of Reading to Robert Platek faces conflict of interest concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“It cannot be overlooked that the current League One campaign has clearly not progressed as anticipated,” said a club statement. “Home results and performances, in particular, have been disappointing and below the standard at which our supporters expect. For this reason, the board felt that it was time for a change.”</p> <p>Maloney was a popular former player for Wigan, spending four seasons at the club between 2011 and 2015, and managed Hibernian before he joined the Latics.</p> <p>Wigan’s assistant manager, Max Rogers, has also departed. Glenn Whelan will take interim charge supported by Graham Barrow and Frankie Bunn. Wigan are back in League One action on Tuesday at Mansfield.</p>
