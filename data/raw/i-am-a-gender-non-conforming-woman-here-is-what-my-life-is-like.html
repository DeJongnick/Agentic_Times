<p>Re your article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/12/ive-been-spat-on-gender-non-conforming-women-tell-of-toilet-abuse-in-aftermath-of-supreme-court-ruling">‘I’ve been spat on’: gender non-conforming women tell of toilet abuse after UK’s supreme court ruling, 12 August</a>), while it is possible that these women’s experiences are as a&nbsp;result of the recent supreme court&nbsp;ruling, this has been happening to me and others I know for a long time. A very long time.</p> <p>My experience as a gender non-conforming 37-year-old woman is that, since I was about eight, I&nbsp;have been regularly mistaken for a boy or man, and that a few times a year, these incidents are deeply embarrassing to me or involve someone being openly hostile.</p> <p>For example, in 2022, when flying to the US, I was detained for an enhanced search because they did not believe that I was female, as stated in my passport. I was humiliated to the point of tears, not least because I&nbsp;had recently shaved my head for brain surgery for a tumour and had a prominent scar.</p> <p>I have long lived in a world where I expect to be mistaken for a man and feel on edge as a result. My crimes? Being 5ft 8in, slim-ish, with short hair, an angular face, a deeper voice, and preferring loose clothing. Perhaps my walk is a little confident. The chromosomes remain XX.</p> <p>This isn’t about the trans or non-binary debate. The real issue is that in this country, we have an extremely reductive view of what even a biological woman should look like, sound like and dress like. To an extent, the challenge to binaries has unfortunately and bizarrely played a role in reducing the visual and social footprint of natal womanhood even further. I am regularly asked by well-meaners my pronouns too –&nbsp;something I find just as insulting.</p> <p>The way I am is no statement, no protest, no challenge. It is simply how I have always been. Comfy, lazy, functional. Why should those be the preserve of men?<br><strong>Felicity Hawksley</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
