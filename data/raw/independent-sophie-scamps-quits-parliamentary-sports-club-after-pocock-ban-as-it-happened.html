  <p><strong>Bishop says ANU staff and students ‘accept’ she won’t resign</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Julie Bishop</strong> has claimed community support for her to stay on as chancellor at the Australian National University after announcing the institution will break even in 2026.</p> 
  <p>The former politician has resisted calls to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/18/australian-national-university-no-more-forced-job-cuts-anu-restructure">follow ANU’s former vice-chancellor, Prof Genevieve Bell</a>, who resigned in September amid widespread concerns over a controversial restructure program. More than 2,000 staff and students signed a union-led petition demanding Bishop’s resignation earlier this year.</p> 
  <p>Bishop defended her record as chancellor of the ANU, saying she had community support. Asked about staff and student calls for her to resign, Bishop told Senate estimates:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That’s not the feedback that I’ve been getting, senator. In fact, the deans have confirmed their support for me. The council has confirmed their support for me …</p> 
   <p>I have met with many staff and students. I’ve met with the [staff union] representatives. I’ve met with the [student association] representatives, and they accept the council’s position in relation to my role.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She said the organisation expected to return to a break-even financial position at the end of 2026, after record years of operating losses and budget deficits.</p> 
  <p>Budget balance was the aim of ANU’s restructure program, which has seen course cuts, allegations of toxic work culture and at least 399 redundancies since it began in 2024.</p>

  <p><strong>‘We need a bigger scheme’: transport bureaucrat on alleged multimillion-dollar kickbacks</strong></p> 
  <p>Returning to the NSW Icac, the commission has heard about the ways in which a former transport bureaucrat sought to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/09/nsw-transport-bureaucrat-cash-bribes-oporto-fake-invoices-ntwnfb">increase earnings from kickback schemes</a> under which he allegedly received more than $11.5m.</p> 
  <p>In a text message of November 2018, <strong>Ibrahim Helmy</strong> wrote to alleged co-conspirator <strong>Peter Le</strong>: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We need a bigger scheme … One that will make us back everything.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Helmy admitted he had previously encouraged <strong>Adam Spilsted</strong>, operations manager of contractor Direct Traffic, to apply for work in other regions of NSW, but denied he told him to use fake addresses to suggest the company had depots in those areas.</p> 
  <p>Several of the addresses used in the company’s application for government work allegedly referred to caravan parks in western NSW, while others were found to be made up. “I don’t even know what caravan parks are,” Helmy told the commission today, although he later clarified that he did.</p> 
  <p>Helmy admitted that from 2019 he began to receive payments from Direct Traffic, initially in the form of $1000 Australia Post gift cards, under an agreement that he would receive a percentage of the contracts it was awarded.</p> 
  <p>Helmy admitted to creating a spreadsheet which showed he was owed about $680,000 as of June 2021, but said it did not accurately reflect a sliding percentage scale he had allegedly agreed with Spilsted. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I don’t know why this one says 3% all the way through. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Helmy will give further evidence to the inquiry next week.</p>

  <p><strong>Liberal MP takes a swipe at Pocock’s sports club ban</strong></p> 
  <p>The criticism over the decision to boot <strong>David Pocock</strong> from the parliamentary sports club is coming in thick and fast.</p> 
  <p>Liberal MP <strong>Simon Kennedy</strong> took a swipe at Pocock’s ban, which came after he raised concerns about the club’s sponsorship by the gambling industry. Kennedy said the government needed to do more on gambling.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>The prime minister’s the [president] of the sports club and he’s also been sitting on the Murphy Review for more than 830 days. The PM and Labor have a gambling problem … The prime minister needs to stand up, respond to the Murphy report and protect vulnerable Australians.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Kennedy has been pressing the government to take action to curb online sports betting TV ads during sports matches.</p> 
  <p>The MP, who replaced former prime minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> and regularly plays matches organised by the club, said Pocock should be reinstated.</p> 
  <p>He joked:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We beat Pocock and Queensland in last year’s touch footy State of Origin – but even I wouldn’t wish Pocock off the team. Without him, [Liberal MP] <strong>Phil Thompson</strong> will be Queensland’s fastest player, and that’s saying something.</em></p>

  <p>Two people have died on a private property in Tasmania’s north-west after a tree fell in wild winds. It comes amid wet weather and severe wind across the state, with gusts reaching 139km/h in the state’s south-west.</p> 
  <p>Emergency services were called to the scene about 12.10pm, police said.</p> 
  <p>According to the ABC, the state police’s acting commander, <strong>Brenda Orr</strong>, said: “It appears that the severe weather has resulted in a tree falling on private property, resulting in the death of those two people. No other people have been injured.</p> 
  <p>“Both people were on private property, out in the open, when a tree fell.”</p> 
  <p>Tasmania SES said it had responded to 72 requests for assistance today, with most due to wind-related damage.</p> 
  <p><strong>Chris Irvine</strong>, the Tasmania SES’s acting assistant director of operations and resources, said volunteers had been assisting the community since the early hours of the morning.</p> 
  <p>Irvine said widespread gusts of up to 110km/h were expected across the state this afternoon, before easing this evening.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Members of the public should take all precautions for their own personal safety and be aware of the potential for falling trees and branches.</p>

  <p>In Senate estimates, Department of Foreign Affairs (Dfat) officials confirmed those representations also included discussions by the prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, and foreign affairs minister, <strong>Penny Wong</strong>. The official said the most recent was by Wong with her Iraqi counterpart at the UN general assembly last month, following Pether’s release.</p>

  <p><strong>Former NSW transport bureaucrat admits contractor’s offer to return favour meant ‘nothing else’ but cash benefit</strong></p> 
  <p>Returning to the Icac hearing on an alleged multimillion-dollar kickback scheme involving NSW transport workers, the commission has seen messages from a contractor thanking former transport bureaucrat&nbsp;<strong>Ibrahim Helmy</strong>&nbsp;for assisting with an application to be included on a government roadwork suppliers’ panel.</p> 
  <p>One message sent before the deadline by <strong>Adam Spilsted</strong>, the operations manager for contractor Direct Traffic, said he hoped the company could “return the favour”.</p> 
  <p>Asked by counsel assisting <strong>Rob Ranken</strong> <strong>SC</strong> what he understood by this, Helmy replied that he was not expecting payment for his initial help with the application. Later, Ranken asked again: “What other benefit did you have in mind if it wasn’t cash?”</p> 
  <p>Helmy said: “Yeah, I guess there’s nothing else.”</p> 
  <p>Helmy said an informal agreement was reached several days before the application deadline at a dinner meeting with Spilsted and his wife, <strong>Mechelina Van Der Ende-Plakke</strong>, a director of Direct Traffic. Helmy was asked about later messages to a female associate in which he wrote: “They [Direct Traffic] still aren’t sure why I’m helping them.”</p> 
  <p>“I think I didn’t want to tell her what I was doing at the time,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Spilsted told the inquiry in July that Helmy initially offered to help secure roadwork contracts because he knew his father, although he said he later went <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-07-24/icac-transport-for-nsw-kickbacks-inquiry-traffic-controller/105569350">behind his “wife’s back”</a> to pay alleged kickbacks to Helmy.</p>

  <p><strong>Queensland confirms state-owned coal plants will run for up to a decade longer</strong></p> 
  <p>The Queensland government has released a <a href="https://www.treasury.qld.gov.au/policies-and-programs/energy/energy-roadmap/">new five-year energy roadmap</a>, extending the life of its state-owned coal plants by up to a decade compared to the previous government’s plans.</p> 
  <p>The state’s treasurer and energy minister, <strong>David Janetzki</strong>, is speaking to the Queensland media club, saying the plan is “pragmatic and realistic”.</p> 
  <p>He said the plan was “grounded in realities of consumer needs, infrastructure costs and deliverability time frames”. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>That means the journey will be delivered the Queensland way.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> was asked about the coal extension during his press conference today, before the state government confirmed it. <br><br>At the time, he said he wouldn’t comment on “speculation” but pressed: “We know that the cheapest form of new energy is, of course, renewables.”</p>

  <p><strong>Former transport bureaucrat allegedly sought to help contractor under agreement to ‘return the favour’</strong></p> 
  <p>The former transport bureaucrat at the centre of an alleged multimillion-dollar kickback scheme is giving evidence before the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) again today.</p> 
  <p>As we reported yesterday, <strong>Ibrahim Helmy</strong> has admitted to artificially inflating invoices for one contractor in order to share the difference with them. Helmy was allegedly paid with envelopes of cash, some at an Oporto fast-food restaurant in western Sydney.</p> 
  <p>Today, the commission has heard evidence of how he allegedly sought to help another contractor, Direct Traffic, secure a potentially lucrative position on a panel of confirmed roadwork suppliers for the Department for Transport in September 2018.</p> 
  <p>That allegedly includes sharing confidential documents with them close to the deadline to assist with their last-minute application, as well as offering to change their format to make it editable.</p> 
  <p>The hearing has again focused on the informal language used in messages between Helmy and an alleged co-conspirator in the transport department, <strong>Peter Le</strong>. “Hey sexy boy,” Helmy messaged Le on the day before the deadline. “Sorry to do this to u [sic] … But can u send these plans in word not pdf.”</p> 
  <p>“I better be getting paaaaid for this,” Le wrote back. Helmy told the commission Le’s reference to getting paid was “just a joke”. “I hadn’t told him who I’m sending [the documents] to at this stage,” he said.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW announces $145m first all-electric bus depot for Macquarie Park</strong> </p> 
  <p>Sydney’s first purpose-built all-electric bus depot is to be built in Macquarie Park and will service 150 buses running on routes across the city’s north.</p> 
  <p>The depot, due to open by 2028, is part of the state’s conversion of 8,000 buses to zero-emission technology.</p> 
  <p>The transport minister,&nbsp;<strong>John Graham,</strong>&nbsp;said the announcement of the $145m depot, jointly funded by federal and state governments, was a “big moment” in the rollout.</p> 
  <p>“This first all-electric depot really is a big step forward,” he told reporters this morning. “It’s really unprecedented to be building an all-electric [depot].”</p> 
  <p><strong>Jerome Laxale</strong>, the federal member for Bennelong, said it was a “great day” and that the project, including its $115m commonwealth contribution, had been “easy to fight for”.</p> 
  <p>In September, Brookvale became the first of Sydney’s 11 bus depots to be converted. Leichhardt and Kingsgrove are expected to be fitted with electric chargers by 2026.</p> 
  <p>The ACT and Victoria have electric bus depots, while Western Australia is building its first fully electric site. South Australia is installing electric chargers at its Morphettville depot.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Coalition’s immigration spokesperson has taken a thinly veiled swipe at <strong>Andrew Hastie</strong> in a speech to the Migration Institute of Australia this afternoon.</p> 
  <p><strong>Paul Scarr</strong>, a moderate, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/29/real-people-real-families-coalition-signals-dramatic-shift-away-from-anti-immigration-rhetoric-of-dutton-era">promised a more empathetic</a> and measured approach to migration when coming into the role, and says debate on the issue must be “based on evidence and facts”.</p> 
  <p>Hastie has recently made public comments about “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/09/australia-is-not-the-usa-labor-accuses-coalition-of-importing-trump-style-culture-war-on-immigration">mass migration</a>” – a term Scarr has rejected – and said migration levels have made Australians feel like “strangers” in their own country.</p> 
  <p>In his speech, Scarr said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The debate with respect to Australia’s immigration policy must be had. It is an important debate. But the debate must be based on evidence and facts. It must be measured and considered. <strong>It must not seek to inflame emotion, but rather to engage in good faith.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The shadow immigration minister also didn’t hold back on his criticism of the home affairs minister, <strong>Tony Burke</strong>, accusing him of vacating the space and neglecting to have a nuanced debate.</p> 
  <p>He said when Burke recently revealed Australia’s permanent migration intake for this year, he did so in a three-sentence statement, which was “simply not good enough”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>When making proposals, it is simply not good enough to provide a number without explaining how you derived that number. You need to be clear on proposed policy settings and linking them to how you are going to achieve outcomes. You need to be able to answer detailed questions about numbers for different visa categories.<strong> If you do not do that, you lose credibility</strong> …</p> 
   <p>It is especially not good enough in the context of Australia going through one of the most tumultuous periods of discussion of immigration policy in recent times. Transparency is important … <strong>Otherwise, the vacuum is left to be filled by the extreme fringe elements</strong>.</p>

  <p>Albanese is asked about the story by my colleague, <strong>Henry Belot, </strong>on ACT independent senator David Pocock’s ban from attending Parliament House’s social sports club after the former Wallabies star raised concerns over the gambling industry sponsoring it. </p>

  <p>Like a football, Albanese punts the question and takes a dig at Pocock. (I’ll note here the government is still under serious pressure for not responding to a landmark gambling inquiry report by the late <strong>Peta Murphy,</strong> which was handed down more than two years ago.)</p>

  <p><strong>PM says ‘nothing unusual’ about receiving briefings on super bill</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> tries to pour cold water on revelations from estimates yesterday that the PM’s office has been taking an interest in the treasurer’s superannuation tax bill for accounts more than $3m.</p> 
  <p>He was asked a few times (in a few different ways) why the PM’s office would take a briefing on the bill. Albanese said it was a normal process.</p> 
  <p>He added that there would be no changes to the legislation (which still doesn’t have the support of the Coalition or Greens to pass through the Senate).</p>

  <p>Albanese declined to specify what concerns had been raised over the bill when answering a later question, saying that the government “makes no apologies” for engaging with people.</p>

  <p><strong>Bullock says housing policy ‘not my bailiwick’</strong></p> 
  <p>At Senate estimates, there was an interesting exchange between the RBA governor, <strong>Michele Bullock,</strong> and Greens senator <strong>Nick McKim</strong> over housing unaffordability.</p> 
  <p>Bullock has consistently called for more supply to ease housing pressures, but declined to comment on how other government initiatives or policies might affect prices.</p> 
  <p>While the impact of supply shortages is widely acknowledged as a major contributor to unaffordability, the Howard-era decision to halve the rate of capital gains tax has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/13/great-job-good-education-no-home-is-australias-bloated-property-market-destroying-the-middle-class">made dwellings even more attractive to investors</a> at the expense of owner-occupiers. Investors have also taken full advantage of negative gearing.</p> 
  <p>McKim asked Bullock why she wouldn’t address policies like the CGT discount while “being very happy to talk about supply”. Bullock said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There’s a plethora of policies, and I have not done analysis of looking at those various policies to decide whether or not different policies would have different impacts and what you should do with them holistically. That’s not my bailiwick.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The RBA regularly refers to its dual mandate of setting monetary policy to achieve both price stability and full employment for not commenting on specific government policies. But the RBA does consider financial stability implications for any potential problems in the housing market.</p>

  <p><strong>Bullock tells Senate estimates inflation is ‘sticky’</strong></p> 
  <p>The Reserve Bank governor, <strong>Michele Bullock,</strong> has described services inflation as “sticky”, amid signs households costs are trending up, at Senate estimates this morning.</p> 
  <p>Services inflation refers to important household items including rents, insurance, education and medical costs. Bullock said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’d have to say that in Australia, like many other countries, services inflation does remain a little sticky.</p> 
   <p>It is higher. It’s been offset by slightly lower goods inflation, but services inflation is still up around 3%, and in some countries, it’s a bit higher than that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Last month, the RBA’s monetary policy board <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/30/rba-interest-rate-news-decision-dithers-on-cut-not-political-flashpoint-it-was">held the cash rate steady</a> at 3.6%, dashing hopes of mortgage holders that the central bank would deliver further interest rate relief.</p> 
  <p>Analysts were alarmed in September after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/26/inflation-jim-chalmers-nobody-wanted-to-say-mission-accomplished">monthly inflation figures</a> showed price growth jumped back to 3% in the year to August, the very top of the central bank’s target range, moderating hopes of further rate cuts.</p> 
  <p>Bullock said she expects the unemployment rate to “drift a little bit higher” for the remainder of the year, even as the labour market remains in a “pretty good place”.</p> 
  <p>Any persistent increase in inflation and unemployment could prove tricky for the RBA, given the central bank would typically raise rates to combat inflation and cut rates to address rising unemployment.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted">

  <p>Weighing in, independent MP <strong>Nicolette Boele</strong> tells ABC RN Breakfast she’s concerned that the government just “has an idea and runs with it” instead of having a whole-scale reform conversation about taxation which is what her colleague and fellow independent, <strong>Allegra Spender</strong> has been pushing for, and what Boele believes her community wants:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is too often what happens when you get a government that has such a large majority that they don’t take people along on key policy issues.</p> 
   <p>People have been planning for decades for how they save for retirement and structure those investments. So any changes that are made to super need to be considered and provide people looking to retire with plenty of warning.</p>

  <p><strong>Former US envoy predicts Israel will agree to ceasefire deal</strong></p> 
  <p>Israel’s security cabinet will likely agree to the Gaza ceasefire deal when they meet today, says a former US Middle East envoy for humanitarian issues.</p> 
  <p><strong>David Satterfield</strong>, the former envoy and former US ambassador to Turkey, tells ABC RN Breakfast he believes the circumstances created by president Trump, and the Arab League have made the first phase a “deal they cannot say no to”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I don’t think there are high risks to this first phase. The ceasefire, the release of the living hostages, the rapid identification and turnover of those bodies that can be found, and the introduction of humanitarian assistance, coupled with that, first of all steps, the Israeli withdrawal to the agreed initial line. I think that will happen. The problematic and hard to negotiate issues are what follows. This phase one is, if you will, the opening of the door.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But the toughest point of the plan will be the disarmament of Hamas and its removal of power, which Satterfield are “absolutely linked”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>An armed Hamas is a Hamas which will retain the ability to assert, albeit clandestinely, effective governance. Disarmament must be in parallel to the process of shifting Hamas out of that effective governance role. And so the question that has to be raised here is what pressures can be brought to bear upon Hamas in order to affect that goal.</p>

  <p>Labor MP <strong>Josh Burns</strong>, who’s just won the McKinnon Prize for political leadership alongside Liberal MP <strong>Julian Leeser</strong> for their roles in fighting antisemitism, says the deal brings “cautious optimism”.</p> 
  <p>Burns tells ABC News Breakfast today is about the families having their loved ones return home and about the Palestinians who have “been living in tents and who have been displaced from their homes”.</p> 
  <p>On what this means for Australia and whether the deal will help lower the temperature of debate, Burns says he hopes everyone can “take a big breath”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What I think really matters is how we talk about difficult things and how we see the humanity in one another, and I really hope that some of the dehumanising and some of the attacking we have seen across society can take – everyone can take a big breath and we can all look at each other and see more humanity.</p>

  <p><strong>‘Hard not to be excited’ about Gaza plan: Mark Butler</strong></p> 
  <p>On Sunrise this morning the health minister, <strong>Mark Butler,</strong> and Liberal senator <strong>Jane Hume</strong> are both positive on the progress of the Gaza deal, but acknowledge it’s still “early days”. You can read more on the latest of the peace deal on our live blog <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/09/gaza-ceasefire-live-trump-says-hostages-probably-released-monday-idf-says-gaza-city-still-extremely-dangerous">here</a>.</p> 
  <p>Butler says its hard not to be excited that perhaps the “worst of this awful conflict is behind us:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The prospect of hostages returning to their families in Israel, Defence Forces starting to withdraw from Gaza, humanitarian aid flowing again to civilians there, is very hard not to be excited that we are finally on the road to peace.</p> 
   <p>We don’t underestimate the possibility that things can fall off the rails, which is why we do urge all parties to stick to the letter of President Trump’s 20-point plan.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>While there’s been a split between the two major parties over their stance on the region – the government has recognised Palestinian statehood while the Coalition has said it would revoke that – there is bipartisanship support of this deal. </p> 
  <p>Hume reflects on the 48 Israelis who remain in hostage – 20 who are still believed to be alive, who under the deal will be returned from early next week. She says “this is a really good start”. </p> 
  <p>On whether <strong>Donald Trump</strong> will get his coveted Nobel peace prize, Butler says he doesn’t think the Australian government gets a vote and at the end of the day “it’s not about prizes it’s about peace”, while Hume says that if the deal succeeds, “you name me who else” deserves the prize.</p>

  <p>Returning to the interview on 730: in response to the comment from anchor Sarah Ferguson that Trump appeared to believe Israel was becoming isolated in the world, Israel’s deputy foreign minister said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Look, Israel has been through a tough period of time. OK, we’ve been in many discussions with many of our allies, and many nations that we truly expected to stand beside us during those very difficult times.</p> 
   <p><strong>Look, Donald Trump is the best friend Israel has ever had.</strong> He was able to negotiate, through pressure on Hezbollah, a ceasefire with Lebanon. He was able to negotiate. This is the second ceasefire with Hamas, because of pressure on Hamas. He understands it’s not about the end result. It’s not about the obsession about the Palestinian state, it’s about the process, about building constructive steps towards peace, stability and coexistence.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Qantas is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/08/qantas-among-nearly-40-companies-facing-ransom-demand-from-hacker-group">one of almost 40 companies</a> facing having their data potentially posted on the dark web after a hacker group, <strong>Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters</strong>, reportedly sent a ransom note to Salesforce ordering payment by today.</p> 
  <p>The Qantas data includes personal and contact information of the companies’ customers and employees, including dates of birth. Qantas previously stated the hackers may have also accessed frequent flyer numbers and membership-tier data, which could include information on which people are given exclusive access to Qantas’s chairman’s lounge.</p> 
  <p>As is becoming standard practice after ransomware attacks of large organisations in Australia, Qantas obtained an ongoing injunction from the NSW supreme court ensuring protections to prevent the stolen data being accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published by anyone, including third parties.</p> 
  <p>“We continue to offer a 24/7 support line and specialist identity protection advice to affected customers,” a Qantas spokesperson said.</p> 
  <p>A Salesforce spokesperson told Guardian Australia earlier this week the company “will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand”.</p>

   <li><p>This post was amended on 10 October 2025. A previous version incorrectly stated that Qantas data also included purchase histories and passport details.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Admiral defends fourfold increase in Aukus consultancy contract</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The head of the <strong>Australian Submarine Agency </strong>has defended a consultancy contract that grew from $2.8m to $12.1m over the course of a year, saying it was “value for money”.</p> 
  <p>In a Senate estimates hearing last night, Vice Admiral <strong>Jonathan Mead</strong> said the organisational review by the <strong>Boston Consulting Group</strong> between November 2024 to last month was crucial to ensuring the agency had the right structure after it transitioned from an Aukus taskforce in July 2023.</p> 
  <p>The initial contract was valued at $2.8m in November 2024. It was extended twice more before it reached its final value of $12.1m, more than four times as much as the original estimate.</p> 
  <p>Mead said the agency was tasked with “something that has never been undertaken before in this country and is probably one of the most complex engineering tasks in the world”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I can look you in the eye and tell you that, in my opinion, we got value for money, the agency now looks a lot different … [the Australian] government had given us very specific outcomes to deliver the optimal pathway. The three [Aukus] leaders agreed to that trilaterally. We were always under the scrutiny of government, but [also] by our trilateral partners to deliver in accordance with the schedule.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Israel’s deputy foreign minister has praised the US president, <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, as the “best friend Israel has ever had” and taken aim at Australia, as well as other European states, for their recognition of Palestinian statehood last month.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sharren Haskel</strong> said on ABC’s 730 last night that Gaza was “a two-state solution failure that was brought on us, that exploded in our face” and that Australia and European states had “gifted Hamas” with their recognition of Palestine.</p> 
  <p>Haskell claimed the negotiation deadlock between Israel and Hamas broke for two reasons: “One is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/oct/08/young-lives-cut-short-on-an-unimaginable-scale-the-18457-children-on-gazas-list-of-war-dead">military pressure</a>, and the second one is Trump pressure on Hamas.” She continued:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Unfortunately, during the very sensitive negotiation that we’ve had just a couple of months ago, European countries, including Australia, have gifted Hamas and made it very clear to them that the longer this war will continue, the more they will reward Hamas. </p> 
   <p>I mean, you have to understand when Hamas praises you, and thank you, that you are on the wrong side of history. And so, they have pushed back and obliterated the chances for the peace negotiation that we’re taking on during that time.</p>
