<p>They are the scourge of the modern commute: passengers who play music or videos out loud. But amid widespread disapproval from fellow travellers, Transport for London (TfL) is trying to appeal to the better nature of “headphone dodgers” by asking them to “be considerate” and plug in.</p> <p>The new posters, which will start to appear on the Elizabeth line this week – and on other TfL services, including London buses, in the autumn – remind travellers to use headphones when listening to music or making calls.</p> <p>“Most people use headphones, but even a small number not doing so can create an unpleasant or stressful environment,” said Emma Strain, TfL’s customer director. “That’s why we’re reminding people to put their headphones on if they don’t already, to give others the stress-free journey they’d expect for themselves.”</p> <p>A TfL survey of 1,000 people found that 70% described loud music and phone conversations without headphones to be a nuisance.</p>    <p>The campaign comes as mobile coverage spreads across the network, with 4G and 5G now available on large sections of the tube and the Elizabeth line. Increased connectivity has led to more opportunities to stream content and make calls on the go, but also more chances for fellow passengers to be disturbed, TfL said.</p> <p>Seb Dance, the deputy mayor for transport, said: “The small minority who play music or videos out loud can be a real nuisance to other passengers.” The new posters would encourage Londoners “to always be considerate of other passengers”, he added.</p> <p>Although the campaign focuses on courtesy, regulations are already in place.</p> <p>TfL bylaws ban passengers from singing or playing music out loud anywhere on the network, unless they have written permission, such as the licence granted to approved buskers. The behaviour can be prosecuted if it causes the “annoyance of any person”.</p> <p>In practice, staff usually ask people to turn off their speakers. Prosecutions are rare, but not impossible. In 2023, a man was fined more than £300 after playing loud music on the Jubilee line.</p> <p>The Department for Transport said “strict rules” exist to prevent antisocial behaviour on public transport, including fines of up to £1,000.</p> <p>The antisocial behaviour is one that has drawn rare support across party lines, with the Liberal Democrats branding offenders “headphone dodgers” and Conservative MPs calling for tougher enforcement.</p> <p>The Lib Dems have proposed fines and a national publicity campaign, while the former shadow transport secretary, Gareth Bacon, and other Tories have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/apr/23/lib-dems-back-ban-on-playing-music-and-videos-on-public-transport-in-england">signalled their backing, emphasising that “everyone deserves to travel in peace”</a> and playing loud music chips away at public civility.</p> <div class="element element-callout" data-campaign-id="e6cd4819-7ac8-48a0-99da-962573d1e19f" > <h2>Callout</h2> </div>  <p>• This article was amended on 26 August 2025. An error in supplied information meant that in an earlier version Seb Dance spoke of a “small majority” of passengers who play music or videos out loud, rather than a “small minority” as intended.</p>
