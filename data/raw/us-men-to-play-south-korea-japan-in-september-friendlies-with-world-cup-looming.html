With the top two sides earning automatic qualification to the 2026 tournament, South Korea are likely to book their tickets to North America in June’s international window with games against Iraq and Kuwait. The team, coached by legendary defender and former LA Galaxy player Hong Myung-bo, also boast star power in the form of Tottenham Hotspur captain Son Heung-min.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/20/an-increasingly-multicultural-japan-has-qualified-for-the-2026-world-cup">An increasingly multicultural Japan have qualified for the 2026 World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Japan, meanwhile, have already assured their spot in next year’s showpiece.
