He predicts that wage settlements will be pushed down in “an economy with rising unemployment and weak demand”, meaning little risk of an upward spiral in wage-led domestic inflation.</p> <p><strong>Taylor</strong> argues that there are now three plausible scenarios in 2026, of varying pain for consumers and businesses:</p> <p>The first scenario is the “<strong>soft</strong> <strong>landing”</strong>, which <strong>Taylor</strong> fears is receding in terms of probability.</p> <p>He says: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>By maintaining what I think is a too restrictive path of interest rates, we may have braked too hard, such that inflation cannot smoothly return to target with the economy close to potential, as my votes have indicated.</p> </blockquote> <p>The second scenario is the “<strong>bumpy</strong> <strong>landing</strong>”, which Taylor thinks is increasingly likely.</p> <p>This, he says, is:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>… a downside scenario, where inflation undershoots, and goes below target in late 2026, and the economy moves into a weakened state for a sustained period, with output and employment below potential, leading to undue damage to economic activity. </p> </blockquote> <p>The third scenario is the “<strong>hard</strong> <strong>landing”</strong>, which Taylor calls “a deeper worry”. He says: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>This was a remote and low probability event a year ago, but the risk is rising. In this scenario, weak demand at home can lead to a more forceful downturn, where recession dynamics start to kick in that can be very difficult to contain or even reverse. The economy has been flirting with zero growth, and the realisation of negative readings could easily change the future path for the worse. The probability of this outcome is now not trivial. This would be the ‘downside to the downside’ scenario and it would lead to an even more dramatic inflation undershoot than the second scenario. To end up here would be a mistake.</p> </blockquote> <p>Taylor also outlines in his speech how the UK could find itself on the end of a “double diversion phenomenon” as Donald Trump’s tariff war diverts trade flows</p> <p>He explains how this could lead to more goods from China arriving in the UK, unless London takes protectionist trade measures, making the “bumpy landing” more likely, saying:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>First, the US raises barriers on imports from low-cost producers, who then redirect their goods to third countries, like the EU, who in turn respond with further barriers to those low-cost producers, who then move on again to direct their large flows of exports to an ever-smaller target group of open export markets. Naturally, the UK comes to mind as one of those potential targets.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68ee3b3d8f08df06f91ab5ce" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/kalyeena-makortoff"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-14T12:01:21.595Z">1.01pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Goldman Sachs profits jump too</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>An investment bank rebound has also boosted earnings for Goldman Sachs, where Q3 profits have jumped 37% to $4.1bn (£3bn).</strong></p> <p>That is up from just under $3bn during the same period in 2024, and was driven by a 42% surge in investment banking fees, thanks to the same jump in mergers and acquisitions and IPOs that boosted earnings at its larger rival JP Morgan (which reported results earlier today – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2025/oct/14/us-treasury-secretary-beijing-rare-earths-us-china-port-fees-imf-tariffs-business-live-news?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-68ee30658f088a8360ad3909#block-68ee30658f088a8360ad3909">see here for more</a>). </p> <p><strong>Goldman’s</strong> CEO and chairman <strong>David</strong> <strong>Solomon</strong> says:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“This quarter’s results reflect the strength of our client franchise and focus on executing our strategic priorities in an improved market environment.”</p> </blockquote> <p>However, he seemed to hint that the bank would be looking to cut costs, saying it needed to “operate more efficiently” and harness the benefits of AI.</p> <p><strong>Solomon</strong> said: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“We know that conditions can change quickly and so we remain focused on strong risk management.
