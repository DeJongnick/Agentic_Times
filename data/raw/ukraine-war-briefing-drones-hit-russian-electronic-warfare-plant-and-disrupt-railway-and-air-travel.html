<ul> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s drone forces were on the attack against Russian strategic targets on Saturday and into Sunday.</strong> Drones hit the Signal radio and <strong>electronic warfare equipment plant in the Stavropol region</strong>, an official from Ukraine’s SBU security service told Reuters. Two facilities at the Signal plant in the city of Stavropol, about 540km (335 miles) from the Ukrainian border, were damaged. Videos online showed an explosion and a large column of dark smoke rising into the sky. The plant was one of <strong>Russia’s leading producers of electronic warfare equipment,</strong> including radar, radio navigation equipment, and remote control radio equipment, the official said. “Each such attack stops production processes and reduces the enemy’s military potential. This work will continue.”</p></li> <li><p>Russia’s civil aviation authority said it again had to <strong>shut down an airport as Ukrainian drones attacked</strong>. Rosaviatsia said it suspended flights soon after midnight on Sunday at the <strong>airport serving the city of Volgograd</strong>, which is the administrative centre of the broader Volgograd region.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukrainian drones also hit a railway power supply in the Volgograd region</strong>, the administration of the region in Russia’s south said on Sunday. Air raid alerts were introduced in several other regions in Russia’s west and south, warning of Ukrainian drone attacks, according to posts by regional officials.</p></li> </ul> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/25/russia-record-attacks-ukraine-struggles-defend-itself">The Shahed blitz: can Russian drone onslaught break Ukraine’s resolve?</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Drones again targeted Moscow</strong>, said the mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, and an industrial facility in the Penza oblast south-east of the capital, according to the region’s governor, Oleg Melnichenko. In the Rostov region, officials said Ukrainian drones killed two people.</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine’s regions of <strong>Dnipro in the south and Sumy in the north-east came under combined rocket and drone attack</strong> into Saturday, local officials reported. The head of the Dnipro regional administration, Serhii Lysak, said at least two people died and five were wounded. In the city of Dnipro, a multi-storey building and business were damaged and outside the city a fire engulfed a shopping centre.</p></li> <li><p><strong>In Sumy, the military administration said three people were injured</strong>. Russian drones hit a central square in Sumy city, and damaged the building of the regional administration. <strong>Kharkiv sustained an intense aerial bombardment</strong> with Ukraine’s state emergency service reporting six people were hurt, including four rescuers wounded in a “double tap” where a second attack targeted emergency workers trying to help the victims of the first.</p></li> <li><p>According to Ukraine’s air force, <strong>Russia launched 208 drones and 27 missiles</strong> overnight into Saturday. It said according to preliminary data, air defences and electronic warfare <strong>took down or intercepted 183 drones and 17 missiles</strong>, but hits from 10 missiles and 25 drones were recorded in nine locations.</p></li> <li><p>Russia’s defence ministry claimed its forces had captured two more villages in eastern Ukraine: <strong>Zelenyi Hai in the Donetsk region and Maliivka just inside the Dnipropetrovsk region</strong>. The Ukrainian military’s general staff mentioned Zelenyi Hai as one of several frontline areas that had come under Russian attack 11 times over the past 24 hours. It said Maliivka was one of several villages where 10 Russian attacks had been halted.</p></li> <li><p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, said Ukraine’s top commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, had identified Pokrovsk as an area requiring “special attention” due to constant attack. A military spokesperson, Viktor Trehubov, told national television that <strong>Russian forces were attacking Pokrovsk in “a small torrent … that simply does not stop”.</strong> Zelenskyy said Ukrainian forces had recorded “successful actions” in Sumy. The Reuters news agency, which reported on the developments, could not independently confirm battlefield accounts from either side.</p></li> <li><p>Russia’s defence ministry on Saturday claimed that it <strong>struck military facilities in Ukraine</strong> that “manufacture components for missile weapons, as well as produce ammunition and explosives”. The claim could not be independently verified. Zelenskyy posted that that “there can be absolutely no silence in response to such strikes, and Ukrainian long-range drones ensure this. Russian military enterprises, Russian logistics, Russian airports must feel that the Russian war has real consequences for them.”</p></li> <li><p>An Indian firm that <strong>shipped $1.4m worth of an explosive compound with military uses to Russia</strong> said on Saturday that it complies with Indian rules and the substance was for civilian industrial purposes. A Reuters investigation found that <strong>HMX, also called octogen, was sent to two Russian explosives manufacturers despite the threat of international sanctions</strong>. Ukraine’s drones have attacked the factory of one of the Russian companies after security services linked it to Russia’s military.</p></li> <li><p>The Indian company involved emailed Reuters saying its shipment was “for industrial activity and it’s a civil explosive”. The US government has <strong>identified HMX as “critical for Russia’s war effort”. It is widely used in missile and torpedo warheads, rocket motors, exploding projectiles and plastic-bonded explosives for advanced military systems</strong>, according to the Pentagon’s Defense Technical Information Center and related defense research programmes. The compound also has some <strong>limited civilian applications</strong> in mining and other industrial activities.</p></li> </ul>
