 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>The House passed the $1.9tn coronavirus relief package, </strong>delivering <strong>Joe Biden </strong>his first major legislative victory as president. According to an Urban Institute analysis, the relief package will reduce US poverty in 2021 by more than a third. The White House has said the president will sign the bill on Friday.</li> 
   <li><strong>Democratic congressional leaders signed the relief bill, officially sending it to Biden’s desk. </strong>At a bill enrollment ceremony this afternoon, the House speaker, <strong>Nancy Pelosi, </strong>and the Senate majority leader, <strong>Chuck Schumer, </strong>celebrated the passage of the “historic” legislation. “So what do we say to America? We say to America: help is on the way,” Schumer said.</li> 
   <li><strong>The US will purchase another 100m doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine, </strong>Biden confirmed at a White House event this afternoon. In his remarks, the president celebrated the increased production of coronavirus vaccines and the House passage of the relief bill. “There is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year,” Biden said. “There is real reason for hope, folks.”</li> 
   <li><strong>The Senate confirmed two more of Biden’s cabinet nominees, Merrick Garland and Marcia Fudge. </strong>Garland was confirmed as the next US attorney general, and Fudge was confirmed to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</li> 
   <li><strong>The Senate also voted 66-34 to confirm Michael Regan as the EPA administrator. </strong>Regan, 44, previously served as secretary of North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality. He’ll be the first Black man to lead the EPA and the second Black administrator in the agency’s history.</li> 
   <li><strong>Texas’s attorney general has threatened to sue county officials if they don’t lift local mask mandates. </strong>The threat comes after Texas governor Greg Abbott lifted a statewide mask mandate, and at the same time announced that all businesses could reopen “100%” – triggering a mad dash for vaccines, and inciting panic among vulnerable workers.<br></li> 
   <li><strong>The White House reiterated that migrants should not attempt to enter the US right now. </strong>Ambassador <strong>Roberta Jacobson, </strong>the coordinator for the southern border, said at the White House briefing today that the <strong>Biden administration </strong>is still working to recalibrate the US immigration system after four years of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s leadership. “The border is not open,” Jacobson said.

  <p><strong>Texas’ attorney general has threatened to sue county officials if they don’t lift local mask mandates. </strong></p> 
  <p>Texas governor Greg Abbott lifted a statewide mask mandate, and at the same time announced that all businesses could reopen “100%” – triggering a mad dash for vaccines, and inciting panic among vulnerable workers. </p> 
  <p>But the governor’s orders, which go against the advice of health officials, do allow local officials to issue “mitigation strategies” though officials are prohibited from punishing residents who refuse to follow mask orders. Private businesses are allowed to mandate masks, and limit capacity within their own premises. </p> 
  <p>But Ken Paxton, the attorney general, is threatening officials implementing local mask orders.</p> 
  <p>“The decision to require masks or otherwise impose Covid-19-related operating limits is expressly reserved to private businesses on their own premises,” Paxton said. “It does not rest with jurisdictions like the City of Austin or Travis County or their local health authorities. Nor do they have the authority to threaten fines for non-compliance.”</p> 
  <p>Paxton gave officials until 6pm Wednesday to rescind local mask mandates, threatening, “Otherwise, On behalf Of the State of Texas, I will sue you.” </p>

  <p><strong>The number of migrant children and families seeking to cross the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border">US-Mexico border</a> has increased to levels not seen since before the coronavirus pandemic – a challenge for Joe Biden as he works to undo the hardline immigration policies of predecessor Donald Trump.</strong></p> 
  <p>Statistics released Wednesday by US customs and border protection (CBP) showed the number of children and families increased by more than 100% between January and February.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">FBI must target white supremacists' infiltration of police agencies, congressman says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi">FBI</a> must develop a strategy to respond to white supremacist infiltration of law enforcement agencies and address its past failures to take the issue seriously, a prominent Democratic congressman has argued in a letter to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi">FBI</a> director, Christopher Wray.</p> 
  <p>Multiple internal FBI reports over the past 15 years have labeled white supremacist infiltration of police departments as a serious threat. But last year, FBI officials refused to testify in a hearing about the topic, repeatedly telling congressional staffers that “it did not believe that this threat was supported by evidence” and “that there would not be any utility in the bureau offering testimony”, the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin wrote in a <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2021-03-09.JR%20to%20Wray-FBI%20re%20White%20Supremacist%20Infiltration.pdf">letter to Wray</a> on Tuesday.</p> 
  <p>The presence of current and former police officers in the violent insurrection at the Capitol on 6 January was “irrefutable proof of this threat”, the congressman argued.<br></p> 
  <p>“Given the FBI’s refusal just last year to admit that extremist police officers posed a serious threat to our nation’s security, I am now concerned that the bureau lacks an adequate strategy to respond to this clear and present danger to public safety,” Raskin, the chair of a subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties, wrote.</p> 
  <p>Raskin requested a briefing on the issue for members of Congress by 26 March. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.</p> 
  <p>In February, a confidential intelligence assessment from the FBI’s San Antonio division warned that white supremacists and other far-right groups would “very likely seek affiliation with military and law enforcement entities” in order to advance their ideology, attack racial minorities, and gain insider information and tactical training, according to ABC News, which <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/white-supremacists-seek-affiliation-law-enforcement-goals-internal/story?id=76309051">obtained a copy of the report</a>.<br></p>

  <p><strong>The final stop on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/from-paradise-to-coronavirus-the-grand-princess-and-the-cruise-from-hell">Grand Princess Hawaii Cruise</a> has turned out to be a federal courtroom in Los Angeles.</strong><br></p> 
  <p><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/erin-mccormick">Erin McCormick</a> in Berkeley reports: </em></p> 
  <p>The tropical island cruise that departed San Francisco in February 2020 became one of the United States’ first Covid-19 hotspots with a coronavirus outbreak aboard that forced 3,000 vacationers into a weeks-long quarantine and was eventually connected to at least 122 cases and six deaths.</p> 
  <p>In the year since, Grand Princess<strong> </strong>passengers have tried to get some resolution to the horrors that befell them, reckoning with the cruise company’s actions and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> response to one of the first major health emergencies in the pandemic.</p> 
  <p>Many have filed lawsuits against Princess <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/cruises">Cruises</a> and some against its parent company Carnival – nearly three dozen cases have wound up in the LA courtroom of federal district court judge Gary Klausner. The passengers charge that the cruise company negligently sent them out to sea, despite being alerted to the dangers by a disaster it handled on another ship in Japan and a suspicious illness during a previous leg of the Grand Princess’ journey. They also claim that pre-boarding health checks were cursory and that the company did not take prompt action to stop the spread of the virus on board once the outbreak was under way.</p> 
  <p>“We were surprised at how ill-prepared they were,” said Denise Morse, who went on the cruise with her husband, David, to celebrate their 45th wedding anniversary. The Morses did not sue Princess Cruises, but they did fear for their life during the ill fated trip. “They didn’t seem to have any institutional knowledge passed down from one incident to the next.”</p>

  <p><strong>A Republican senator who voted against the $1.9tn stimulus package is now trying to take credit for the legislation. </strong></p> 
  <p>Roger Wicker of Mississippi is touting the bill’s aid to restaurants and small businesses. But Wicker, like all his Senate Republican colleagues who voted unanimously against the relief bill, said just yesterday criticized the package. “The Democrats’ $1.9T spending package makes their priorities clear: expanding the government’s role in Americans’ lives is more important than actual Covid relief,” he said. </p>

  <p>With the bill headed to Biden’s desk for a signature, Republicans who’ve stuck together in opposition to the legislation have found themselves in a tough spot – having to explain to Americans why they tried to block much-needed economic relief. A majority of Americans, including a hefty proportion of Republican and Republican-leaning voters, support the package. </p> 
  <p>During a press conference yesterday, Nancy Pelosi warned against “Republican colleagues who – they say no to the vote, and they show up at the ribbon-cuttings or the presentations.” </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Texans scramble to get vaccinated after Republican governor says no more masks</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In Houston, a long line of cars wraps around a cluster of white tents in the parking lot of NRG Stadium – a Texas-sized vaccination hub. Texans roll up to the drive-through, hang an arm out of the window to get their shot, and leave as if the vaccination site were one of many fast-food restaurants sprawled across the state.</p> 
  <p>Men and women in army green and face shields direct traffic, scan QR codes and administer shots containing the ticket to a renewed social life and some peace of mind.</p> 
  <p>That reassurance could not come too soon for Texans, since the statewide mask mandate has now officially been lifted, leaving millions of those still unvaccinated more vulnerable to an infectious disease that has killed 527,000 people in the US, including more than <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/us/texas">45,000 in Texas</a>.</p> 
  <p>On 2 March, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, announced the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/07/02/texas-mask-order-greg-abbott-coronavirus/">statewide mask mandate</a> implemented over the summer would suddenly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/02/texas-governor-ends-mask-mandate-and-declares-it">cease to exist</a> as of Wednesday.</p> 
  <p>At first glance, one might see the announcement as the light at the end of the tunnel. But upon further examination, it seems Texas is jumping the gun.</p> 
  <p>According to the <a href="https://tabexternal.dshs.texas.gov/t/THD/views/COVID-19VaccineinTexasDashboard/Summary?%3Aorigin=card_share_link&amp;%3Aembed=y&amp;%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y">Texas health department</a>, the number of those fully vaccinated in the state currently stands at 2,463,005 – about 16% of Texas’s near 15 million over-18 population. Texas currently ranks 38th in the nation for total administered vaccinations.<br></p> 
  <p>Announcing the end of the mask mandate, Abbott said last week: “It is now time to open Texas 100%. So today, I am issuing a new executive order that rescinds most of the earlier executive orders: effective next Wednesday, all businesses of any kind are allowed to open 100%. Also, I am ending the statewide mask mandate.”<br></p> 
  <p>The announcement fueled condemnation from Democratic leaders across the state. Some argued Abbott’s order was a distraction from the state’s failure to keep its energy grid powered during a brutal winter storm that left millions without electricity, heat and water for days.</p>

  <p><strong>Joe Biden </strong>will travel to Delaware county, Pennsylvania, next Tuesday, the White House just announced.</p> 
  <p>The trip will mark the beginning of the president’s tour to sell the $1.9tn coronavirus relief package to the American people.</p> 
  <p>The House passed the relief bill this afternoon, and Biden is expected to sign the legislation into law on Friday. Biden will also likely tout the bill and its benefits for American families tomorrow, when he delivers his first primetime address as president.</p> 
  <p>Biden has said that he believes the <strong>Obama administration </strong>erred by not taking a “victory lap” after passing the 2009 stimulus bill, and he intends to learn from that mistake this time around.</p>

  <p><strong>Joe Biden </strong>reflected recently on the last time a Democratic administration had to rescue an economy left in tatters by a Republican president.</p> 
  <p>“The economists told us we literally saved America from a depression,” Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/03/remarks-by-president-biden-at-the-house-democratic-caucus-virtual-issues-conference/">told the House Democratic Caucus last week.</a> “But we didn’t adequately explain what we had done. <strong>Barack</strong> was so modest; he didn’t want to take, as he said, a ‘victory lap’. I kept saying, ‘Tell people what we did.’ He said, ‘We don’t have time. I’m not going to take a victory lap.’ And we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.”</p> 
  <p>The 46th US president is often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/opinion/joe-biden-humility.html">lauded for his humility</a> but don’t expect him to repeat Obama’s mistake. Once his $1.9tn coronavirus relief bill is signed, he is set to take an extended victory lap by travelling the country to promote it.</p> 
  <p>Biden will have short and long sales pitches. First, that help is on the way after the hellish year of a pandemic that has killed more than 528,000 people in the US and put many millions out of work.</p> 
  <p>The stimulus, among the biggest in history, includes $400bn to fund $1,400 direct payments to most Americans (unlike <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/09/biden-coronavirus-relief-bill-pelosi-congress">Biden’s signature will not appear on the cheques</a>), $350bn in aid to state and local governments and increased funding for vaccine distribution.</p> 
  <p>The American Rescue Plan is not without disappointments for progressives, notably the lack of a $15-per-hour minimum wage, a harbinger of how difficult an evenly divided Senate will be for Biden to handle. All the more reason to enjoy his victory lap and celebrate that four decades of <strong>Reaganism</strong> and “trickle down” economics are at an end. </p>

  <p>The reporter asked the president what the US would do with its surplus coronavirus vaccine doses, if the country ends up with more doses than it needs.</p> 
  <p>“If we have a surplus, we’re going to share it with the rest of the world,” Biden replied. “We’re not going to be ultimately safe until the world is safe.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Joe Biden </strong>confirmed that his administration will purchase another 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine.</p> 
  <p>The president said the additional doses would ensure that the US government has “maximum flexibility” as it continues to distribute coronavirus vaccines to the American people.</p> 
  <p>“A lot can happen. A lot can change. And we need to be prepared,” Biden said.</p> 
  <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine has been shown to be less effective than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but it has the benefit of being a single-dose vaccine, rather than the double-dose options from Pfizer and Moderna.</p>

  <p><strong>Merrick Garland </strong>has been confirmed as America’s top law enforcement officer, a boost for <strong>Joe Biden</strong>’s drive against racial discrimination in the criminal justice system.</p> 
  <p>Garland’s rise to attorney general, approved 70-30 by the US Senate, turns the page on former president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>’s harsh <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/donald-trump-re-election-nixon-protests-strategy">“law and order” rhetoric</a> and efforts to bend the justice department to his will.</p> 
  <p>It also marks <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/21/merrick-garland-attorney-general-justice-department-confirmation">a poignant second chance</a> for the 68-year-old judge who, nominated to the supreme court by then president <strong>Barack Obama</strong> in 2016, was denied a hearing by Senate <strong>Republicans</strong> on the pretext that it was an election year.</p> 
  <p>This time around his confirmation had been widely expected, especially after a relatively uneventful hearing where Republicans landed few punches. <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong>, who was Garland’s nemesis in 2016, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/23/mcconnell-merrick-garland-attorney-general-471177">told reporters last Tuesday</a> that he would back him for attorney general.</p> 
  <p>Garland, however, faces a daunting inbox at a justice department that critics say was left in tatters by Trump and his own attorney general, <strong>William Barr</strong>. He must attempt to restore morale while addressing demands for racial justice in the wake of last year’s police killing of <strong>George Floyd</strong> and widespread Black Lives Matter protests.</p>

  <p>Joe Biden tweeted “<strong>Help is here</strong>” moments after the House passed his $1.9tr Covid relief bill shortly after 2pm ET today. He’d indicated he’ll sign the bill, known as the <strong>American Rescue Plan</strong>, on <strong>Friday</strong>.</p> 
  <p>In a statement from the White House, the US president said of his <strong>first major legislative victory</strong>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p> For weeks now, an overwhelming percentage of Americans – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – have made it clear they support the <strong>American Rescue Plan</strong>. Today, with final passage in the House of Representatives, <strong>their voice has been heard</strong>.</p> 
   <p>Now we move forward with the resources needed to vaccinate the nation. To get <strong>$1,400 in direct payments to 85% of American households</strong>. To expand coverage and help with lowering health care premiums. </p> 
   <p>To give small businesses what they need to stay open. To expand unemployment insurance, provide food and nutrition assistance. To help keep a roof over people’s heads. To cut child poverty in half.</p> 
   <p>This legislation is about giving the backbone of this nation – the essential workers, the working people who built this country, the people who keep this country going – a fighting chance.</p> 
   <p>I want to thank all the members who voted for it, especially <strong>Speaker Pelosi</strong>, the finest and most capable speaker in the history of our nation. Once again, she has led into law an historic piece of legislation that addresses a major crisis and lifts up millions of Americans.</p> 
   <p>On Friday, I look forward to signing the American Rescue Plan into law at the White House – a people’s law at the people’s house.</p>

  <p><strong>Merrick Garland was approved overwhelmingly by the Senate to become the new attorney general. He was supported by Republicans as well as Democrats.</strong></p> 
  <p>Kentucky Senator <strong>Mitch McConnell</strong>, who as Republican majority leader in 2016 almost single-handedly blocked Garland’s nomination to the Supreme Court, voted for the federal appellate judge. </p> 
  <p>“I’m voting to confirm Judge Garland because of his long reputation as a <strong>straight-shooter and legal expert</strong>,” McConnell said before the vote. “His left-of-center perspective has been within the legal mainstream.”</p> 
  <p>Reuters further reports:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The bipartisan tally in the Democratic-led Senate was 70-30 to confirm Garland as the top U.S. law enforcement official, with a number of Republicans including McConnell and former Judiciary Committee chairmen Lindsey Graham and Chuck Grassley joining the chamber’s Democrats in support.</p> 
   <p>Garland, 68, will assume the post at a time of heightened concern about domestic extremism. He takes over a Justice Department that Republican former President Donald Trump repeatedly sought to bend to his will. The former federal prosecutor also inherits sensitive ongoing investigations including one involving the new Democratic president’s son.</p> 
   <p>His confirmation represented some measure of vindication for Garland. The Senate in 2016, then controlled by Republicans, refused to consider his nomination to the Supreme Court by Democratic President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> and declined even to give him a confirmation hearing. </p> 
   <p>By doing so, the Republicans, led by McConnell, enabled a Republican president, Trump, in 2017 to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with a conservative justice.</p> 
   <p><strong>Garland was nominated by Biden to lead a department in the midst of intensive investigations</strong> into the deadly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/09/us-capitol-insurrection-white-supremacist-terror">Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol</a> by supporters of Republican former President Donald Trump.</p> 
   <p><strong>Garland has called the attack “heinous” and promised to make the investigation among his top priorities</strong>. Hundreds of people have been arrested in connection with the incident including members of right-wing extremist groups.</p> 
   <p>During his confirmation hearing, Garland on Feb. 22 pledged to restore confidence in the department and protect it from political meddling.</p> 
   <p>Trump repeatedly interfered in Justice Department matters, applying pressure to go easy on his friends and allies ensnared in criminal investigations and to target political foes.</p> 
   <p>Garland will also inherit some investigations that began during the Trump administration, including one by <strong>Special Counsel John Durham</strong> into the FBI’s handling of its investigation into Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and another criminal tax probe into <strong>Hunter Biden, the new president’s son.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Dr Rochelle Walensky</strong>, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), urged Americans to carry on taking precautions against spreading coronavirus, and to get vaccinated when available because the US is “at a critical point” in the pandemic.</p> 
  <p>At the White House coronavirus response team briefing earlier today, Walensky said: “We are at a critical point in this pandemic and on the cusp of having enough vaccine to protect every adult in the United States. We ask for your patience in practicing proven prevention measures for just a little longer.”</p>

  <p>There are indications that cases are starting to trend downwards on a national basis again <strong><em>because </em></strong>people are taking the right precautions, she added.</p> 
  <p>This despite Texas, for example, ending its state mask mandate from today and allowing businesses to open at 100% normal operation.</p> 
  <p><strong>Dr Anthony Fauci </strong>expressed concern about Texas relaxing its coronavirus-related restrictions in a CNN interview earlier today.</p> 
  <p>“We understand people’s need to get back to normal, and we’re going in that direction. But when you start doing things like completely putting aside all public health measures as if you’re turning a light switch off, that’s quite risky,” Fauci said. “We don’t want to see another surge, and that’s inviting one when you do that.” </p> 
  <p>Cases, hospitalizations and deaths are decreasing at the moment. Walensky warned, however, that relaxing and traveling more could just lead to another surge in disease.</p> 
  <p>The government announced an increase in supplies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and plans to double its order for the single shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, procuring an additional 100 million doses.</p> 
  <p>Vaccinations are being administered at the rate of around two million a day, with a record three million shots given last Saturday.</p>

  <p>According to the Urban Institute, the relief package will reduce projected US poverty for 2021 by more than one-third.</p> 
  <p>Here’s an excerpt from <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/2021-poverty-projections-assessing-four-american-rescue-plan-policies">the abstract</a> of the think tank’s analysis:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p> In an <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/2021-poverty-projections">earlier analysis</a>, we projected that without this legislation, the 2021 annual poverty rate would be 13.7 percent. We project that key elements of the American Rescue Plan would reduce that annual poverty rate to 8.7 percent. The policies would reduce poverty by more than half for children and for people in households experiencing job loss. Poverty would fall about 42 percent for Black, non-Hispanic people, 39 percent for Hispanic people, and 34 percent for white, non-Hispanic people, reducing the disparities in poverty rates for Black, non-Hispanic people and Hispanic people relative to white, non-Hispanic people.<br></p>

  <p>Pelosi has repeatedly clashed with House minority leader <strong>Kevin McCarthy </strong>in recent weeks. Last month, the speaker sharply criticized the Republican leader’s failure to remove Greene from her committee assignments over her extremist views.</p> 
  <p>McCarthy’s refusal to do so forced <strong>Democrats </strong>to hold a full-chamber vote to remove Greene from her committees.</p> 
  <p>At the time, Pelosi mocked McCarthy as a member of the “Q” party, meaning QAnon, the anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Greene has previously voiced support for.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>61% support the $1.9 trillion economic relief bill proposed by Biden, and several key provisions of the bill are even more popular. 85% say they support policies in the bill that would provide larger tax credits for families and make them easier for low-income households to claim, including majorities across party lines (95% of Democrats and 73% of Republicans support it).</p> 
   <p>Around three-quarters favor provisions to provide funding to facilitate a return to the classroom for K-12 students (77%), and sending stimulus checks worth up to $1,400 per person to most families and individuals (76%). Both of those policies also have majority support across party lines (55% of Republicans support each, among Democrats, support tops 90% for each one).</p> 
   <p>A smaller majority, 59%, say they back providing $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. That policy sparks the sharpest partisan divide among the four tested, with 88% of Democrats in favor vs. just 28% of Republicans.</p> 
   <p>One measure not in the bill – raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour – also has majority support. Overall, 55% favor such an increase in the minimum wage, including 85% of Democrats, 52% of independents and 20% of Republicans.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Sam Levin</strong> in Los Angeles <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/10/george-gascon-los-angeles-district-attorney-prison-reform">reports for us today</a> on California’s new DA, <strong>George Gascón</strong>:</em></p> 
  <p>George Gascón, a former LA police official and district attorney in San Francisco, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/06/jackie-lacey-george-gascon-los-angeles-district-attorney-winner">won his race last November</a> after the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor brought mainstream attention to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/16/its-not-about-bad-apples-how-us-police-reforms-have-failed-to-stop-brutality-and-violence">systemic problems in law enforcement</a>.</p> 
  <p>Gascón gained traction as he explicitly spoke about the harms of California’s racist prison system. “We’ve created this machine of mass incarceration for the last 40 years, that we have normalized what is really abnormal anywhere else in the world,” Gascón recently told the Guardian. “What I’m doing is radical for the US … but sending people to prison for 60 years, 100 years, 150 years, or to death row, or prosecuting a 15-year-old as an adult – these are all concepts that in most of the rest of the world would be inconceivable.”</p> 
  <p>The stakes are enormous. Gascón’s success or failure could determine whether young people in LA are sentenced to life behind bars, whether elderly people get a chance to come home after decades in prison, and whether the DA’s office pursues criminal cases against police for misconduct and unjust killings.</p> 
  <p>And what happens in LA could affect the future of mass incarceration and reform policies across the US. The LA district attorney’s office is the largest in the country, with jurisdiction over a county larger than most US states, and Gascón’s term has become a crucial test for a growing movement of progressive prosecutors.</p> 
  <p>“The norm is changing, and the police can’t accept that,” said Helen Jones, an organizer with the group Dignity and Power whose 22 year-old son died in LA sheriff’s custody in 2009. “They don’t want to have to worry about being held accountable, that one of them might go to jail for murdering somebody’s child. They know that change is coming. So they fight back.”</p>

  <p>Clinton says, of the treatment of Meghan by the media that it was “cruelty”, and was full of praise for her, saying “This young woman was not about to keep her head down. You know, this is 2021.”</p> 
  <p>Clinton also made a wider point, about institutions beyond the British royal family:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>These two young people are not only standing up for themselves, and for their children, but they’re really trying to send a message about what institutions – including the one that they were part of – need to do to be more dynamic and forward looking than they currently are. Every institution has got to make more space, and acceptance for young people coming up, particularly young women, who should not be forced into a mould that is no longer relevant, not only for them, but for our society. <br></p>

  <p><em><strong>Arkansas</strong> passed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/09/arkansas-abortion-ban-supreme-court-roe-v-wade">a sweeping ban on abortion</a> yesterday, but as <strong>Michelle Broder Van Dyke</strong> in Honolulu reports for us, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/10/guam-abortion-access-aclu-lawsuit"><strong>Guam</strong> is moving closer to restoring abortion access after an ACLU lawsuit</a>:</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Guam has taken a significant step toward restoring abortion access, after the ACLU scored a victory in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/22/guam-abortions-aclu-lawsuit">a lawsuit</a> that seeks to ensure residents of the US territory can turn to remote healthcare providers for abortion medication.</strong></p> 
  <p>Getting an abortion on Guam has been impossible since 2018, when the last abortion doctor retired and moved off the island. Before then, at least 200 abortions occurred on Guam every year. Today, accessing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/22/guam-abortions-aclu-lawsuit">the closest legal abortion clinic</a> requires a flight to Hawaiʻi, an expensive and difficult undertaking especially during a pandemic.</p> 
  <p>Telemedicine medication abortions, which allow doctors to remotely prescribe the abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol to patients up to 10 weeks pregnant, would be an obvious solution, if it were not for a 1978 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guam">Guam</a> law that says abortions must be “performed” in a “medical clinic or hospital”. The ACLU lawsuit is fighting, in part, to block that law from being enforced.</p> 
  <p>“We know that many people have reached out to physicians in Hawaiʻi about accessing abortions and that not all of them have been able to overcome the enormous financial and logistical obstacles to traveling several thousand miles,” said Vanessa Williams, a Guam lawyer working with the ACLU.</p> 
  <p>Historically, it has not been easy to access abortions on Guam despite them being legal, due to stigma and past restrictive laws. In the 1990s, the mostly Catholic US territory, where 165,000 people live, passed a law that prohibited abortion except when the mother’s life was endangered. Eventually, the US ninth district court of appeals struck down the law, citing Roe v Wade.</p> 
  <p>“There are very polarizing points of view within our small community on this emotionally charged issue,” said Williams.</p>

  <p>Alexandra Jaffe at Associated Press has set out a scorecard this morning of what <strong>Joe Biden</strong> has so far achieved in his early days in office. He had set some ambitious targets for his first 100 days. In the “done” column Jaffe places these policies:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Prioritized addressing the coronavirus pandemic during his first weeks in office. He’s on pace to hit his goal of 100 million vaccine doses administered in his first 100 days.</li> 
   <li>Several early actions fulfilled pledges on climate policy. He signed an executive order on Inauguration Day that revoked the permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, halted development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and ordered the review of Trump-era rules on the environment, public health and science.</li> 
   <li>Delivered on top campaign pledges that involved rolling back Trump administration moves. The Biden administration rejoined the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accord, halted construction of the border wall, ended travel restrictions on people from a variety of Muslim-majority countries and created a task force to reunite families separated at the US-Mexico border.</li> 
   <li>Biden pledged to deliver a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress within his first 100 days, and it was unveiled last month.<br></li> 
   <li>He made early moves to deliver on a pledge to tighten ethical standards in his administration, including a 20 January executive order imposing an ethics pledge on appointees.<br></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Jaffe identified these as areas where Biden is yet to meet goals:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Yet to take significant action on criminal justice reform, aside from an executive order terminating private prison contracts. Biden pledged to set up a police oversight board within his first 100 days, but there’s been no clear movement in that direction.</li> 
   <li>Other 100-day pledges also awaiting movement: creating a Cabinet-level working group focused on promoting union participation, and ordering an FBI review of issues with gun purchase background checks.</li> 
   <li>Some of Biden’s 100-day pledges will require congressional action, like his promise to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and increase taxes on corporations. Biden also promised to make passage of the Equality Act, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, a priority in his first 100 days. That bill has passed the House but not the Senate.</li> 
   <li>And some of his promises are waiting on Biden’s Cabinet secretaries to be confirmed by the Senate. On gun control, Biden has said he would direct his attorney general to deliver recommendations to restructure key Justice Department agencies to more effectively enforce the nation’s gun laws. He also pledged to have his secretary of Housing and Urban Development lead a task force to create recommendations for making housing a right for all Americans.</li> 
  </ul>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Texans are waking up this morning to a new dawn, with statewide mask mandates and occupancy restrictions in businesses lifted, a move that some have heralded as long-overdue freedom, while others have criticised it as foolishness.</strong></p> 
  <p>Brad Brooks reports for Reuters that on paper, Texas’ rollback of coronavirus mitigation efforts is the most sweeping seen in the United States, along with a similar measure in Mississippi. In practice though, vast swaths of Texas have rarely enforced mask or occupancy mandates in the past year, anyway.</p> 
  <p>Several major retailers, grocery and restaurant chains in Texas said they would still require that masks be worn in their stores, which under Abbott’s order relaxing restrictions is their right to do. Some expected to see standoffs between maskless customers and store employees.<br></p> 
  <p>Texas was one of the first states to reopen its economy after the first wave of pandemic cases last May, and the nation’s second most populous state led the way again last week when Governor Greg Abbott announced the relaxation amid declines in new daily Covid-19 cases and with the rollout of vaccines.<br></p> 
  <p>County officials in regions where Covid patients take up 15% or more of hospital beds for seven consecutive days can enact new mask and occupancy restrictions, under Abbott’s order, but no regions are currently in that situation.<br></p> 
  <p>Austin’s city council voted to still require masks - and dared state officials to sue the city. “In Austin, we’re committed to saving lives,” city council member Greg Casar wrote on Twitter.<br></p> 
  <p>The Dallas Jewish Conservatives organization plans to host a party Wednesday evening with about 200 people. There will be a moment of silence for the pandemic’s dead, refreshments for the guests and a bonfire into which folks will be encouraged to toss masks.<br></p> 
  <p>“It’s about freedom, liberty and personal responsibility,” said Benjie Gershon, founder of the group. “The act of throwing a mask into the bonfire ... is in no way meant to belittle or undermine the tragic numbers of individuals who have fallen ill to Covid.”</p> 
  <p>Over 45,000 deaths have been recorded in the state from coronavirus. Texas is currently averaging around 500 news cases and 200 further deaths per day.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Alaska becomes first state to drop eligibility requirements for Covid vaccines</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Alaska has become the first state to drop eligibility requirements for Covid-19 vaccines, and will now allow anyone 16 or older who lives or works in the state to get a vaccine, Gov <strong>Mike Dunleavy</strong> said Tuesday.<br></p> 
  <p>Dunleavy made the announcement after his own bout with COVID-19, which he described as an inconvenience and said underscored his own desire to be vaccinated. He said he did not become severely ill but did not want “to be laid up in the house again,” impact his family or possibly spread the virus to others.</p> 
  <p>Becky Bohrer reports for Associated Press that he described expanding eligibility for vaccines in Alaska as a “game changer,” particularly with the summer tourist season looming and as the state seeks to rebuild its pandemic-tattered economy.</p> 
  <p>He said he respects those who do not wish to get a vaccine and wanted to relay his personal experience for those mulling vaccination. “I would ask that you give some due consideration,” the Republican said.<br></p> 
  <p><strong>Dr Anne Zink</strong>, the state’s chief medical officer, said officials were seeing open vaccine appointments and wanted to act to allow as many people who want a vaccine to get one. More appointments will be added as vaccine is moved around the state and additional doses come in, she said.<br></p> 
  <p>“This does feel like a gigantic milestone in so many ways to get to the point where we can offer protection for anyone who wants it in the state,” Zink said during a news conference with Dunleavy.<br></p> 
  <p>Alaska has led states in the percentage of its population to have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. At least 25% of the adults in the state have already received at least one dose. The state has reported about 57,300 resident Covid-19 cases and 301 related deaths since the start of the pandemic.</p>

  <p><em><strong>Peter Stone</strong> reports for us on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/10/us-far-right-extremists-millions-social-cryptocurrency">how US far-right extremists are making millions via social media and cryptocurrency</a>:</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Dozens of extremist groups and individuals, including some involved in the Capitol attack, have used social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, tax-exempt status and other fundraising tools to rake in about $1.5m in the last year, according to experts.</strong></p> 
  <p>Two recent studies by groups that track extremist financing, the Global Disinformation Index (GDI) and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), underscore the growing threat posed by far-right extremists, including those who attacked Congress to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.</p> 
  <p>The recent studies and testimony delivered to a House committee by representatives from the SPLC and GDI in late February showed that the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and others with white supremacist and anti-immigrant bias, reaped windfalls via the streaming platform DLive, cryptocurrencies and other fundraising methods.</p> 
  <p>Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University and a senior fellow at the SPLC, found that from 15 April to early February, 55 extremist individuals and groups used the video streaming platform DLive, which allows cryptocurrency-based donations for content, to pull in just under $866,700.</p> 
  <p>“The idea that multiple hate groups could raise tens of thousands of dollars a month from bleeding-edge technology and a tiny donor pool should be terrifying, not ho-hum,” Squire said in an interview. “This is the canary in the coalmine, and we ignore it at our peril.”</p> 
  <p>In a statement, DLive noted its guidelines prohibit hate speech and inciting violence, and that after the Capitol attack it “indefinitely suspended the accounts of the individuals who used DLive to livestream from the riots,” and their access to any “tokens given to them by community members”.</p> 
  <p>According to GDI co-founder Daniel Rogers, 44% of the 73 hate groups he has studied have benefited by securing tax exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service.</p>

  <p>The exchanges between potential jurors, attorneys and the judge at the outset of <strong>Derek Chauvin</strong>’s murder trial illustrated yesterday the challenges in seating a jury in such a well-known case. Judge Peter Cahill has set aside at least three weeks for jury selection. Opening statements are scheduled no sooner than 29 March.</p> 
  <p>Amy Forliti, for the Associated Press, writes that the three jurors who were selected yesterday – two men and one woman – all said they had heard some details about the case against Chauvin but would be able to put aside what they heard or opinions they had formed and make a decision based on evidence in court. </p> 
  <p>One of the selected jurors said he hadn’t seen the bystander video of <strong>George Floyd</strong>’s arrest at all, while the others described seeing it minimally. A person who worried about the divisiveness of the case was dismissed, as was a potential juror who feared his family could be targeted.</p> 
  <p>The first man who was selected to serve on the jury, a chemist who says he works to find facts and thinks analytically, said he has never watched the video of Floyd’s arrest but that he has seen a still image from it. When asked if he could decide the case based on the evidence, he said, “I’d rely on what I hear in court.”<br></p> 
  <p>The man, whom prosecutors said identifies as white, said he supports the Black Lives Matter movement, but views the organization itself unfavorably. He also has an unfavorable view of the Blue Lives Matter movement. He said everyone should matter the same.<br></p> 
  <p>“The whole point of that is that all lives should matter equally, and that should include police,” he said.<br></p> 
  <p>Another juror, a woman who is related to a police officer in greater Minnesota, said she initially had a negative perception of Chauvin because of what she saw in the bystander video, but said she doesn’t know him and could be proven wrong. “That video just makes you sad,” said the woman. “Nobody wants to see somebody die, whether it was his fault or not.”</p> 
  <p>The third juror selected, an auditor, also told the court he would be open-minded.</p> 
  <p>Outside the proceedings this week members of Floyd’s family have spoken. <strong>Bridgett Floyd</strong>, his sister, said that her family was glad the trial had finally arrived and was ‘praying for justice’.</p>

  <p>Also coming down the track from the House of Representatives this week has been the PRO Act, which was passed yesterday. It will almost certainly face a filibuster attempt from Republicans in the Senate, which hasn’t stopped Sen <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> urging all of his colleagues to get behind it. <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/bernie-sanders-senate-pro-union-bill-1574989">David Brenna writes for Newsweek</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The act would strengthen the rights of American workers to strike for better wages and working conditions, introduce new protections for union elections, and give the National Labor Relations Board the power to fine employers who violate workers’ rights, among other reforms.</p> 
   <p>Sanders appealed to colleagues on Twitter to take up the bill on Tuesday. “The trade union movement is the last line of defense against a billionaire class that won’t be satisfied until they have it all,” <a href="https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1369470546015121416?s=19">Sanders said</a>.</p> 
   <p>But the legislation is highly unlikely to win the 60 Senate votes needed to avoid a Republican filibuster. Five House Republicans voted for the legislation, but the vast majority of GOP members stood against the bill, despite recent claims from prominent party members that the GOP has become the true party of the working class.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Exchanges in the House were quite testy. In response to Republican objections that the regulations might limit the freedoms of small buisness oweners, Ohio’s Tim Ryan said “Heaven forbid we pass something that’s going to help the damn workers in the United States of America.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">US House poised to approve Joe Biden's $1.9tn Covid relief plan</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">House of Representatives</a> is poised to give final approval to Joe Biden’s sweeping $1.9tn coronavirus stimulus and relief plan, a giant aid package the president has said is critical for lifting the US out of the pandemic and reviving its battered economy.</p> 
  <p>If passed by the House on Wednesday, as Democratic leaders expect, the first major legislative initiative of Biden’s presidency will rush assistance to families struggling under a year-long public health crisis and provide the most generous expansion of aid to low-income Americans in a generation.</p> 
  <p>It will send direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans, expand aid to state, local and tribal governments, provide federal subsidies for those struggling to afford health insurance, housing and food and deliver money to boost Covid-19 vaccine distribution and testing and to safely reopen schools.</p> 
  <p>Economists predict that as one of the largest emergency rescue packages in American history, the American Rescue Plan (ARP) will accelerate economic recovery, boosting growth to levels not seen in recent decades and dramatically reducing numbers living in poverty.</p> 
  <p>According to one <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5743308460b5e922a25a6dc7/t/601acf15866c634924d12963/1612369686861/Poverty-Reduction-Analysis-Biden-Economic-Relief-CPSP-2021.pdf">estimate</a>, the ARP could cut child poverty by as much as half, through an expansion of a tax credit for families with children that many Democrats want to make permanent.</p> 
  <p>House Democrats, who hold a slim majority, were confident the measure would pass on Wednesday morning, despite changes made in the Senate that threatened to alienate some progressives.</p> 
  <p>The New York congressman Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic Caucus chair, said he was “110% confident” of success. Once passed by the House, the bill will be sent to Biden for signature.</p> 
  <p>The Senate passed the bill on Saturday in a 50-49 vote, Democrats overcoming unified Republican opposition and a last-minute objection by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/07/joe-manchin-stimulus-bill-minimum-wage-ocasio-cortez-progressives">Joe Manchin of West Virginia</a>, a member of their own party.</p> 
  <p>The package before the House on Wednesday was narrower than Biden’s initial proposal, which included progressive priorities subsequently either stripped out or scaled back to appease moderates like Manchin, who echoed Republicans with concerns that the infusion of aid was too big in an economy showing signs of revival.</p> 
  <p>A provision to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour was deemed inadmissible under a budget process Democrats used to bypass Republican opposition.</p> 
  <p>The Senate-approved version tightens eligibility for stimulus checks and restructures a proposal for unemployment benefits that Biden hoped to raise to $400 a week. Under the new plan, unemployment benefits will remain at $300 a week but will be extended through the beginning of September, rather than August. The first $10,200 of supplements from 2020 will be made tax-free.</p> 
  <p>Though disappointed with some of the amendments, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called them “relatively minor concessions” and said the overall package remained “truly progressive and bold”.</p>
