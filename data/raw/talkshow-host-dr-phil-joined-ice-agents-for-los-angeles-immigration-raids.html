<p>The television personality Dr Phil was embedded with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers as they carried out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/06/los-angeles-ice-raids-immigration">controversial raids in Los Angeles</a> that led to days of protests in California, his TV network said.</p> <p>Phil, whose full name is Phil McGraw, was with Ice before and after its agents conducted a series of raids on multiple locations across LA on Friday. Immigration advocates said at least 45 people were arrested, and the action was condemned by California’s governor and LA’s mayor.</p> <p>It was the second time McGraw, a former practising psychologist who hosted a TV talkshow for two decades, has been embedded with Ice this year. In January, he joined the US border czar, Tom Homan, in a choreographed immigration raid in Chicago, in a stunt that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/02/trump-immigration-raids-propaganda">was criticized at the time</a>.</p> <p>CNN was the first to report on McGraw’s presence at the Los Angeles raids. McGraw was there “to get a first-hand look at the targeted operations”, his conservative TV channel, MeritTV, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/09/media/dr-phil-mcgraw-ice-immigration-raids-los-angeles">told CNN</a>. McGraw had “exclusive” access to Homan before and after the raids, CNN reported.</p> <p>During the Chicago raids, McGraw was on the ground with Ice officers and even <a href="https://x.com/DrPhil/status/1883669382242644069">spoke to some of the people</a> the agency had detained. His experience in LA was less immersive, MeritTV said.</p> <p>“In order to not escalate any situation, Dr Phil McGraw did not join and was not embedded” during Friday’s raids, a MeritTV spokesperson told CNN.</p> <p>On Sunday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/09/eric-adams-executive-orders-antisemitism">he appeared with Eric Adams</a>, the mayor of New York City, at a synagogue, as Adams signed an executive order which ordered city agencies to adopt a controversial definition of antisemitism.</p> <p>McGraw, who is not Jewish but has said it was his “duty” to support Israel, has increasingly immersed himself in political issues in recent months, particularly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/dr-phil-immigration-ice-raids-rcna189691">regarding immigration</a>.</p> <p>In April, he McGraw backed Donald Trump in the 2024 election, and in May he described Trump as “a man of deep faith, a man of deep conviction”.</p>
