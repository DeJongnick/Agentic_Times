<p>From recycled wide-leg denims to Afrofuturistic designs made from secondhand curtains, the catwalk at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nairobi.fashion.week/?hl=en#">Nairobi fashion week</a> has featured a wave of new designers focussed on sustainable fashion in Africa.</p> <p>The annual event, which began in 2013 to promote Africa’s then nascent fashion industry, has grown to become a showcase for sustainability in recent years amid <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/africa/en/press/56381/fast-fashion-slow-poison-new-report-exposes-toxic-impact-of-global-textile-waste-in-ghana/">concerning reports</a> on the environmental impacts of textile waste on the continent.</p> <p>Eco and culturally conscious brands, such as the Kenyan studio <a href="https://maishabynisria.co/">Maisha by Nisria</a>, have shown collections this year. The label makes designs by hand from discarded textiles sourced at flea markets, wholesalers, recycling factories and landfill. One piece from its new Afropia collection, showing on Saturday, the last day of the event, is a cropped high-collar jacket and boxy miniskirt made from repurposed curtains.</p>    <p>“You can use anything and everything to make something interesting,” says Tausi Conde, the label’s head of design. Conde says he stumbled into sustainable fashion at university, when limited access to fabrics pushed him to get creative: repurposing his mum’s old clothes to design stylish outfits for student models. Today, it is an integral part of his brand. He and his team follow a strict zero-waste policy, leftover fabric is transformed into patchwork bags and accessories.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>For now, sustainable fashion is not a sustainable business – we can’t compete with fast fashion.

His new Exodus collection uses exaggerated silhouettes, from flared trousers to oversized pockets, and hand-painting inspired by traditional textile art. The pieces reflect the balance the designer straddles in his work, breaking away from restrictive conventions while honouring African culture and craftsmanship.</p> <p>“It’s about innovating without fear, while remembering where you come from,” says Niyigena. “The [sustainable fashion] market is growing, especially among young conscious consumers who are more aware of environmental and social issues, and are looking for options that match their values and honour culture, and have global appeal.”</p>    <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/d13037bac419e76b0fc826c1d8a4c1951cfbd386/1884_76_5008_6260/800.jpg&amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/d13037bac419e76b0fc826c1d8a4c1951cfbd386/1884_76_5008_6260/800.jpg&amp;label_before=&amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5ffe3ad1567251a310f7f1d5fa5473eaadffed1f/2529_529_3719_4649/800.jpg&amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5ffe3ad1567251a310f7f1d5fa5473eaadffed1f/2529_529_3719_4649/800.jpg&amp;label_after=&amp;analytics_label=Bone&amp;type=duo&amp;" data-alt="Each picture shows a model wearing outsized denim clothes standing in front of a van"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/d13037bac419e76b0fc826c1d8a4c1951cfbd386/1884_76_5008_6260/800.jpg&desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/d13037bac419e76b0fc826c1d8a4c1951cfbd386/1884_76_5008_6260/800.jpg&label_before=&mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5ffe3ad1567251a310f7f1d5fa5473eaadffed1f/2529_529_3719_4649/800.jpg&desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/5ffe3ad1567251a310f7f1d5fa5473eaadffed1f/2529_529_3719_4649/800.jpg&label_after=&analytics_label=Bone&type=duo&">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Niyigena uses exaggerated silhouettes with hand-painting inspired by traditional textile art.

Buy pre-loved | Halima Begum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Cameroonian designer Sikoti Mbaitjongue, who has showcased playful cotton pastel designs at the fashion week, says a big challenge she has faced running her Dakar-based label, <a href="https://sokolata-clothing.com/">Sokolata</a>, since 2022 has been sourcing and processing raw cotton. While west Africa is a major producer of cotton, many countries on the continent <a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-report-africa-new-global-fashion-leader">export the bulk of the raw material</a>, which is processed elsewhere and re-imported as fabric. With little left to meet national demand or support the growth of local textile industries, designers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/01/fashion-can-change-africa-the-pioneering-designers-chasing-a-world-of-opportunity">go to great lengths</a> to find and make quality fabric. Mbaitjongue now imports cotton from Benin, but it affects the overall cost of her range, pricing many African consumers out.</p> <p>“For [sustainable fashion] to become more accessible, our industries will need to deliver,” says Sikoti, whose permanent collections range mostly from <a href="https://sokolata-clothing.com/">£40 to £90</a>. Her main clients are from the African diaspora and Senegalese expat communities.</p> <p>“For now, sustainable fashion is not a sustainable business – we can’t compete with fast fashion. But as more of us [eco-conscious designers] come up, I’d like to see a future where it is,” says Conde.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/b9961e684c2e481415429774f4aba3317d95f21b/0_202_1838_2298/800.jpg&amp;desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/b9961e684c2e481415429774f4aba3317d95f21b/0_202_1838_2298/800.jpg&amp;label_before=&amp;mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/431ef8a8a7e4333c1512dbdf6ea4a3d650d0008a/24_409_2567_3209/800.jpg&amp;desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/431ef8a8a7e4333c1512dbdf6ea4a3d650d0008a/24_409_2567_3209/800.jpg&amp;label_after=&amp;analytics_label= Sokolata&amp;type=duo&amp;" data-alt="Each picture shows a model on a catwalk wearing a dress, one long and hooded and one shorter and tied at the waist"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//media.guim.co.uk/b9961e684c2e481415429774f4aba3317d95f21b/0_202_1838_2298/800.jpg&desktop_before=//media.guim.co.uk/b9961e684c2e481415429774f4aba3317d95f21b/0_202_1838_2298/800.jpg&label_before=&mobile_after=//media.guim.co.uk/431ef8a8a7e4333c1512dbdf6ea4a3d650d0008a/24_409_2567_3209/800.jpg&desktop_after=//media.guim.co.uk/431ef8a8a7e4333c1512dbdf6ea4a3d650d0008a/24_409_2567_3209/800.jpg&label_after=&analytics_label= Sokolata&type=duo&">Interactive</a> <figcaption>Cameroonian designer Sikoti Mbaitjongue imports cotton from Benin, but it affects the cost of her range.

Nairobi fashion week organisers have also called for tighter regulations on imported garments.</p> <p>Brian Kihindas, creative director of the Nairobi Fashion Week, convened a group of traders, consumers, designers and policymakers to discuss the issue over the week and make recommendations. “The quality [of second hand clothes] has been watered down, and that’s a textile waste issue,” he says.</p>
