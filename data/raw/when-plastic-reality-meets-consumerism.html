<p>On <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/microplastics-hinder-plant-photosynthesis-study-finds-threatening-millions-with-starvation">10 March</a>, you reported on a study showing that microplastics may impact plant photosynthesis, putting hundreds of millions at risk of starvation, part of your continuing important coverage of the damage caused by plastic.</p> <p>A few days later, on 14 March, an article suggested ways to reduce your use of plastic: “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/14/simple-ways-cut-down-plastic">Get milk delivered and always buy refills: 20 simple ways to cut down on plastic (and save money)</a>” . All well and good. However, a few days after that, on 17 March, there was a glowing five-star <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/mar/16/otty-original-hybrid-mattress-review">review of the Otty Original Hybrid mattress</a> . This uncritically noted that the mattress is compressed in the factory and delivered in a box, “encased in metres of sturdy plastic” to stop it expanding during transit, but this fact was not mentioned again, even in the section purportedly examining the sustainability of the product.</p> <p>There seems to be a lack of coherence here: a clash between reports on the reality of pervasive plastic pollution and the often superficial nods to “sustainability” that form part of contemporary&nbsp;consumerism.<br><strong>Samuel Bruce</strong><br><em>Mitaka City, Tokyo, Japan</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
