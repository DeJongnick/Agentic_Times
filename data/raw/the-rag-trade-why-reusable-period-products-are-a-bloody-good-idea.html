<p>About <a href="https://www.cityservices.act.gov.au/recyclopaedia/factsheets/menstrual-products">800m</a> disposable pads and tampons are purchased in Australia every year. Once used, most period products – and their packaging – end up in landfill. If <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/26/a-blocked-loo-is-on-you-surge-in-fatbergs-as-bizarre-items-flushed-down-sydneys-toilets">incorrectly flushed</a> they can clog toilets and contribute to wastewater blockages.</p> <p>With 10,000 disposable period products used on average over a lifetime, sustainable alternatives that work can reduce waste.</p> <p>These days there are plenty of ways to manage without relying on single-use products, with options ranging from period undies to menstrual cups.</p> <h2>Diversity of experience and product choice</h2> <p>Dr Emmalee Ford, a researcher at <a href="https://www.fpnsw.org.au">Family Planning Australia</a> and the <a href="https://www.newcastle.edu.au">University of Newcastle</a>, says menstrual cycle duration, the age of someone’s first period and the onset of menopause can vary significantly and influence what products they use to manage their period flow. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/23/recycling-alone-wont-limit-the-scourge-of-soft-plastics-in-our-everyday-lives">Recycling alone won’t limit the scourge of soft plastics in our everyday lives</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Education, income and personal preference also play a role. “The choice of what [product] you use is limited by so many things,” Ford says.</p> <h2>Reusable pants and pads are popular options</h2> <p>One way to reduce waste is by switching to a reusable alternative, such as period undies or fabric pads.</p> <p>Period undies are easy to use, says Megan Lim, an associate professor and lead of the young people’s health research group at the <a href="https://www.burnet.edu.au">Burnet Institute</a>. They are worn like standard underwear, but incorporate a built-in absorbent pad.</p> <p>Widely available in supermarkets, pharmacies and online, period undies cost between $14 and $30 a pair, depending on the brand. Investing in multiple pairs or pads increases the initial cost.</p> <p>But while the upfront cost is higher than disposable pads (about 40c each), the more period undies are worn, the lower the cost-per-use. When period undies are washed and re-worn many times, they can cost as little as 13c per use, according to data from the <a href="https://www.cityservices.act.gov.au/recyclopaedia/education-resources/menstrual-products">ACT government</a>.</p> <p>Lim says period undies and reusable pads are popular with people aged 15-29, a group who are more likely to use pads than tampons. “It’s a similar style of product that’s not inserted,” she says.</p> <p>Period underwear should be washed after each use, but are machine washable and can be thrown in with the rest of your washing.</p> <p>A set of reusable pads or period undies are expected to last for around two years, but they should be replaced if they are no longer absorbing enough blood, have general wear and tear, or don’t smell fresh after washing.</p> <h2>Be a diva and use a menstrual cup</h2> <p>Menstrual cups are another reusable alternative. Also known as moon cups or diva cups, these flexible devices look like a tiny silicone wine glass, and cost between $40 and $70.</p> <p>The cup is folded in half and then inserted similarly to a tampon. Once in place, the cup unfolds to create a suction seal, and only needs to be changed every 12 hours.</p> <p>Once the menstrual cup is full, it should be emptied and rinsed, before being inserted again. At the end of each period, the cup should be sterilised by boiling it in water over the stove or in a microwave safe, product specific steriliser. If maintained well, a menstrual cup can last for five years.</p>    <p>In Lim’s <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39670424/">research</a>, some people reported problems with menstrual cups – including leaking, feeling uncomfortable, being annoying to clean or having difficulty removing them. But the upfront cost is the main barrier to people trying them. “If you’re not completely sure how, or if you want to use it, it’s a big investment,” Lim says.</p> <p>It’s important to be aware that menstrual cups work by creating suction, which can dislodge contraceptive intrauterine devices (IUDs). Lim says “2% of cup users had an IUD pulled out when removing a cup”. She recommends not using a menstrual cup if you have an IUD.</p> <p>Despite these challenges and upfront costs, the longevity of menstrual cups makes their cost-per-use the lowest of all period products at just 9c, compared with tampons at 50c each. Research suggests that a menstrual cup has just <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344919303179?via%253Dihub%20">1.5% of the environmental impact</a> of a disposable product and costs 90% less per use.</p> <p>“It’s really about education and providing knowledge, not just how to use them and what they can do, but how to choose a cup that fits you right and [finding] what sort of products would be best for you.”</p> <h2>Go with the flow and choose the option right for you</h2> <p>If washing reusable products or spending $50 on a menstrual cup isn’t your thing, there are other sustainable alternatives to disposable period products.</p> <p>To reduce plastic waste, check the materials used to manufacture your disposable pad or tampon. Choosing a product made with plant fibres or organic cotton instead of a rayon or polyester blend is an easy habit to change. A product without a plastic applicator or without any applicator also limits what ends up in the bin.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/11/the-vaginal-microbiome-how-to-look-after-it-and-what-to-avoid">The vaginal microbiome: how to look after it – and what to avoid</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lim and Ford stress that no one should be shamed for using a disposable product.</p> <p>“The right choice for you is not necessarily about what everyone says is best. What works for me might not work for someone else, and there’s no wrong way to do it,” Ford says.</p> <p>Lim agrees. “It’s not all or nothing,” she says. “You don’t have to choose one or the other. But every pad or tampon that you save by using a reusable product instead is one less pad or tampon in landfill.”</p>
