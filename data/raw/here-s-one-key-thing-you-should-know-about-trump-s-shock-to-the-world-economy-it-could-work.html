<p>It’s less than a week since Donald Trump’s sensational announcement that he was unilaterally ending the world’s trading system with the imposition of a 10% minimum tariff for trading with the US – and a very much higher rate for those countries unfortunate enough to have the US as a major export partner. Long-term allies such <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/04/03/economy/trump-tariff-japan-response/">as Japan</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-acting-president-orders-emergency-measures-over-us-tariffs-2025-04-02/">South Korea</a> have been hammered with tariffs of around 25%, while export-dependent poorer countries such as Vietnam, which sells about a third of its exports to the US, have been hit with <a href="https://www.vietnam-briefing.com/news/us-vietnam-trade-relations-trump-impact-tariffs-vietnamese-exports.html/">tariffs in excess of 45%</a>. A further round of global debt crises is possible as heavily indebted countries face the sudden loss of export earnings.</p> <p>Global <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/07/stock-market-dow-jones-sp-ftse-trump-tariffs">stock markets have tumbled</a> as panicked investors dump shares, and political condemnation has been near-universal. China has already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/china-donald-trump-tariffs-recession--us-stock-market">retaliated with 34% tariffs</a>, threatening an escalating trade war. Right now, it looks and feels like disastrous overreach by a uniquely erratic administration at the behest of a president with a terrifyingly limited grasp of how the modern economy works.</p> <p>Trump has talked about imposing tariffs on the world since he first rose to prominence in the 1980s, when his target was Japan. In a political career notable for its jack-knifes in policy and direction, tariffs – “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2024/dec/16/the-most-beautiful-word-in-the-dictionary-donald-trumps-tariff-plan-podcast">the most beautiful word in the dictionary</a>” – have been a constant. But this is about far more than his long-cherished whims. However inconsistent or even confused Trump may sometimes appear to be, those around him have a clear-eyed view of what they want to achieve.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/07/corportate-trump-tariffs-backlash">Corporate America won’t stop Trump’s tariffs. Here’s why | Alex Bronzini-Vender</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His Treasury secretary, hedgefund billionaire Scott Bessent, has spoken of a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drPH94fio7E&amp;list=PL0Gc4VoRItIro2S4e5ZuFCU_2kTFc3g1t&amp;index=4&amp;t=10s">global economic reordering</a>” that he intends to shape to the benefit of the US’s elite. Trump’s new chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Stephen Miran, wrote a <a href="https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf">lengthy paper</a>, A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System, shortly before his appointment. The latter is particularly ambitious – detailing how the US should use not only tariffs but also the threat of withdrawing its security support to compel its friends and allies to accept cuts in payments due from the Federal Reserve on their US Treasury bills. This would be a potentially massive loss to them, akin, in reality, to a US debt default. But it is tariffs that are the cutting edge of the plan – leveraging the US’s power as the world’s largest consumer and greatest debtor to compel other countries into a negotiation on terms.</p> <p>After decades winning in an international trading game it wrote and refereed the rules for, the US is now facing serious competition – primarily from China, but with Europe as an expensive irritant. The response of this administration is to kick over the table, and demand everyone starts again. What it ultimately wants is a cheaper dollar to revive US manufacturing and Chinese competition held off, all the while keeping the dollar as the world’s reserve currency. And the rest of the world will pay the price.</p> <p>There are precedents. In October 1979, Paul Volcker, newly appointed as chair of the Federal Reserve, <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/anti-inflation-measures">drove up interest rates</a> to a remarkable 13% in a bid to tackle inflation, later raising them to 17%. Soon the US was in recession. Millions lost their jobs over the next two years, notably in manufacturing, where soaring interest rates had driven up the value of the dollar, making US exports less affordable on the world market. After a light easing of interest rate hell by the Fed, Volcker applied a second dose of the medicine, driving interest rates up to 19% and forcing the economy back into a double-dip recession. Unemployment peaked at around 10% in late 1982.</p>    <p>But by mid-1983, inflation had come down to 2.5%. For the rest of the 1980s, the US economy boomed. The “Volcker shock” appeared to have worked. Volcker is today a folk hero among central bankers: Ben Bernanke, chair of the Federal Reserve during the 2008 crisis, praised Volcker’s “<a href="https://theweek.com/articles/883046/complicated-legacy-paul-volcker">independence</a>” and willingness to brazen out the political storm.</p> <p>More decisive than lower inflation, however, was the reshaping of the US economy Volcker’s interest-rate shock accelerated: with manufacturing in freefall, investment flooded into finance and property, firing up what became the great credit bubble of the 1990s and 2000s. The world economy was reordered around a US that acted as a giant sink for its output – swallowing exports from the rest of the world on seemingly limitless borrowing. China’s extraordinary boom was the flipside of US debt and deindustrialisation. The Volcker shock, more than any other single action, created the globalised world system that Trump is now bent on destroying.</p> <p>Few would have bet on Volcker’s world-shaping capacity at the time. The stock market response to the shock was immediate and unanimous. US shares plunged by a record 8% in the two days after his announcement<strong>.</strong> The S&amp;P 500 lost 27% of its value before August 1982 – two years of grinding decline. Manufacturers and unions hated it, understandably: they were on the wrong side of an epochal reconfiguration of US capitalism. But they were not the only losers: rising interest rates in the US meant less developed countries had to spend more on<strong> </strong>servicing debts, just as recession squeezed their major export markets. The result was the so-called “third world” debt crisis, as heavily indebted countries across the global south plunged into spirals of economic decline and soaring indebtedness.</p> <p>Over the weekend, Bessent and commerce secretary Howard Lutnick were doing the media rounds, insisting that there <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/06/commerce-secretary-lutnick-tariffs-are-coming.html">would be no climbdown</a> on the tariffs. Trump is not for turning on what is clearly for him a personal crusade. Already, countries such as Vietnam are promising to cut all their tariffs on US goods – a clear and brutal demonstration of the US’s continuing economic power. The administration has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/06/donald-trump-tariffs-keir-starmer-uk-world-live-news-updates">claimed 50 other countries</a> have also asked to open negotiations. By the end of the week, expect Trump to be triumphantly announcing more such concessions from economies in the global south. His real target – China – will be a far tougher nut to crack, if it breaks at all.</p> <p>Perhaps the rolling market chaos will become too much. Perhaps the administration will blink first. There is no guarantee this extraordinary gamble will work, not even for those in the clique around Trump. But it would be a mistake to assume it cannot work – and however the pieces now land, they will not return to their old places.</p> <ul> <li><p>James Meadway is the host of the podcast Macrodose</p></li> </ul>
