<p>Thousands of viewers have already tuned in to see a fluffy trio of falcon chicks born atop a Melbourne skyscraper, but the real cliffhanger is yet to come.</p> <p>In their lofty nest on top of a Melbourne skyscraper, three peregrine falcon chicks hatched from three eggs, with the first tiny beak appearing on 30 September.</p> <p>Over the next few weeks, teetering from a ledge 150m above <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@367collinsfalcons4/streams">367 Collins Street</a>, the birds will learn to fly. It’s heart-in-mouth viewing, and as the big day approaches – in early November – the falcon livestream will begin popping up in the corner of screens, in office buildings around the country, with tens of thousands of viewers expected to tune in.</p> <p>“People get very excited waiting for the day when the first one flies,” says peregrine expert Dr Victor Hurley. “I apologise to business managers the world over, because productivity does collapse. In the lead up to fledging there’s almost permanent watch parties going on.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2025/oct/06/australian-bird-of-the-year-2025-vote-now">Australian bird of the year 2025: vote for your favourite #birdoftheyear in the Guardian / BirdLife Australia poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First, the birds will spend “an inordinate amount of time running up and down the ledge, flapping,” he says. Then, the adults will start reducing their food, and might fly past the ledge with a dead starling, or a pigeon, Hurley says, almost taunting the young with food.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/10/sign-up-for-the-clear-air-australia-environment-newsletter-with-adam-morton?CMP=copyembed">Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletter</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Sometimes the fledglings will hover for a bit first, before ultimately taking the plunge.</p> <p>“It’s a dangerous environment,” Hurley says, “if they fledge early it’s asking for trouble.</p> <p>“The longer they take, the stronger they are, the lighter they are, the better their first flight will be.”</p> <p>It’s gripping TV, and the live broadcast from 367 Collins is one of many across the country, each attracting its own dedicated band of viewers.</p> <p>Can’t get enough birds during <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2025/oct/06/australian-bird-of-the-year-2025-vote-now">bird of the year</a>?
