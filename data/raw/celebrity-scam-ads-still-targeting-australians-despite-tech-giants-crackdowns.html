<p>Scammers are finding loopholes in restrictions brought in by Google and Meta to combat fake celebrity scam ads and experts warn they will be hard to stop while Australia remains a lucrative target for cybercriminals.</p> 
<p>On Monday Meta <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/dec/02/meta-to-force-financial-advertisers-to-be-verified-in-bid-to-prevent-celebrity-scam-ads-targeting-australians">announced it would require businesses targeting financial advertising</a> at Australians to verify themselves, including through the Australian Securities Investment Commission, to check they hold an Australian financial services licence.</p> 
<p>This came after increased pressure for tech companies to tackle the scourge of celebrity investment scams and other fraud taking place on their services, and before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2024/nov/07/banks-and-social-media-companies-to-be-fined-over-scams-under-new-australian-laws-touted-as-strongest-in-world">federal government legislating framework</a> that will force the tech companies to verify advertisers.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.google/intl/en-au/australian-financial-services-advertisers-verification/">Google implemented a similar change in 2022</a> and there has been a marked downward trend in the number of reported losses from scams, from a peak of $53m and more than 25,000 reports in the month of May 2023.</p> 
<p>But as of September 2024, the National Anti-Scams Centre still recorded $16m in losses from scams from more than 16,000 reports, with nearly half of the reports stating they had been scammed on social media.</p>

<p>Ads featuring investment scams, including celebrity investment scams, can still be seen on sites using Google’s ads, albeit less frequently than at the peak.</p> 
<p>The company has said in 2023 it suspended 12.7m advertiser accounts – nearly double the previous year – and blocked or removed more than 5.5bn ads, including more than 273m for violating the company’s financial services policies.</p> 
<p>Google said bad actors operating with more sophistication and at a greater scale were changing their tactics in an attempt to evade detection. This included impersonating genuine licence holders or using text manipulation to circumvent automatic detection.</p> 
<p>The scammers also used cloaking to show Google’s ad reviewers and systems different ad content than they showed users, meaning the company had to keep developing its own detection strategies.</p>

<p>An RMIT cybersecurity professor, Asha Rao, said nothing would be 100% effective in deterring scammers but that the efforts of Google and Meta would reduce the flow. Rao said it was possible that scammers were finding loopholes.</p> 
<p>Chester Wisniewski, the global field chief technology officer for the cybersecurity firm Sophos, said cybercriminals would always learn to how to evade capture.</p> 
<p>“Cybercriminals are making millions of dollars and will continue to evolve tactics to bypass detection schemes – evident with Google’s previous shortcomings at cracking down on scams,” Wisniewski said.</p> 
<p>He said he hoped Meta and Google’s actions would be the first of many.</p> 
<p>“There is no silver bullet to stop scams on the internet, and while companies have a big responsibility to protect Australians, individuals should also exercise constant vigilance to be their own best protector online.”</p> 
<p>Rafe Berding, a spokesperson for the cybersecurity firm AUCyber, said Australia would always be a lucrative market for scammers and it wasn’t solely up to the platforms to change that.</p> 
<p>“The maturity of our technology [and] the wealth of our nation will always dictate that we will be one of the most scammed countries in the world,” he said.</p> 
<p>“That is the reality, and it is a whole community effort through education, through legislation, through governance, that we can try and really stop it.”</p>
