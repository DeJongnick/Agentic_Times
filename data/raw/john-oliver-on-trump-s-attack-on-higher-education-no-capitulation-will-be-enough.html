<p>On the latest Last Week Tonight, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/john-oliver">John Oliver</a> looked into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/23/us-college-campuses-trump-funding-protests">assault on higher education</a> in the US. “Trump has long held a grudge against higher education, and now that he’s in power, he’s acting on it,” Oliver explained. Among other things, Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/06/trump-administration-ucla-grants">targeted</a> the billions of dollars granted to universities for scientific <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/trump-administration-harvard-funding-cut">research</a> “in order to bend them to his will”.</p> <p>Trump’s “war on higher education” continues a long tradition of conservative distrust of universities. Back in 1972, Richard Nixon said “the professors are the enemy,” and as Oliver noted, Republicans have railed for years against higher education for supposedly wasteful spending on scientific research – think the Fox News fixation on the alleged “shrimp on a treadmill” study – and for being supposed bastions of liberal indoctrination. “Conservatives have long sought to orient universities sharply to the right,” he said. “And in recent years, they’ve seized upon a new justification for doing this – specifically, to ‘combat antisemitism’ in the wake of student protests over Gaza.”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk94il8L820"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xk94il8L820?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Of those protests, Oliver noted: “Multiple things can be true. You can think some critics of the protests were conflating criticism of Israel with antisemitism, and that some are pointing out actual instances of antisemitism. You can also acknowledge that some Jewish students did feel unsafe because of the actions of some protesters and that some protesters were made unsafe by universities calling the police on them. You can also argue that many universities did themselves no favors by failing to figure out a coherent, consistent response.</p> <p>“But none of that nuance has been present in the White House’s response, which has been to suggest the wholesale destruction of certain universities.” Soon after taking office, Trump convened a “Task Force to Combat Antisemitism” backed by Stephen Miller with the goal of targeting certain schools with large protest movements and, to quote its lead <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/leo-terrell-trump-neo-nazi-tweet">Leo Terrell</a>, “taking away their money”.</p> <p>“Look, if colleges were spending all of their federal money on inventing a big automatic antisemitism generator, then yeah, it would make sense to take their money away,” said Oliver. “But the thing is, they’re not doing that, partly because it seems to be Elon Musk’s project.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/18/john-oliver-make-america-healthy-again">John Oliver on ‘Make America healthy again’: ‘A bleak time to be involved in public health’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Instead, the money being taken away is largely going to research studies, and cutting those has nothing to do with antisemitism.”</p> <p>As Michael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University, put it on Face the Nation: “The idea that you are attacking antisemitism by attacking universities, I think is a complete charade. It’s just an excuse for getting universities to conform.”</p> <p>“Right, it’s obviously bullshit,” Oliver confirmed. “The very idea that Trump’s actions are part of some great effort to defend the Jewish people is, as charades go, slightly less convincing than a toddler playing hide-and-seek.”</p> <p>Oliver considered a non-exhaustive list of “telltale signs that this isn’t really about antisemitism concerns”, including but not limited to the fact that Trump reportedly kept a book of Hitler’s speeches next to his bed, dined with Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes this summer, brought people into his administration with records of antisemitic comments, reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/06/donald-trump-hitler-michael-bender-book">said</a> during his first term that “Hitler did a lot of good things”, and was endorsed in his first campaign by both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/feb/25/david-duke-kkk-vote-donald-trump">David Duke</a> and the KKK. “Hearing that Trump is suddenly waging war against antisemites is like hearing that Billy Joel is waging war against dads from Long Island,” he joked.</p> <p>Oliver then looked into exactly what the administration is doing, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/trump-administration-cancels-columbia-university-funding">cancelling</a> Columbia’s grants until the school stopped considering race in admissions, paid $200m in fines and reformed their Middle Eastern studies department, among other requirements. The university “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/21/columbia-university-funding-trump-demands">caved</a> in about five seconds”, Oliver noted, “officially solidifying Columbia’s reputation as the Little Bitch University, rather than what it was known for before: being the place that Timothée Chalamet went to for five minutes before realizing he didn’t need it”.</p> <p>The capitulation didn’t change anything, either; weeks later, the administration froze all of the university’s remaining funding from the National Institutes of Health, about $700m in total, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/04/trump-columbia-accreditation">threatened</a> the school’s accreditation. “There’s no guarantee the administration is going to stop making demands from Columbia, and why would they when they keep getting met?” said Oliver.</p> <p>The situation, which has caused a chilling effect on campus, “goes much further than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/aug/26/trump-harvard-feud">Harvard</a> and Columbia”, Oliver explained, as the administration has frozen hundreds of millions in research funds at several other private institutions, and slashed studies at several public universities. Even Northwestern, a school that tried pre-capitulating to the administration by releasing public steps taken to combat antisemitism, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/08/trump-administration-cornell-northwestern-funding">targeted</a> anyway, with over $790m in grants frozen. Those funds have still not been unfrozen, even though the university’s president, Michael Schill, the Jewish descendant of Holocaust survivors, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/04/northwestern-university-president-resigns-trump-cuts">stepped down</a> amid forced layoffs.</p> <p>That case, in particular, highlighted for Oliver what the government’s assault on universities was really about. He pointed to a clip of JD Vance from 2021: “We go to the universities, we use the hundreds of billions of dollars that we send to them as leverage and we say: ‘Unless you stop indoctrinating our children, unless you stop indoctrinating our entire society, you don’t get another dime of our money.’”</p> <p>“That is the exact same plan as now, just hastily remodeled to be about ‘fighting antisemitism’, expecting no one to notice,” said Oliver. “It’s basically the rhetorical equivalent of when a random business clearly used to be a Pizza Hut.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/aug/11/john-oliver-trump-ice-immigration">John Oliver on Ice’s crackdown: ‘Trying to drive up arrests at all costs’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The end result, as one researcher put it, is that the “science in this country is going to be destroyed”, which is bad for future innovations as well as for the private sector. One study <a href="https://www.unitedformedicalresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/UMR_NIH-Role-in-Sustaining-US-Economy-FY2024-2025-Update.pdf">found</a> that every dollar of medical research funded by the NIH delivered $2.56 in economic activity. “So even if you are someone who hates learning and loves money – and yes, I am talking to one guy in particular here – publicly funded research is just a no-brainer,” said Oliver. “But obviously that is not what this is really about. This is about the right being willing to sacrifice everything, up to and including a generation’s worth of scientific progress, to get what it wants.”</p> <p>“And it is not hard to see what that is. Because when the administration is launching investigations like ‘why aren’t there more white men teaching at Harvard?’, you know what they’re up to,” he continued. “Just like you know what the plan was when they suddenly canceled diversity grants awarded to PhD students who were members of certain racial or ethnic groups, disabled, or from disadvantaged backgrounds.”</p> <p>Where do things go from here? “I don’t really know, and I’m not sure this administration does either,” said Oliver. But “even if there is not a fixed destination, there is a clear direction. And that is they want to turn back a clock that, quite honestly, had taken way too long to move forward, and restore all of academia to being a training ground for those looking to uphold old systems of power instead of questioning them.”</p> <p>In conclusion, he added: “You can have problems with academia. You can think it’s too cloistered or too liberal. You can think it’s becoming too expensive or that its resources are misallocated. But the notion of the state suddenly executing a sweeping takeover of higher education to this degree is chilling.”</p> <p>Based on everything that has happened so far, “no capitulation will be enough, and they will never stop demanding more.” Given that, Oliver argued, universities should “stop yielding, stand firm and fight back” because although it is tempting to think one more capitulation will safeguard your independence, “it’s worth asking at what point have you compromised so much that the thing you’re supposed to be defending is gone.”</p>
