<p>Two Nine Entertainment staff members in Paris to cover the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/olympic-games">Olympic Games</a> have allegedly been attacked in what colleagues have described as a suspected robbery of a “serious physical nature”.</p> 
<p>Nine reporter Christine Ahern said the two staff members were working in the international broadcast centre in the northeastern suburbs of Paris and were walking back to their accommodation on Monday afternoon when they were attacked by a group.</p> 
<p>“It was clear it was a robbery because they went for the backpacks. There was no weapon used, but there was quite a significant assault,” she told 3AW radio from Paris on Wednesday morning.</p> 
<p>“The two workers managed to get away, but obviously it’s a worry.”</p>

<p>Ahern said the tech workers were “OK” and back at work today, but “shaken up” by what occurred.</p> 
<p>Nine’s director of sport, Brent Williams, reminded staffers in Paris to remain vigilant, and described the alleged attack as being of a “serious physical nature”.</p> 
<p>In an internal note seen by the Guardian, Williams said the Paris crew of around 200 should take care when commuting to the broadcast centre. </p>

<p>French police are investigating the allegation that the tourist was sexually assaulted by five men, according to local media.</p> 
<p>According to the reports, the woman aged in her 20s told police in Paris she had been raped by several men.</p> 
<p>The Australian chef de mission, Anna Meares, said on Tuesday morning she had heard of no threats against team members, but they were being advised to be careful when going outside the athletes’ village.</p> 
<p>“I have been informed, it sounds horrific. Obviously our hearts go out to the woman involved and we hope she’s being cared for and supported in the trauma she’s experienced,” Meares said.</p>
