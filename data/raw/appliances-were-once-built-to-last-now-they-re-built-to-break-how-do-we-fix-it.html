<p>Sometimes the smallest things get in the way of repairing a broken appliance.</p> <p>“There might be one screw that the company owns the copyright to, so you can’t buy it anywhere,” says Rowan Barr.</p> <p>Barr runs a repair cafe at Lilydale Lake in Melbourne, one of 112 predominantly volunteer-run centres across Australia. She says proprietary tools are a “bugbear” for skilled repairers – who might have 12 different screwdrivers and still not be able take apart a particular brand of vacuum cleaner to fix it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>It is hard to fix things in Australia. Manufacturers restrict access to spare parts and repair manuals and make products so they need to be replaced rather than repaired.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/02/how-to-fix-household-items-washing-machine-furniture">Can I fix it? Yes you can! Don’t throw away these household items before trying to repair them</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Things used to be built to last, and now they’re built to break with short lifespans,” Barr says. “It’s designed that way so you will just buy new.”</p> <p>Most Australians share the frustration, according to a <a href="https://cprc.org.au/report/misused-and-confused">national survey and research</a> run by the independent Consumer Policy Research Centre.</p> <p>“People want to repair their products, they want to keep what they have for longer, and they’re struggling to do so,” says Erin Turner, the centre’s chief executive.</p> <p>“These are hip-pocket issues, but they’re also environmental issues. People deeply, deeply care about them.”</p> <p>Overall, the survey found 85% of Australians wanted to know the expected lifespan of an appliance before they bought it. The vast majority backed the idea of a durability and repairability label to help compare different products.</p> <p>“People want really good, clear information,” Turner says. “Particularly they want answers to: how long will this product last? And can I fix it if it breaks?”</p> <p>The survey showed existing water and energy appliance ratings worked well. “They have high recognition, they have high trust, so people are using them,” Turner says.</p> <p>So the CPRC wants the government to bring in a similar type of label and rating scheme for durability and repairability, an idea supported by the Productivity Commission in its <a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/repair/report/repair.pdf">Right to Repair</a> and <a href="https://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/circular-economy/interim/circular-economy-interim.pdf">Circular Economy</a> inquiries.</p> <p>A similar scheme already operates in France, where products are required to display a repairability rating based on criteria such as the availability of spare parts, repair manuals and whether the product can be easily disassembled or needs specialised tools.</p> <p>Many people can remember a time when major household appliances such as a fridge or sewing machine were rarely replaced – when appliances came with a circuit diagram or a repair manual and there were service centres you could call when things stopped working.</p> <p>Karen and Danny Ellis, the reuse and repair enthusiasts behind Mend It, Australia, say companies have slowly eliminated all of that. The result is a throw-away society and an e-waste problem, with many working and repairable items ending up in hard rubbish or landfill.</p> <p>Working with their local council, the couple have audited a selection of 1,000 appliances sent to e-waste. Of the items selected, they found 70% in working order and 20% able to be repaired. Most could be resold in the council’s tip shop.</p> <p>There are lots of opportunities for reuse, recycling and harvesting parts being missed, Karen says.</p> <p>“The federal government is all about productivity. They’re all wondering how they can make money from the circular economy. Well, we’re showing them at the real grassroots – and it can be scaled up.”</p> <p>A first step is mandatory labelling that encourages durability and repair, and helps consumers make better decisions.</p> <p>The status quo in Australia is expensive for consumers, Turner says. “Things are breaking sooner, you’re replacing more frequently. You’re losing money at every step of the purchase and ownership process.</p> <p>“We’ve got more waste. We’ve got people losing money. And there are simple answers here that are being rolled out in other countries … What we need is governments to step in to disrupt this cycle.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
