 <h2 class="block-title">Preston condemn Milutin Osmajić ban</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Preston North End:</strong> The Championship club have issued a statement condemning the nine-match ban and £21,000 fine handed down to their striker Milutin Osmajić by the Football Association after allegations that the Monetengran had racially abused Burnley’s Hannibal Mejbri during a league fixture in February were found proven. Mejbri reported the incident to the match referee at the time, while Osmajić has repeatedly denied accusations of any wrongdoing.</p> 
  <p>Burnley’s manager, Scott Parker, fully supported Mejbri and left him out of a subsequent FA Cup tie between the two teams a fortnight later to protect him from any fallout. Parker also supported his players’ collective decision not to shake hands with Osmajic before the fifth round game, a call supported by the FA investigation.</p> 
  <p>“We are extremely disappointed at the decision made by an independent regulatory commission to sanction Milutin Osmajić and impose a nine-match suspension, following an incident which took place in a league fixture against Burnley on 15th February 2025,” said Preston’s statement.</p> 
  <p>“We note that the outcome was determined on the ‘Balance of Probabilities’ rather than one that is ‘Beyond Reasonable Doubt’. We also note that the FA determined that this decision offers no moral judgement, was not premeditated nor any comment about his general character.</p> 
  <p>“Milutin has always pleaded his innocence of the charge and continues to do so. We continue to be fully supportive of our player. We are proud of our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion policies and practices, and we reaffirm our opposition to all forms of discrimination.”</p> 
  <p>Osmajić, who last year served an eight-match ban for biting Blackburn’s Owen Beck, will begin his ban immediately and must also under go a mandatory education course.</p>

  <p><strong>Brentford:</strong> Keith Andrews side welcome a Newcastle side whose Premier League form has been up and down like a yo-yo to the Getech Community Stadium on Sunday and in the build-up to what could be an intriguing match, the Dubliner has been talking about the non-return of Yoane Wissa, the former Bees striker who spat the dummy and demanded a move to Newqcastle during the summer but has yet to play under Eddie Howe because he’s sidelined with a knee injury. </p> 
  <p>“Wissa is a very good player, so I am not too displeased that he is not going to be available because it’s the nature of competing against teams,” he said. “Around the transfer window, I was glad when it was closed; it wasn’t enjoyable for a lot of people, I would imagine. I think the nature of that deal in particular - there was a lot made around certain aspects of it. Ultimately, they paid a really good fee for a player of a certain age, a really good player, but I think we as a club did pretty well out of that.”</p>

There’s a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry">timeless explainer</a> here and ahead of the game, Brighton’s German coach said the significance of the A23 derby is not lost on him.</p> 
  <p>“I understood from the first second,” he said. “We have to promise the supporters we will try to do everything to win it. At the end of the day, you cannot promise wins but you can promise to leave your heart on the pitch.</p> 
  <p>“It’s going to be really important to be in the right place mentally. If you’re too emotional, you can’t make the right decisions. If you’re not emotional enough, you won’t be committing to duels or keeping your intensity up. We need to find the right balance.”</p> 
  <p>Brighton will travel to London without James Milner, Brajan Gruda and Jack Hinshelwood, who are all injured. Joel Veltman is available for selection after recovering from a calf-injury, while Kaoru Mitoma is rated at no better than 50-50 as he continues his revoery from an ankle issue.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Gary O'Neil in talks to take over at Southampton</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Southampton:</strong> Already one of the hardest working men in football journalism, Ben Fisher has been busier than several hives full of bees today. Not content with bringing us the latest updates on Wolves’ hitching their skirts in the direction of Boro coach Rob Edwards, Ben has news of Gary O’Neil, who turned down a return to Molineux earlier this week and now looks like he might be off to the south coast instead. Read on …</p> 
  <p>Southampton have sounded out Gary O’Neil for their managerial vacancy and the former Wolves head coach is thought to have held preliminary talks about succeeding Will Still at St Mary’s, <em>he writes</em>. Still was sacked after two league wins in 13 matches with Saints hovering above the relegation zone.</p> 
  <p>O’Neil was poised to return to Wolves to succeed Vítor Pereira but pulled out of talks on Monday. He faced a supporter backlash and is also thought to have had reservations about the club’s working structure. O’Neil, who was sacked last December, is still being paid by Wolves under the terms of his severance package.</p> 
  <p>Wolves’s Supporters’ Trust said O’Neil’s return would evidence “a clear lack of strategic direction” by the Molineux club. Domenico Teti, the director of football who was an ally of Pereira’s, departed the club on Wednesday. Wolves have switched focus to Middlesbrough’s Rob Edwards, whose future is shrouded in doubt before Boro’s home meeting with Birmingham on Saturday.</p>

  <p><strong>Fulham:</strong> A former Everton manager who worked for the club between May 2018 and December 2019, Marco Silva takes Fulham to play their first match at hill dickenson Stadium tomorrow afternoon. Asked how it felt to be returning to face his former club, the Portuguese said he was looking forward to a pleasant afternoon catching up with familiar faces in an unfamiliar stadium. </p> 
  <p>“It’s always good when you go back to a place where you are going to see familiar faces and some people you know very well, and people who treat you very, very well,” he said.</p> 
  <p>“Some people in that structure, some players, they are still there from our time as well. And what I expect is always the same that I got the other times before, to have some good conversation before and after the match with people that I know very, very well, and people that welcome us always very well in that football club.</p> 
  <p>“Of course, Goodison was a special one. Okay, [moving] was the step that the club should give, and they gave. They are pleased with the place where they are playing right now and it’s going to be the first time, first experience for us in that stadium.</p> 
  <p>“But you can feel it, you can see it, that it’s been very, very good for them in that aspect, and we are going to embrace the challenge of playing there against a good side. A side with a very experienced manager, some mature players as well.”</p> 
  <p>Everton go into tomrrow’s game having won just one of their past seven matches in the top flight, while Fulham arrive on the back of an emphatic victory over Wolves that ended a run of four consecutive league defeats. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Thomas Frank: We'll "keep supporting" Destiny Odogie</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur:</strong> Thomas Frank says Tottenham are doing everything they can to support Destiny Udogie after a “terrible situation” in which he was allegedly threatened with a gun in north London.</p> 
  <p>The Metropolitan Police have launched an investigation after the incident involving the Spurs left-back on 6 September, while the club said on Tuesday it was providing support to Udogie and his family. A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of firearms with intent, blackmail and driving without a licence following the incident. He has been bailed while inquiries continue, the force said.</p> 
  <p>Udogie was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/05/destiny-udogie-revealed-as-footballer-allegedly-threatened-at-gunpoint-by-an-agent">identified by Italian media</a> on Tuesday as the previously unnamed Premier League player involved in the incident, with the 22-year-old still producing an impressive display in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/nov/04/tottenham-fc-copenhagen-champions-league-match-report">the 4-0 win over Copenhagen</a> in the Champions League later that night. Ahead of Saturday’s visit of Manchester United, Frank revealed everyone at Tottenham had rallied around Udogie.</p> 
  <p>“It is a terrible situation to have been in and I can’t speak too much about it as it’s a legal case, as we know, but the club and we have done everything we can to support him,” he said. “We’ll do that and he’s clearly doing well on the pitch, which is good and we’ll keep supporting him.”</p> 
  <p>On 6 September at 11.14pm, police were called following reports a man in his 20s had been threatened with a gun in Cockfosters Parade, Barnet. “Officers spoke to the victim and during the course of their investigation, it was also a reported another man in his 20s had also allegedly been blackmailed and threatened by the same individual,” said a police statement. “No injuries were reported in either incident. A 31-year-old man was arrested on Monday, 8 September on suspicion of possession of firearms with intent, blackmail and driving without a licence. He has been bailed while inquiries continue.”</p>

  <p><strong>Manchester City:</strong> Pep Guardiola has said Rodri is unlikely to be risked in Sunday’s Premier League clash with Liverpool. The Ballon d’Or-winning midfielder missed the midweek Champions League defeat of Borussia Dortmund after suffering another injury setback after starting just six games this season and the Spain international is still working his way back to full fitness following the knee surgery that ruled him out of most of the last campaign.</p> 
  <p>“We will see tomorrow but I think we will not take the risk,” said Pep. “It is the international break afterwards. You have to find the moment when you feel strong, you feel fit and can sustain the actions of the games that are so demanding, sustain it proper. You have to make that step.</p> 
  <p>“Still we are in November. The best part of the season is ahead of us and we need him. We are still playing without the Ballon d’Or winner, a massively important player for us. We are desperate to have him back but Nico [Gonzalez] right now is becoming a really important player.”</p> 
  <p>Rodri had missed four games with a hamstrong problem before returning as a late substitute in the victory over Bournemouth last Sunday. City’s first game after the international break is against Newcastle at St James’ Park on 22 November and Rodri has not been picked for the Spain squad to face Georgia and Turkey in the interim.</p>

  <p><strong>Aston Villa:</strong> Ollie Watkins has just one goal to his name in 15 appearances for Aston Villa so far this season, a poor run of form that appears to have cost him his place in the England squad announced by Thomas Tuchel this morning. It is a subject that was raised with Unai Emery ahead of Villa’s match against Bournemouth on Sunday and Emery said he was unconcerned by his striker’s lack of goals.</p> 
  <p>“All his career he’s shown that he’s a fighter and he overcame a lot of situations early in his career through being a fighter,” he said of Watkins. “And now - he must keep moving forward. He has to focus with us again recover his good form, get confident.</p> 
  <p>“Yesterday we were speaking and I told him ‘I am so so happy with you. You are a striker, you have been consistent all your career. From when I have arrived here, you’ve shown me your capacity to be resilient in all the moments we need to get fighting like you are and now I know you are going to recover and get your performance through being consistent and through fighting as you did and through focusing with us’.”</p> 
  <p>Speaking of his decision to drop Watkins from the England squad for the looming international break, Thomas Tuchel said: “We understood and could observe it when we watch Ollie that he is playing through discomfort, so it didn’t make sense to bring him into camp. We wanted to give him a break to get treatment and fight for his place again in March.” </p>

  <p><strong>Newcastle United:</strong> Eddie Howe will mark his fourth anniversary as Newcastle United manager tomorrow and could celebrate the occasion with his 100th win in charge of the club. Newcastle travel to play Brentford on Sunday but if they are to win at the Gtech Community Stadium, they may have to do so without Anthony Gordon, who was forced off at half-time in Newcastle’s win over Athletic Club on Wednesday night.</p> 
  <p>“We don’t think it’s a serious injury,” said Howe. “We’re going to get him scanned and we’re awaiting the results. There’s every chance he might miss out on Sunday but we’ll give him every opportunity to be fit.” William Osula will also miss out on Sunday’s match with an ankle injury which Howe says could rule the striker out for “a matter of weeks, not any longer.”</p> 
  <p>On the subject of Yoane Wissa, who Newcastle signed from Brentford during the summer but have yet to see in action because he was injured on international duty before he made his debut for his new club, Howe had this to say: “Yoane is working well. He’s on the grass and he’s building his fitness. The knee is feeling good and there’s no problems with that. It’s more a case of looking at his fitness, sharpness, all the things he’s going to need to put together. “He’s in a good place to kick on and push his body. We need to give him time to get fit, robust enough and be in a position to give his best version of himself for the team. I’m sure he’ll be worth the wait.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Thomas Tuchel open to England contract extension</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Thomas Tuchel is open to extending his stay as England manager beyond next summer’s World Cup, contrary to expectations that he would move on and vacate his position regardless of how England fared in the tournament.</p> 
  <p>The 52-year-old was named Gareth Southgate’s permanent successor last October and began working in the job at the turn of the year. Tuchel’s deal with the Football Association takes the former Chelsea boss through to the end of next year’s World Cup, which England have qualified for with two games to spare.</p> 
  <p>It is a job the German coach seems to enjoy and one he hinted in Friday’s press conference that he was interested in staying in beyond the tournament in North America. “I open up the possibility,” Tuchel he told BBC Radio 5 Live. “There’s always a possibility. If everyone, the FA is happy with me, there’s always the possibility, but the focus is now for camp. [The job is] not more fun than I thought. I find it just reassuring. I find it as exciting as I was hoping it to be.</p> 
  <p>“I didn’t know exactly what was coming. I knew that I would love to work with the players, but I was not aware what demands of international football for a coach actually means. Am I missing the daily work with the players? Yes, still, but it is very exciting so far to be close to this group of players and to shape this group of players, and of course, lead the group into a World Cup, so the best is yet to come. The most exciting part is yet to come and I’m looking very much forward to it. Personally, I’m in a good place, I like where I am. It’s a lot of fun. It’s very demanding, so all fine.”</p> 
  <p>Asked if he thought the England job suited him better than he thought it would, Tuchel said he wasn’t sure. “I was the one pleading for a short-term contract,” he said. “I was the one to say ‘let’s streamline it, let’s make it straightforward and let’s make this contract until the World Cup’, so I don’t lose focus and we all don’t lose focus and we get used to each other.

  <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur:</strong> Considering Spurs have won five and drawn two of their last seven games against tomorrow’s visitors, it’s probably fair to say the “Lads, it’s Tottenham” era is well and truly over for Manchester United. The sides meet in north London tomorrow afternoon and Thomas Frank has let it be known that his winger Mohammed Kudus is only “touch and go for tomorrow” after missing his team’s midweek win over Copenhagen in the Champions League.</p> 
  <p>Lucas Bergvall will also miss out with a concussion, while Atchie Gray, Yves Bissouma, Radu Dragusin, Ben Davies, Dominic Solanke, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also numbered among his team’s long- and short-term lame and halt.</p> 
  <p>Speaking of Solanke, who has been absent since August after undergoing surgery on an ankle injury, Frank had this to say: “I think the international break will be the big decider and we have two weeks to push him for the next steps. It is going forward. It was clear he was not ready before the international break. After is what we’re aiming for and you always want to get it right.”</p>

  <p><strong>Manchester City:</strong> Of course, the part of their job that all football managers enjoy the most is undertaking their obligations to deal with journalists before and after games and as he approaches his 1,000th game in charge, Pep jokes that he is no exception. “Two thousand press conferences!” he says. “Those were the best moments! Plus interviews. No, when I started, I didn’t expect this. But it is a joy. I didn’t enjoy every single moment but I enjoyed the journey a lot. I have been blessed.”</p>

  <p><strong>Manchester City:</strong> Eighteen years after he managed Barcelona B for the first time in a match against Premia in the Spanish fourth tier, Pep Guardiola will take charge of his 1,000th game for different sides –Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City – when his current club host Liverpool on Sunday.</p> 
  <p>“If I could chose one rival for his personal milestone that I want to share with many, many people - that would be the best,” he said. “I have been a long time in this country. Of course, Barcelona and the impact it had on my life as a ball boy, football player and manager. Of course, Bayern was an incredible step. But Liverpool, especially with Jurgen [Klopp], have been the biggest rival in this country and it could not be better. The destiny of the universe.</p> 
  <p>“I know how quickly things change. One week ago it was Liverpool ‘disaster, disaster’ and now they win two and it’s ‘are they back to their best?’ I’m sure the managers take a little bit more perspective of the situation. Always in a season there are ups and down.”</p>

  <p><strong>Bournemouth:</strong> Andoni Iraola has been speaking ahead of Bournemouth’s trip to Aston Villa on Sunday and naturally talk turned to Alex Scott’s call-up to the England squad by Thomas Tuchel. </p> 
  <p>“I’m pleased for him,” said the Spaniard. “He has been playing very well. Everyone was really excited for him this morning. In the beginning of the season he was also good for the England Under-21s. I am also pleased for the club, for his team-mates. Everyone around the club was happy as even if it’s an individual call, we feel it collectively and there is a recognition of playing for Bournemouth. If you do well you can have this reward.</p> 
  <p>“I think Alex, in the two seasons with us, has had three knee injuries. He hasn’t had a long run of games where he could play the level he is lately. To play in the summer with England put him in a perfect place for pre-season. He arrived strong, did a good pre-season and won his place in the team. He has strong competition in those positions. I think this period without any issue has been very good for him.”</p>

  <p><strong>Adam Wharton may have been recalled to the England squad but he’s not a certain starter for Crystal Palace this weekend.</strong> The 21-year-old missed the wins over Liverpool and Brentford due to illness and then played the final 30 minutes of Palace’s 3-1 Conference League victory over AZ Alkmaar on Thursday.</p> 
  <p>However, Palace boss Oliver Glasner said he’s not guaranteed to get the nod for the home showdown with Brighton on Sunday after watching Wharton in action against Alkmaar.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>He’s still feeling his chest is not completely free. Sometimes you need to cough it out. I hope this will happen now. Let’s see. It was good for him to play 30 minutes. For me he felt a little bit rusty at the beginning, moving a little bit slow. That’s why we wanted him to play these 30 minutes because he can recover in these next two days.</p> 
   <p>It was important for him to raise his heart frequency and get a little bit of intensity. He did better and better during the game. If it’s enough to start against Brighton, I don’t know at the moment.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Glasner also had this to say about his squad.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A few knocks, Marc (Guehi) had a knock at the end but he’s fine. At the moment it looks like all players who were involved (on Thursday) will be available.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Collins confirms he's in charge for Wolves' trip to Chelsea</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>While we await further news on Rob Edwards, Wolves interim coach James Collins has been speaking to the press.</strong> And Collins has provided a bit of clarity for this weekend at least, confirming that he’ll be in the away dugout.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What I have been told is that I’ll be taking the game this weekend. The likelihood is that it will be one, one week only, but you never know in football. Last time we were told it could be a week or two, and it ended up being six. My focus is on the team and our week’s work.</p> 
   <p>We were determined not to do is that it’s a week’s holiday and a new manager comes in. We had to make sure that we prepared properly for the game this weekend, it’s a Premier League game that can be won. That was the message to the players, and they’ve responded brilliantly. They’ve been unbelievably receptive to what we’ve done with them.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Collins, Wolves’ youth-team boss, has also praised the departed Vitor Pereira, who was sacked after a terrible start to the season which yielded just two points. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Vitor and his staff were brilliant with me, they welcomed us to watch training, they welcomed us to be around it, they welcomed us into meetings, they were enthusiastic about the U21s, and get players through. I can’t speak highly enough of them; they were brilliant people and good coaches.</p> 
   <p>Sometimes in football, it is dictated by results and in the end, if you keep losing, you lose your job. They understand that, but they did their job diligently, great people, and they treated me with great respect, and I wish them well.</p>

  <p><strong>Most Erling Haaland stats make the eyes go pop.</strong> For example, the Manchester City striker has scored 27 goals in 17 matches for club and country this season.</p> 
  <p>Here’s another from Opta: Haaland has netted 98 goals in 107 Premier League appearances – if he scores a brace in this game he will become the fastest player to 100 goals in Premier League history, with Alan Shearer the current quickest to 100 in 124 games.</p> 
  <p>And yet, his record against Sunday’s opponents, Liverpool, is underwhelming. He’s faced them eight times and only emerged on the winning side once. And in those matches he’s managed a paltry (for him) three goals. I was at Anfield for the first, the equaliser in a mad game when RB Salzburg fought back from 3-0 down before Mo Salah struck to give the relieved hosts a 4-3 win. Haaland was a sub that day in October 2019.</p> 
  <p>Haaland has only scored one Premier League goal against the Reds so will he improve that record this weekend?</p>

  <p><strong>Ahead of Chelsea v Wolves, Blues boss Enzo Maresca has been talking about the idea of facing a team without a manager.</strong> Although perhaps his comments will become moribund if Rob Edwards is making his way to the Black Country as we speak.</p> 
  <p>Maresca said in his press conference: “It’s difficult for this reason, it is also difficult because we play Wednesday night - the players were off yesterday, we have a small session today and a game tomorrow. So the game plan is also different, but we need to adapt.”</p> 
  <p>Chelsea could be without Romeo Lavia for the visit of Wolves after the midfielder was forced off early in the 2-2 draw against Qarabag with yet another injury.</p> 
  <p>“We don’t have an update at the moment,” said Maresca. “We need to wait some hours to do all the checks that he needs. He is painful. It’s a shame. We are tying to minimise minutes for him. But even with that he’s injured again. We need to persist until we find the right solution.”</p>

Mamdani <a href="https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1342904588438024192">took aim</a> at the midfielder in the lead-up to Arsenal’s match against Chelsea on Boxing Day 2020.

Xhaka has been a revelation at Bayer Leverkusen – where he won the Bundesliga title undefeated – and now Sunderland, where he is adored by fans for perfectly complementing the youth of Régis Le Bris’ surging side. The league leaders will go to the Stadium of Light wary of their former captain, who will surely be out to prove a point.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Maresca responds to Rooney criticism</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Some thinly sliced ultra-processed beef for you. Wayne Rooney was gently criticial of the extent to which Enzo Maresca rotates his Chelsea side after they draw with Qarabag in the Champions League. Maresca has responded thus:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are in an era where anyone can say what they want. Since I joined the club, it’s my view to rotate players. No one complains when you win. When you don’t win I can understand no one is agreeing.</p> 
   <p>I loved rotation as a player. Football is a bit different compared to years ago in terms of physicality and intensity. It’s impossible to play with the same players 65 games in one season.</p> 
   <p>You cannot say: ‘why, years ago, was it possible?’ Because it was different. It was not so physical. I played for 20 years. Now it’s changed. You need to rotate.</p> 
   <p>If you want to see the season like a marathon, when you are in February and March, the last sprint, you have to think in a different way.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Wolves’ search for their next head coach has taken another twist: Middlesbrough’s Rob Edwards will no longer be conducting his pre-match press conference. Wolves had an official approach for Edwards rejected on Thursday with Boro determined to keep the man who has led them to third in the Championship after taking over in the summer on a three-year contract.</p> 
  <p>Wolves are longstanding admirers of Edwards, who has a fondness for the club, having previously played and coached at Molineux. He also had a spell in caretaker charge in 2016, shortly after the Wolves owner, Fosun, assumed control of the club. Might he now take permanent charge?</p>

  <h2>On the return of Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden</h2> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are delighted they are back – their contributions to their goals has been immense. Jude comes back as a No10; I think that’s his best position and one of his key strengths is to arrive and score goals a No9 would score. They can seem like easy goals (but they aren’t) – this is one of his key qualities.</p> 
   <p>I see Phil as being strongest where he played against Dortmund – close to the opponent’s box, maybe as a mix between a 9 and a 10. He’s on the half-turn, then he assists; he’s in the pockets. The main thing with Phil is that he gets a role in the centre of the pitch. I don’t see him as a winger. His role will be very flud – but in the middel of the pitch.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <h2>On Alex Scott and Adam Wharton’s inclusion</h2> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Two different positions, two different profiles. It’s the third time we’ve tried to call Adam up – I hope he stays fit! Elliot [Anderson] has done very well for us. He is playing through pain at the moment – nothing major – so we are aware of that and we added Adam to the squad. We need to learn about him and prepare ourselves if Elliot is not able to play both 90 minutes. Don’t forget Jordan Henderson please because we have both options. </p> 
   <p>Alex deserves to be with us. I first closely saw him in the Euros with the under-21s when he was excellent together with Elliot Anderson. Since then he has really satepped up and is a regular starter for Bournemouth, who are overperforming constantly in the league. He has come a long way. He will come as a No8 and hopefully he can show his talent and personality.</p>

He played against Jude Bellingham for Southampton at youth level, now they are England teammates. “It has been a bit of a whirlwind few years,” he said. “I don’t really want to look back on how it’s gone, I just want to keep going.”</p>

  <p><strong>Arne Slot’s press conferences are more interesting than most, and this morning’s was no exception. Here are some of the things he said.</strong> </p> 
  <h2>On Florian Wirtz </h2> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Florian can play in more than only one position. He can play off the left, which he did almost all the time in Leverkusen when Xabi Alonso came and introduced his 3-4-3 system, and before he played as a 10 in a 4-3-3.</p> 
   <p>It is more about getting him positions where he is good, rather than be focused on ‘Is he a 10, is he an 11, is he an eight?’. We would like to have him in and around the 18-yard box, centrally or a bit more off the left or bit more off the right for him to create the amount of chances he has already created for us.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <h2>On Liverpool’s return to form</h2> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We always knew we were able to do so. It was helpful to us the other team [Real Madrid] did what I expected because in eight out of 10 games this season we have faced a different playing style than these teams played before, although there is still a lot of work to be done from the players to get a result like that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <h2>On visiting Manchester City</h2> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What we can expect from City is the playing style we always see, but the difficult thing is they are very good at it and have very good players so that makes that challenge big again.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <h2>On Arsenal’s lead at the top</h2> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I only focus on ourselves. We have lost a few games, much more than we usually do, and now we have won two so our focus is on getting consistent, improving and getting players fit and then we will see where that will lead to. But at this moment in time definitely not the only focus we have is the league table.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Save the date: 13 June 2026</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Manchester United will trial a one-off day of tours of the club’s training complex next June which could raise £100k if the 20 time slots are sold out, and will be followed by further days and a more expensive VIP version of the experience.</p> 
  <p>United believe that the only other elite clubs which currently offer a similar tour of facilities are Liverpool and Barcelona. The executive view their initiative as being about creating new and memorable experiences for supporters while increasing revenues to improve financial robustness and maximise funds to invest in Ruben Amorim’s squad, it is understood.</p> 
  <p>On Saturday 13 June the usual Old Trafford tour will be expanded to include a coach to the Carrington facility, which is seven miles from the stadium.</p> 
  <p>While no photographs will be allowed, the whole day will take around four hours and is to take in the training ground dressing rooms, gym, recovery facility and press lounge plus the players lounge and views of the training pitches.</p> 
  <p>Tickets for the whole day including the training ground are £100 each for adults, senior citizens and U16s. The tour of the Old Trafford usually has a 50-person limit so if each of the 20 time slots, which start at 10am and finish at 2.45pm, are sold out the club would earn £100k from the single day.</p> 
  <p>After the trial a number of follow-up days are planned, all of which will be when the players are not at the club, with a VIP option also set to be available that will “offer once-in-a-lifetime features”, according to United sources.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Big interview: Leny Yoro</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A little under six months ago, Leny Yoro was sat on the San Mamés turf, head slumped, anguished by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/may/21/europa-league-final-tottenham-manchester-united-match-report">Europa League final defeat</a> to Tottenham. It extinguished Manchester United’s last flicker of hope of Champions League qualification in a desperate season, the Frenchman’s first in England.</p> 
  <p>United visit the same opponents on Saturday, with optimism finally creeping back at Old Trafford after a run of four games without defeat. Yoro, who turns 20 next week, was one of the few successes of a grinding campaign. Ruben Amorim’s attempt to turn the behemoth around is starting to see results and a win at Tottenham would be a further indication of progress as the head coach begins his second year in charge.</p> 
  <p>“I think everyone knows last season was a really emotional season,” Yoro says. “Not just for the coach, for everyone. It was tough, honestly, it was tough for us to sometimes face the games, face training. So everyone was emotional, to be honest.</p> 
  <p>“I think this year is different. We don’t have the Champions League, but if you can take the good way of this, we have more time to train, we have more freedom in our head. So, the coach is not different than last year, it’s just the result that is different. And every footballer knows when you win on the day, you have a really perfect week after. It’s more about the result in the head. It’s not as emotional as last year.”</p>

  <p><strong>‘A moral crisis in Turkish football’</strong></p> 
  <p>Turkish prosecutors said on Friday they had ordered the detention of 21 people, including 17 referees and the chairman of an unnamed Super Lig club as part of an investigation into alleged betting on football matches.</p> 
  <p>So far 18 of the 21 suspects have been detained, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported.</p> 
  <p>The move comes a week after the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) suspended 149 referees and assistant referees after an investigation found the officials working in the country’s professional leagues were betting on football matches.</p> 
  <p>The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said the detention of the 17 referees was on the grounds of abuse of duty and manipulating match results. A Super Lig club president, a former club owner and a former association president were also ordered detained over alleged match-fixing, it said.</p> 
  <p>One more person faced arrest for spreading misleading information on social media as part of the operation across 12 cities in Turkey, the statement said.</p> 
  <p>In its own separate probe, the TFF’s disciplinary board has imposed bans ranging from eight to 12 months on 149 officials for involvement in betting activity.</p> 
  <p>TFF President Ibrahim Haciosmanoglu has described the situation as a “moral crisis in Turkish football”. Its probe revealed that 371 of 571 active referees in Turkey’s professional leagues had betting accounts, and 152 of them were actively gambling.</p> 
  <p>One referee had bet 18,227 times, and 42 referees had bet on more than 1,000 football matches each. Others were found to have bet only once.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The football news cycle cannot function without some ultra-processed beef. This week it’s been between Wayne Rooney and Virgil van Dijk, who had a face-to-face discussion on Amazon Prime about Rooney’s suggestion Van Dijk had “downed tools” during Liverpool’s recent slump.</p> 
  <p>Here’s what Rooney had to say on the latest edition of his BBC podcast.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Maybe I was a bit unfair with that comment (about downing tools). Maybe I was a bit unfair because I don’t know him that well as a person.</p> 
   <p>From a performance point of view I think I was speaking what I felt and what I was seeing and I felt I was right.</p> 
   <p>Van Dijk will judge himself by them (high standards). When he reflects on his performances this season he’d be the first to say they haven’t been at the standard he’s set.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Wolves’s approach for Rob Edwards has been rejected by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/middlesbrough">Middlesbrough</a>, with the Championship club determined to keep hold of their head coach. Wolves want Edwards to succeed Vítor Pereira but after Gary O’Neil pulled out of advanced talks on Monday, Boro dismissed Wolves’s attempt to lure Edwards on Thursday afternoon.</p> 
  <p>Edwards joined Boro in the summer on a three-year contract until 2028 and the club are adamant they want to keep him after leading them to third in the division. Wolves were hoping to tempt Edwards to swap a promotion charge for a relegation battle, with the Molineux club bottom of the Premier League after claiming just two points from their opening 10 matches.</p> 
  <p>Wolves and particularly their executive chair, Jeff Shi, are longstanding admirers of Edwards, who previously played and coached at the club. Edwards also had a short spell in caretaker charge in 2016, shortly after Fosun, Wolves’ owners, bought the club. Wolves were willing to pay Boro compensation to extract Edwards from his contract.</p>
