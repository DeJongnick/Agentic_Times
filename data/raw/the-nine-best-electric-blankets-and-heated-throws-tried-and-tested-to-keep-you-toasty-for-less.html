<p>Aside from hugging a fluffy hot-water bottle, sipping the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/dec/17/best-whisky">Christmas whisky</a> and ramping up the thermostat, an electric blanket or heated throw is the best way to ward off the winter chill. More than half of a typical household’s fuel bills goes <a href="https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/energy-at-home/heating-your-home/">on heating and hot water</a>, so finding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2024/nov/07/the-8-best-electric-heaters-tried-and-tested-from-traditional-stove-style-units-to-modern-smart-models">alternative ways to keep warm</a> – and heating the person, rather than the whole home – is always a good idea. </p> <p>Many of the best electric blankets and heated throws cost about 2p to 3p an hour to run, so it’s hard to ignore their potential energy- and money-saving benefits.</p> <p>While electric blankets are ideal for using on your mattress, heated throws are better for snuggling on the sofa. They’re practical but also look good, with tactile finishes in materials such as bamboo and pure cotton. The most convenient electric blankets also have timers and auto-shut-off features for peace of mind, and dual control panels to keep both sides of the bed happy.</p> <p>I was tasked with sleeping on the job to find out which was best, testing the most popular electric blankets and heated throws from well-known homeware brands such as Silentnight, Slumberdown, Fogarty and Dreams. Here are my top nine picks.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Best </strong><strong>electric blanket overall:<br></strong>Fogarty Wonderfully Warm</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/fogarty-wonderfully-warm-electric-blanket-1000246450?beddingSize=Double" > Double, £60 at Dunelm </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best budget electric blanket:<br></strong>Slumberdown Sleepy Nights</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Slumberdown-Electric-Blankets-Settings-Quilted/dp/B08556GCYR" > King, £30.59 at Amazon </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best quilted electric blanket: <br></strong>Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanket</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.boots.com/dreamland-pure-comfort-pure-bamboo-electric-underblanket-king-dual-control-200-x-150cm-10350543" > King, £139.99 at Boots </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best </strong><strong>heated throw overall:<br></strong>Beurer heated snuggle blanket <sub> </sub></p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beurer-Temperature-Luxurious-Switch-Off-Machine-Washable/dp/B09XQXSBQ2" > £84.99 at Amazon </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best budget heated throw:<br></strong>Dunelm fleece electric throw</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/fleece-electric-throw-1000244541?colour=Navy" > £32 at Dunelm </a>  <ul> <li><p><strong>Best heated duvet:<br></strong>Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvet</p></li> </ul>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/dreamland-love-mornings-king-heated-duvet-white/p112510722" > King, £199.99 at John Lewis </a>  <p>***</p> <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>I’ve been a lifestyle journalist for magazines and newspapers for more than two decades. Over the years, I’ve thoroughly tested everything from breadmakers and bedding to beehives and biscuits – thankfully not all at the same time.</p> <p>Lately, I’ve specialised in bedding, testing numerous mattresses, pillows, weighted blankets and bed linen, so I know what makes for a decent night’s sleep. Testing electric blankets was the logical next step.</p> <p>Whatever I’m testing, I’ll find practical and useful ways to rigorously measure the value of the product and dig deep to go beyond the marketing jargon. </p> <h2>How I tested</h2>    <p>Without a Cern-grade laboratory at my disposal, I tested 13 of the most popular electric blankets and throws at home. In bed. In my pyjamas. I wanted to assess how luxurious each blanket and throw felt while sleeping or resting, and how durable and well-made they were. After all, you want a blanket to feel comfortable and soft to the touch, which you can only really test by using them in real life.</p> <p>I measured how hot each blanket got and how quickly – I have zero patience when cold, so quick and efficient heating is crucial. Using an infrared thermometer, I tested the temperatures on the highest settings at 10 minutes, 30 minutes and an hour after being switched on. The weight of your duvet and room temperature can affect the temperature of electric blankets, so I kept things fair by using all the electric blankets on the same bed, and all the heated throws on the same sofa, with a consistent room temperature of 18C. </p> <p>No one wants a hot back and frosty feet, so I measured how evenly each blanket heated up by taking temperature readings at three different points after an hour on full power. I also used a plug-in power consumption meter to determine each blanket’s hourly running cost based on the Ofgem price cap of 26.35p a kWh.</p> <p>Although I tested 13 electric blankets and heated throws, I’ve included only the best-performing designs here. Some brands didn’t want the products I had tested returned, so these will be donated to <a href="https://www.hopeforfood.org.uk/">Hope for Food</a> – a Bournemouth-based charity supporting local families in need.</p> <h2>***</h2> <h2>The best electric blankets and heated throws in 2025</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best </em><em>electric blanket overall:</em><br>Fogarty Wonderfully Warm </h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/fogarty-wonderfully-warm-electric-blanket-1000246450?beddingSize=Double" > Double, £60 at Dunelm </a>  <p>This Fogarty blanket has a generous nine heat settings and a one- to nine-hour timer. The soft fleece cover has a thermally bonded fibre wadding filling, giving it a plush feel, and its cushioned surface adds an extra layer of comfort.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Dual controls mean it’s easy to adjust the temperature on each side of the bed independently. You can have both sides on the same setting, one side on and the other off, or both sides set at different temperatures – so that’s one less thing to argue about with your other half.</p> <p>Heating up the king-size I was testing left this is as this is what she tested and all the timings etc took a little longer than anticipated, but my bed felt comfortably warm after an hour. The maximum setting was more than hot enough, so I opted for a cooler setting for an hour before bed. I like that this blanket has a nine-hour timer so that you can set and forget it.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> the sides of the blanket don’t heat up as effectively as the middle.</p> <p><strong>Sizes available:</strong> <a href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/fogarty-wonderfully-warm-electric-blanket-1000246450?beddingSize=Single">single</a>, double, king (currently unavailable) <br><strong>Dimensions</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(double): </strong>L150cm x W120cm<br><strong>Number of heat settings:</strong> nine<br><strong>Timer included:</strong> yes, one to nine hours<br><strong>Running cost </strong><strong>on maximum</strong><strong> (king size):</strong> 2p/hour (0.056kWh) <br><strong>Temperature after an hour:</strong> 27.1C<br><strong>Guarantee:</strong> two years<br><strong>Machine washable:</strong> yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best budget electric blanket:</em> <br>Slumberdown Sleepy Nights </h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.debenhams.com/product/slumberdown-king-size-sleepy-nights-electric-blanket_p-9209456e-8925-4cd9-a599-7702603678db" > King, £32.27 at Debenhams </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Slumberdown-Electric-Blankets-Settings-Quilted/dp/B08556GCYR" > King, £30.59 at Amazon </a>  <p>Generous straps for easy positioning and three adjustable heat settings make this electric blanket a good budget buy. It comes in six sizes, can be machine-washed for easy maintenance and has a two-year guarantee. </p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>This microfibre blanket feels soft against the skin and was simple to set up – bonus points were awarded for the long cord that could easily reach the nearest plug socket.</p> <p>The blanket’s fitted straps are lengthy and elasticated, so I didn’t have to wrestle too much with the corners of my thick Sealy mattress to position it securely, plus it stayed in place nicely.</p> <p>The blanket is powerful, too, heating up to 22.1C in just 10 minutes and 25C in 30 minutes. After an hour on its highest setting, it reached a comfortable 29.5C – more than enough heat for me.</p> <p>When I measured the temperature across the blanket, I found it was hotter in the middle than on the sides. However, I didn’t notice any cold spots when my duvet was on top, trapping in the heat.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> it doesn’t have a timer. The manufacturer suggests leaving this blanket on its lowest setting if you want to keep it on all night.</p> <p><strong>Sizes available:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Slumberdown-Electric-Blankets-Settings-Quilted/dp/B0FTZNW466">small single</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Slumberdown-Electric-Blankets-Settings-Quilted/dp/B08556LV49">single</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Slumberdown-Electric-Blankets-Settings-Quilted/dp/B0FR59DVLX">small double</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Slumberdown-Electric-Blankets-Settings-Quilted/dp/B085574BL2">double</a>, king, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Slumberdown-Electric-Blankets-Settings-Quilted/dp/B08556L43Y">super king</a><br><strong>Dimensions (</strong><strong>king size):</strong> L150 x W142cm<br><strong>Number of heat settings:</strong> three <br><strong>Timer included:</strong> no<br><strong>Running cost </strong><strong>on maximum</strong><strong>:</strong> 3p/hour (0.094kWh)<br><strong>Temperature after an hour:</strong> 29.5C <br><strong>Guarantee:</strong> two years<br><strong>Machine washable:</strong> yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best quilted electric blanket:</em> <br>Dreamland Pure Comfort bamboo underblanket</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.boots.com/dreamland-pure-comfort-pure-bamboo-electric-underblanket-king-dual-control-200-x-150cm-10350543" > King, £139.99 at Boots </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dreamland-Underblanket-Hypoallergenic-Detachable-190x137cm/dp/B0DJC45TRX" > King, £139.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>The king-size version of this underblanket has dual control panels for operating each side independently. There are six heat settings to choose from, and three timer options for one, three or nine hours.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The blanket heated up surprisingly quickly, reaching 22C in its centre after just 10 minutes. Within an hour, temperatures had risen to a snuggly 32C. The middle and end of the blanket get hot, but the top section remains cool to the touch, working well for under your head.</p> <p>It costs a little more than your average electric blanket, but I love the high-end quilted bamboo finish. It has a polyester filling (as with many other electric blankets), but the bamboo fabric feels soft and has the natural benefit of being breathable. The control panels on either side were easy to navigate, too, even when I was sleepy-eyed.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> there are no timer options between three and nine hours.</p> <p><strong>Sizes available:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dreamland-Electric-Underblanket-Hypoallergenic-Detachable/dp/B0DJC246SZ/">single</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dreamland-Underblanket-Hypoallergenic-Detachable-190x137cm/dp/B0DJC32H95">double</a>, king, <a href="https://www.boots.com/dreamland-pure-comfort-pure-bamboo-electric-underblanket-super-king-dual-control-200-x-180cm-10350544">super king</a><br><strong>Dimensions (</strong><strong>king size):</strong> L200 x W150cm<br><strong>Number of heat settings:</strong> six<br><strong>Timer included:</strong> yes, one, three or nine hours<br><strong>Running cost </strong><strong>on maximum</strong><strong>:</strong> 3p/hour (0.129kWh)<br><strong>Temperature after an hour:</strong> 32.2C<br><strong>Guarantee:</strong> three years<strong><br>Machine washable:</strong> yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best </em><em>heated throw overall:</em> <br>Beurer heated snuggle blanket</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.currys.co.uk/products/beurer-nordic-hd-150-heating-blanket-kingsize-10245380.html" > £109 at Currys </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beurer-Temperature-Luxurious-Switch-Off-Machine-Washable/dp/B09XQXSBQ2" > £84.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>Ideal for the sofa, this Beurer blanket has a<em> very</em> soft and sumptuous fleece finish. Its six heat settings are all adjustable via the central control panel. I tried the XXL design – a little oversized on my three-seater sofa, but ideal for sharing comfortably with another person. It also comes in a <a href="https://www.superdrug.com/electricals/electric-blankets/beurer-nordic-faux-fur-heated-throw/p/mp-00014037">smaller 180 x 130cm size</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>The surface of this heated blanket is wonderfully soft to touch, so it was easy to get cosy underneath it while on the sofa watching Strictly. Its structure feels padded enough to disguise the heating elements inside the blanket – not something that can be said of all heated blankets.</p> <p>The blanket heated up fast: it reached temperatures in the low 20s in just 10 minutes, yet it used surprisingly little energy. After an hour, it felt very hot, so I turned it down to setting two, which was a more comfortable heat. I like that you can switch on this blanket and forget about it, thanks to its three-hour automatic switch-off timer.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> it didn’t heat up as evenly as I would have liked. While the middle was warm, sections around the edges didn’t feel it at all. That may create a problem if the person beside you on the sofa is trying to hog the blanket.</p> <p><strong>Sizes available:</strong> small, large<br><strong>Dimensions (large):</strong> L200 x W150cm <br><strong>Number of heat settings:</strong> six<br><strong>Timer included:</strong> three-hour automatic switch-off<br><strong>Running cost </strong><strong>on maximum</strong><strong>:</strong> 2p/hour (0.055kWh)<br><strong>Temperature after an hour:</strong> 32.2C<br><strong>Guarantee:</strong> three years<br><strong>Machine washable:</strong> yes</p> <p><br></p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best budget heated throw:<br></em>Dunelm fleece electric throw</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dunelm.com/product/fleece-electric-throw-1000244541?colour=Navy" > £32 at Dunelm </a>  <p>This smooth fleece blanket comes in three attractive colours – taupe, charcoal and navy – to match most neutral decor schemes. A handheld digital LED controller allows you to flick between its six heat levels.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>For less than £35, this heated throw is good value – and at this price, you could even buy it as a gift for friends or family. The deep navy colour looks great on my sofa, and the blanket feels lovely to touch. While it’s not the fluffiest heated throw I’ve tested, I like that it’s not too thick or heavy. Its size is perfect for one person – and will just about squeeze two people if you’re willing to snuggle up close.</p> <p>The blanket warmed up steadily, and the temperature it reached was comfortable. After 10 minutes on its full heat setting, I measured it at 19.7C in its centre. After an hour on full power, the blanket rose to 40.3C. The heat wasn’t particularly evenly distributed, but that didn’t make much difference to the overall feeling of warmth the blanket provided.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> it doesn’t have a timer, other than a four-hour automatic shut-off, but you’ll need to make sure you switch it off using the controller and at the plug after use.</p> <p><strong>Sizes available:</strong> one<br><strong>Dimensions:</strong> L130 x W160cm <br><strong>Number of heat settings:</strong> six<br><strong>Timer included:</strong> no, but automatic shut-off after four hours<br><strong>Running cost on maximum:</strong> 3p/hour (0.1kWh)<br><strong>Temperature after an hour:</strong> 40.3C<br><strong>Guarantee:</strong> one year<br><strong>Machine washable:</strong> yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best heated duvet:</em> <br>Dreamland Love Mornings heated duvet</h2>      <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/dreamland-love-mornings-king-heated-duvet-white/p112510722" > King, £199.99 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dreamland-Mornings-Electric-Settings-Detachable/dp/B0DJBZ3JK8" > King, £199.99 at Amazon </a>  <p>Dreamland has such a wide range of heated bedding products available that it’s hard to choose which one to go for (I also have my eye on the brand’s <a href="https://www.dreamlanduk.co.uk/collections/heatpads">electric heat pads</a> for specific areas, including your feet, neck, back and hands).</p> <p>Having tried the underblanket (as reviewed above), I was keen to see how this heated duvet compares. Like the underblanket, the duvet is machine washable once the controller has been removed, so it’s easy to keep clean, and it can also be tumble dried.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>I was instantly impressed by the tidy stitching and smooth finish of this heated duvet, which is filled with polyester and has a 100% cotton cover. With an October chill in the air, I set up the duvet on my bed under a breathable cotton <a href="https://www.nectarsleep.co.uk/products/bed-linen-set?variant=31580501966894">Nectar duvet cover</a>.</p> <p>The dual controls lead out the end of the duvet so that you can run them up the side of the bed to plug in. This means your duvet cover can be buttoned up, but you won’t be able to use one with a zip.</p> <p>The duvet is meant to heat up in five minutes, and while it was slightly warm after a few minutes, I did have to go hunting for the warmer spots during my tests. I like that it doesn’t get scorching hot too quickly, though. After 10 minutes on the highest setting, I measured the temperature in the middle at 26.6C, and after an hour it was 36.3C, which felt comfortable but probably isn’t a heat I’d like to sleep with all night (as with all electric bedding, it’s advisable to turn it off at the plug once you’ve used it anyway). </p> <p>Each side can be heated independently, thanks to the dual controls. This worked well for my partner and me, meaning I could blast the heat on my side while he, who prefers cooler climes, didn’t need to have it on at all. The duvet has a timer for up to nine hours, but I’d be inclined to put it on for an hour, just to take off the winter chill, and then turn it off for the duration of the night. </p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> it doesn’t come with a cover included in the pack. Also, while having the heat filter down from the duvet above me felt cosy, on a really cold night, I prefer the heat from an electric blanket underneath.</p> <p><strong>Sizes available:</strong> <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/dreamland-love-mornings-single-heated-duvet-white/p112510723">single</a>, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/dreamland-love-mornings-double-heated-duvet-white/p112510721">double</a>, king size <br><strong>Dimensions (king size):</strong> L225 x W220cm<br><strong>Number of heat settings:</strong> six <br><strong>Timer included:</strong> yes, one, three and nine hours<br><strong>Running cost on maximum:</strong> 5p/hour (0.101kWh a side)<br><strong>Temperature after an hour:</strong> 36.3C<br><strong>Guarantee:</strong> two years <br><strong>Machine washable:</strong> yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best of the rest</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2>Snuggledown Intelligent Warmth</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.johnlewis.com/snuggledown-intelligent-warmth-supreme-comfort-heated-electric-under-blanket/p3271341?size=king-150-x-200cm" > King, £125 at John Lewis </a>  <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/3246476" > King, £125 at Argos </a>  <p><strong>Best for:</strong> couples who share a bed and can’t agree on temperature</p> <p>With a sustainable 180-thread-count pure cotton cover, the surface of this electric blanket is luxuriously soft and breathable, wicking away moisture to keep it feeling fresh.</p> <p>The quilted finish added extra padding and warmth to my mattress before the blanket was even turned on. It has fastening straps for the corners, and the blanket’s base material sat securely without sliding around too much.</p> <p>The two control panels let you tailor each quarter of the mattress to suit your upper and lower body, so it’s a great option for bed sharers or those who like to keep their feet at a different temperature from the top half of their body. On the highest setting, the blanket produced a nicely even temperature that felt even warmer once I added my duvet.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> it may have a pure cotton cover, but its filling is made from polyester.</p> <p><strong>Sizes available:</strong> <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/snuggledown-intelligent-warmth-supreme-comfort-heated-electric-under-blanket/p3271341?size=single-90-x-190cm">single</a>, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/snuggledown-intelligent-warmth-supreme-comfort-heated-electric-under-blanket/p3271341?size=double-135-x-190cm">double</a>, king, <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/snuggledown-intelligent-warmth-supreme-comfort-heated-electric-under-blanket/p3271341?size=super-king-180-x-200cm">super king</a>; <strong>dimensions (</strong><strong>king size):</strong> L200 x W150cm; <strong>number of heat settings:</strong> nine; <strong>timer included:</strong> yes, up to nine hours;<strong> running cost </strong><strong>on maximum:</strong> 2p/hour (0.062kWh); <strong>temperature after an hour:</strong> 27.6C; <strong>guarantee:</strong> two years; <strong>machine washable:</strong> yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2>Dreams Luxury quilted heated blanket</h2>    <a class="element element-link" href="https://www.dreams.co.uk/dreams-luxury-quilted-heated-blanket/p/731-00082-configurable" > King, £40 at Dreams </a>  <p><strong>Best for: </strong>those with allergies</p> <p>There’s much to like about this electric blanket, from its pure cotton, smooth quilted finish to its independent dual control panels. What sets it apart from the rest is that it comes with an anti-allergy coating, which is reassuring because I’m allergic to dust mites.</p> <p>Each control panel has a timer that can be set to switch off after up to nine hours, but it heats up incredibly quickly, so I found that one hour of heat was more than enough at bedtime.

If used for a few hours a day, it could cut down on your heating use and save you money over the year – depending on how much you spend on the blanket in the first place, of course. </p> <p>“There are factors to consider when calculating the costs, as not all electric blankets are the same,” says John-Paul Drake, energy expert at <a href="https://www.loveenergysavings.com/">Love Energy Savings</a>. “Some come with timers, different heat settings and various efficiency ratings. But it could be wise to take advantage of both an electric blanket and a lower thermostat setting as an optimal way to save money on energy bills this winter.”</p> <h2>How much should you spend on an electric blanket?</h2> <p>Prices for an electric blanket range from about £30 to £140, depending on the size. You can expect to pay anything from £20 to £150 for a heated throw.</p> <h2>Are electric blankets safe?</h2> <p>Electric blankets should be used with caution, and should never be used by young babies and toddlers. Most manufacturers do not recommend that young children use electric blankets unless they’re supervised by an adult and have a clear understanding of how to use them safely. Always check the manufacturer’s guidelines for safe use. Brands don’t always seem to make it obvious on the box, but the latest electric blankets should have passed electrical safety checks. Safety marks such as “<a href="https://www.intertek.com/product-certification-marks/beab/">BEAB approved</a>” (British Electrotechnical Approvals Board) or “<a href="https://www.dekra.nl/en/wat-is-kema-keur/">KEMA-KEUR</a> safety tested” should offer peace of mind. For more advice on electric blanket safety, <a href="https://www.london-fire.gov.uk/safety/the-home/electrical-items/electric-blankets">read this advice from London fire brigade</a>.</p> <p>Also look out for safety features such as an automatic switch-off timer that you can set to stay on for a number of hours before it turns off, or overheat protection that switches off the device if it senses it is getting too hot.</p> <p>An electric blanket should fit securely on your mattress, just underneath your pillow to stop your head from overheating. It shouldn’t be folded or creased, as this can damage the wiring inside. The safest place to leave your blanket when it’s not needed is flat on your bed.</p> <h2>Is my electric blanket compatible with my mattress?</h2> <p>Electric blankets are compatible with most mattresses, but they can potentially damage some mattresses made from memory foam or latex. “Memory foam mattresses are heat-sensitive, and there has been a concern in the past that they could soften too much when heated by an electric blanket, damaging the foam’s structure and reducing support,” says Chelsea Brown, lead product adviser at <a href="https://operabeds.com/">Opera Beds</a>.</p> <p>“Most modern electric blankets shouldn’t reach high enough temperatures to face this issue, but you should use them with caution. Memory foam is designed to mould to your body, so directly placing an electric blanket on top can also prevent the mattress from fitting your body snugly. Consider using a mattress topper under the electric blanket or keeping it on a low heat to prevent damage to your mattress.”</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Emily Peck is a </em><em>lifestyle journalist who’s been writing and editing for more than two </em><em>decades.
