<h2>The Great British Bake Off</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Jasmine, Aaron and Tom have made it to the final week. And while Bake Off might not have the same pull on the nation it once had, there’s still plenty of joy (and many nail-biting moments) to be had as they tackle British iced buns, French delights and, intriguingly, the challenge of pulling off the largest cake in the show’s history. Then it’s time for the tea party before the winner is announced. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Ambulance</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>“Is this the leg you landed on? Did you feel it crunch?” Two questions nobody wants to have to answer are put to poor Joey, who has been knocked off his bike, in this week’s episode. Elsewhere, a five-year-old is bumped by a car outside school. Heroic work ensues once more. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>TikTok: Murder Gone Viral</h2> <p><strong>9pm, ITV1</strong><strong><br></strong>The documentary series about murder victims whose deaths had something to do with the titular social media platform focuses on the death of Tristyn Bailey in this episode. The 13-year-old girl from Florida became the subject of much online speculation after her death – and one of her classmates was eventually jailed.<em> Alexi Duggins</em></p> <h2>Murder Before Evensong</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong><strong><br></strong>Daniel is having a rough old time of it. His friendship with Neil is on shaky ground; mum Audrey shares some painful home truths with him (“You broke your dad’s heart”); and he’s been summoned to a tribunal to defend himself before the bishop. On the plus side, his plans for the church lavatory may be waved through after all … <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Worlds Apart</h2> <p><strong>9.15pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>It’s the end of the road for the first series of the age gap-bridging, Japan-traversing reality travel show – but surely not for the friends we’ve made along the way? In a final challenge at the Buddha on the Hill, three remaining old-young teams compete for that £50,000 prize. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2>In My Own Words: Val McDermid</h2>    <p><strong>10.40pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>“I don’t know how to write a book that doesn’t have a dead body in it,” says the writer Val McDermid. Before she became the queen of crime fiction, McDermid was a journalist who reported on Lockerbie and Hillsborough. In this absorbing programme, she recounts a traumatic period in her childhood and her beginnings as a fiction writer – and shows off her beautiful home library. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Kenny Dalglish (Asif Kapadia, 2025), </strong><strong>Prime Video<br></strong>Asif Kapadia’s latest documentary profile ties in with his love of Liverpool FC, personified by its greatest ever footballer. In a self-deprecating, witty voiceover, Kenny Dalglish relates his rise to success as a striker with Celtic, then Liverpool, in the 1970s. For the uninitiated or nostalgic, there’s plenty of footage of Kenny in his pomp, but it’s the double blow of the Heysel and Hillsborough disasters that gives the film real weight. The trauma of those events still casts a shadow over him, giving his story a universality that transcends the beautiful game. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Champions League </strong><strong>football: Slavia Prague v Arsenal, </strong><strong>5pm, TNT Sports 1 </strong>Spurs v Copenhagen is at 7.45pm.</p> <p><strong>Champions League </strong><strong>football: Liverpool v Real Madrid, </strong><strong>6.30pm, Prime Video </strong>From Anfield.</p>
