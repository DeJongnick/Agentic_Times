<p>Clean energy contributed a record 10% of China’s gross domestic product in 2024, an analysis has found.</p> <p>With sales and investments worth 13.6tn yuan (£1.5tn; $1.9tn), the sector has now overtaken real estate sales in value.</p> <p>Solar power, electric vehicles (EVs) and batteries have all played a major role in the dramatic growth of Chinese clean technology.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/03aVD/1/" data-alt="China’s clean power sector"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/03aVD/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>The Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (Crea), which conducted the analysis based on official figures, industry data and analyst reports, said it had used a broad definition of “clean-energy” sectors, including renewables, nuclear power, electricity grids, energy storage, EVs and railways.</p> <p>EVs and vehicle batteries were the largest contributors to China’s clean-energy economy last year, making up an estimated 39% of the overall value.</p> <p>Simon Evans of Carbon Brief, said: “China has been investing heavily in these sectors for a while now. Perhaps the scale and the pace of things has taken people by surprise, but China’s been developing its electric vehicle industry for a long time now.</p> <p>“It’s a deliberate, strategic move for various reasons, including the fact that China is a major oil importer and so they want to improve their energy security and their balance of payments by not having to import oil to run their cars.”</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/aPELg/2/" data-alt="Chinese investments in new solar power capacity more than tripled between 2022 and 2024"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/aPELg/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Whether the clean-energy sector continues to boom will depend on the new targets and policies in China’s next five-year plan for economic and social development, which comes into force in 2026.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/pkhzf/2/" data-alt="Battery EVs and plug-in hybrids"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/pkhzf/2/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Evans said that, despite world events, China is likely to continue its growth in clean energy: “After the US election result lots of people were wondering what the implications of that would be for the global climate process. China already at Cop29 [last year’s UN climate conference] made it very clear that it was planning to continue doing what it’s doing.</p> <p>“They’re doing this not out of altruistic reasons but just because they think it makes sense financially and they’ve invested a huge amount in building up these industries. They’re not going to turn back just because Trump says he doesn’t believe in climate change.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 20 February 2025 to make clear that the analysis was conducted by Crea for Carbon Brief, not by Carbon Brief itself.</p>
