<h1>There are no secrets on the internet. Just ask the women who entrusted their data to Tea</h1>

<p>Help me out with a question I’ve been pondering, will you? I’m trying to figure out if there is a single adult on Earth whose personal information isn’t for sale somewhere on the darker corners of the internet. Data breaches are a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23031858/data-breach-data-loss-personal-consequences">regular occurrence now</a>. We give companies our information; they promise to keep it safe and then they sell it to dodgy third parties or lose it in hacking attacks. There is a website called <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned.com</a> where you can check if your email addresses have been part of a&nbsp;data breach. My personal email is&nbsp;in 15&nbsp;of&nbsp;them.</p> <p>The latest data breach to hit the headlines is particularly nasty. A popular women-only dating-safety app called Tea lets users compare notes about men to see if they are dating the same person or if anyone has red flags to share. It’s a bit like an app version of the popular “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/01/are-we-dating-the-same-guy-women-turn-to-facebook-to-uncover-cheating-and-violence">Are we dating the same guy?</a>” Facebook groups. Last Friday, the company behind Tea confirmed it <a href="https://www.404media.co/women-dating-safety-app-tea-breached-users-ids-posted-to-4chan/">had been breached</a>. Women have to submit a selfie (to “prove” their gender) in order to use the app; an estimated 72,000 images, including 13,000 verification photos and photos of government IDs, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/tea-app-hacked-13000-photos-leaked-4chan-call-action-rcna221139">have been leaked online</a>. More than 1m private messages <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tea-app-leak-worsens-with-second-database-exposing-user-chats/">have also been leaked</a>.</p> <p>This isn’t just a run-of-the-mill data breach – it’s revenge. It seems users of 4chan, a message board popular with rightwing and misogynistic trolls, were upset by the app and called for <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/tea-app-hacked-13000-photos-leaked-4chan-call-action-rcna221139">a “hack and leak” campaign</a>. 404 Media reported that the database of stolen images has now been posted on 4chan and X. Someone has <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/tea-app-leak-worsens-with-second-database-exposing-user-chats/">reportedly even created a site</a> where men can rate women’s selfies exposed in the leaked data.</p> <p>There are obviously numerous ethical issues with apps such as Tea, or the Facebook groups that allow people to share unverified and potentially defamatory information about men. But there is a reason these digital whisper networks exist: social media companies and dating sites do <a href="https://time.com/6256395/dating-app-safety-tips/">very little to</a> protect women. According <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the-only-one#methodology">to one survey</a>, 31% of women reported being sexually assaulted or raped by someone they had met through an online dating site. Tea was supposed to be a rare safe space – but now I&nbsp;suspect a lawsuit is brewing.</p> <p>• Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
