<p>Regarding Adrian Birch’s letter (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/21/britain-should-adopt-the-passivhaus-standard-to-cut-energy-costs-in-new-homes">Britain should adopt the Passivhaus standard to cut energy costs in new homes, 21 May</a>), we have been attempting to build a Passivhaus standard home. However, we cannot justify building to that standard because the cost has risen over the past two years to £3,800 per sq metre for a 165-sq-metre timber-frame build.</p> <p>Obviously, if the nation’s housebuilding companies did try to build to Passivhaus standard, the costs would be less due to economies of scale but, given their constant complaining that they cannot afford to do so, and our government’s refusal to stipulate higher environmental standards, it seems highly unlikely that they will try to future-proof their often poorly built and designed homes. As for our desperately needed social homes, if building costs remain as high, how many will be able to be built to a Passivhaus standard?</p> <p>After extensive revisions to our plans, we are getting closer to building an energy-efficient home that incorporates many of the Passivhaus features, but at a lower cost and, potentially, a lower energy performance certificate score. Passivhaus standard should be the future for British housebuilding, but not at current price levels.<br><strong>Alan and Jane Hill</strong><br><em>Perth </em></p> <p><em>• </em>Over 15 years ago as one of the trustees overseeing the renovation of the Mildmay Community Centre&nbsp;in north London, we went for the Passivhaus standard of serious insulation, solar panels and&nbsp;ground-source heating. Despite considerable opposition at the time, the building was the first&nbsp;retrofitted Passivhaus standard&nbsp;community centre in England. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;warm, beautiful and&nbsp;efficient.</p> <p>Passivhaus is a long established standard in Germany, and could and should be adopted in the UK for new builds. But as anyone can see if they visit our community centre, it is also perfect and appropriate for&nbsp;retrofitting old buildings.<br><strong>Jenny Littlewood</strong><br><em>London</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
