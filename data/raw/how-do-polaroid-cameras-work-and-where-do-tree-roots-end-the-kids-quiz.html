    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - Inside a Polaroid camera, there’s a pack of film that has three layers. When you press the button to take a picture, light enters through the lens and a chemical reaction happens on the film. Then the photo is pushed out through rollers, which squish the chemicals to spread them evenly. They react with the light and your picture slowly appears., 2:D - Tree roots can grow much wider than the tree’s crown, helping it find water, stay strong and hold tight to the ground, even in a storm., 3:B - Butterfly wings are made of thin layers of a protein called chitin – like insect shells! Thousands of colourful scales, like tiny tiles, create the beautiful patterns., 4:A - The rollercoaster is pulled up a hill using a chain and motor, giving it potential energy, like winding up a toy. Then gravity takes over. As it rushes down, the potential energy turns into kinetic energy, which keeps it going up and down until it slows at the end. Some new ones use magnetic launch systems., 5:A - If everything was see-through, the light-sensing parts in your eyes wouldn’t work, so you wouldn’t be able to see anything!</p>
