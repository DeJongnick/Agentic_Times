<p>Wales is famed as the land of song, the music of the valleys and mountains providing a source of pride, joy and a sense of belonging.</p> <p>But a pioneering project led by <a href="https://wno.org.uk/">Welsh National Opera</a> has suggested music can also help people suffering with persistent pain.</p> <p>Participants in a pain management programme run by WNO with NHS Wales reported that singing and taking part in breathing exercises in sessions run by vocal experts eased their symptoms.</p> <p>An independent report on the Wellness with WNO persistent pain pilot programme has reported that two-thirds of people who took part in a study of the programme’s effectiveness reported decreases in pain and a similar number said their mental health had improved.</p> <p>Those who had taken part had no illusions that they had been cured of chronic illnesses but said the programme had helped them manage their pain by giving them techniques to deal with it.</p> <p>June Evans, 67, from Llandrindod Wells in mid Wales, who has a number of serious illnesses including a heart condition, said the programme, funded by the Welsh government, had changed her life.</p>    <p>“Before I took part I felt my life was over. I was anxious and frightened. I only went out of the house for hospital appointments. I was hopeless. What was the point in carrying on? I couldn’t do anything, go anywhere, enjoy anything.”</p> <p>She had not known what to expect from the course, which takes place, via Zoom. “I’d not done any singing before; I’m not the sort who’s been in choirs so I was a bit nervous about it.”</p> <p>But she enjoyed the singing, which ranged from a little light opera to folk songs and anthems. Home on the Range and Don’t Worry Be Happy were among her favourites. “Your microphone is muted so you can sing your heart out.</p> <p>“You learn techniques on how to cope with the pain. I’ve sort of tamed the pain, whereas it used to control me. It’s made me a different person. I now go out to the park. I’m now happy going outside. It’s brought a joy back into my life. And I’m getting closer to being the person I was before all my illnesses hit me.”</p> <p>Jenny Pearson, a professional singer and one of the programme’s vocal leaders, said she was delighted but not wholly surprised by the results.</p> <p>“Singers have always known singing makes us feel good. Singing in a nice safe environment can have an impact on someone’s life.”</p>    <p>Sessions begin with head and neck exercises to stretch out the neck and head, then move on to breathing techniques, the aim to target the parasympathetic nervous system. There is a break to listen to music – often the Humming Chorus from Puccini’s Madama Butterfly – and then the singing begins in earnest. So far almost 50 people have taken part.</p> <p><a href="https://milestonetweed.co.uk/about/">Milestone Tweed</a>, which carried out the research, said there were “substantial improvements in pain management, mental and emotional health, and overall quality of life”.</p> <p>It said: “Surprisingly, some participants reported that this was the first intervention that had given them significant pain relief. While participants did not expect their chronic conditions to be cured, the sessions helped them to manage pain and improve daily functionality.”</p> <p>Owen Hughes, national clinical lead for persistent pain, NHS Wales, said: “Several participants have said that they’ve gone on to join choirs and some are looking to return to work. The power of music and song has really made a difference to their lives.”</p>
