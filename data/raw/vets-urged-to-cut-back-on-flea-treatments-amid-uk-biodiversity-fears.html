<p>Vets need to stop “profiteering” by giving dogs and cats preventive flea treatments that are wiping out insects and songbirds, according to a well-known scientist.</p> <p>The standard practice in the UK at present is to advise that customers take a preventative approach, treating their pets every couple of months even if they don’t have fleas.</p> <p>But flea treatments include powerful insecticides that have been found to leach off pet fur – and the hands of their owners – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/01/vets-pesticide-flea-treatments-river-pollution-pet-owners-toxic-insecticides-hands">into waterways</a>. A<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jan/27/pet-fur-found-in-songbird-nests-contains-high-levels-of-pesticides-study-finds"> recent study</a> also found that songbirds are inadvertently killing their young by making nests out of contaminated pet fur.</p> <p>There is growing concern about the impact these treatments are having on biodiversity. Imidacloprid and fipronil, for example, are powerful insecticides: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31974186/">one monthly flea treatment</a> for a large dog contains enough imidacloprid to kill 25 million bees.</p> <p>Dave Goulson, professor of biology at the University of Sussex, where the songbird study was carried out, said: “Given the scale of environmental contamination it is causing, prophylactic use of flea treatments on family pets cannot continue.</p> <p>“Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] and the veterinary profession need to take responsibility for development of a sustainable alternative, but an obvious first step is to stop treating animals for fleas if they don’t have fleas.</p> <p>“After all, we don’t treat our children against nits if they don’t have them. Promoting prophylactic, monthly treatment is simply profiteering.”</p> <p>The UK government is drawing up plans for a total ban on imidacloprid in agriculture but not for pet treatments.</p> <p>Fleas can also be prevented by using a flea comb and washing pet bedding regularly.</p> <p>“I’ve felt really pushed, and a bit patronised, by our vets for not subscribing to their monthly programme to receive monthly flea and worm treatment (and vaccines),” said Helen Hedges, a nurse who has two dogs.</p> <p>“I’ve moved to an independent vet who are better and more open to discussing alternative options. Why do I need to apply chemicals to them if they don’t actually have fleas?! I never did this to my childen – I only treated them for nits when they had nits, not monthly to prevent them.</p> <p>“Even this has its downfalls though as vets can’t prescribe flea treatment if they haven’t seen a dog for six months, so the only time my dogs had fleas in the last two years cost nearly £200 for the consultation and treatment for both dogs.”</p> <p>The British Veterinary Association (BVA) is calling for more research into the impact of the pesticides and said vets should use them responsibly.</p> <p>The BVA president, Elizabeth Mullineaux, said: “Parasiticides play an important role in preventing and treating parasites in animals, which if left unaddressed can lead to bigger health and welfare issues in both animals and people.</p> <p>“Rather than blanket use, we strongly encourage vets and owners to take a risk-based approach to prescribing or recommending these medicines, reflecting an animal’s exposure to parasites.</p> <p>“Owners should speak with their vet about their animal’s needs and how to responsibly use and dispose of these medicines to minimise environmental contamination.”</p>
