<p>You are 2.5 times more likely to have your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/cycling">bike</a> stolen than your car. And as tools such as cordless angle grinders – which can quickly slice through metal – become easily available, a sturdy steel shackle or chain may no longer be enough.</p> <p>Fortunately, lock design has come a long way in the last few years. Brands including Abus, Litelok, Kryptonite and Hiplok have introduced stronger materials, smarter mounting systems, and locks designed specifically for the fatter frames of e-bikes. You can now choose from ultra-tough U-locks, wearable chain locks, and compact folding models with real-world resistance to power tools. A good bike lock won’t make your bike theft-proof, but it can buy you time and give a thief enough reason to walk away.</p> <p>We tested 15 of the best bike locks widely available in the US across all different categories and price points. Whether you need <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/13/coronavirus-cycling-bikes-american-boom">maximum protection for a high-theft area</a> or just a dependable lock for errands around town, we’ve narrowed down the best bicycle locks worth considering in 2025.</p>    <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>I’ve been testing bikes and cycling gear professionally for more than a decade, with a focus on long-term durability and real-world performance. My reviews have appeared in Outside, Bicycling and more than a dozen other cycling publications. I’ve broken, bent and burned through plenty of bike locks – and several dozen angle grinder discs – to separate marketing hype from real-world security.</p> <h2>How I tested</h2> <p>I tested 15 locks from major brands, including Abus, Kryptonite, Litelok, Hiplok, OnGuard and Seatylock. They were chosen based on security ratings, brand reputation, US availability and how well they represented key use cases.</p> <p>To test theft resistance, I cut them using a cordless angle grinder – the preferred device of modern bike thieves to slice through locks and even bike racks. The time to breach listed for each lock is based on this method. While no lock is grinder-proof, some dramatically slow down the theft process by chewing up grinder discs. The best locks required multiple cuts, drained batteries, and destroyed cutting discs enough to deter determined thieves.</p> <p>That said, grinder resistance is only one part of the equation. I used each lock for a minimum of two weeks, including short stops, daily commutes and overnight lockups when appropriate for the type of lock. I tested how easy each lock was to carry, deploy and use with different bike frames and bike racks. I noted whether mounts were included, how well they worked, and how much the locks rattled while riding.</p> <p><em>All prices current at the time of publication.</em></p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Best bike lock overall:</strong><br>Litelok X1<br><a href="https://us.litelok.com/products/litelok-x1"><sub>$189.99 at Litelok</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best budget bike lock:<br></strong>Abus Ivera Chain 7210<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ABUS-Ivera-7210-Bicycle-Chain/dp/B081DVMQFM/"><sub>$82.70 at Amazon</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best chain bike lock:<br></strong>Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain<br><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kryptonite-New-York-Fahgettaboudit-Chain-1415-and-New-York-Disc-Bicycle-Locks-14-mm-X-60-In/151035378"><sub>$124.96 at Walmart</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best folding bike lock:<br></strong>Foldylock Forever<br><a href="https://seatylock.com/products/foldylock-forever"><sub>$135 at Seatylock</sub></a></p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Best overall bike lock:<br>Litelok X1</h2> <p><a href="https://us.litelok.com/products/litelok-x1"><sub>$189.99 at Litelok</sub></a></p>    <p>The Litelok X1 is the best overall bike lock we tested. It balances real-world grinder resistance with everyday usability and it is relatively low-weight. This makes it ideal for e-bike riders, daily commuters and anyone locking up in theft-prone areas.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong></p> <p>Most high-security locks fall into two camps: burdensome chains that can weigh up to 15lb, or compact U-locks that can be difficult to use with larger frames or awkward racks. The X1 sidesteps that trade-off with a flexible composite armor called Barronium over a hardened steel core. This material actively resists cutting wheels so effectively that in testing, we had to swap angle grinder discs six times, as well as swap batteries. Both are key factors that can easily stop a thief in their tracks.</p> <p>At just 3.7lb (1.7kg), the X1 is surprisingly portable for a Diamond-rated lock. It’s slightly larger than a standard U-lock, with enough internal space to fit around oversized tubes or street signs. It also has reflective striping for night-time visibility and a covered keyway to keep out grime and water.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong></p> <p>It doesn’t include a frame mount. You’ll need to purchase one separately, or carry it in a bag. And while not as burly as the heavier Litelok X3 or Hiplok D1000, the X1 strikes a smarter balance for most riders.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 3.7lb (1.7kg)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Material:</strong> Barronium composite over hardened steel core</p></li> <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> Sold Secure Diamond, ART 4-star</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mount:</strong> None included; compatible with Twist &amp; Go or Tactical mounts (sold separately)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Time to breach: </strong>Eight minutes</p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Best budget bike lock:<br>Abus Ivera Chain 7210</h2> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ABUS-Ivera-7210-Bicycle-Chain/dp/B081DVMQFM/"><sub>$82.70 at Amazon</sub></a></p>    <p>The Abus Ivera 7210 is a solid pick for budget-conscious riders who still want real protection for daily errands or commutes. While it doesn’t offer the grinder resistance or top-tier certifications of more expensive locks, it performs well enough for short stops and day-to-day use in lower-risk areas.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong></p> <p>This chain uses 7mm hardened steel links that resist common hand tools such as bolt cutters and hacksaws. The square profile and tight spacing between links make it difficult to get leverage or cutting tools in position. It’s long enough to wrap through your frame and front wheel, and the soft textile sleeve prevents it from scratching paint when you loop it around the bike.</p> <p>At just under 3lb (1.3kg), it’s one of the lightest chains we tested, and it coils easily into a bag. It also holds up well in poor weather: the fabric sleeve dries quickly and shields the links from corrosion, which can be a problem with exposed chains.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong></p> <p>It’s not rated by Sold Secure or ART. We wouldn’t trust it for overnight lockups in city centers, but for everyday errands and quick stops, it’s hard to beat at this price.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 2.8lb (1.3kg)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Material:</strong> 7mm hardened steel with woven textile sleeve</p></li> <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> No third-party certification</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mount:</strong> None included</p></li> <li><p><strong>Length:</strong> 33.5in (85cm)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Time to breach: </strong>Less than 20 seconds</p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Best chain bike lock:<br>Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain</h2> <p><a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kryptonite-New-York-Fahgettaboudit-Chain-1415-and-New-York-Disc-Bicycle-Locks-14-mm-X-60-In/151035378"><sub>$124.96 at Walmart</sub></a></p>    <p>If maximum security is your top priority and weight is a distant concern, the Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboudit Chain is as tough as they come. This beast of a chain pairs 14mm hardened manganese steel links with a matching New York Disc Lock, creating a set-up that’s earned one of the highest Sold Secure ratings. The 5ft chain (1.5-meter) chain is long enough to secure both your frame <em>and</em> wheel, and the nylon sleeve keeps the links from scratching paint.</p> <p>In our testing, the Fahgettaboudit resisted everything short of power tools. Bolt cutters didn’t make a dent, and its sheer bulk alone acts as a visual deterrent – thieves know this isn’t an easy target. At a portly 15lb (6.8kg), this is not a lock you’ll want to carry on a long ride. But for locking up in high-theft urban areas, it’s one of the most trusted options available.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong></p> <p>It delivers the highest level of security short of a bank vault, and serious peace of mind in cities where bike theft is common.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong></p> <p>The weight and size make it impractical for most cyclists to carry. This lock is best used as a primary lock at a fixed location, supplemented with a lighter, more compact lock for errands.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 15.25lb (6.9kg)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Material:</strong> 14mm hardened steel links with a textile sleeve</p></li> <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> Sold Secure Gold for Bikes and Motorcycles</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mount:</strong> None included</p></li> <li><p><strong>Length:</strong> 5ft (1.5 meters)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Time to breach:</strong> Five minutes</p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Best folding lock:<br>Foldylock Forever</h2> <p><a href="https://seatylock.com/products/foldylock-forever"><sub>$135 at Seatylock</sub></a></p>    <p>Commuters need a lock that’s easy to carry, fast to deploy, and secure enough to leave outside the office or coffee shop. The Foldylock Forever offers better security than most folding bike locks, making it an ideal choice for city riders who lock and unlock their bikes multiple times a day.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong></p> <p>Unlike most folding locks, the Foldylock Forever is both Sold Secure Gold and ART 3-star certified. It uses 6.5mm hardened steel plates connected by convex rivets designed to make drill bits slip when attempting to breach the lock. The lock opens and closes smoothly, with a wide enough reach to accommodate typical bike racks and frame shapes.</p> <p>The included mount bolts to water bottle bosses or attaches with adjustable straps. It’s one of the quietest systems we tested – no rattles or clunks when riding over potholes. At just under 4lb (1.8kg), it’s lighter than most chain locks and easier to stash than a long U-lock. For commuters prioritizing convenience without sacrificing security, it hits the sweet spot.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong></p> <p>The folding design limits what you can lock to: wide signposts or thick bike racks may be a challenge. It’s also more expensive than some comparably rated U-locks.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 3.9lb (1.8kg)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Material:</strong> 6.5mm hardened steel folding plates</p></li> <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> Sold Secure Gold, ART 3-star</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mount:</strong> Rattle-free frame bracket included</p></li> <li><p><strong>Time to breach:</strong> Three minutes</p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>The best of the rest</h2> <h2>Best chain lock for multiple bikes:<br>OnGuard Mastiff Chain Lock 8021</h2> <p><a href="https://www.onguardlock.com/product/mastiff-key/"><sub>$119.95 at OnGuard Lock</sub></a></p>    <p>If you’re securing multiple bikes, the OnGuard Mastiff Chain Lock is a practical choice. Its generous 6ft (1.8-meter) chain makes it possible to lasso two or more bikes to a sturdy anchor, reducing the number of locks you need. The hardened 10mm steel links and beefy lock head balance security with cost, and a protective sleeve prevents frame damage.</p> <p>While it isn’t quite as impervious as the Kryptonite Fahgettaboudit, in testing, the Mastiff proved to be a solid deterrent to most hand tools, and an effective option in low- to mid-risk areas. It’s heavy at 9.8lb (4.4kg), but for securing multiple bikes, one long chain is still lighter and much easier to manage than multiple shorter, ultra-secure chains.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong></p> <p>A combination of length, strength and value makes the Mastiff a smart choice for families or households with more than one bike. It’s ideal for long-term use at bike racks, garages or apartments.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong></p> <p>It’s not Sold Secure or ART certified, though its build quality is comparable to many Gold-rated options.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 9.8lb (4.4kg)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Material:</strong> 10 mm titanium-hardened hex chain</p></li> <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> Manufacturer-rated; no Sold Secure/ART certification</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mount:</strong> None; best stored at lock-up site</p></li> <li><p><strong>Length:</strong> 6ft (1.8 meters)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Time to breach:</strong> Four minutes</p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Best lock for e-bikes:<br>Abus Granit Super Extreme 2500</h2> <p><a href="https://www.rei.com/product/254507/abus-granit-super-extreme-2500-u-lock"><sub>$224.99 at REI</sub></a></p>    <p>Heavier-duty frames require stronger, longer locks. The Abus Granit Super Extreme 2500 is one of the few U-locks specifically designed to withstand angle grinders and secure large-diameter tubing. It’s expensive and heavy, but for e-bike riders, it may be the best defense available.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong></p> <p>This lock combines a burly 27mm shackle with a carbide-reinforced core, making it extremely resistant to cutting wheels. In real-world tests, angle grinders take noticeably longer to breach it compared with standard U-locks, buying you minutes, rather than seconds. The lock body houses an Abus XPlus cylinder, which is designed to resist drilling and picking.</p> <p>Generous internal clearance makes the Granit easier to secure through large e-bike frames or wheels. Abus’s keyed-alike system allows you to match it with other locks or batteries using the same key. This makes it particularly appealing for e-bike commuters or delivery riders managing multiple lockups a day.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong></p> <p>It weighs nearly 5lb (2.2kg), and it costs more than double most of our picks.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.95lb (2.2kg)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Material:</strong> Carbide-reinforced hardened steel shackle (27mm)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> Sold Secure Diamond, ART 4-star</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mount:</strong> Included, mounts to pannier racks</p></li> <li><p><strong>Time to breach: </strong>Eight minutes</p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Best wearable bike lock:<br>Hiplok Gold</h2> <p><a href="https://www.rei.com/product/116718/hiplok-gold-maximum-security-wearable-chain-lock"><sub>$130 at REI</sub></a></p>    <p>The Hiplok Gold wearable chain lock wraps around your waist like a belt, providing real protection without rattling in a bag or taking up rack space.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong></p> <p>The adjustable, belt-like fit keeps the weight evenly distributed around your waist, which makes it especially appealing for bike messengers or city riders who don’t want to carry a heavy chain in their bag. It’s long enough to loop through your frame and rear wheel, and it uses a 10mm hardened steel chain and a 12mm shackle to deliver Sold Secure Gold-rated protection.</p> <p>The outer sleeve is removable and washable, and the lock mechanism is reassuringly solid. Hiplok includes coded key tags and a 10-year warranty, which suggests long-term reliability. If you’re on and off your bike frequently, it’s one of the most practical chain locks on the market.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong></p> <p>Wearing it is more comfortable than carrying it, but at 5.3lb (2.4kg) it can feel bulky off the bike.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 5.3lb (2.4 kg)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Material:</strong> 10mm hardened steel chain, 12mm shackle</p></li> <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> Sold Secure Gold</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mount:</strong> Wearable (waist-mounted belt-style)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Time to breach: </strong>Two minutes</p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Best lightweight lock:<br>Hiplok Switch</h2> <p><a href="https://hiplok.com/product/hiplok-switch/"><sub>$89.99 at Hiplok</sub></a></p>    <p>For shorts rides and coffee stops, we always reached for the Hiplok Switch. It’s compact, easy to carry and offers just enough security to deter opportunistic theft. It also makes a great backup when used alongside a more robust primary lock.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong></p> <p>The lock folds into a small, lightweight unit and mounts securely to your frame using a clever bracket system that doubles as a tool holster or bottle cage. Five-millimeter hardened steel folding bars extend to 33.5in (85cm) of locking length. That’s enough to secure your frame and wheel to a rack in most cases.</p> <p>At just over 2lb (1.05kg), it’s barely noticeable on the bike. While it’s only Sold Secure Bronze rated, it’s far more robust than a cable lock and won’t attract as much attention as heavier models. We found it perfect for daytime errands or locking up in view.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong></p> <p>It’s not meant for high-crime areas or overnight locking. Think of it as insurance against casual theft, not determined attacks.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 2.3lb (1.04kg)</p></li> <li><p><strong>Material:</strong> 5mm hardened steel bars</p></li> <li><p><strong>Security:</strong> Sold Secure Bronze</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mount:</strong> Frame bracket included</p></li> <li><p><strong>Time to breach: </strong>Under one minute</p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Best ultralight lock:<br>Abus Combiflex Travelguard</h2> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ABUS-Combiflex-TravelGuard-Cable-Lock/dp/B0BF5DNG3Q?th=1"><sub>$33.39 at Amazon</sub></a></p>    <p>If you’re looking for a lock you can take everywhere without even thinking about it, the Abus Combiflex Travelguard fits the bill. At just 2.1oz (60g) and small enough to disappear into the pocket of your jeans or jersey pocket, it’s essentially an oversized zip-tie with a combination lock, which also means no key to carry. It’s available in 17.7in (45cm) and 29.5in (75cm) lengths, giving you flexibility depending on how you plan to use it.</p> <p>In testing, it was ideal for low-risk stops such as grabbing a coffee or taking a quick restroom break. It’s not built to resist heavy-duty tools and is best seen as protection against quick, snatch-and-grab thefts: the kind where someone might walk off with an unlocked bike but won’t bother trying to cut even a basic cable lock. It addresses a common paradox in cycling: some of the most expensive bikes on the road get the least protection when parked, making them tempting targets even during short stops.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong></p> <p>You don’t notice it when it’s stashed in your pocket or bag, yet it’s there when you need a quick layer of security. It’s also handy for helmets, strollers and even traveling. For riders who avoid carrying a full-size lock but still want something for short stops, it strikes a useful balance of convenience and deterrence.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong></p> <p>It offers minimal protection against more determined thieves.

Look for hardened steel or reinforced composite materials, a compact locking profile, and locking mechanisms that resist picking, drilling or twisting. But that’s just part of the story.</p> <p>A lock is only effective if you use it, which means size, weight and convenience matter. The best bicycle lock for a casual rider running errands isn’t the same as what a courier or e-bike commuter needs. Match the lock’s security level to your routine.</p> <p><strong>Which type of lock should I buy?</strong></p> <p>Each lock type comes with trade-offs:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>U-locks</strong> offer the best strength-to-weight ratio. They’re hard to cut, easy to stow, and great for urban lockups.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Chain locks</strong> allow you to lock your bike to more anchors, such as trees, and are flexible and often allow for more versatile locking opportunities, but are also much heavier. They’re ideal for overnight storage or high-theft zones.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Folding bike locks</strong> are compact and easier to mount, but usually less secure. They’re good for light-duty use or commuters who want convenience.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Wearable locks</strong> strap around your waist or shoulders, freeing up bag space. They’re best for couriers and city riders on the move.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>What do lock certifications mean?</strong></p> <p>Independent security testing is one of the best ways to compare locks. Here’s what to look for:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://soldsecure.com/">Sold Secure</a></strong> (UK) awards Bronze, Silver, Gold and Diamond ratings. Diamond locks resist power tools and are recommended for e-bikes or high-risk areas.<a href="https://soldsecure.com/"><br></a></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://stichtingart.nl/en/">ART</a></strong> (Netherlands) rates locks from 1 to 5 stars. Most bike locks worth considering fall into the 2–4 star range.<a href="https://stichtingart.nl/en/"><br></a></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://vds.de/ueber-vds">VdS</a></strong> (Germany) also certifies locks, mostly for European markets.</p></li> </ul> <p>If you ride an e-bike or store your bike outdoors often, consider a lock with Sold Secure Diamond or ART 3-star certification or better. These are tested against power tools and high-impact attacks. Not all locks are submitted for certification, but if you’re parking in public regularly, these labels can help narrow the field.</p> <p><strong>How should I lock my bike?</strong></p> <p>Always lock the frame to a solid, immovable object – ideally through the frame and rear and wheel if possible. Avoid locking just the front wheel, and steer clear of signs or poles that can be unbolted, or your bike lifted over the top of.</p> <p>In high-theft areas, consider using two locks, such as a U-lock for the frame and rear wheel and a second lock for the front wheel or accessories. Mixing lock types, such as a U-lock plus a folding lock, can force thieves to carry more tools or, at the very least, cut through two locks, increasing the chance they’ll move on.</p> <p><strong>How do I care for my bike lock?</strong></p> <p>Clean your lock occasionally, especially if it’s exposed to rain, salt or dust. Adding a drop of lubricant, such as a light chain lube, in the keyway every month can help prevent sticking. If your lock uses a fabric sleeve, make sure it dries fully before storage to prevent corrosion. Also, keep your spare keys in a safe place. Many brands offer key replacement programs, but only if you have the original code.</p> <p><strong>Theft prevention beyond bike locks</strong></p> <p>Protecting your bike starts long before you lock it up. Nationwide, fewer than 5% of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/jun/11/what-to-do-if-your-bike-is-stolen-and-how-to-break-the-cycle">stolen bikes</a> are ever recovered, but recovery rates improve significantly in cities that actively promote bike registration. Signing up with <a href="https://project529.com/">Project 529</a>, <a href="https://bikeindex.org/">Bike Index</a> or both, before anything happens, makes it easier for police, bike shops and other riders to identify and return your bike if it’s stolen. Project 529 is known for its tamper-resistant “shield” stickers and direct integration with many law enforcement agencies, while Bike Index offers an open, global registry that is free to search and widely used by cyclists, shops and advocacy groups.</p> <p>Thieves often target bikes in places owners assume are safe, such as home garages, apartment parking facilities or even busy public racks. Bike Index data shows <a href="https://bikeindex.org/news/bike-indexs-2025-annual-bike-theft-report">59% of thefts happen in residential areas,</a> often when bikes aren’t secured to anything solid. Whenever possible, lock your bike to a fixed, immovable object that can’t be cut, unbolted or otherwise easily removed, and make sure the lock passes through the frame and at least one wheel. Front wheels are generally easier to steal because they’re not affixed to the chain, derailleur and gears, but those components also make the rear wheel more expensive to replace.</p> <p>In public spaces, choose well-lit, high-visibility spots and avoid signposts or fixtures that could be lifted out of the ground. For longer stops, double up with a second lock, ideally a U-lock paired with a heavy-duty chain or folding lock, to force thieves to carry more tools and spend more time. Even indoors, such as in a garage or bike room, anchor your bike to a sturdy rack or wall mount. As Bike Index advises: “Yes, even in your garage – lock your bike to something sturdy, thick and impossible to cut through.”</p> <p>If you use fitness tracking apps such as Strava, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/oct/29/strava-problem-fitness-app-locate-worlds-most-powerful-people">review your privacy settings</a> to hide your home or work location. Public ride maps can unintentionally tip thieves off to where your bike is stored.</p> <p><strong>What to do if your bike is stolen</strong></p> <p>Even with a high-quality lock and smart security habits, theft can still happen. If it does, act quickly. File a police report with your bike’s make, model, serial number and any distinguishing features or photos.</p> <p>If your bike is already registered with Project 529 or Bike Index, update its status to “stolen” immediately. If not, register it right away; both platforms can still help after the fact. Marking your bike as stolen in either system triggers alerts across their networks, increasing the odds someone will spot it. “The faster a bike gets flagged as stolen, the greater the chance someone in our network will spot it,” notes Rob Brunt, Project 529’s chief outreach officer and a former Vancouver police detective.</p> <p>Once your bike is flagged as stolen, get the word out as widely as possible. Post its details on cycling forums, neighborhood groups and stolen bike pages, and keep an eye on resale channels such as Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace and pawn shops. Let local bike shops know so staff can be on the lookout. If you spot your bike, don’t confront the thief; contact the police and let them handle the recovery.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>How long do bike locks last against an angle grinder?</strong></h2> <p>We tested each lock using a <a href="https://www.milwaukeetool.com/Products/2780-20">Milwaukee M18 Fuel battery-powered angle grinder</a>. This is the same tool you’d find on many job sites and, unfortunately, in the hands of determined bike thieves. Locks were secured on a sawhorse using bar clamps, and we employed 5in discs until the lock was disabled. We recorded the total cut time and the number of discs consumed.</p> <p>Because the locks were clamped in a fixed position, our cut times might be shorter than in the field, which is good for real-world deterrence. Additionally, these results can’t guarantee how long a thief might persist in public. Noise, sparks and battery swaps all increase the chances of drawing attention and increase the likelihood that a would-be thief will move on to easier targets.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/DP7MY/1/" data-alt="t"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/DP7MY/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>***</p> <h2><strong>Takeaways</strong></h2> <p>Every lock will eventually fail when subjected to the use of an angle grinder.
