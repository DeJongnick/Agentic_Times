<p>Donald Trump met with billionaire Elon Musk, his once trusted adviser with whom the president had a spectacular public falling out, at a memorial event for right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, raising speculation that the two could be reconciling. </p> 
<p>Trump shook hands with and chatted to Musk, who once led the president’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which took a hatchet to the US federal workforce and agencies in the early months of Trump’s second administration.</p> 
<p>The pair sat in the stands of a stadium in Glendale, Arizona, where tens of thousands had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/thousands-gather-at-charlie-kirk-memorial-in-arizona-where-trump-to-pay-tribute-to-slain-organizer">gathered to pay tribute to Kirk</a>, who was shot dead on 10 September at a Utah university campus.</p>

<p>Video of the two was shared by the official White House account on social media platform X, which Musk owns.</p> 
<p>Musk donated more than $270m to Trump’s presidential campaign, barnstorming key battleground states for the Republican.</p> 
<p>After the election, he oversaw the launch of the DOGE, a controversial initiative that eliminated thousands of government jobs deemed by the agency to be part of a pattern of waste, fraud and abuse.</p> 
<p>But Musk <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/06/elon-musk-america-party-scott-bessent">broke with Trump</a> over the White House’s flagship tax and spending bill, which Musk called “utterly insane and destructive.” The extraordinary feud, which largely played out over social media, saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/06/elon-musk-signals-he-may-back-down-in-public-row-with-donald-trump">Musk accuse Trump</a> of being named in the so-called “Epstein files” – documents related to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In July, Trump said he would “take a look” at the idea of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/trump-musk-feud-doge-deportation">deporting Musk</a>.</p> 
<p>After the falling out, Musk went as far as to announce he was launching his own “America First” party, but little has materialised so far. Musk on his X account posted an image of him and Trump sitting together at the memorial, captioning it: “For Charlie.”</p> 
<p>It is not known whether Sunday’s meeting was the first between the pair since their falling out.</p>
