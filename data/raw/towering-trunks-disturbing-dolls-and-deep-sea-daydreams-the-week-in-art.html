With a laser-like focus on urgent domestic matters, the US president this week bemoaned that the painting hanging in the Colorado state capitol building didn’t flatter him and demanded it be taken down. He even found time to insult its creator, saying: “The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one on [sic] me is truly the worst. She must have lost her talent as she got older.” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/24/trump-colorado-portrait-painting">Full story here</a>.

These Dutch alders have a very distinctive appearance with their fluffy foliage crowns and branchless, but furry leaved, tall trunks. They resemble palm trees in Los Angeles, which might be one reason why David Hockney is fascinated by this work. What Hockney has spoken about and imitated in his own art, however, is Hobbema’s complex perspective that he claims has two vanishing points. This is also a highly symbolic view of a humanised landscape. The new Dutch Republic in the 17th century relied for its success, and even survival, on land reclaimed from the sea. The low-lying flat vista here evokes a Dutch world where human intervention shapes nature. It would be barren without the tended, manicured avenue of alders that leads gently into town in a harmonious ideal of nature governed wisely by its human regents. <br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/meindert-hobbema-the-avenue-at-middelharnis">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in Touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
