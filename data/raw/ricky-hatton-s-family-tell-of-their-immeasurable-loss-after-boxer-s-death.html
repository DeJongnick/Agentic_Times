To us he was simply ‘Richard’, our son. A loving father, grandfather, and brother, and a true friend to many. He had a heart as big as his smile, and his kindness, humour and loyalty touched everyone who was lucky enough to know him. To the wider world, Richard will always be remembered as one of boxing’s greatest champions – a man who gave everything inside the ring and wore his heart on his sleeve outside of it.”</p>   <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/sep/14/ricky-hatton-tribute-boxing">Unforgettable Ricky Hatton turned boxing into a spectacle for his vast army of fans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The family added: “He inspired generations with his fighting spirit, his humility, and his love for the sport. But beyond the titles, the nights to remember, and the roar of the crowd, he remained the same down-to-earth Richard who never forgot where he came from.</p> <p>“As a family, our loss is immeasurable, and words cannot truly capture the pain we feel. We have been deeply moved by the overwhelming outpouring of love and support. It has been a source of great comfort to see just how many lives Richard touched, and how widely he was admired and respected. At this time, we kindly ask for privacy as we come to terms with life without him. Richard’s memory will forever remain in our hearts, in the hearts of his fans, and in the sport he loved so dearly.”</p> <p>The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said the city would consider how best to honour Hatton’s memory properly. Burnham said Hatton’s death was “hard to take in” and added: “Ricky was much loved by so many in Greater Manchester. He was the kind of person who would always turn up for people, supporting so many causes. He made us smile and made us proud. We will find a way of honouring him properly. Rest in peace, Champ.”</p>
