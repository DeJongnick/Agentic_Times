<p>Good morning. </p> 
<p>Amid higher interest rates and soaring living costs, new data shows how the percentage of income that Australian mortgage holders are spending on their loans has rocketed to levels not seen since before the 2008 global financial crisis.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization is warning that an mpox outbreak in Africa resembles the early days of HIV. And, it was thought a giant stone at England’s Neolithic Stonehenge monument originated in Wales – but archaeologists now say it came from much further away.</p>

<h2>In-depth</h2> 
<p>Peak bodies have argued that the revenue from gambling advertising flows through to grassroots teams and sport development across Australia. But experts told an inquiry that tobacco companies made similar claims before governments and commercial entities stepped up with sponsorships. So, would banning gambling ads damage children’s sports – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/aug/15/would-banning-gambling-ads-in-australia-damage-childrens-sports-and-would-a-partial-ban-work">and could a partial ban work</a>?</p> 
<h2>Not the news</h2> 
<p>Sauna has long been a way of life in northern Europe, where friends and family routinely gather to sit, chat and sweat before dunking themselves in cold water or snow, then repeating. In the past few years Australia’s once limited sauna options have expanded, bringing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/aug/15/australia-saunas-best-blue-mountains-nsw">the joy of stripping off and sweating it out</a> to the mainstream – and, just maybe, changing Australian attitudes to public nudity.</p>
