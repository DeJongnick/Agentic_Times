<p>Thank you so much for publishing Michael Rosen’s article on the Covid inquiry (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/nov/24/who-were-you-to-decide-that-our-innings-was-over-michael-rosens-covid-inquiry-poem">‘Who were you to decide that our innings was over?’ Michael Rosen’s Covid inquiry poem, 24 November</a>). It expresses so accurately the contempt that I feel for those in charge of the government in the first phase of Covid. Having myself spent more than 70 days in intensive care in 2020 and, as a retired university professor, being someone whom Boris Johnson would no doubt have considered to have “had a good innings”, I am eternally grateful that the doctors and nurses who cared for me took the opposite view – that my life was&nbsp;worth saving. </p> <p>I hope that the four generations of students whom I have had the privilege of introducing to my area of research since my recovery would endorse that view.<br><strong>Peter Johnstone</strong><br><em>Emeritus professor</em><em>, University of&nbsp;Cambridge</em></p> <p>• In a better world than this one, Boris Johnson (and Rishi Sunak) would be required to read and reply to Michael Rosen’s heartfelt article on their actions during&nbsp;the&nbsp;pandemic. <br><strong>Roger Downie</strong><br><em>Glasgow</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
