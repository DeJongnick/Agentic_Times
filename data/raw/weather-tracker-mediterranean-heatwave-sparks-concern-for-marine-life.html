<p>A recent heatwave in the Mediterranean Sea has been so severe that scientists are concerned for marine life.</p> <p>The human-induced climate crisis is making marine heatwaves more intense and prolonged, with sea surface temperatures off the coast of Mallorca since late June frequently exceeding 30C (86F).</p> <p>Portugal’s maritime authority said the southern Algarve had experienced a marine heatwave between 28 June and 9 July. Temperatures have been significantly higher than the average observed over the past 20 years – with some areas 5C above normal.</p> <p>This most recent marine heatwave has been the western Mediterranean’s most extreme for this time of year. While sea surface temperatures above 30C are not that unusual later in the summer, such conditions are unprecedented in late June.</p> <p>The impact on marine wildlife and ecosystems from marine heatwaves can be significant. Prolonged exposure can drain the energy from sea creatures to a point where they can no longer survive. There is also evidence that some species go into survival mode and will not reproduce.</p>    <p>Meanwhile, days of torrential rain across South Korea have been responsible for at least four deaths, with two people still unaccounted for.</p> <p>The country has been pounded by heavy rainfall since Wednesday, prompting the authorities to warn of landslides and flooding. Landslide alerts were raised to the highest level in several regions late last week, including across Chungcheong.</p> <p>The ministry of the interior and safety said more than 500mm had been recorded in Seosan, South Chungcheong province, since Wednesday.</p> <p>As of Saturday, almost 3,000 people had not returned to their homes after more than 7,000 were evacuated. More than 600 properties were reported damaged.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Wipha has brought heavy rain and strong winds to parts of south-east Asia. The weather system hit parts of the Philippines before passing to the south of Taiwan on Saturday.</p> <p>Rain lashed Hong Kong on Sunday as Wipha moved southwards before making landfall on the coast of Guangdong province in China. The storm is expected to reach northern Vietnam this week, bringing very heavy rain.</p> <p>More than 110mm of rain was recorded in three hours in Hong Kong, with up to 100mph (161km/h) gusts. Cathay Pacific cancelled all flights for much of Sunday and elsewhere trees and scaffolding were toppled.</p>
