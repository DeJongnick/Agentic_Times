<p>More than 1,400 vehicles have been seized from drivers who have persistently ignored fines relating to London’s Ulez clean air zone, Transport for London has revealed, with more than £25m being recouped by bailiffs.</p> <p>Bailiffs working on TfL’s behalf seized 1,429 vehicles in the last year from drivers who had repeatedly ignored penalty charge notices, with £710,000 being raised from the sale of nearly 800 of these cars.</p> <p>The figures, which cover the 12 months up to the end of July, come a year after the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/28/ulez-expansion-charge-free-car-london">extended the Ulez to cover all 32 London boroughs</a> from a previous zone that covered the area between the capital’s north and south circular roads.</p> <p>Vehicles that do not meet certain emissions standards and are caught using roads in the zone must pay a £12.50 daily charge, or a fine of up to £180 for non-payment.</p> <p>If drivers do not pay this penalty it is registered as an unpaid debt and an order is made for recovery. If it remains unpaid, a warrant is issued which allows bailiffs to recover the outstanding debt.</p> <p>The latest figures from TfL, covering June, showed that the average number of vehicles charged is 42,555, with 6,004 penalty notice charges (PCNs) being issued.</p> <p>TfL said that in the past 12 months bailiffs had recouped £25.6m from those who refused to pay penalty charge notices. This included one driver who was forced to settle a balance of £16,000 after 45 warrants were issued against them. In another case, a vehicle was seized to pay off an outstanding balance after the driver ignored 10 warrants.</p> <p>TfL said it is owed more than £370m in unpaid Ulez penalty charge notices since the scheme expanded last year but added that it believed a significant amount of this debt would be recovered through law enforcement.</p> <p>TfL has hailed the Ulez expansion as a success, pointing to research showing that it has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/25/ulez-expansion-led-to-significant-drop-in-air-pollutants-in-london-report-finds">reduced levels of harmful air pollutants</a> significantly since its introduction, as well as helping with the climate emergency by cutting London’s emissions.</p> <p>However, the scheme has also faced a strong backlash from some, including owners of non-compliant vehicles refusing to pay fines and others <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/08/bomb-attack-ulez-camera-grotesquely-irresponsible-london-mayor">vandalising the cameras that police the zone</a>.</p> <p>TfL said a significant amount of debt remained outstanding and it was now tripling the number of investigations staff to help enforcement agencies target repeat offenders.</p> <p>While the compliance of a vehicle is based on declared emissions rather than its age, a rule of thumb is that it affects diesels made before 2015 and petrol cars before 2006.</p> <p>Last month, TfL was forced to refund drivers in Chingford, east London, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/14/tfl-refund-drivers-wrongly-issued-ulez-fines-cameras-vandalised-london">after its camera had become misaligned</a> and incorrectly charged vehicles outside the Ulez boundary.</p> <p>In January, the Guardian revealed that hundreds of thousands of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/jan/26/eu-citizens-ulez-fines-data-breach-tfl">EU citizens could have been wrongly fined</a> for driving in the Ulez zone, with five EU countries accusing TfL of illegally obtaining names and addresses of citizens in order to issue fines.</p> <p>Alex Williams, TfL’s chief customer and strategy officer, said: “The most recent data shows that on average, over 96% of vehicles seen driving in the Ulez are compliant.</p> <p>“We want to send a clear message to vehicle owners that if you receive a penalty charge for driving in the zone, you should not ignore it. Your penalty will progress to enforcement agents to recover the fines that you owe, and there is a risk that your vehicle and other items of property will be removed.”</p>
