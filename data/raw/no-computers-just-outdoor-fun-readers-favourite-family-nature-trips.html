<h2>Winning tip: meadow birdsong by the beach in Pembrokeshire</h2> 
<p>For 28 years we have been going to <a href="https://westhookfarm-camping.co.uk/">West Hook Farm</a> in Marloes, Pembrokeshire, to camp. The farm has some lovely showers and toilets, and nothing else apart from beautiful fields full of meadow grass. The swifts and swallows dart along the top of the grass to eat bugs at dawn and dusk. All day long you can hear beautiful birdsong from birds such as skylarks. The fields run alongside the beautiful coastal path, which has a hedgerow full of wildflowers and birds. This is the most beautiful place on Earth (when it isn’t raining). The numerous beaches are full of soft white sands. Our children have grown up playing free in the fields on their yearly holiday – no computers, just outdoor fun.<br><strong>Em</strong></p> 
<h2>Hiking a Highlands mountain</h2> 
<p>For a true taste of the Scottish Highlands, head to Ballater and hike the 1,155-metre (3,789 ft) peak of Lochnagar in the Grampians. The trail winds through pine forests and open moorland, the air crisp and alive. Be ready for the weather to change like pages in a book: sunshine, sudden rain, a flurry of snow on the summit, then blue skies again. On the way down, slip into the river, its water sharp as ice. Pack layers, bring snacks and take your time. It’s a walk that stays with you long after you leave the mountain behind.<br><strong>Eva</strong></p> 
<h2>Walking the Cotswold Way – inspired by Laurie Lee</h2> 
<p>After a family reading of Laurie Lee’s <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/as-i-walked-out-one-midsummer-morning-9780241953280/">As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</a>, my husband and I decided our two teens were ready to try a walking holiday in the Cotswolds. We set out with backpacks and a tent on the <a href="https://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/en_GB/trails/cotswold-way/">Cotswold Way</a>, starting just outside lively Chipping Campden and ending in Bath. Mobiles were limited to an hour a day in the evening and we did 10 miles a day – covering the walk in 10 days. We felt we were a part of a community of walkers as fellow hikers greeted us in passing, sharing drinks and tips with us along the way. We also learned about the Japanese idea of <em>shinrin-yoku</em> – feeling free in nature under the canopy of trees, sky and stars – from a family from Tokyo. We returned fitter, more together and happier than when we set out.<br><strong>Ann</strong></p>

<h2>Forests and folklore in the Carpathians</h2> 
<p>Following a brilliant solo back-to-nature trip to the Carpathian mountains in Romania two years ago, I talked my two teenage boys into a family repeat earlier this summer – dangling the carrot of a trip to Count Dracula’s castle. In fact I only needed some minor encouragement from the vampire; the area itself was my ally. The forests, flanked by brooding mountains, were exciting to hike through anyway (with the help of a local guide), with the presence of brown bears, wolves and lynx adding to the thrills as we marched along. We came across medieval towns and villages that are rich in traditional folklore. One highlight was sampling local cheese and singing songs with villagers in the Bârza valley. The boys were rewarded with a ride on a horse-drawn cart to the next village, near Dracula’s alleged abode – Bran Castle. Don’t miss the stiff climb up to Postăvarul peak (1,799 metres) for great views over the area. <br><strong>Joe</strong></p> 
<h2>Where Austria’s hills are alive</h2> 
<p>Salzkammergut is the Austrian lake district. Lush meadows, forests and blue-green lakes make for endless days of swimming, biking and lying in the sun. No wonder that The Sound of Music was filmed here. Wolfgangsee has well-marked bike trails and opportunities to swim, alongside cafes serving delicious <em>kaiserschmarrn</em> (fluffy pancakes) and schnitzel. The nearby Fuschlsee has an incredible water park right by the lake: swimming pools, slides and plenty of quiet water in which to swim. It’s excellent entertainment for the entire family. We stayed in the newly renovated Feichtingerbauer, which offers complimentary access to the <a href="https://fuschlsee.salzkammergut.at/en/oesterreich-poi/detail/430010152/fuschlseebad-lakeside-beach-and-pool.html">Fuschlseebad</a>.<br><strong>Neha</strong></p> 
<h2>Paddleboarding in County Derry</h2> 
<p>By the end of the summer in 2021 we were at the end of our tether due to lockdowns and the lack of socialising opportunities. The kids had never been so quiet. My good friend Bob insisted we join his family at Swanns Bridge in County Derry for a paddleboard trip. Swanns Bridge is only a few minutes’ drive from the Atlantic beaches of Benone, but it makes use of the River Roe, rather than the ocean. After 20 minutes of trying to stay upright, something happened. For the first time in over a year we were distracted by something positive and by the beauty of the Roe. The only sound was water (mostly me falling in) and laughter. We’ve gone back since to be distracted for different reasons. It still works.<br><strong>Kieran</strong></p> 
<h2>Trigbagging in the Peak District</h2> 
<p>Try trigbagging with the kids. Be it a weekend in the Peak District or Monday to Friday in the Lake District, it doesn’t have to cost a lot. You can pitch a tent in a campsite or get cheap accommodation in a youth hostel. My kids love scrambling up the hills, paddling in the streams that flow down them, spotting the ground-nesting birds, and tucking into the snacks that come with hiking. It teaches them so much about nature and personal safety, as well as about how quickly the weather can change in such places.<br><strong>Rebecca</strong></p> 
<h2>Searching for buried treasure on Ynys Môn (Anglesey)</h2> 
<p>Our best back-to-nature day out? A spontaneous treasure hunt through the dunes of Newborough beach on Ynys Môn (Anglesey). There’s no admission fee needed – just a hand-drawn pirate map, a flask of lemonade and plenty of imagination. The kids darted between marram grass and shoreline, hunting for shells and “buried treasure” (a biscuit tin full of sweets we’d hidden earlier). With views of Llanddwyn Island and a picnic under the pines, it was low-stress, big-memory magic. Just bring snacks, suncream and a good sense of adventure! <br><strong>Robert Serebriakoff</strong></p> 
<h2>Car-free and carefree on the Isle of Arran</h2> 
<p>We had a lovely summer holiday staying on a farm on the Isle of Arran. It’s the perfect car-free holiday for families, with a very easy train ride from Glasgow to the harbour [at the mainland ferry port of Ardrossan]. We stayed on the organic farm, picking our own fruit and veg then cooking it on our camping stove on the beach. The accommodation is right on the beach and on our first morning we stepped out and saw an enormous pod of dolphins. Our days were spent walking up and down the beach playing in rock pools. Absolute heaven! The owner of the farm, who used to work in a Michelin-starred restaurant, cooks fresh lobster and seafood most nights. You can watch him and his daughter going out on their kayak to make their daily catch.<br><strong>Gemma</strong></p> 
<h2>Rockpooling in East Sussex</h2> 
<p>One of our favourite trips out in nature is to the beach at Seven Sisters, East Sussex. The walk to get there is lovely – it’s flat and a good size for our boys to ride their bikes along. It’s beautiful, with the cliffs and rivers winding along, and there’s even a little empty building to look inside, which is very exciting for small children. When at the beach, there is so much to do, including wading across the part where the river joins the sea with a pretty decent current; rock pooling in crystal-clear waters; and, on a good day, there’s the sludgy sand to get filthy in! Bonus fun is had by watching walkers wade across the river to get to the cliffs, teetering on the painful rocks, as they don’t want to get their walking shoes wet; or by finding crabs in the rock pools; and seeing little islands made as the tide goes in and out. It’s extra fun if you win the competition to find the most interesting stone or find some treasured sea glass. Chalk is fun too, but common enough not to count as an entry into the competition.<br><strong>Lauren</strong></p>
