<p>Britain is one of the least “nature connected” nations in the world, according to one of the first ever global studies of how people relate to the natural world.</p> <p>Britain ranks 55th out of 61 countries in the study of 57,000 people, which looks at how attitudes towards nature are shaped by social, economic, geographical and cultural factors.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/nov/05/we-need-to-restore-britains-connection-to-nature">We need to restore Britain’s connection to nature</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most nature-connected nation is Nepal, followed by Iran, South Africa, Bangladesh and Nigeria, according to the study, which is published in the journal <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-025-02275-w">Ambio</a>.

Studies have found that people with higher levels of nature connectedness enjoy improved wellbeing and are <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272494418308557">more likely to act</a> in <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pan3.10117">environmentally friendly</a> ways. Low levels of nature connectedness have been <a href="https://www.sei.org/publications/ipbes-transformative-change-assessment/">identified as one of three major underlying causes</a> of biodiversity loss alongside inequality and the prioritisation of individual, material gains.</p> <p>The latest research drew upon data from a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494424002056">2024 study</a> published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology. In the latest study,<em> </em>researchers from Britain and Austria, led by Miles Richardson, <a href="https://www.derby.ac.uk/staff/miles-richardson/">professor of nature connectedness at the University of Derby</a>, found the strongest indicator for a close relationship with nature was high levels of “spirituality” in a society. More religious societies and cultures where there was a preference for faith over science showed high levels of nature connection.</p> <p>In contrast, the study also found that “ease of doing business” – a World Bank measurement of the business-friendly character of a country – was correlated with less nature connection.</p> <p>Although Britain is believed to have one of the highest levels of membership of environmental organisations in the world, this apparently pro-nature indicator was found to have little impact on closeness to nature.</p> <p>More concrete factors found by the study to be linked to a lack of connection with nature included levels of urbanisation, mean income and internet use.</p> <p>“Nature connectedness is not just about what we do, but how we feel, think, and value our place in the living world,” said Richardson, who admitted he was not surprised that Britain languished so low in the nature connection league table.</p> <p>“We’ve become a more rational, economic and scientific society. That’s obviously brought some fantastic benefits but it’s how we balance them with the unforeseen problems,” he said. “How do we reintegrate natural thinking in our very technological world? It’s obviously very difficult to change cultures but it’s about mainstreaming the value of nature, making it integral to our wellbeing, so it becomes respected and almost sacred.”</p> <p>According to Richardson, ways of fostering nature connection could include better <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/sep/04/better-than-medication-prescribing-nature-works-project-shows">use of natural environments in NHS treatments</a> of mental and public health; developing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/02/trees-have-rights-too-robert-macfarlane-on-the-new-laws-of-nature">rights of nature</a> in law, and bringing nature into boardrooms and business decisions through regulations such as biodiversity net gain.</p> <p>He admitted the study revealed a tension between business and the environment. “We still need a functioning economy,” he said. “There’s ways we can rethink the way we do business – bringing nature into decision-making, nature in the boardroom, and biodiversity net gain. They can start to shift the system, where nature isn’t just simply treated as a resource but as a stakeholder.”</p> <p>While bringing nature into urban areas might reinvigorate nature connection in very urban societies, Richardson added: “It’s not just about putting a park in. How do you create sacred urban nature? It’s easy to build a park but it needs to go deeper than that.”</p> <p>The correlation between nature connection and “spirituality” in countries was discovered using measurements of the importance of religion, beliefs in a god and faith in different countries recorded by the <a href="https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp">World Values Survey</a>.</p> <p>Graham Usher, the bishop of Norwich and lead for environmental affairs for the Church of England, said: “We’ve long known that getting out into nature is good for body, mind and soul. In the Gospels we keep encountering Jesus going out to be alone in nature to be with God; he notices the birds of the air and the lilies of the field. I believe that what we notice we begin to love, and what we love we come to treasure, and what we treasure we want to protect. It all starts with children and is why activities like forest school and wild church are important for people and nature.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 3 November 2025 to describe the research as one of the first global studies of how people relate to the natural world, rather than “the first”; and to note that it drew upon data from a 2024 study published in the Journal of Environmental Psychology.</p>
