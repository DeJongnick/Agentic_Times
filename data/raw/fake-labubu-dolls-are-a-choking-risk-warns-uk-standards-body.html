<p>Growing numbers of counterfeit Labubu dolls being sold in the UK are poorly made and pose a choking hazard to young children, a trading standards body has warned.</p> <p>The toothy, fluffy monster doll figures, made exclusively by the Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/labubu-viral-doll-california">surged in popularity</a> among children and adults after going viral on social media. Celebrity fans include Rihanna and Lisa from the K-pop group Blackpink, while many owners like to attach the dolls to handbags or backpacks. </p> <p>In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/08/labubu-doll-burglary-los-angeles">burglary at a Los Angeles store</a> last week, thousands of dollars worth of Labubus were taken.</p> <p>Their popularity has triggered a surge in fakes, with many being sold by third-party sellers on online marketplaces and in local shops that are breaking the law, according to the UK’s Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI).</p> <p>Trading standards teams have seized thousands of unsafe counterfeit Labubu dolls in recent weeks. In just one month, more than 2,000 were confiscated from 13 retailers in North Tyneside, with more found in Greater Manchester, Humberside, North Somerset and Scotland. Many of the dolls were discovered after tip-offs from concerned parents.</p>    <p>Kerry Nicol, external affairs manager at CTSI, said: “These dolls are fast becoming the latest must-have craze, which is being amplified by social media influencers promoting and showcasing ‘unboxing’ of the products on platforms such as TikTok and Instagram. Supply and demand means that legitimate Labubu dolls are almost impossible to find.</p> <p>“Parents understandably want to be able to get their hands on these toys for their children and rightly expect the toys they buy to be safe, but dangerous counterfeits are finding their way into the market.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/labubu-viral-doll-california">Labubu for life: how did a viral doll become a ‘social currency’? Just ask these diehard fans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Counterfeit Labubu dolls are poorly made and unsafe, containing small detachable parts such as eyes, hands and feet, which present a serious choking hazard to young children, CTSI said. Loose stitching and exposed stuffing increase the risk of suffocation.</p> <p>The fakes often breach the UK’s toy safety regulations, lacking CE or UKCA safety markings, importer details and required safety warnings. They may also contain toxic substances such as lead, harmful dyes or banned plasticisers.</p> <p>Genuine Labubu dolls have a distinctive elf-like design and include authenticity features such as a holographic POP MART sticker, a scannable QR code linking to the official Pop Mart website, and on newer editions a subtle UV stamp on one foot, the institute said.</p> <p>Fakes can be spotted via their overly vibrant colours and an incorrect number of teeth – authentic Labubus have nine.</p> <p>“Everyone involved in the supply chain – from manufacturers and fulfilment houses to sellers and marketplaces should have a role to play in ensuring unsafe toys never reach the hands of children,” said Nicol.</p>
