<p>As the Queensland election campaign heads into its final stretch, Labor’s main message of “chaos” under a Liberal National party-One Nation government has been damaged by one of its own, while Adani continues to cause headaches for both major parties.</p> <p>With Queenslanders preparing to head to the polls on Saturday, no clear victor has emerged, leaving both the LNP and Labor scrambling to bed down seats.</p> <p>Labor has consolidated its message to one line – “a clear choice” – as it seeks to highlight what it says will be the “cuts and chaos” under a Tim Nicholls-led government. The LNP leader has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/queensland-lnp-could-form-government-with-one-nation">he is willing to work with One Nation</a> in the event of a hung parliament.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/12/rise-of-one-nation-thickens-the-plot-in-queensland-election">Rise of One Nation thickens the plot in Queensland election</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the Labor campaign is reeling from the damage done by one of its own MPs, the former police minister Jo-Ann Miller, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/21/one-nation-a-thorn-in-its-queensland-rivals-sides">who sought out the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson</a>, in front of the media on Tuesday, embracing her and presenting her with a gift for her new grandson.</p> <p>Media at the event have reported that One Nation was aware of Miller’s intentions. Miller and Labor have maintained it was a coincidence of the campaign and a “common decency” to present a gift for a new baby.</p> <p>But the friendly meeting may have damaged Labor’s attempts to paint itself as standing apart from Hanson’s party, which is predicted to take seats across north and central Queensland, as well as some outer-urban electorates in the south-east.</p> <p>“The real issue here is what is going to happen in three days’ time, on Saturday,” Annastacia Palaszczuk said from Bundaberg on Wednesday, moments before her team attempted to keep her away from signs declaring: “It’ll be grim under Tim.” The placement of “grim” seemed a little too close for comfort for those focused on optics.</p> <p>“That is the real fundamental issue and it is about a choice, it is fundamentally about a clear choice,” she said.</p> <p>Labor is headed through the Wide Bay region, which suffers from some of the highest youth unemployment rates in the state, in an attempt to win back voters vulnerable to One Nation’s message.</p> <p>In this region the decision to veto the $1bn Adani train line loan is not as popular as it is in the south-east, with Wide Bay, like central Queensland, one of the main regions that supplies labour to the mines.</p> <p>At a Townsville leaders’ debate – which Palaszczuk did not attend, having said she had a prior commitment – the loan veto also proved controversial, with the audience in support of Adani receiving the northern Australia infrastructure facility funds, while protesters launched from under a stage to speak out against it.</p> <p>Balancing south-eastern priorities with those of the rest of Queensland has proved particularly difficult for the two main parties in this campaign, with One Nation and the Greens taking advantage of the contradictory views.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/17/queensland-election-one-nation-question-dogs-lnp-in-leaders-debate">Queensland election: One Nation question dogs  LNP in leaders' debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, was in the electorate of South Brisbane, considered the strongest chance of a Greens victory, on Wednesday morning and said he felt “the same sort of energy” as in the Victorian seat of Northcote, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/19/northcote-byelection-greens-lidia-thorpe-takes-melbourne-seat-from-labor">which Labor lost to the Greens</a> in a byelection last week. </p> <p>“Increasingly people are saying we need a genuine alternative to politics as usual,” he said. “There is no question that Adani is shaping up as one of the central issues of this election campaign.”</p> <p>One Nation is spreading the same message, with Hanson expected to head to Bundaberg and its surrounds as she continues her own tour of vulnerable seats.</p> <p>The LNP is about to begin an electorate blitz of its own, heading from north Queensland to the Gold Coast in the final days, while Labor’s “cuts express” featuring senior ministers continues its own journey through 50 electorates.</p> <p>Palaszczuk’s campaign will continue to head south, with both major parties expected to release their costings on Thursday.</p>
