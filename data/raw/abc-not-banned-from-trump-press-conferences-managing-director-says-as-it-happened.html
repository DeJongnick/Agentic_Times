resettlement in a third country and remaining on temporary visas.</p> <p>Australia has struck deals with the US and New Zealand to resettle those who came to Australia by sea and have since been found to be refugees due to a hardline bipartisan policy against ever allowing them to settle in Australia.</p> <p>The US program offered 1,200 spots while the New Zealand program offered 450. Thomas said 1,115 spots have been taken up in the US program – which has been paused under US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> – for refugees who came to Australia.</p> <p>In the New Zealand program, 324 spots have been filled with an extra 63 approved to take up a spot but yet to depart Australia.</p> <p>Thomas said there had been a further 108 refugees and asylum seekers who had been resettled in other countries, including Canada, since the policy was introduced in 2013.</p> <p>The Greens senator, <strong>David Shoebridge</strong>, asked officials and the minister sitting alongside them, <strong>Murray Watt,</strong> if any other resettlement programs were being arranged given there were not enough spots for the remaining cohort.</p> <p>Thomas said “the government is continuing to engage with partner countries to determine other potential options” but declined to name any specific countries.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-08T06:34:56.639Z">at 7.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68e603298f08ca5de7d82768" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/stephanie-convery"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-08T06:24:21.266Z">7.24am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Vision Australia appoints first blind or vision-impaired CEO</strong></p> <p>Vision Australia has appointed its first vision-impaired chief executive, after more than a year of searching and a community campaign urging it to prioritise a candidate with lived experience.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Vision Australia <a href="https://www.visionaustralia.org/community/news/2025-10-07/david-williamson-announced-new-vision-australia-ceo">announced the appointment of </a><strong><a href="https://www.visionaustralia.org/community/news/2025-10-07/david-williamson-announced-new-vision-australia-ceo">David Williamson</a>,</strong> who has spent the past decade in executive roles at Catholic disability and aged care provider, VMCH.

understanding that any country which effectively facilitates illegal migration into yours is guilty of an unfriendly act, and you have a right as a sovereign nation, you have a right as a sovereign nation to protect yourself against what is, in effect, a peaceful invasion.</strong></p> <p>So, whether it’s … possibly establishing processing centres in British-dependent territories like Ascension island or something like that, as opposed to putting people up in nice hotels in nice towns in Britain, <strong>whether it’s holding people in a mothership on the English Channel</strong> and then putting them in unsinkable life rafts with just enough fuel to get back to France in the middle of the night, as we did in Java, or whether it’s conducting very vigorous mafia-busting operations in northern France.</p> <p><strong>I mean, Britain has to get serious about this, and it is going to involve deeply upsetting the French.</strong> But hey, Britain has had a lot of experience, and it needs to happen again.</p> </blockquote> <p>Abbott has been criticised before for referring to “illegal maritime arrivals” <a

The median weekly rent has surpassed $700 across Australia’s capital cities, with Brisbane and Perth running especially hot.</p> <p>Regional rents are catching up to the cities as well, reaching $591 in September on a weekly median basis – about $110 behind the capitals, compared to a gap of $120 in May 2024.</p> <p>Rent price growth had previously been easing from an annual pace of about 8% and held near a four-year-low of just 3.4% since May, amounting to about a $20 weekly increase on the median rent, Cotality found.</p> <p>Kaytlin Ezzy, an economist with Cotality, said re-accelerating rent rises were the result of far fewer properties than normal being listed “for lease”, with listings running at just three-quarters of the pre-pandemic average.</p> <p>Ezzy noted that even a recent
