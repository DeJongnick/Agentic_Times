<p>Two of Afghanistan’s national sporting heroes have called on the Taliban to reverse a decision to bar women from education and medicine, as cricket’s international community grapples with how to best address human rights concerns in the country.</p> <p>Afghanistan’s women’s cricket team fled following the takeover in 2021 and no longer competes internationally, but the country’s men’s cricket team continues to play and triggered mass celebrations following historic victories <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/15/england-humbled-by-afghanistan-in-historic-cricket-world-cup-shock">over England at last year’s 50-over World Cup</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/article/2024/jun/24/afghanistans-magical-rise-continues-with-t20-world-cup-giant-slaying-of-australia">Australia in the T20 version this year</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/19/cricket-australia-cancels-mens-t20-against-afghanistan-due-to-concern-over-womens-rights">Cricket Australia cancels men’s T20 against Afghanistan due to concern over women’s rights</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The team’s captain Rashid Khan posted on social media on Thursday that women had a “right” to education and must be allowed to train as doctors and nurses.</p> <p>“It is essential for our sisters and mothers to have access to care provided by medical professionals who truly understand their needs,” he said. “Providing education to all is not just a societal responsibility but a moral obligation deeply rooted in our faith and values.”</p> <p>The Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, issued an order on Monday to forbid women from attending institutions offering medical education. It closed one of the last remaining loopholes to navigate the regime’s ban on education for older girls and women.</p> <p>All-rounder Mohammad Nabi also posted on Thursday to condemn the move.</p> <p>“This decision does not only harm the future of these girls, but it also harms the whole country and nation,” he said. “Afghanistan also needs educated women besides educated men. Please reverse this decision and let our girls get an education.”</p> <p>Australia’s defeat to Afghanistan at the T20 World Cup in June was one of the rare meetings between the two teams, after Cricket Australia elected to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/mar/19/cricket-australia-cancels-mens-t20-against-afghanistan-due-to-concern-over-womens-rights">stop playing bilateral series</a> due to the Taliban’s treatment of women.</p> <p>Outgoing ICC chair Greg Barclay accused CA of hypocrisy this week, and backed his organisation’s stance of continuing to allow the men’s Afghanistan to compete.</p> <p>“If you really want to make a political statement, don’t play them in a World Cup. Sure, it might cost you a semi-final place, but principles are principles. It’s not about having half a principle,” he said.</p> <p>“It would be easy to kick Afghanistan out, but their board haven’t done anything wrong. They’re just working under a decree and a series of laws that says this is what you have to do. I don’t think it would make a jot of difference to the ruling party there to kick them out.”</p> <p>CA chair Mike Baird defended Australia’s approach, and highlighted the country’s ongoing support for Afghanistan women’s cricketers who fled as refugees.</p> <p>“We’re very proud of the position we’ve taken,” he said. “We’ve drawn a line, we’ve taken a position and we’re proudly standing up where we think we should.”</p> <p>Baird also confirmed Afghan women’s cricketers in Australia will be formally celebrated by CA in an event in January.</p>
