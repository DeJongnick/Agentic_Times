<p>A deep-sea diver is stranded on the sea bed with just 10 minutes of oxygen and little hope of a happy outcome. Defying the odds, his colleagues stage a daring rescue attempt. Director Alex Parkinson, who co-directed a 2019 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/05/last-breath-review-deep-sea-disaster-documentary-divers">documentary</a> about the incredible true story on which this film is based, makes an efficient fist of this breathless (literally) survival movie. </p> <p>Finn Cole plays rookie North Sea diver Chris Lemons, who, through no fault of his own, finds himself trapped underwater. Woody Harrelson and Simu Liu are businesslike as the veteran divers on his team. The main asset, though, is the camerawork, both above and below water, which plunges us into this unbearably tense thriller.</p> <ul> <li><p>In UK and Irish cinemas</p></li> </ul>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24uJzNQ2RM"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B24uJzNQ2RM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B24uJzNQ2RM">Watch a trailer for Last Breath.</a></figcaption> </figure>
