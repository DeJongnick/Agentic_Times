<p>In 35 years of reading the Guardian, a leader has never made&nbsp;me cry – until this one (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-children-of-gaza-when-17000-die-its-more-than-a-mistake">The Guardian view on the children of Gaza: when 17,000 die, it’s more than a mistake, 15 July</a>). Those last six simple words – “They were children. They were loved” – should haunt every elected member who has been complicit in this genocide. Thank&nbsp;you for your humanity.<br><strong>Mark Whitfield</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p>• Thank you for the moving leader. Alas, neither that nor the advert from Médecins Sans Frontières in your 11 July print edition headlined “We’re witnessing a genocide in Gaza. And the UK government is complicit”, nor the voices of millions in this country, have moved the government to declare an arms embargo on Israel or recognise the state of Palestine.<br><strong>Rae Street</strong><br><em>Littleborough, Greater Manchester</em></p> <p>• I find it odd that the rise in the headline inflation rate was “unexpected” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/16/uk-inflation-labour-economic-scrutiny">Report, 16 July</a>). The only people who are surprised must be economic analysts. When they walk around the supermarket or order food online, are they oblivious to the constant price rises?<br><strong>Su Hardman</strong><br><em>Woodbridge, Suffolk</em></p> <p>• Why travel to far-flung places causing so much environmental damage when the UK offers such wonderful vegan food (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jul/15/dont-ever-assume-theres-anything-to-eat-29-tips-perfect-vegan-holidays-where-to-go-how-to-order">‘Don’t ever assume there’s anything to eat!’ 29 tips for perfect vegan holidays, from where to go to how to order, 15 July</a>)? Beats me.<br><strong>Maggie Kemp</strong><br><em>Shrewton, Wiltshire</em></p> <p>• Don’t tell Rachel Reeves, but Peter the Great taxed beards (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jul/15/protect-children-not-just-animals-from-lead-exposure">Letters, 15 July</a>) and the amount depended on the length.<br><strong>Chris Walters</strong><br><em>Buxton, Derbyshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
