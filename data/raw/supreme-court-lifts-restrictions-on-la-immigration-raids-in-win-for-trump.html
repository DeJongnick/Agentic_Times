<p>Federal agents can resume sweeping immigration operations in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a> after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-supreme-court">US supreme court</a> lifted an order barring the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> administration from stopping people solely based on their race, language or job.</p> <p>The court ruled in favor of Trump’s administration, granting a stay against a restraining order from another judge that found “roving patrols” of immigration agents were conducting indiscriminate arrests in LA. The ruling from the conservative majority is a win for the administration in its ongoing effort to enact mass deportations.</p> <p>US district judge Maame E Frimpong in Los Angeles had found a “mountain of evidence” that enforcement tactics were violating the constitution. The plaintiffs<strong>, </strong>who said the administration’s approach amounted to “blatant racial profiling”, included US citizens swept up in immigration stops. An appeals court had left Frimpong’s ruling in place.</p> <p>But the Trump administration argued the order wrongly restricted agents carrying out its widespread crackdown on illegal immigration.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/02/immigration-hiring-push-trump-private-army">‘Trump’s private army’: inside the push to recruit 10,000 immigration officers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The supreme court’s 6-3 decision comes as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents also step up enforcement in Washington amid Trump’s unprecedented federal takeover of the capital city’s law enforcement and deployment of the national guard. The majority did not explain its reasoning, as is typical on the court’s emergency docket. Meanwhile, Chicago is readying itself for an immigration operation expected <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/08/chicago-suburb-evanston-federal-agents">this week</a> and the possible deployment of the national guard following weeks of threats.</p> <p>Gavin Newsom, the California governor, condemned the decision, <a href="https://x.com/CAgovernor/status/1965127261079883994">writing</a> that the administration was targeting Latinos and that “Trump’s private police force now has a green light to come after your family.”</p> <p>The ACLU of southern California called it a “devastating setback”.</p> <p>“In running to the Supreme Court to request this stay, the government made clear that its enforcement operation in Southern California is driven by race,” Mohammad Tajsar, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, said in a statement. “We will continue fighting the administration’s racist deportation scheme to ensure every person living in Southern California – regardless of race or status – is safe.”</p> <p>The Trump administration celebrated the ruling, with Pam Bondi, the attorney general, describing it as a “massive victory”.</p> <p>“Now, Ice can continue carrying out roving patrols in California without judicial micromanagement,” she said.</p> <p>The lawsuit will now continue to unfold in California. It was filed by the ACLU and immigrant advocacy groups that accused Trump’s administration of systematically targeting brown-skinned people during a crackdown on illegal immigration in the Los Angeles area.</p> <p>The Trump administration has made California a center of its deportation campaign, sending federal agents near <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/los-angeles-ice-raids-teachers-schools">schools</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/ice-raids-crops-california-farms">workplaces</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/home-depot-ice-raids-los-angeles">Home Depot</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/14/los-angeles-ice-raid">stores</a>. The large show of federal agents – along with the deployment of the military – has left southern California communities in fear.</p> <p>In its order granting the stay, the court majority wrote that the government sometimes makes stops to check the immigration status of people who work jobs in landscaping or construction, among others “that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive to illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English”.</p> <p>“Immigration stops based on reasonable suspicion of illegal presence have been an important component of US immigration enforcement for decades, across several presidential administrations,” the decision states.</p> <p>In a stinging dissent joined by her two liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote: “Countless people in the Los Angeles area have been grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor. Today, the Court needlessly subjects countless more to these exact same indignities.”</p> <p>Department of Homeland Security attorneys have said immigration officers target people based on illegal presence in the US, not skin color, race or ethnicity. Even so, the justice department argued that the order wrongly restricted the factors that Ice agents can use when deciding who to stop.</p> <p>The Los Angeles region has been a battleground for the Trump administration after its hardline immigration strategy spurred protests and the deployment of the national guard and the marines. The number of immigration raids in the Los Angeles area appeared to slow shortly after Frimpong’s order came down in July, but recently they have become more frequent again, including an operation in which agents jumped out of the back of a rented box truck and made arrests at an LA Home Depot store.</p> <p>The supreme court decision was condemned by LA’s mayor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/karen-bass">Karen Bass</a>, who said it “isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country.</p> <p>“I want the entire nation to hear me when I say this isn’t just an attack on the people of Los Angeles, this is an attack on every person in every city in this country. Today’s ruling is not only dangerous – it’s un-American and threatens the fabric of personal freedom in the United States of America.”</p> <p>The plaintiffs argued that Frimpong’s order only prevents federal agents from making stops without reasonable suspicion, something that aligns with the constitution and supreme court precedent.</p> <p>“Numerous US citizens and others who are lawfully present in this country have been subjected to significant intrusions on their liberty,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. “Many have been physically injured; at least two were taken to a holding facility.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/06/trump-administration-immigration-crackdown-massachusetts">Trump administration begins new Ice operation in Massachusetts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Trump administration said the order was too restrictive, “threatening agents with sanctions if the court disbelieves that they relied on additional factors in making any particular stop”.</p> <p>D John Sauer, the solicitor general, also argued the order could not stand under the high court’s recent decision restricting universal injunctions, though the plaintiffs disagreed.</p> <p>The order from Frimpong, who was nominated by Joe Biden, barred authorities from using factors such as apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a location such as a tow yard or car wash, or someone’s occupation as the only basis for reasonable suspicion for detention. It covered a combined population of nearly 20 million people, nearly half of whom identify as Hispanic or Latino.</p> <p>Plaintiffs included three detained immigrants and two US citizens. One of the citizens was Los Angeles resident Brian Gavidia, who was shown in a 13 June video being seized by federal agents as he yelled: “I was born here in the States. East LA, bro!”</p> <p>Gavidia was released about 20 minutes later after showing agents his identification, as was another citizen stopped at a car wash, according to the lawsuit.</p> <p>Agents arrested Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, a named plaintiff in the case, at a bus stop in June while he waited to be picked up for work.</p> <p>“When Ice grabbed me, they never showed a warrant or explained why. I was treated like I didn’t matter – locked up, cold, hungry, and without a lawyer. Now, the supreme court says that’s okay? That’s not justice. That’s racism with a badge,” said Vasquez Perdomo said in a statement following the decision.<strong> </strong></p>
