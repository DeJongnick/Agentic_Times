<p>The Smithsonian Institution has scrubbed all mention of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s impeachments from a prominent display at the National Museum of American History, temporarily eliminating any acknowledgment of the president’s unique status as the only US leader the House impeached twice.</p> <p>The alterations to the presidential power exhibit, first reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/2025/07/31/trump-impeachment-smithsonian/">the Washington Post</a>, occurred in July, with museum officials replacing contemporary signage with an older version that excludes Trump’s impeachment proceedings entirely. Visitors now see only a generic reference to three presidents facing potential removal from office.</p> <p>Museum representatives confirmed the changes followed an institutional review of exhibition content.</p> <p>“In reviewing our legacy content recently, it became clear that the ‘Limits of Presidential Power’ section in The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden exhibition needed to be addressed,” a Smithsonian spokesperson told the Guardian. “Because the other topics in this section had not been updated since 2008, the decision was made to restore the Impeachment case back to its 2008 appearance.”</p> <p>The spokesperson pledged that “a future and updated exhibit will include all impeachments,” though they provided no specific timeline for implementation.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/30/smithsonian-institution-trump-executive-order">‘It reminds you of a fascist state’: Smithsonian Institution braces for Trump rewrite of US history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The move comes as Trump has waged a systematic campaign to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/apr/14/trumps-assault-culture-echo-nazis-degenerate-art">reshape federal cultural agencies</a> since returning to power, and issued directives aimed at purging what he categorizes as diversity initiatives and halting new federal appointments.</p> <p>Earlier this year, he signed an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/27/trump-smithsonian-executive-order">executive order</a> directing the elimination of “anti-American ideology” across Smithsonian museums and promising to “restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness”. The order specifically <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/29/artists-react-trump-administration-smithsonian-institution">targets several Smithsonian facilities</a> for ideological review, including the National Museum of African American History and Culture.</p> <p>Trump faced impeachment charges twice during his first presidency – initially over allegations he pressured Ukraine to investigate political rivals, then later for his role in the 6 January 2021 Capitol attack. The Senate cleared him on both occasions.</p> <p>That historic distinction has now vanished from the nation’s premier history museum, while displays covering Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon’s impeachment cases remain untouched.</p> <p>The spokesperson explained that temporary materials addressing Trump’s impeachments had been installed in September 2021 as “a short-term measure to address current events at the time, however, the label remained in place until July 2025”.</p> <p>The Smithsonian operates as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/29/what-is-the-smithsonian-institution">congressional trust</a> with an annual budget exceeding $1bn and attracts millions of visitors annually to its network of museums, making it a key cultural touchstone for public education about American history.</p>
