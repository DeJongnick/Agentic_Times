<p>Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update.</p> <p>Iran directed at least two attacks against Australia’s Jewish community, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/26/iran-ambassador-expelled-australia-antisemitic-attacks-ntwnfb">Australia’s domestic spy agency has determined</a>, with Anthony Albanese describing the attacks as “extraordinary and dangerous acts by a foreign nation on Australian soil”.</p> <p>The prime minister announced on Tuesday afternoon that the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation had “credible intelligence” to determine the Iranian government was behind the attacks against the Adass Israel Synagogue of Melbourne and Lewis’ Continental Kitchen, alleging “it is likely Iran directed further attacks as well”.</p> <p>In response to the investigation, the Iranian ambassador to Australia, Ahmad Sadeghi, will be expelled – the first removal of a foreign ambassador to Canberra since the postwar period – and Australia’s embassy in Tehran will suspend operation. Albanese also said the government will list Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, as a terrorist organisation.</p> <p>The Asio director general, Mike Burgess, said his agency did not believe Iran was involved in every act of antisemitism in Australia but was investigating other events for possible Iranian government involvement. Burgess said no Iranian diplomats here in Australia were involved. “This was directed by the IRGC through a series of overseas cut-outs, facilitators, to coordinators that found their way to tasking Australians,” he said.</p> <h2>Top news</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/26/police-attending-active-incident-at-rural-property-in-victoria-and-ask-people-to-avoid-the-area">Porepunkah shooting: two Victoria police officers dead, one injured in attack at rural property</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/26/australia-post-auspost-suspends-us-parcel-deliveries-postage">Australia Post suspends parcel deliveries to US on eve of Trump’s new import tariff scheme</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/26/former-nsw-police-officer-beau-lamarre-condon-to-plead-not-guilty-to-murder-charges-luke-davies-jesse-baird-ntwnfb">Former NSW police officer Beau Lamarre-Condon to fight charges of murdering two men</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/piracy-straits-of-malacca-singapore">Piracy and armed robbery surge in the straits of Malacca and Singapore</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/trump-fires-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook">Trump says he hopes to meet Kim Jong-un and raises prospect of US taking over some South Korean land</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/aug/26/us-open-2025-venus-williams-karolina-muchova-first-round-match-report">Venus Williams’s US Open return ends with first-round defeat to Karolína Muchová</a></p></li> </ul> <h2>In pictures</h2>    <p><strong><br></strong>In his new book Footy Country, Australian photographer Cory White toasts the role grassroots football plays in connecting communities across Australia.
