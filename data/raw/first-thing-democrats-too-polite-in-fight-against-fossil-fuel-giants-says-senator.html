<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Democrats and the environmental movement have been “too cautious and polite” and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/10/sheldon-whitehouse-fossil-fuels">need to start loudly calling out</a> the “huge denial operation” of fossil fuel companies, the US senator Sheldon Whitehouse has said.</p> <p>Whitehouse, one of the US’s most outspoken senators on climate, gave his 300th Time to Wake Up climate speech on Wednesday.</p> <p>He has been giving the speeches since 2012, and has consistently criticized both main political parties for their weak response to the climate crisis.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What’s changed since he began giving these speeches?</strong> Whitehouse said he had shifted from discussing the facts of climate science to challenging “the fossil fuels’ massive climate denial operation”.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Trump announces 50% tariff on Brazil, claiming ‘witch-hunt’ against Bolsonaro</strong></h2>    <p>Donald Trump said he would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/09/trump-tariffs-brunei-libya-moldova">impose a 50% tariff on Brazil</a> over what he called a “witch-hunt” trial against its former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro.</p> <p>Earlier on Wednesday, the US president announced high tariffs on seven other countries – the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka – with effect from 1 August.</p> <p>Trump, who has called Bolsonaro a friend, posted a message on social media saying: “This Trial should not be taking place. It is a witch-hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!”</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How did Brazil’s president respond?</strong> Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva rejected Trump’s demand, saying the charges against Bolsonaro, for allegedly plotting to stay in power after losing the election, fell exclusively under the jurisdiction of Brazil’s judicial branch.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>US issues sanctions against Francesca Albanese, UN official investigating abuses in Gaza</strong></h2>    <p>The Trump administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/09/israel-gaza-war-un-sanctions">has announced it will put sanctions</a> on an independent official and human rights lawyer investigating human rights abuses in the Palestinian territories.</p> <p>The sanctions against Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza, mark the latest attempt by the US to penalize critics of Israel’s war in Gaza, and come after it failed to force the UN to fire her.</p> <p>Albanese has called the war against Palestinians in Gaza a genocide – a position backed by leading genocide scholars and rights organisations, but denied by Israel and the US, its main backer.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Albanese has written a series of letters urging countries to enact sanctions on Israel to put pressure on it to end its deadly bombardment of Gaza, which the territory’s health ministry says has killed 57,000 Palestinians, widely believed to be a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/10/gaza-death-toll-40-higher-than-official-number-lancet-study-finds">substantial underestimate</a>.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>How has Albanese responded</strong><strong>?</strong> Al Jazeera quoted her saying the US was using “mafia style intimidation techniques”.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In other news …</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>The death toll from the Texas flash floods has reached 119 </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/09/texas-floods-victims-death-toll">and search crews are continuing to look for the 173 people</a> still missing.</p></li> <li><p><strong>War has intensified poverty and hunger in Yemen </strong>while aid has been slashed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jul/10/yemen-refugee-families-war-poverty-hunger-aid-cut-millions-camps">with families saying</a> they have considered taking their own lives because they cannot feed their children.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the president of Ukraine, has urged western powers to </strong><strong>place heavy sanctions on Russia </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/10/russia-largest-missile-drone-attack-kyiv-ukraine-war">after its latest huge round of strikes on Kyiv</a>.</p></li> <li><p><strong>US shoppers have begun to feel the pinch</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jul/10/trump-tariffs-price-increase-shoppers">as the Trump-imposed tariffs push up</a> the cost of some imported goods.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Stat of the day: 40% of children between 12 and 15 </strong><strong>limiting their own screen use</strong></h2>    <p>Children are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/10/children-limiting-own-smartphone-use-manage-mental-health-survey">increasingly limiting the time they spend</a> on their smartphones, computers and tablets, a study shows, finding that the number of 12- to 15-year-olds who consciously take breaks from their devices has increased to 40% since 2022.

At one point, Blanco says, “I fantasized that she might try to kill me.”</p> <h2><strong>Climate check: Why are swathes of young trees dying in some UK woodlands?</strong></h2>    <p>In some UK forests all the saplings have died.
