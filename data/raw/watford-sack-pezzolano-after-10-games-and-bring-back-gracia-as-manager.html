<p>Watford have sacked their manager Paulo Pezzolano after only five months and 10 games in charge, with the club’s former manager Javi Gracia confirmed as his replacement.</p> <p>It is understood that Pezzolano, who was appointed in May to replace Tom Cleverley, and his technical staff were told not to take training on Wednesday after speculation that he was to depart began to mount on Tuesday. </p> <p>The Uruguayan was summoned to a meeting at which he became the 11th manager Watford have moved on since the start of 2020.</p> <p>“We are very pleased to welcome back Javi,” the Watford chairman and chief executive, Scott Duxbury, said. “His passion, leadership and clear strategy will help us build stability, unity and momentum.</p> <p>“We are sure there are many supporters who wished Javi had never departed in 2019. With this young and exciting squad we are convinced his experience and qualities are exactly what we need now.”</p>    <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/18/manchester-city-win-treble-watford-fa-cup-final-match-report">Gracia guided Watford to the FA Cup final</a> for only the second time in their history in 2019 but was sacked a few matches into the following campaign and last managed at Leeds in 2023.</p> <p>“For me, the feeling I have in this moment is that I’m going back home. It was the happiest time of my career,” Gracia said. “I have very good memories and we have unfinished business here. For us it’s another important step in our career.</p> <p>“It is something special for us, and at the same time we are very ambitious for this season. If we are together, we are stronger.”</p> <p>Pezzolano’s sacking comes despite their win against Oxford at Vicarage Road on Saturday that lifted them to 11th in the Championship after a slow start that yielded five points from the first six games. </p> <p>The Uruguayan is said to have left dismayed by the decision to sack him having guided Watford to a three-match unbeaten run that also included a home win over Hull and a draw at Portsmouth and means they are three points off the playoff places.</p> <p>Pezzolano arrived shortly after the end of last season with a strong record of guiding clubs to promotion in Spain, Brazil and Uruguay.</p>
