<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> said on Tuesday that it will look for “anti-American” views, including on social media, when assessing the applications of people wanting to live in the United States.</p> <p>In an <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-to-consider-anti-americanism-in-immigrant-benefit-requests">announcement</a>, US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which handles requests to stay in the United States or become a citizen, said it would expand vetting of the social media postings of applicants and that “reviews for anti-American activity will be added to that vetting”.</p> <p>“America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies,” said agency spokesperson Matthew Tragesser. “US Citizenship and Immigration Services is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible. Immigration benefits – including to live and work in the United States – remain a privilege, not a right.”</p> <p>The US Immigration and Nationality Act, which dates back to 1952, defines anti-Americanism, which at the time primarily focused on communists.</p> <p>Since taking office in January, the Trump administration has moved aggressively to deny or rescind short-term visas for people deemed to go against US foreign policy interests, especially on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/19/california-teen-ice-immigration-detention-van-nuys">Community rallies around LA teen detained by Ice while walking dog</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The latest guidance on immigration decisions said that authorities will also look at whether applicants “promote anti-Semitic ideologies”.</p> <p>The Trump administration has accused students and universities of antisemitism over protests against Israel’s war in the Gaza Strip, charges denied by the activists.</p> <p>In April, the administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/how-many-student-visas-revoked">revoked</a> or changed the legal status of hundreds of international students, only to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/25/student-visa-legal-status-restored">reinstate</a> them several weeks later. In May, student visa interviews were temporarily <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/30/trump-international-students-visas">halted</a>, and then, in June, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/social-media-student-visa-screening">new social media</a> vetting measures were introduced for international students applying to study in the US.</p> <p>Under the new measures, US diplomats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/18/social-media-student-visa-screening">are directed</a> to review applicants’ social media profiles to look for “any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States” before issuing visas.</p> <p>On Monday, the state department said it had revoked 6,000 student visas since the secretary of state, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio">Marco Rubio</a>, took office in January. It said that 4,000 of the cases involved violations of the law – “the vast majority being assault, DUI, burglary and support for terrorism” a state department official said.</p>
