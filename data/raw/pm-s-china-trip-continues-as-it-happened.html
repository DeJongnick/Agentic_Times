  <p>It’s time to wrap up our live news coverage. Here’s what’s been keeping us busy today:</p>

   <li><p>The education minister, <strong>Jason Clare,</strong> said the sheer scope of childcare centres in alleged paedophile <strong>Joshua Dale Brown’s</strong> work history showed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/16/accused-melbourne-paedophile-joshua-dale-brown-childcare-workers-australia-ntwnfb">need for a database or register to track workers</a> who moved between centres.

   <li><p><strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> and Chinese and Australian business leaders were treated to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jul/16/australia-news-live-wednesday-china-relations-economy-foreign-policy-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-6877016a8f08f900d609f252#block-6877016a8f08f900d609f252">full rendition of Australian rock classics</a> in Beijing’s Great Hall, including songs by <strong>Paul Kelly</strong>, <strong>Midnight Oil</strong> and <strong>Powderfinger</strong>, as a gesture of respect.</p></li>

  <p>We have a whale update!</p> 
  <p>The “inquisitive”, bus-sized humpback whale on tour of Sydney Harbour is now in Rose Bay in the city’s east.</p> 
  <p>According to <strong>Dr Vanessa Pirotta</strong>, who is on board a New South Wales Maritime boat shadowing the whale in an effort to protect it from the busy traffic of the harbour, the whale is “very cruisey”.</p> 
  <p>It is also on the move.</p> 
  <p>After our last update – when the mammal was in Balmoral Bay – it headed back towards the Harbour Bridge and then past Neutral Bay. It then headed past Taronga Zoo before crossing the harbour to Rose Bay.</p>

  <p><strong>AEC confirms challenge to election result in Bradfield</strong></p> 
  <p>The Australian Electoral Commission has acknowledged the petition lodged with the high court sitting as the court of disputed returns by the Liberal candidate <strong>Gisele Kapterian</strong> for the election for the seat of Bradfield in NSW.</p> 
  <p>In a statement this afternoon, the AEC said the action was a “legislated option for any participant in the federal election to potentially exercise and we respect the right of anyone to do so”.</p> 
  <p>The electoral commissioner, <strong>Jeff Pope</strong>, said the court of disputed returns played a critical role in ensuring the integrity of Australia’s federal electoral process.</p> 
  <p>“The AEC looks forward to supporting the Court in this critical role if and when required,” Pope said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>As the matter is now before the Court it is not appropriate for the AEC to provide any further comment at this stage.</p>

  <p><strong>Cancer Council welcomes vaping figures but warns against complacency</strong></p> 
  <p>The boss of the Cancer Council of Victoria, <strong>Todd Harper</strong>, has welcomed today’s figures showing dangerous vaping rates among younger Australians may have turned.</p> 
  <p>After years of rapid growth, new research released on Wednesday by the health minister, <strong>Mark Butler</strong>, showed take-up could have peaked among teenagers and high school-aged children.</p> 
  <p>Vaping rates fell from 17.5% at the start of 2023 to 14.6% in April this year among children aged 14 to 17 years.</p> 
  <p>Across the whole population, vaping declined from 9.1% in 2023 to 8.2% last year.</p> 
  <p>Harper said while today’s news was positive, now was not the time to become complacent.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Decades of efforts to address nicotine addiction has taught us that we need to sustain our efforts for the longer term. These addictive tobacco and nicotine products are marketed irresponsibly by industry, and we must remain ready to counter their tactics.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The figures come a year after federal Labor made changes to the law restricting the sale of vapes to pharmacies.</p> 
  <p>“We must not take our eye off the goal of Australians being able to live their lives free from addiction to nicotine,” Harper said.</p>

  <p><strong>Greens call for national watchdog to oversee early childhood sector</strong></p> 
  <p>The Greens are urging the government to set up an independent watchdog to oversee Australia’s early childhood education and care sector – and warn “piecemeal safety measures” will continue to leave children at risk.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, the Greens said they took a Parliamentary Budget Office-costed plan to the 2025 election which would establish a national watchdog with the authority to enforce quality standards and shut down unsafe centres. The plan was backed by The Parenthood and Royal Far West, according to the statement.</p> 
  <p>The Greens spokesperson for early childhood education and care, <strong>Steph Hodgins-May</strong>, said the party would not stand in the way of a new national childcare staff database, but further measures were needed.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We took a plan to the election that would give the government the power to ensure childcare centres are safe for kids, staff and families. The Prime Minister has no excuse not to act.</p> 
   <p>How much more harm do we need to learn about before this government acts? The system is in crisis, and band-aid fixes won’t protect our kids.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Jason Clare</strong> says access to information about childcare workers should be accessible at the click of a button and not delivered in a “drip feed” way.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on the ABC just now, the education minister responded to news of yet more childcare centres in which alleged Melbourne paedophile <strong>Joshua Dale Brown</strong> worked.</p> 
  <p>“This is another reason we need an educator register, a database telling us where people are working and where they have been working,” he said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The company responsible should know this at the click of a button, but so should we. This shouldn’t be the information that comes out in drip feed form, it should be information easy to access quickly.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said he had not been briefed about potentially more affected childcare centres coming to light. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Police have been briefing the Victorian government specifically, but this is the sort of information police should have at their fingertips, that we should have right now. We do not have it, but we should.</p>

  <p>Speaking on the ABC just now, the education minister said:</p>

   <p>I had a look at what Ed Husic had to say. He was fundamentally making the point that a definition of antisemitism should not stop somebody from criticising the government of Israel and I think he is right in that respect.</p>

  <p>Australia will have to build housing at a significantly faster rate than it has in the last couple of decades to meet the government’s target of 1.2m new homes between June 2024 and 2029.</p> 
  <p>To hit the target we need about 240,000 new dwellings every year, and new data shows we are already falling behind.

  <p><strong>Parks and Wildlife crews escort stray humpback in</strong> <strong>Sydney Harbour</strong></p> 
  <p>The New South Wales Parks and Wildlife Service, the Port Authority and Transport for NSW are urging all vessels on Sydney Harbour to take care and give a stray humpback whale “plenty of space”.</p> 
  <p>A spokesperson for NPWS says the humpback whale in Sydney Harbour is being escorted by a NPWS crew to make sure it, and the public, are safe.</p> 
  <p>NPWS crews have been out in small boats moving alongside the whale as it swims freely in the harbour, they say. Bright orange buoys were attached to a line between the two crews to draw the attention of other vessels and to alert them that the whale is nearby.</p> 
  <p>“This is done to avoid any accidental collisions and to keep the animal safe in this very busy city harbour,” they say.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>At this stage, there is nothing to suggest the whale is injured or entangled, it appears to have just taken a detour on its journey north. We expect it will leave the harbour when it is ready, and thank everyone for their cooperation.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The service says about 40,000 humpback whales are now on their annual migration from Antarctica to Queensland.</p>

  <p>A major arterial road tunnel in Sydney was closed for about an hour this morning after a car caught fire, but police are now searching for the drivers of the vehicle after saying drugs were found inside.</p> 
  <p><strong>NSW police</strong> said emergency services responded to reports a silver Audi was on fire in the M5 tunnel in Sydney at around 6.20am. Two occupants reportedly left the vehicle and walked out of the tunnel before <strong>Fire and Rescue NSW</strong> arrived to extinguish the fire.

  <p>Police allege officers later found methamphetamine and cannabis inside the car. They are appealing for information about the occupants, noting the vehicle was not reported stolen.</p>

  <p>The light show, using 500 Damoda drones, was scheduled for the evening of 14 July 2023 over the river in Docklands, in Melbourne’s CBD.</p> 
  <p>The drones, part of a show celebrating Australia’s women’s football team, launched at 6.30pm. Less than two minutes later many began showing critical errors indicating an autopilot failure, according to an Australian Transport Safety Bureau <a href="https://www.atsb.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-07/AO-2023-033%20-%20Final.pdf">report into the incident</a>, released this week.</p>

  <p><strong>Childcare educator workloads include many unpaid hours, impacting quality of care, study finds</strong></p> 
  <p>Childcare educators are spending only two-and-a-half hours of undistracted time per day with children due to heavy workloads and unpaid hours, according to an Australian-first study.</p> 
  <p><strong>AAP</strong> reports the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13384-025-00847-z">study</a>, published on Wednesday, also found more than three-quarters of educators work an average of nine unpaid hours per week, directly impacting the quality of care they can give to children.</p> 
  <p>University of Sydney lead researcher <strong>Erin Harper</strong> said the findings paint a stark picture of a sector in crisis:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Many educators said they spend a lot of time working away from children in their care and are often interrupted by multi-tasking, administrative work, or cleaning duties.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The research, which surveyed 570 educators, indicates unpaid hours make up a significant portion of the overall workload.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Henry was just asked about the devastating toxic algal bloom in South Australia that has fouled beaches and devastated marine life over the last few months. Henry said the event was not an early warning of the impacts of climate change, but a late one that scientists had been warning of for decades.</p> 
  <p>He told the National Press Club:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s well past time that we, and others in the world, dealt properly with the threats of climate change and the warming of the oceans. …</p> 
   <p>It’s another wake-up call, but it’s not an early wake-up call. We should have been well awake decades ago. And of course, some people were. Some people were awake decades ago, and were calling for action decades ago. And I think that that is how we should treat this.</p>

  <p><strong>Ken Henry, ex-treasury head, says ‘of course’ Australia needs a carbon tax</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Ken Henry</strong>, the former treasury secretary who now leads the Australian Climate and Biodiversity Foundation, is speaking before the <strong>National Press Club</strong>, where he was just asked if it was time for the nation to reconsider the need for a carbon tax. He had this to say:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It still boggles the mind that we had the world’s best carbon policy, and then, for purely political reasons, decided that we could afford to do without it. A country that’s capable of creating the best and then decides that it doesn’t need anything at all – well, my God. Of course we need a carbon tax.</p> 
   <p>But in the meantime, we’ve got something else, and we’ve got to make this something else work … I am not of the view that without a carbon tax we should give up. Clearly I am not of that view and that’s why I’m here. We’ve got to make what we’ve got work.</p>

  <p><strong>Jewish advocacy group says adoption of antisemitism definition ‘valuable tool’</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Alex Ryvchin</strong>, the co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, fired back at Labor MP <strong>Ed Husic</strong>, who said this morning Australia shouldn’t necessarily get “hung up” on definitions of antisemitism.</p> 
  <p>Ryvchin said Husic was entitled to his own opinions, but not “to his own facts”, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Antisemitism is becoming more entrenched among young people. … This is unsurprising given that generation has grown up almost completely relying on digital platforms as the source of news and information.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Ryvchin went on to say the adoption of a definition of antisemitism, as proposed by the federal envoy on antisemitism, Jillian Segal, would be a “valuable tool in understanding what is and isn’t antisemitism”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Ms Segal’s plan seeks to grapple with the precursors to violent antisemitism. That is essential to reversing the increasing normalisation of racial abuse, exclusion and violence in our society.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Segal’s report recommending the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism has caused controversy.</p>

  <p>Alleged paedophile <strong>Joshua Dale Brown</strong> has been linked to another daycare centre not previously listed by authorities, bringing his total known workplaces to 24.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A sub-adult humpback is taking in the attractions of Watsons Bay in Sydney’s east, having swum close to Circular Quay, Fort Denison and Garden Island, says whale expert, <strong>Dr Vanessa Pirotta</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Speaking from a NSW Maritime boat in the harbour just now, the scientist and organiser of the Wild Sydney Harbour citizen science project said the whale was first spotted close to Fort Denison about 8am.</p> 
  <p>While it’s not unusual for a whale to take a detour off the “humpback highway” running down Australia’s east coast – four humpbacks have been seen in the harbour this migratory season, she said – it is “crazy” for the creatures to be as inquisitive as the whale seen today.</p> 
  <p>“It’s the most inquisitive whale. It’s thin, but from its behaviour, it’s very relaxed,” she said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s not every day a whale takes a detour and hangs out in Watsons Bay – maybe it’s having fish and chips.</p> 
   <p>Most will hang out around Manly and then work out it’s not in the right place and swim away but this one is having the full harbour experience.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">'Nightmare' childcare centre case shows need for worker database to lift safety, education minister says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The education minister, <strong>Jason Clare,</strong> said the sheer scope of childcare centres in alleged paedophile <strong>Joshua Dale Brown’s</strong> work history showed the need for a database or register to track workers who moved between centres.</p> 
  <p>Channel 7’s Sunrise asked Clare this morning about “nightmare” new details surrounding Brown’s workplace history, which prompted officials to recommend 800 more Victorian children be tested for STIs:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You just used the word nightmare. That’s the right word. More parents are being put through the wringer. All the fear and anxiety that their kids might be sick, and all the trauma that kids have to go through …</p> 
   <p>The Victorian government and authorities are doing everything they can to track the details of where he worked. But this highlights an example of why you need a database or a register, so you know where all childcare workers are and where they’re moving from centre to centre. That’s just one of the things that we need to do.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Clare said the government would introduce legislation next week to cut funding from childcare centres that “aren’t up to scratch” or were not meeting “the sort of safety standards that parents expect and that our kids deserve”.</p>

  <p><strong>More on the teenage vaping data released this morning</strong></p> 
  <p>The federal government believes dangerous vaping rates among younger Australians may have turned a corner after years of rapid growth, with new research showing take-up could have peaked among teenagers and high school-age children.</p> 
  <p>Data released by the health minister, <strong>Mark Butler</strong>, on Wednesday showed that vaping rates fell from 17.5% at the start of 2023 to 14.6% in April this year among children aged 14 to 17. The report says the data follows the July 2024 vaping reforms, which were designed to curb youth access and use, and to reduce the social acceptability of vaping.</p> 
  <p>The figures come as the <strong>Therapeutic Goods Administration</strong> and <strong>Australian Border Force</strong> announced more than 10m illicit vapes had been seized since January 2024, worth a combined street value of $500m.</p>

  <p>Birth injuries are linked to a range of physical, psychological and social impacts including conditions like pelvic organ prolapse, painful sex and urinary incontinence.</p> 
  <p>Relationship strain, reduced body confidence, difficulty returning to work and ongoing social or physical limitations can all be experienced as a result of these injuries. Birth Trauma Australia co-founder <strong>Amy Dawes</strong> said:</p>

  <p><strong>Husic says envoy’s report makes critical point all must play role to combat antisemitism</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Ed Husic</strong> added that <strong>Jillian Segal</strong>’s report made several stark points about the spread of antisemitism across Australia and the threats of hatred spreading among young people. He told RN Breakfast:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think the critical point that it makes is we’ve all got a role to play in combating antisemitism, that everyone, not just government, has a role to play. Because, as the report points out, antisemitism poses a threat not just to Jewish Australians, but when hatred goes unchallenged, our democracy is at risk.</p>

  <p>He added that <a href="https://www.aseca.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-07/2025-aseca-plan.pdf">claims</a> in the envoy’s report that younger Australians were at risk of becoming “fully fledged anti-Semites” run the risk of being “a bit too sweeping”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I appreciate the point that’s trying to be made, but I think that’s a statement we’ve got to be careful as taking as an evident truth.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Husic went on to say that he had regularly spoken out against antisemitism out of a feeling that all Australians should never feel fear “for who they are”, adding:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’ve spoken up against antisemitism, conscious of the intergenerational trauma caused by the Holocaust … As the special envoy points out, antisemitism has been an ancient hatred. I just have to emphasise I’ve never needed a definition to do so.</p>

  <p>What if you could buy architect-designed drawings for a new home for $1 – and have certainty your council would approve it within 10 to 20 days?</p> 
  <p>The NSW premier, <strong>Chris Minns</strong>, will release the state’s housing pattern book on Wednesday, which contains eight blueprints for architect-designed townhouses, terraces and manor houses, chosen from internationally renowned firms including Sam Crawford Architects, Carter Williamson Architects, Saha and Anthony Gill Architects.</p> 
  <p>The designs – which will be available for $1 for the first six months and then for $1,000 – can be adjusted to fit a family’s needs and are designed with sustainability, ease of construction and cost effectiveness in mind. By comparison, getting custom architectural plans can cost upwards of $20,000.</p> 
  <p>The plans are intended to boost the state’s sluggish housing construction rates and help alleviate cost of living pressures.</p>

  <p>The shadow defence minister, <strong>Angus Taylor</strong>, has urged <strong>Anthony Albanese </strong>to shore up Australia’s relations with the United States, including signing on to a deal with Taiwan despite the prime minister’s trip to China.</p> 
  <p>Speaking on ABC’s 7.30 on Tuesday, Taylor said Australia should have strong trade relations with China, but singled out the United States and the need for the federal government to avoid tariffs on exports:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>After over 250 days of this new US administration we should have seen a face-to-face meeting between the prime minister and the president of the United States and we should be seeing relationship-building and work going on … around the Aukus alliance, around our strategic alliance more broadly.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Taylor singled out a joint commitment with the US on the security of Taiwan and peace in the Taiwan Strait as something Australia should strive towards, adding that was why Aukus was “so important”.</p> 
  <p>Asked if the Coalition would be prepared to guarantee to <strong>Donald Trump</strong> that Australia would join a war with the US over Taiwan, Taylor said you couldn’t “codify your response in every scenario” but the security and peace of Taiwan was needed:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You can make principled commitments to the security of Taiwan, to peace through deterrence and capability in the Taiwan Strait … that does mean you’re prepared to act under certain circumstances.</p> 
  </blockquote>

 <h2 class="block-title">China hails Albanese's 'personal efforts' to restore ties</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Relations between China and Australia reached a “low point” but are back on track under <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>’s leadership, the <strong>Chinese premier, Li Qiang,</strong> said last night after the pair met in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.</p> 
  <p>China’s premier congratulated Albanese on his re-election, Australian Associated Press reports, and for his “personal efforts” to stabilise the China-Australia relationship, which soured under the former Liberal government during the Covid pandemic.</p> 
  <p>“China-Australia relations have moved beyond a low point and returned to the right track of stability and development,” Li said.</p> 
  <p>Since the pair last met in October last year “a lot has happened in the world”, Li said, and there was growing instability and uncertainty in the global economy.</p> 
  <p>“The development of all countries is faced with new challenges. Given such circumstances, China and Australia as important trade partners, should strengthen dialogue and cooperation,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Albanese said he looked forward to the two nations exploring new opportunities in trade, climate change, tourism and culture.</p> 
  <p>“We’ll also have an opportunity to have a frank and open dialogue that enables us to navigate issues that need to be discussed,” he said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m <strong>Martin Farrer</strong> with the stories making the news this morning and then it’ll be <strong>Nick Visser</strong> to take the controls.</p> 
  <p>China’s premier, <strong>Li Qiang</strong>, last night hailed <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> for his “personal efforts” to stabilise the China-Australia relationship, which went south under <strong>Scott Morrison’</strong>s leadership and the Covid pandemic. After a meeting in the Great Hall of the People wrapped up a busy day of diplomacy for Albanese, Li said relations had “moved beyond a low point”. More coming up.</p> 
  <p>As Albanese continues with his diplomatic offensive in China, the shadow defence minister, <strong>Angus Taylor</strong>, told ABC’s 7.30 that he believes the prime minister should be making more progress on shoring up Australia’s relations with the US. Taylor said the reset of relations with Washington should include a deal to protect Taiwan – despite the problems that it might pose with China. More coming up.</p>
