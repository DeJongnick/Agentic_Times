<p>Good afternoon. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has mounted the case for the federal government to set a strong 2035 emissions reduction target <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/15/millions-of-australians-at-risk-from-rising-sea-levels-and-heat-deaths-could-soar-landmark-climate-report-warns">after releasing a “confronting” report</a> which provided the most detailed picture of the severe and far-reaching social and economic consequences of the climate crisis for Australia.</p> 
<p>The long-awaited national climate risk assessment found the number of heat-related deaths in Sydney could surge by almost 450% if global heating surpasses 3C, with no Australian community immune from the “cascading, compounding and concurrent” risks of a worsening climate.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2025/sep/15/landmark-climate-report-shows-every-australian-has-a-lot-at-stake-minister-says-video">Bowen said the</a> “cost of inaction will always outweigh the cost of action”, with the government expected to announce its 2035 emissions target <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/15/labor-will-announce-its-2035-emissions-target-this-week-heres-how-it-could-shape-australias-next-decade">later this week</a>, after the Climate Change Authority provided its advice to the minister last Friday.</p>
