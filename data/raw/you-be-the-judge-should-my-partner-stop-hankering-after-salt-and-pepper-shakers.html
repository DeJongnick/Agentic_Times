<h2><strong>The prosecution: Debbie</strong></h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>He says the Spanish bowl&nbsp;we use for salt is unhygienic, but </em><em>I think it&nbsp;makes us look cultured</em></p> </blockquote> <p>My partner Gene has been bothering me for ages, asking for help choosing salt and pepper shakers. But I find them to be pointless accessories.</p> <p>Salt and pepper already come in plastic shakers from the supermarket, <em>and</em> we also keep pink Himalayan salt in a small ceramic bowl from Spain, which we dispense using a wooden spoon. I&nbsp;like using the bowl, but Gene doesn’t because we often end up using our fingers to sprinkle the salt, which he says isn’t sanitary. But it’s just us in our home, so who cares? </p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>When we have people over, he says it’s ‘uncouth’ to have them sticking their hands into the bowl</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gene says it would be “more hygienic and convenient” if we didn’t keep the salt in an open bowl. But I&nbsp;don’t believe shakers will add to our life in any way. The plastic supermarket shakers do the job perfectly well, and I&nbsp;don’t think we should have more things cluttering the countertop or crowding our small wooden table. </p> <p>The other issue Gene has is about presentation and ease of use. When we have people over, he says it’s “uncouth” to have them sticking their hands into the bowl, which they sometimes do. One time our friend pinched the salt with her fingers, and Gene didn’t say anything until after she left, but he was really bothered. And he thinks supermarket shakers look tacky.</p> <p>He also wanted to decant all our soaps and washing-up liquid into plain containers. I just don’t see the point in doing that, whereas Gene is all about aesthetics. We have lived together for five years and he’s always been like this. According to him, it’s more eco-friendly to decant things instead of buying new plastic containers all the time, but I don’t think it makes a&nbsp;huge difference as we probably only buy salt and pepper twice a year.</p> <p>Rather than shakers, I think it’s more interesting to have a&nbsp;little bowl of salt from Spain, because it makes us&nbsp;look cultured and well travelled. Gene has spent hours browsing online and comparing little silver antique shakers to wooden ones. It’s&nbsp;too much effort. People managed without shakers for centuries. </p> <h2><strong>The defence: Gene</strong></h2> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>Proper shakers are more practical and elevate the table, showing it was laid with care and intention </em></p> </blockquote> <p>Salt and pepper shakers are often dismissed as decorative or unnecessary, but they serve a practical purpose. The&nbsp;main benefit is hygiene.</p> <p>Open bowls of salt, no matter how charming or artisanal they look, invite people to dip fingers in or fumble with spoons. When guests do this, I&nbsp;shudder at the thought of all the bacteria in there. A shaker, on the other hand, keeps seasonings covered and dispensed cleanly.</p> <p>There’s also the matter of presentation. When guests are over, details count. A pair of well-chosen shakers elevates the table, while plastic or glass supermarket containers look temporary and out of place. Debbie thinks it’s funny, but I like to decant everything for aesthetics. People might not comment on these little details, but presentation helps create an atmosphere, and small touches matter. A table laid with intention feels different from one cobbled together with whatever packaging happened to come from the shop.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>I want wooden shakers to match our kitchen counters. Debbie doesn’t really care</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Convenience is another factor. Shakers are designed for speed and consistency. A quick shake gives just the right amount without fumbling or measuring. I’ve ruined many dishes by over-sprinkling salt. Shakers would occupy the same space that the supermarket containers do, but they’d help us ration the salt in our meals – and they also look nice.</p> <p>I want wooden ones to match our kitchen counters and our dining table. Debbie doesn’t really care, but she once expressed an interest in some antique Victorian silver ones, which I’m open to. However, I’d like to see her show more interest in our purchase, as she will be using them too. I don’t understand the pushback.</p> <p>Proper shakers combine hygiene, practicality, and presentation in a&nbsp;way that open bowls and disposable plastic containers can’t. A small change, maybe, but one that makes a&nbsp;difference in the feel of a shared home. Debbie should be grateful she has a man who cares so deeply about the little things.</p> <h2>The jury of Guardian readers</h2> <p>It seems like Debbie will be relatively unaffected by this purchase, whereas it will make Gene a lot happier. And given the times we live in, it feels nice to find occasion to add a little more beauty to the world – or even just the table.<br><strong>Rebecca, 31</strong></p> <p>Gene may be correct about the appearance of the dinner table, but he really needs to get over himself: the notion of decanting everything strikes me as hugely unnecessary and a salt shaker won’t stop you over-salting a dish. Salt is a natural biocide anyway, so the chances of catching something from sharing a small bowl must be tiny.<br><strong>Bob, 72</strong></p> <p>Debbie should relinquish the salt bowl in favour of some chic new shakers. Gene’s desire to optimise their home might seem a bit over the top, but there isn’t anything wrong with it as long as&nbsp;he doesn’t impose the task of decanting on Debbie. <br><strong>Daisy, 26</strong></p> <p>It’s nice to have aesthetically pleasing things in your home, and Gene seems to genuinely care about making the place look good for them both. Decanting the washing-up liquid may be a bit much, but if he wants to spend his time doing that, each to their own.<br><strong>Sophie, 41</strong></p> <p>If hygiene is the issue, wash your hands before touching the salt. Aesthetics is a&nbsp;personal preference but pepper from a&nbsp;grinder tastes better than pre-ground and you can measure salt better by the pinch than from a shaker.<br><strong>Matt, 30</strong></p> <h2><strong>Now you be the judge</strong></h2> <p><strong>In our online poll, tell us who you think should lay the table</strong></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="poll">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/js.php/ybtj_poll_1_oct_2025_closing_8_oct_&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://guardiannewsandmedia.formstack.com/forms/ybtj_poll_1_oct_2025_closing_8_oct_&quot; title=&quot;Online Form&quot;&gt;Online Form - YBTJ poll - 1 Oct 2025 (closing 8 Oct)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; font-size:x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.formstack.com?utm_source=jsembed&amp;utm_medium=product&amp;utm_campaign=product+branding&amp;fa=h,6319157&quot; title=&quot;Powered by Formstack&quot;&gt;Powered by Formstack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>The poll closes on Wednesday 8 October at 9am BST</strong></p> <h2><strong>Last week’s results</strong></h2> <p>We asked whether <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/sep/25/you-be-the-judge-should-my-daughter-pay-for-the-vase-she-broke-in-our-holiday-villa">Dani should pay for the cleaning bill </a>at the Airbnb her family rented.</p> <p><strong>99%</strong> of you said yes – <strong>Dani is guilty</strong></p> <p><strong>1%</strong> of you said no – <strong>Dani is not guilty</strong></p> <p><em><strong>• You be the judge - live!</strong> As part of a special <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-live-events/2025/sep/24/an-evening-of-guardian-culture-with-tim-dowling-stuart-heritage-and-meera-sodha">Guardian Live event</a> on Wednesday 26 November, Georgina Lawton will be hosting an IRL version of th</em><em>is column.
