<p>The mood in the White House on Monday was strikingly upbeat.</p> <p>Nato’s ever-cheerful secretary general, Mark Rutte, set the tone as he addressed Donald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the gathered European leaders. “Let’s make the best out of today,” he said with a smile, before repeatedly thanking the US president for his attention to the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>That ritual of praise and gratitude continued throughout the day, as Zelenskyy and European leaders hailed supposed breakthroughs and spoke of progress on issues that remain far from clear.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/four-key-takeaways-trump-ukraine-russia-talks-white-house-washington">Four key takeaways from Trump’s White House summit on Ukraine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Much of what unfolded at the White House looked less like serious planning to end the conflict than a performance for an audience of one: persuading Trump that Russia was the obstacle to peace.</p> <p>When the US president suggested that Putin was ready for a meeting with Zelenskyy, other leaders quickly echoed the claim until it acquired the ring of truth.</p> <p>Rutte even told Fox News Putin had agreed to meet Zelenskyy, a claim Moscow has conspicuously declined to confirm, instead saying that any such meeting would need to be “prepared extremely carefully”.</p> <p>The conversation in Washington soon moved to security guarantees.</p> <p>European leaders made clear they were prepared to go further than before in pledging protection for Ukraine – from article 5-style mutual defence commitments to talk of a British-backed “reassurance force” under a settlement.</p> <p>But those ambitious pledges were as much about perception as policy.</p> <p>Moscow has made clear that Nato troops in Ukraine are a red line, and Putin shows little interest in meeting Zelenskyy. Putin insists Zelensky is not a legitimate leader and has said that any meeting with him would only take place to sign a final peace deal.</p> <p>Yet European leaders continue to push both ideas, which some observers view as a tactic to make Putin appear the one unwilling to budge.</p> <p>“Most of their [European] optimistic statements aren’t true beliefs, but meant to influence Trump. Europeans hype up expectations to create a reality in which Putin disappoints,” Janis Kluge, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, wrote on X.</p> <p>“Europeans (hopefully) know that Putin will never agree to Nato troops in Ukraine. They know that Putin doesn’t want to meet Zelenskyy. But they pretend all that is a realistic possibility to make Putin look as bad as he really is, to undermine Putin’s own narratives,” Kluge added.</p> <p>Putin, who has himself shown little desire to compromise on his maximalist demands, has also tried to frame the other side as the obstacle to peace.</p> <p>In remarks after his Alaska summit with Trump, the Russian president warned that Kyiv and European capitals should not “throw a wrench in the works” by pursuing back-room dealings that could derail the “agreements” he reached with Trump.</p> <p>There remains widespread confusion over what exactly Trump proposed and what, if anything, Putin agreed to during the Alaska summit.</p> <p>Trump’s team has presented Putin’s core concession as agreeing to US and European security guarantees for Ukraine – though even that remains murky.</p> <p>Moscow is reported to have floated a different idea: that China, Russia’s ally, act as one of the guarantors of Ukraine’s security, reviving a proposal first tabled by Russian negotiators during talks in Turkey in spring 2022.</p> <p>For now, Europe’s tactic seems to have paid off: Trump has temporarily refrained from attacking Zelenskyy or demanding that Ukraine hand over territory on the spot.</p> <p>Putin, meanwhile, is being forced to now tread carefully in response to Trump’s push for a Zelenskyy meeting. The Kremlin is expected to intensify pressure on Kyiv to accept Russian terms, framing it as groundwork for talks.</p> <p>“That way Moscow can deflect claims Putin won’t meet Zelenskyy, while signalling that any talks depend on Kyiv’s willingness to concede,” said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre.</p> <p>But Europe’s far-reaching promises, designed in part to draw a reaction from Putin, may prove unrealistic once Ukraine needs clarity about what support it can truly expect.</p> <p>“Security guarantees come in lots of shapes and sizes. But let’s be clear: there’s not going to be a US or European commitment to go to war with Russia if it reinvades Ukraine,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at Rand, a nonprofit global policy thinktank.</p> <p>“This conversation is becoming divorced from reality,” Charap added.</p>
