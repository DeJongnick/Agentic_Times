<p>Jane Goodall has been remembered as a “guiding light” in China, with hundreds of millions of people paying tribute online to the conservationist who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/01/jane-goodall-world-renowned-primatologist-dies">died this week, aged 91</a>.</p> <p>The British primatologist and founder of the Jane Goodall Institute was well known in China, and her research and findings were ubiquitous in Chinese educational materials, which listed her among “women of achievement” in text books. </p> <p>Her institute’s flagship Roots and Shoots environmental education programme worked with more than 1,000 schools across the country, and over nearly 30 years it trained 10,000 teachers and educated countless students across 25 provinces about protecting animals and the environment.</p> <p>Several high-profile scientists in China <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/oct/02/dame-jane-goodall-obituary">paid tribute to Goodall</a> after her death.</p> <p>“Her story is truly inspiring, and I was deeply influenced by it,” Sun Xin, the chief science communication expert at the National Zoological Museum of China, said.</p> <p>“It’s easy to shout slogans, but it’s extremely difficult to actually get things done and make an impact,” said Sun, who met Goodall on many occasions.</p> <p>“Through her personal efforts, she continuously advocated for animal and environmental protection, hoping that humanity would love and safeguard nature.”</p> <p>Shi Jun, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences institute of botany, and an online influencer, said Goodall was “a model for all biologists and naturalists”.</p>    <p>State media noted Goodall’s “long-standing connection with China”, which she visited for the 17th time last year, and gave an interview to the state broadcaster CCTV, remarking on ecological improvements in China.</p> <p>“Her environmental philosophy and spirit have influenced many people in China,” reported China News.</p> <p>In 2017, <a href="https://news.janegoodall.org/2017/06/04/4346/">Goodall spoke</a> about the changes in the country since her first visit almost 20 years earlier, with government efforts driven in part by the degradation of environments such as the Yangtze River basin, and the rise of rare public protests.</p> <p>“There is no doubt that more and more Chinese have become aware of environmental problems and the risk of the extinction of many species due to human activity,” she said.</p> <p>Goodall said it was true that China had caused great harm to the environment domestically and overseas, but her message was that the country “could lead the way in eliminating the need for fossil fuels and create a more sustainable future”.</p> <p>News of her death also prompted hundreds of millions of interactions on social media platforms such as Weibo, where a related hashtag was viewed 120m times, and Bilibili, where Goodall posted videos.</p> <p>“Thank you for your contributions to wildlife research and conservation, and for setting an inspiring example for women everywhere,” said one comment under Goodall’s <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1oCpfzqEsb/?spm_id_from=333.1387.homepage.video_card.click&amp;vd_source=cfd570e27d24cdc9a51604d17aaa793a">most recent video</a>, in which she called for action and hope against the human violence and environmental destruction sweeping the world, and the worsening impact of climate change.</p> <p>“Decades ago, I attended the environmental programme ‘Roots &amp; Shoots’ at school, founded by Dr Goodall in my school. It has influenced me profoundly,” wrote a Weibo user.</p> <p>Xi Zhilong, the founder of Wild China Film, a conservation-focused production organisation, said Goodall had become “a guiding light, leading us forward”.</p> <p>“The green seeds she has sown across the world will bring hope to this beautiful yet fragile planet.”</p> <p><em>Additional research by Lillian Yang</em></p>
