<p>The terms and conditions set out below describe how Guardian News &amp; Media Limited (“we”, “us”, “our”) makes available our Digital + print subscription. Please read them carefully as they affect your rights and liabilities under the law. These terms will be subject to any rights you may have under consumer law to which we are bound and which cannot be waived by contract.</p> <p>By agreeing to pay for a Digital + print subscription, you agree to comply with these terms and conditions and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/help/terms-of-service">Guardian Terms of Service</a> which apply to the use of our digital information network generally as it may be accessed on various internet-connected devices (such as smartphones and tablets). We recommend that you print a copy of these terms and conditions or save a copy on your computer for future reference.</p> <p>If you have any questions, or need any help, please visit our <a href="https://manage.theguardian.com/help-centre">Help Centre</a>.</p> <p><strong>1. What is a Digital + print subscription?</strong></p> <p>If you are taking out a Digital + print subscription, you will receive our digital benefits and our Guardian Weekly magazine on a subscription basis.</p> <p>The Guardian Weekly is an international publication, available for delivery all over the world. It is normally published 51 times a year. As part of this subscription, you will be entitled to receive one copy of the Guardian Weekly each week (except for the last week of the calendar year) delivered to your chosen address for the duration of your subscription.</p> <p>You will start to receive your digital benefits when you sign up, by using the details associated with your account. Your first copy of the Guardian Weekly magazine will be the publication date shown when in the checkout you take out your Digital + print subscription.</p> <p>If you don’t have a password already, you’ll be asked to create one when you go to sign in. Further information can be found in your confirmation email.</p> <p>You will need to sign in across all of your devices to enjoy advert-free reading on theguardian.com website and the Guardian Live App. This means that all advertising which usually appears on theguardian.com website and the Guardian Live App will be removed. This includes content from third party advertisers, adverts for The Guardian’s services, display advertising and ‘paid content/paid for by’ content.</p> <p>The advert-free reading experience only applies to content which we host, so you may still see adverts on third party hosted content, such as videos. You will still see ‘Supported by’ content. The term ‘Supported by’ is used to describe editorially independent content that the Guardian has produced with funding from foundations around the world who support specific projects. Further information about content funding on the Guardian can be found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2016/jan/25/content-funding">here</a>.</p> <p>You may see “Paid content/Paid for by” content in the Guardian Feast App. “Paid content/paid for by” is used to describe advertisement features that are paid for and controlled by the advertiser rather than the Guardian. This content is produced by the advertiser and the advertiser is solely responsible for this content.</p> <p>There may be third party advertising in the Guardian Feast App from time to time. Each individual advertiser is solely responsible for the content of its advertising material.</p> <p>We accept no responsibility for third party advertising or “Paid content/Paid for by” content, including, without limitation, any error, omission or inaccuracy therein.</p> <p>If you think there is something wrong with your subscription, please visit our <a href="https://manage.theguardian.com/help-centre">Help Centre</a> for support articles and customer service details.</p> <p><strong>2. How can I sign up to get a Digital + print subscription?</strong></p> <p>You can sign up to get a Digital + print subscription <a href="https://support.theguardian.com/uk/contribute">online</a>. You will however be required to download the Guardian apps from the Apple and Google app store/s.</p> <p>As part of the process, you will need to register for a Guardian account and we will provide you with a Supporter ID.</p> <p>If you sign up to get a Digital + print subscription online, you will receive your Supporter ID by email.</p> <p>You will then be required to sign in, using your Guardian account details or your Supporter ID, within the Guardian app and on the website in order to access your benefits.</p> <p>Your subscription is personal to you and non-transferable. Subject to our rules on fair use below, you can however share your account details with a few friends and family so that they can enjoy the digital benefits too.</p> <p>Our rules on fair use are: where we suspect fraudulent activity or we believe that you are sharing your subscription account details unreasonably or excessively, we have the right to lock your subscription account (so you can’t share your details anymore) or cancel your subscription under section 9(e).</p> <p>By submitting our online form, you are making an offer to sign up to the Digital + print subscription. If we accept your offer, as described below, it will then constitute a binding contract. Nothing that we do or say will amount to any acceptance of that offer until we send you confirmation by email.</p> <p>We will not be responsible for any failure by you to receive such confirmation, which results from your failure to supply us with correct contact details.</p> <p>If you sign up online, you are able to correct errors on your online form up to the point at which you submit your form. After this point, we will assume that all information provided is correct, unless and until you make any changes to your personal information, and will process your form accordingly.</p> <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to refuse any offer of support and therefore to refuse to provide you with the Digital + print subscription. We will do so for reasons such as where we suspect fraud or where we have questions about the origin of your funds.</p> <p><strong>3. Guardian Weekly delivery</strong></p> <p>Copies are posted prior to the publication day (Friday). Whilst we endeavour to use fast delivery services, we cannot guarantee delivery on Fridays in every region/country.</p> <p>In the event that you experience persistent delivery delays or do not receive an issue, you should contact your local customer services team (as per the details below) to seek an appropriate solution. In the event that we are forced to temporarily suspend delivery for any reason, you will be entitled to receive a proportional refund of the subscription value of the undelivered copies.</p> <p><strong>4. Digital + print subscription Renewals</strong></p> <p><strong>Automatic Renewal</strong>: <strong>Unless you cancel your Digital + print subscription by following the cancellation procedures described below, your Digital + print subscription will automatically renew on these terms on a rolling monthly or annual basis. If you do not cancel, we will automatically charge your chosen payment account for the renewed Digital + print subscription. If you are paying annually, we will send you a reminder before your Digital + print subscription automatically renews and of how you can cancel.</strong></p> <p>Once we accept your offer for the Digital + print subscription, your Digital + print subscription will continue and renew automatically on a rolling monthly or annual basis unless and until it is ended by either of us in accordance with section 9 (Cancellation and Refunds).</p> <p>You will continue to be charged the applicable Digital + print subscription price each time it renews.</p> <p><strong>5. Changes to the Digital + print subscription</strong></p> <p>We reserve the right to change from time to time:</p> <ul> <li><p>the benefits that you receive as part of the Digital + print subscription;</p></li> <li><p>the monthly and annual Digital + print subscription price; and/or</p></li> <li><p>the third party platforms on which we make our digital apps available.</p></li> </ul> <p>We also reserve the right to withdraw the supply of the Digital + print subscription and its benefits at any time.</p> <p>If we change:</p> <ul> <li><p>the Digital + print subscription benefits, we will give you at least 30 days’ notice in advance; and/or</p></li> <li><p>the monthly and annual price for the Digital + print subscription, you will need to pay this new price to continue receiving the Digital + print subscription and its benefits. We will give you at least 30 days’ notice in advance of this change (or such other length of notice as is required by the Direct Debit guarantee from time to time). Any such change will apply from your next billing cycle.</p></li> </ul> <p>If we change the subscription benefits and/or the monthly and annual price, we will give you this advance notice so that you can choose whether or not to cancel your subscription, in accordance with section 9(c) (Cancellation and Refunds).</p> <p>You will continue to receive your subscription and its benefits, until you cancel your payments or your Direct Debit (as applicable).</p> <p><strong>6. Privacy</strong></p> <p>We use third parties to fulfil certain parts of the Guardian Weekly subscription service on our behalf. This means that the information provided by you is passed to such third parties. This information will only be used for the purposes of providing the subscription service to you and will be dealt with in accordance with our privacy policy.</p> <p>You can read our Privacy Policy at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/help/privacy-policy">https://www.theguardian.com/help/privacy-policy</a> for details regarding how we use your personal information.</p> <p><strong>7. Payment of Digital + print Subscription</strong></p> <p><strong>Your first payment will be taken on the publication date of your first Guardian Weekly magazine (as shown in the checkout when you take out your Digital + print subscription). However, you will start to receive your digital benefits when you sign up.</strong></p> <p>You must provide us with complete and accurate payment information at the time you sign up and ensure that you keep your payment information up-to-date for as long as you are signed up to receive the Digital + print subscription. We will not provide a refund if you cannot access your subscription benefits due to your payment details being incorrect.</p> <p>Your subscription monthly or annual payments include any applicable sales taxes.</p> <p>Your first payment will be taken on the publication date of your first Guardian Weekly magazine (as shown in the checkout) but you will start to receive your digital benefits when you sign up. Subsequent monthly or annual payments will then be taken on a regular, rolling basis on this date, using your chosen payment method. Your Digital + print subscription will continue unless and until it is ended by either of us in accordance with section 9 (Cancellation and Refunds).</p> <p>From time to time, we may introduce promotional offers for the Digital + print subscription. These promotional offers will be subject to their own terms, which will be published together with the relevant offer, and subject to availability. We reserve the right to offer and withdraw promotional offers at any time and in no way guarantee that a promotional offer will be available at any particular time.</p> <p>You will not be able to benefit from multiple promotional offers on Guardian products at the same time. For example, you will not be able to benefit from a student Guardian Weekly subscription at the same time as any Digital + print promotional offer we may make available from time to time.</p> <p>By paying for the Digital + print subscription, you shall have no rights to influence our editorial policy or output.</p> <p><strong>8. Holidays</strong></p> <p>You are allowed to take subscription “holidays” of your Guardian Weekly subscription of up to 6 weeks (i.e. 6 issues) per subscription year (starting on the date you first took out your Digital + print subscription and each anniversary of this date). The holiday allowance is reset at the beginning of each subscription year. You cannot carry over any holiday not taken in one subscription year into the next year. You must give at least 2 weeks’ notice in order to start a subscription holiday. The weeks covered by your subscription holiday will be credited to your next payment.</p> <p><strong>If you take subscription “holidays” for your Guardian Weekly copies, you will continue to receive your digital benefits during this “holiday” period</strong>.</p> <p><strong>9. Cancellation and Refunds</strong></p> <p>(a) Your right to cancel the Digital + print subscription during the first 14 days</p> <p>You can cancel your Digital + print Subscription at any time during the first 14 days (up to and including day 14), without giving any reason. Your subscription will stop immediately and we will not take the first payment from you. From the moment you cancel, you will no longer receive the Digital + print benefits and so you will not receive any issues of Guardian Weekly.</p> <p>If you are based in the UK or the EU, you have a legal right to cancel your subscription in the first 14 days after you enter into this contract. However, the cancellation right we offer under clause 9(a) is more generous than this legal right.</p> <p>(b) Your right to cancel the Digital + print subscription after the first 14 days</p> <p>You can cancel your Digital + print subscription at any time by cancelling before your next monthly or annual payment date. The cancellation will take effect at the end of your current monthly or annual billing period. You will not receive your Digital + print subscription and benefits after this time and so you will not receive any further issues of Guardian Weekly.</p> <p>If you do not cancel before your next payment date, your Digital + print subscription will automatically renew for another month or year (as applicable), and you will need to cancel before the next payment date.</p> <p>(c) Your other rights to cancel your Digital + print subscription</p> <p>If you are not happy with any changes we will make, under section 5, to:</p> <ul> <li><p>the Digital + print subscription benefits; and/or</p></li> <li><p>the Digital + print subscription monthly and annual price.</p></li> </ul> <p>you should cancel your Digital + print subscription as soon as possible before the changes take effect.</p> <p>If you are not happy with any material changes we will make to these terms and conditions under section 12, you should cancel your Digital + print subscription as soon as possible before the changes take effect.</p> <p>If you let us know that you would like to cancel, cancellation will take effect when the changes are introduced and you will receive any proportionate refund for any unused part of your Digital + print subscription.</p> <p>You may also cancel your Digital + print Subscription immediately if we breach any of our material obligations under these terms and conditions.</p> <p>(d) How you can cancel under 9(a), 9(b) or 9(c)</p> <p>If you wish to cancel your Digital + print Subscription, you can cancel by (1) going to “Manage My Account”; or (2) contacting our customer services team using the contact details in section 11 (Customer Services).</p> <p>If you are based in the UK or EU, you can also electronically fill in and submit the model cancellation form <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2014/jul/10/-sp-subscription-cancellation-form">here</a>. If you use this third option, we will acknowledge receipt of such a cancellation by email without delay.</p> <p>(e) Our right to cancel your Digital + print subscription</p> <p>We may cancel your Digital + print subscription immediately if you breach any of your material obligations under these terms and conditions, including if we do not receive a payment when due from you, if you breach our fair use policy under section 2, if your payments are fraudulent or if we are unable to provide you with the Digital + print subscription. We will make reasonable efforts to contact you before your Digital + print subscription is cancelled in this way. If we cancel your Digital + print subscription because you breach any of your material obligations, you will not receive a refund of any amounts paid.</p> <p>We may also stop providing you with the Digital + print subscription at any time by providing you with at least 30 days’ prior notice. If you have paid the applicable monthly or annual amount, and we stop providing the Digital + print subscription before the end of your current paid for period, we will give you a proportionate refund for the unused part of your Digital + print subscription.</p> <p>(f) Refunds</p> <p>We offer refunds in the circumstances described in sections 9(c) and 9(e).</p> <p>We also offer refunds if:</p> <p>i. we are unable to provide you with the Digital + print subscription through no fault of yours; or</p> <p>ii. if there are exceptional circumstances or circumstances beyond our reasonable control. We will assess these circumstances on a case by case basis.</p> <p>If either of the two circumstances (i) or (ii) above apply, you may cancel your Digital + print subscription and we will give you a proportionate refund for the unused part of your Digital + print subscription.</p> <p>If you have a query about obtaining a refund, please contact our customer services team using the contact details in section 11 (Customer Services).</p> <p><strong>10. Our Responsibility To You</strong></p> <p>We are legally obliged to supply you with the Digital + print subscription in a manner which conforms with these terms and conditions.</p> <p>If we are unable to perform our obligations due to circumstances beyond our control, section 9(f) will apply and you will be entitled to a refund. Furthermore, we shall not be responsible for any failure to provide you with the Digital + print subscription if this is due to the supply of incorrect contact, delivery address or payment details by you or any other act committed by you, and you are not entitled to a refund if this is the case.</p> <p>We reserve the right to dispose of incorrectly addressed envelopes and their contents without an obligation to refund you or any other person if they are returned to us and despite efforts to contact you we do not receive correct address details.</p> <p>Please note that issues with your mobile network operator and/or data connection with your device may mean that you are unable to access the Digital + print subscription at any particular time – this is outside of our control and we shall not be responsible in these circumstances. We may also need to suspend the supply of the Digital + print subscription at any particular time to deal with technical, legal, regulatory or security issues.</p> <p>We exclude our liability to you to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p> <p>In all other events, our total liability to you however arising in connection with your Digital + print subscription will not exceed (i) twelve (12) times the total monthly amount you pay or (ii) the total annual amount you pay (as applicable). In certain jurisdictions, it is not possible for us to limit our liability in this way. We do not limit our liability to you where it is not possible for us to do so. Our exclusions of liability shall not apply to any damages arising from death or personal injury caused by our negligence or that of any of our employees or agents or any other liability which we cannot limit by law.</p> <p>You may have statutory consumer rights (including refund rights in certain countries) that apply to your Digital + print subscription which cannot be limited, excluded or modified. Nothing in these terms and conditions limits, excludes or modifies any such consumer rights.</p> <p>If you are in the United States, section 16 also applies to you.</p> <p><strong>11.
