But he offered no scientific or medical evidence to support his claim, which is a fringe view not shared by the overwhelming majority or vaccine experts and medical doctors.</p> <p>It is worth stressing that both of the senators who asked Kennedy about that expert’s claim – <strong>Michael Bennet</strong>, a Democratic senator, and <strong>Thom Tillis</strong>, a Republican senator – referred to the new vaccine advisory board member as “Dr Levi”. That might have led some viewers to assume that Levi is a medical doctor, but he is not. He is a professor <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/retsef-levi">at MIT’s school of management</a>, with a doctorate in operations research and no expertise in the science of infectious diseases or vaccines.</p> <p>It is unclear how Levi’s background qualifies him for a position on a vaccine panel responsible for making vaccine recommendations and whose members are supposed to be “medical and public health experts”.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-05T02:14:46.563Z">at 3.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68ba2e5b8f083127d2c229e8" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-05T01:02:26.212Z">2.02am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Elon Musk absent as Trump sits down to dinner with Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, Bill Gates, Sam Altman and Sergey Brin</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> hosted an array of tech industry leaders for dinner in the White House state dinning room on Thursday night, including <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong>, <strong>Tim Cook</strong>, <strong>Bill Gates</strong>, <strong>Sam Altman</strong> and <strong>Sergey Brin</strong>, but his former first buddy, <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, was a notable absence.</p> <p>The event, which was to have been held on the newly paved-over Rose Garden, until a forecast of thunderstorms forced the event indoors, began with <a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/white-house-event/president-trump-hosts-tech-leaders-for-white-house-dinner/665202">televised words of praise </a>for the president from several of the assembled tech leaders, and a brief series of questions from reporters.</p> <p>On his social network X, formerly known as Twitter, Musk responded to a question about why he was not at the White House <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1963624123998896368">by writing</a>: “I was invited, but unfortunately could not attend.

In 1949, Congress <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Multimedia/Experience/The-History-of-the-Department-of-Defense/#1949">changed the name</a> of the National Military Establishment to the Department of Defense, and made the army, navy and air force secretaries subordinate to a single, cabinet-level secretary of defense.</p> <p>A draft White House fact sheet on Trump’s rebranding initiative implicitly acknowledges that only Congress can formally change the department’s name, saying that the order would authorize the defense secretary, <strong>Pete Hegseth</strong>, to propose legislation that would make the change permanent. In the meantime, the order instructs Hegseth and the department to start using “Department of War” as a secondary title in official correspondence, public communications and executive branch documents. The order also authorizes Hegseth to refer to himself as the “secretary of war”.</p> <p>When Trump was asked by a reporter last week how he plans to rename the department, since that would require an act of Congress, <a href="https://x.com/cspan/status/1960072433760706827">Trump said</a>: “We’re just going to do it. I’m sure Congress will go along, if we need that, I don’t think we even need that.”</p> <p>“It just to me, seems like a just a much more appropriate,” he added. “The other is, ‘defense’ is too defensive. And we want to be defensive, but we want to be offensive, too if we have to be. So, it just sounded to me better.”</p> <p>Trump’s embrace of the old name, which seems to put to rest <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/09/14/donald-trumps-not-anti-war-just-wants-u-s-military-focus-stealing-oil/">longstanding claims</a> that he was ever the “antiwar candidate” for the presidency, comes days after he ordered the military to carry out the extrajudicial killing of 11 suspected drug smugglers.</p> <p>During his 2015 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Trump himself rejected the perception that he was anti-war by proclaiming that he was, in fact, “<a href="https://rollcall.com/factbase/transcript/donald-trump-speech-norwood-ma-august-28-2015/">much more militaristic</a>” than even George W Bush.</p> <p>Four years earlier, when he was flirting with a run for the presidency against Barack Obama, Trump had demanded US military intervention in Libya.</p> <p>“I can’t believe what our country is doing,” Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4hR4O4Yjmw">told viewers</a> of his YouTube video blog on 28 February 2011, two weeks before the Obama administration got US security council authorization “<a href="http://www.un.org/press/en/2011/sc10200.doc.htm">to protect civilians</a>” in Libya. “Gaddafi in Libya is killing thousands of people, nobody knows how bad it is, and we’re sitting around we have soldiers all have the Middle East, and we’re not bringing them in to stop this horrible carnage and that’s what it is: it’s a carnage.”</p> <p>Five months later, after the US-led air campaign had forced Gaddafi from power in Libya – and Trump had <a href="https://youtu.be/Wc8a7L0lS58">decided not to challenge Obama</a> for the presidency – the star of The Apprentice posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XsruaSmLNk">another YouTube clip</a>, complaining that the administration should have waited longer to aid the Libyan rebels, to force them to agree to surrender half of the country’s oil reserves.</p> <p>“What we should’ve done is we should’ve asked the rebels when they came to us – and they came to us, they were being routed by Qaddafi, they were being decimated – we should’ve said, ‘We’ll help you, but we want 50% of your oil,’” Trump had said. “They would’ve said, ‘How about 75%?’”</p> </div>   <p

labor secretary, <strong>Lori Chavez-DeRemer</strong>, and his Environmental Protection Agency administrator, <strong>Lee Zeldin</strong>, all have primary-residence mortgages on at least two properties, according to financial disclosure forms, real estate records and publicly available mortgage data provided by Hunterbrook Media to ProPublica.</p> <p>Real estate experts told the non-profit investigative outlet that claiming primary residences on different mortgages at the same time is often legal and rarely prosecuted.</p> <p>But Trump has called for the prosecution of Cook, the Biden-nominated central banker, for allegedly having multiple primary-residence mortgages, and leveled the same charge against <strong>Adam Schiff</strong>, the Democratic senator who led his first impeachment, and <strong>Letitia James</strong>, the New York attorney general who brought a successful civil fraud case against Trump.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated

That panel’s next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 18-19.

Cook owns properties in Michigan, Georgia and Massachusetts.</p> <p>Trump terminated Cook over Pulte’s allegations, prompting her to file a lawsuit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/28/fed-governor-lisa-cook-sues-trump">challenging his effort to oust her</a>. Cook’s lawyer, prominent Washington attorney <strong>Abbe Lowell</strong>, said the DoJ was scrambling to invent new justifications for Trump’s overreach in firing the Fed governor.</p> <p>“He wants cover, and they are providing it. The questions over how Governor Cook described her properties from time to time, which we have started to address in the pending case and will continue to do so, are not fraud, but it takes nothing for this DOJ to undertake a new politicized investigation, and they appear to have just done it again,” Lowell said.</p> <p><strong>The case, which will likely end up before the supreme court, has ramifications for the Fed’s ability to set interest rate policy without regard to politicians’ wishes</strong>, widely seen as critical to any central bank’s ability to keep inflation under control.</p> <p>Trump has demanded that the US central bank cut rates immediately and aggressively, berating Fed chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> for his stewardship of monetary policy. The central bank is expected to deliver a rate cut at its 16-17 September meeting.</p> <p>In one of her recent legal filings challenging Trump’s actions, Cook said she listed mortgages on three properties on forms submitted to the White House and Senate in the vetting process for her appointment to the Fed in 2022. Any inconsistencies were known when she was confirmed and cannot give Trump grounds to fire her now.</p> <p>Cook is the third public official to be targeted in a criminal investigation over mortgage fraud allegations.

James had previously said she would appeal.</p> <p>Trump declared “TOTAL VICTORY” after the appellate division wiped away his fine, but the five-judge panel left other punishments in place and narrowly endorsed a trial court’s finding that he committed fraud by padding his wealth on financial paperwork given to banks and insurers.</p> <p>The president filed his own appeal last week, asking the court of appeals to throw out those other punishments, which include a multi-year ban on him and his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr, from holding corporate leadership positions in New York.</p> <p>Those measures have been on hold during the appellate process and the appellate division judges said Trump can seek a court order to extend the pause pending further appeals.</p> <p>James’ appeal is the latest twist in a lawsuit she filed against Trump in 2022, which alleged that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars on his financial statements and habitually misled banks and others about the value of prized assets, including golf courses, hotels, Trump Tower, and his Mar-a-Lago estate.</p> <p>After a trial that saw a sometimes testy Trump take the witness stand, judge Arthur Engoron <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-civil-fraud-verdict-engoron-244024861f0df886543c157c9fc5b3e4">ruled last year</a> that James had proven Trump engaged in a years long conspiracy with executives at his company to deceive banks and insurers about his wealth and assets.</p> <p>Engoron ordered Trump to pay $355m – payback of what the judge deemed “ill-gotten gains” from his puffed-up financial statements. That amount soared to more than $515m, including interest, by the time the appellate division ruled.</p> <p><strong>The five-judge appellate division panel was sharply divided on many issues in Trump’s appeal</strong>, but a majority said the monetary penalty was “excessive”.</p> <p>“While harm certainly occurred, it was not the cataclysmic harm that can justify a nearly half billion-dollar award,” two of the judges wrote.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-04T20:47:38.761Z">at 9.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b9d39b8f08bfd6d85c0fd9" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-04T18:53:05.621Z">7.53pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Tech leaders genuflected to Melania Trump and other White House officials after a midday conclave, thanking her for working to bring artificial intelligence to children nationwide.</strong> Executives joined the First Lady for the inaugural meeting of a government task force on AI education, part of Trump’s Presidential AI Challenge. </p> <p>“It’s a real honor for me to be here,” said <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong>, the CEO of Google and Alphabet. “You’re really inspiring young people to use technology in extraordinary ways.”</p> <p>Pichai said Google is imagining a future where every student “can learn anything in the world.” He said the company was actively working to set up systems to make AI more accessible in schools around the country.</p> <p><strong>Arvind Krishna</strong>, the CEO of IBM, and <strong>Cameron Wilson</strong>, the president of Code.org, also addressed the First Lady, praising her leadership in bringing AI to children.

He argued in defense of a statement made by Dr. Retsef Levi, a new appointee to a key vaccine panel, that mRNA vaccines present a risk of “serious harm, including death, especially among young people.” The scientific consensus today is that mRNA vaccines – including the Covid vaccine - only rarely have side effects and are both effective and safe. </p> <p>Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) with a call to put Kennedy under oath, describing his testimony during his confirmation hearing as a lie. </p> <p>Monarez told the Wall Street Journal that she was asked to pre-approve vaccine recommendations made by a panel now composed entirely of Kennedy allies, some of whom have openly argued against vaccination, after the secretary purged it of its previous expertise, and that her refusal led to her ouster.

The “unscientific interventions failed to do anything about the disease itself.”</p> <p>“Kennedy: “We literally did worse than any country in the world,” in preventing COVID-19 deaths “and the people at CDC who oversaw that process, who put masks on our children, who closed our schools, are the people who will be leaving.”</p> <p>Kennedy: “It’s chronic disease that’s bankrupting us and destroying our national security.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-04T18:13:40.917Z">at 7.13pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b9cdc18f08bfd6d85c0f72" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-04T17:44:29.592Z">6.44pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">    <p><strong>Melania Trump welcomed tech leaders to the East Wing of the White House to inaugurate a taskforce on artificial intelligence and education as</strong> <strong>part of her Presidential AI Challenge.</strong> The event concerned how to integrate artificial intelligence into childhood education and devise ways for the government to work more with the private sector.</p> <p>“It’s a beautiful event today,” Trump said as she kicked off the meeting. “We are living in a world of wonder.”</p> <p>Trump spoke about how driverless cars now “steer themselves through cities” and drones have become an everyday part of warfare.

Annie Farmer, now 46, said she was only 16 when she was flown to New Mexico to spend a weekend with Epstein and Maxwell.</p> <p>“For so many years, it felt like Epstein’s criminal behavior was an open secret,” Farmer said. “Not only did many others participate in the abuse, it is clear that many were aware of his interest in girls and very young women and chose to look the other way because it benefited them to do so.”</p> <p>At the same press conference, the bill’s co-author, Republican representative Thomas Massie said that he is close to reaching<strong> </strong>the 218 signatures needed to bypass US House leadership and bring his bipartisan legislation, calling for the release of the Epstein files, to a floor vote.</p> <p>“Hopefully they can find their spines,” the Kentucky lawmaker said of the Republican holdouts. “I’m calling on my colleagues to be one of the next two who sponsors this discharge petition.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/jeffrey-epstein-files-release-survivors">Epstein abuse survivors urge lawmakers to back bill that would release all files</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68b966778f08bb514e0fbea1" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-04T10:14:47.754Z">11.14am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Trump to host tech CEOs for first event in newly renovated Rose Garden</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>President Donald Trump on Thursday will host more than two dozen technology and business leaders for a dinner in the newly renovated White House Rose Garden, according to a White House official.</strong></p> <p>The guests include Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the official said.</p> <p>The gathering highlights Trump’s complicated but evolving relationship with Silicon Valley and the broader tech industry, Reuters reported.</p> <p>Once a source of frequent clashes over issues such as content moderation and antitrust scrutiny, the tech sector has recalibrated since Trump’s 2024 election victory.</p>    <p>Executives have sought closer ties with the Republican administration, aligning corporate policies with the White House’s push to roll back diversity and equity initiatives while courting Trump’s favor on artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.</p> <p>“The president looks forward to welcoming top business, political and tech leaders for this dinner and the many dinners to come on the new, beautiful Rose Garden patio,” White House spokesman Davis Ingle said.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-09-04T10:22:17.790Z">at 11.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68b963c08f08bb514e0fbe84" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-04T10:03:02.124Z">11.03am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> purposefully chose a notorious Louisiana prison to hold immigration detainees as a way to encourage people in the US illegally to self-deport, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) secretary Kristi Noem said Wednesday.</strong></p> <p>A complex inside the Louisiana state penitentiary, an immense rural prison better known as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/aug/08/life-without-parole-prison-angola-louisiana-visiting-room">Angola</a>, will be used to detain those whom Noem described as the “worst of the worst” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detainees.

I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.</p> <p>We start with news that <strong>Donald Trump has asked the US supreme court to overturn a lower court decision that most of his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/07/more-than-60-countries-scramble-respond-donald-trump-latest-tariffs">sweeping trade tariffs</a> were illegal</strong>.</p> <p>The US president filed a petition late on Wednesday to ask for a review of last week’s federal appeals court ruling in Washington DC, which centred on his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/apr/02/liberation-day-what-is-a-tariff-and-why-they-matter-donald-trump">“liberation day” border taxes</a> introduced on 2 April, which imposed levies of between 10% and 50% on most US imports, sending shock waves through global trade and markets.</p> <p>The court found in a 7-4 ruling last Friday that Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-tariffs-illegal-appeal-court-ruling">had overstepped his presidential powers</a> when he invoked a 1977 law designed to address national emergencies to justify his “reciprocal” tariffs.</p> <p>The decision was the biggest blow yet to Trump’s tariff policies, but the levies were left in place until 14 October – giving the administration time to ask the supreme court to review the decision.</p> <p>Trump has now appealed and the supreme court is expected to review the case, although the justices must still agree to do so. The administration asked for that decision to be made by 10 September.</p> <p>The appeal calls for an accelerated schedule with arguments being heard by 10 November, according to filings seen by Bloomberg. Justices could then rule by the end of the year.</p> <p>Read the full story here:</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/04/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-to-overturn-trade-tariffs-ruling">Trump asks US supreme court to overturn trade tariffs ruling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In other developments:</p> <ul> <li><p>Children in Florida will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/florida-vaccine-mandate">no longer be required to receive vaccines</a> against preventable diseases including measles, mumps, chickenpox, polio and hepatitis.</p></li> <li><p>The governors of California, Oregon and Washington announced on Wednesday the creation of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/west-coast-alliance-trump-rfk-vaccines">West Coast Health Alliance aimed at safeguarding access to vaccines</a>.</p></li> <li><p>A letter published on Wednesday from more than 1,000 past and present workers of the Department of Health and Human Services department (HHS) has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/03/hhs-letter-rfk-resign-vaccines">demanded the resignation of Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Donald Trump on Thursday will host more than two dozen technology and business leaders for a dinner, according to a White House official.
