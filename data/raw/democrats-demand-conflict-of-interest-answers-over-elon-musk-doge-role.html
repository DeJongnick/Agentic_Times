<p>The California senator Adam Schiff has demanded answers about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>’s potential conflicts of interest in his role leading the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), as evidence grows of his complex business relationship with agencies now facing cuts.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.schiff.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250210-Sen-Schiff-Letter-to-COS-Wiles-on-Musk.pdf">a Monday letter</a> to the White House chief of staff, Susie Wiles, Schiff accused Musk of operating in a legal grey zone, noting that as a “special government employee” Musk is subject to strict conflict-of-interest regulations while retaining “significant financial interests in multiple private companies that benefit from federal government contracts”.</p> <p>He is now demanding a response before 13 February about whether Musk had completed a financial disclosure report and whether he had received any waivers exempting him from potential penalties for financial entanglements.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/trump-payment-system-treasury">Key payment systems ‘under siege’ by Trump administration, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Mr Musk’s compliance with federal conflicts of interest and other related obligations remains unknown to Congress and the public,” the letter read.</p> <p>The controversy centers on Musk’s dual role as a government official and CEO of companies under federal scrutiny, including Starlink, a satellite internet service operated by Musk’s SpaceX. Most notably, USAid was investigating Starlink’s operations in Ukraine just months before Musk, as Doge chief, moved to dismantle the agency.</p> <p>USAid inspector general Paul K Martin confirmed to Congress in September that the agency was<a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA17/20240926/117696/HHRG-118-FA17-Wstate-MartinP-20240926.pdf"> looking into its oversight</a> of Starlink terminals provided to Ukraine. The investigation focused on a 2022 collaboration where USAid helped deliver 5,000 Starlink terminals to the war-torn nation.</p> <p>Tesla, valued at $1.25tn – more than all other American automakers combined – faces multiple federal investigations that could be affected by Doge’s restructuring and government regulation. The <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2022/INCLA-EA22002-14498.pdf">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>’s investigation into Tesla’s autopilot system identified design flaws that “led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes” in an April report linking the technology to 13 fatalities.</p> <p>Further entanglements arise from Neuralink, Musk’s brain computer chip company. The firm received FDA clearance for human trials in May 2023 after initially being denied permission, but remains under investigation by the FDA and the Department of Agriculture over its animal testing practices. Reuters reported that approximately <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/musks-neuralink-faces-federal-probe-employee-backlash-over-animal-tests-2022-12-05/#:~:text=In%20all%2C%20the%20company%20has,the%20company's%20animal%2Dtesting%20operations.">1,500 animals died</a> in four years of testing at Neuralink facilities.</p> <p>“Mr Musk’s companies have been the subject of at least 20 recent investigations or reviews by federal agencies, which heightens the risk that Mr Musk may seek to use his new position to shield his companies from federal scrutiny,” Schiff wrote.</p> <p>Last weekend, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/08/politics/elon-musk-doge-treasury-payment-system/index.html">a federal judge blocked</a> Doge-affiliated employees from accessing a sensitive Department of the Treasury payment system that handles 90% of federal payments. Another judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/07/judge-temporarily-blocks-usaid-leave">temporarily halted Doge’s move</a> to place thousands of USAid employees on immediate leave – a decision that would have effectively ended the agency’s ongoing investigations.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/10/elon-musk-doge-agency-illegal">Elon Musk’s gutting of US agencies is illegal, experts say. How do you muzzle Doge?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response, Musk posted on X that the judge who made the decision should be <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1888485948121366871?s=43&amp;t=yvJsmV0mu2913uNCsjBAcQ">impeached</a>, and later suggested that the “<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1888589047129329675?s=46&amp;t=yvJsmV0mu2913uNCsjBAcQ">worst 1% of appointed judges</a>” be purged yearly.</p> <p>The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has claimed Musk would “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-will-excuse-himself-any-conflicts-white-house-says-2025-02-05/https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-will-excuse-himself-any-conflicts-white-house-says-2025-02-05/">excuse himself</a>” from any conflicts, but Schiff says such assurances are insufficient.</p> <p>“Unless [Wiles] or another senior White House official, in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics, provided a written waiver prior to Mr Musk’s appointment as a special government employee, Mr Musk may have violated the federal criminal conflict of interest statute by undertaking acts otherwise prohibited by law,” Schiff wrote in the letter.</p> <p><strong>Send us a tip</strong><em><br>If you have information you’d like to share securely with the Guardian about the impact of cuts to federal programs, please use a non-work device to contact us via the Signal messaging app at (646) 886-8761 or JosephGedeon.01</em></p>
