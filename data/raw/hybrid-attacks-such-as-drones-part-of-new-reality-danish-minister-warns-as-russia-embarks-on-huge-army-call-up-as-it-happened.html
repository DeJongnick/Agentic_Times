from Frankfurt, Germany, about <strong>a German man who has won €15.3m in the lottery after discovering a forgotten ticket in his coat pocket</strong> six months after he bought it, reported by AFP.</p> <p>The father from the Frankfurt area had <strong>remained oblivious to his winnings all spring and summer despite a poster campaign to find him</strong>, the Lotto Hessen company said.</p> <p>The man had even heard about the campaign to find the lucky winner.</p> <p>“I heard about it on the radio at the time and thought to myself, <strong>’How stupid can you be not to collect it?’</strong>”, he said. “It never occurred to me that I could be the person they were looking for.”</p> <p>With the weather turning chilly in Germany, the man reached for a jacket he had not worn since March – to discover the ticket in his pocket.</p> <p>“<strong>When I checked the numbers on my phone and saw the winning amount, I was completely shocked</strong> – luckily I was sitting down, otherwise my knees would have given way.”</p> <p>The man plans to spend his winnings on, <em>erm</em>, <em>a new living room sofa.</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68da954e8f08206a90f08e1d"

<p><em>in Brussels</em></p> <p><strong>In the end, the results were better than Moldova’s western allies had dared hope.</strong> In Sunday’s parliamentary elections, the pro-EU party of president Maia Sandu won a convincing victory, confirming the westward path of this former Soviet republic of 2.4 million people.</p>    <p>For Sandu, a former World Bank official who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/03/moldovans-vote-in-presidential-runoff-amid-claims-of-russian-interference">re-elected Moldova’s president in 2024</a>, <strong>it is an emphatic victory.</strong> With a secure parliamentary majority, rather than the divided coalition many pollsters had predicted, <strong>it should be easier to push through the demanding political and economic reforms required to join the union.</strong></p> <p><strong>It was an equally important result for the EU,</strong> which has invested political capital in Moldova. The European Commission has pledged €1.9bn (£1.7bn) in grants and cheap loans to Moldova to build infrastructure, such as roads, hospitals and internet cables to boost the economy and speed its arrival into the European single market. Last month, the leaders of Germany, France and Poland made a high-profile <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/door-to-the-eu-is-open-merz-tells-moldova/a-73786830">joint visit to Moldova on the anniversary of its independence</a> to express solidarity.</p> <p><strong>But sighs of relief are tempered by understanding that this is only one chapter in a long story.</strong> “The fight is not over,” Moldova’s former prime minister <strong>Natalia Gavrilița</strong> told a security conference in Warsaw on Monday. “Of course, we are very determined to carry out the reforms with all the challenges and capacity constraints and so on,” she said.</p> <p><strong>Moldova is pressing ahead with the ambitious goal of joining the EU by 2030. It is a high bar.</strong> During the past 18 years the EU has admitted only one country, Croatia, amid widespread mistrust of the enlargement process in western Europe, especially France, Denmark and the Netherlands.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/29/pro-european-party-won-moldovas-election-but-obstacles-to-join-the-eu-remain">The pro-European party won Moldova’s election but obstacles to join the EU remain</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68da8dfe8f088bee03e6f717" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/ajit-niranjan"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-29T14:31:06.624Z">3.31pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Environmental damage is putting European way of life at risk, says report</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>Europe environment correspondent</em></p> <p><strong>The European way of life is being jeopardised by environmental degradation,</strong> a <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/europe-environment-2025/main-report">report</a> has found, with EU officials warning against weakening green rules.</p>    <p>The <strong>continent has made “important progress” in cutting planet-heating pollution</strong>, according to the European Environment Agency, <strong>but the death of wildlife and breakdown of the climate are ruining ecosystems</strong> that underpin the economy.</p> <p><strong>“We are struggling to meet our 2030 targets in many areas,”</strong> said <strong>Leena Ylä-Mononen,</strong> the executive director of the agency. “This is, basically, putting at risk the future prosperity, competitiveness and quality of life of Europeans.”</p> <p>The warning comes amid a rollback of green rules as far-right parties that deny the science of climate change gain ground across the continent.

14 December after France cut vital subsidies,</strong> AFP reported</p> <p><strong>The Paris-Vienna and Paris-Berlin routes had been relaunched in 2021 and 2023 to fanfare</strong> as part of a wider effort to bring back night trains as a lower-emission alternative to short-haul flights.</p> <p>They attracted <strong>steady demand, averaging 70 percent occupancy this year,</strong> according to French state rail firm <strong>SNCF</strong>, which operated the routes with Austria’s <strong>ÖBB</strong> and Germany’s <strong>Deutsche Bahn.</strong></p> <p>But it was an expensive endeavour: unlike daytime trains, in which a seat can be resold to several passengers along a multi-stop route, a sleeper berth generates revenue from only one traveller per journey.</p> <p>Higher staffing requirements and locomotive changes at border crossings further raised expenses.</p> <p>The end of the line for the service was the termination of an annual French subsidy of about €10m ($11.7m).</p> <p>The service is “not economically viable without state subsidies”, SNCF said in a statement.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p><em>Operating night trains is indeed a huge economic
