<p>A battalion of transportation workers armed with cans of black paint has been deployed to open a new front in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ron-desantis">Ron DeSantis</a>’s “war on woke”, while young students trying to make their schools safer have joined the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/lgbt-rights">LGBTQ+</a> community as targets of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida">Florida</a>’s Republican governor.</p> <p>The saga began with the state <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/florida-pulse-rainbow-crosswalk-memorial-desantis">moving in the dead of night</a> to paint over a rainbow-colored crosswalk outside Orlando’s former Pulse nightclub, where 49 people were killed in a 2016 shooting. The city’s mayor, Buddy Dyer, called the erasure of the memorial to the mostly LGBTQ+ victims “a cruel political act”.</p> <p>Since then, DeSantis’s crosswalk wars have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-lgbtq-rainbow-crosswalks-desantis-58b22e99150bc89f91362e0bd99aa52a">spread across Florida</a>. The governor has <a href="https://x.com/FDOT_Secretary/status/1940483278428913858">ordered the removal</a> of about 400 “non-standard” pieces of street art, even though they all received state approval as a condition of installation. A growing number of municipalities has pledged to fight him.</p> <p>The state’s declared intent, acquiescent to a <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/us-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-governors-roads-are-safety-not-politics">national directive</a> by the Trump administration last month, is to “keep our transportation facilities free and clear of political ideologies”, Florida’s transport secretary, Jared Perdue, wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/FDOT_Secretary/status/1940483278428913858">post to X</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/22/florida-pulse-rainbow-crosswalk-memorial-desantis">Florida removes rainbow crosswalk honoring victims of Pulse nightclub shooting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perdue has also said painted roadways are a safety hazard, despite research showing improved driver behavior and a “<a href="https://assets.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/43/2022/04/Asphalt-Art-Safety-Study.pdf">significantly improved safety performance</a>” at sites that have art installations.</p> <p>The purge, which has targeted more than just rainbow crosswalks and other street symbols of LGBTQ+ pride street decorations, has reverberated in cities from Tallahassee to Key West.</p> <p>Several municipalities, under threat of losing state funding, have complied. Those include Port St Lucie, which <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/treasure-coast/region-st-lucie-county/port-st-lucie/road-artwork-removed-from-jessica-clinton-park-city-says-hearts-will-return-in-new-location">removed hearts painted on a roadway</a> as a memorial to a teenager who died of a heart condition, and Daytona Beach, which <a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/local/volusia/2025/08/27/fdot-paints-over-daytona-speedway-checkered-flag-crosswalks/85847555007/">painted over checkered flag crosswalks</a> at the city’s famous international speedway.</p> <p>More than a dozen schools in Tampa were also snared, and will lose vibrant asphalt artwork designed by students installed as part of the city’s award-winning Crosswalks to Classrooms program. Florida’s department of transportation (FDOT) recognized it as a <a href="https://www.tampa.gov/news/city-tampa-receives-statewide-innovation-transportation-award-68516">gold standard of road safety</a> only four years ago.</p> <p>“The innovative and collaborative efforts to combine public art and engineering treatments to improve school safety was truly inspiring,” a department official said at the time.</p> <p>In Orlando, bicycle lanes painted in May at an elementary school, designed by fourth-graders who <a href="https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2025/08/27/florida-orders-removal-of-orlando-student-road-art-it-promoted-3-months-ago/">won a FDOT art contest</a>, must also go.</p> <p>DeSantis, at a press conference in Tampa, was unrepentant. He suggested students use his street art directive outlawing “social, political or ideological messages” as a civics lesson.</p> <p>“What I would tell kids is we have a representative system of government. People elect their representatives. They’re able to enact the legislation with the governor’s signature and then when that happens, obviously people will conform their conduct accordingly,” he said.</p> <p>Other cities are digging in their heels, setting up a likely legal fight with the DeSantis administration. A special meeting of the Fort Lauderdale commission on Wednesday voted to file an administrative appeal against a removal order on four pieces of pride-themed street art in the city, including a large rainbow flag.</p> <p>“Tonight, we must stand our ground. We cannot allow ourselves to be bullied into submission and to allow others to dictate what we should do in our own communities,” Dean Trantalis, the mayor of Fort Lauderdale, said. Trantalis has previously called the governor’s crosswalk directive an act of “irrational vengeance” on the LGBTQ+ community.</p> <p>Commissioners also voted to hire the same firm of outside attorneys contracted by officials in Key West and Miami Beach, two other cities known for inclusivity, to help in the legal fight. Delray Beach commissioners <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nS8uT0Vp2gE">voted earlier this month</a> to defy the state and retain its <a href="https://delrayarttrail.com/art-installations/lgbtqia-pride-streetscape-art-installation/">giant pride streetscape</a>. An administrative hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.</p>    <p>Anna Eskamani, a Democratic state representative for Orlando, noted DeSantis’s long history of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation – including the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/28/dont-say-gay-bill-florida-ron-desantis">“don’t say gay” bill</a> and efforts to ban or restrict <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/08/florida-trans-healthcare-ruling-desantis">gender-affirming healthcare</a> – and saw deeper menace in the crosswalk orders.</p> <p>“It’s not just, ‘I despise queer people,’ which is clearly a part of the MO here, it’s bigger than that,” she said.</p> <p>“It’s trying to control what local governments can and can’t do and an effort to essentially target, harass, bully and potentially even eliminate them. Overwhelmingly, cities that have these crosswalks do not support DeSantis and didn’t vote for him. These are the same municipalities that are <a href="https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2025/florida-doge-puts-boots-ground-gainesville-and-broward-county">now getting Doge</a>, the same municipalities where DeSantis is trying to take away property taxes, which means no revenue and the consolidation and elimination of local governments.</p> <p>“It’s worth connecting the dots. It’s not as simplistic as another culture war on LGBTQ+ people.”</p> <p>Charlie Crist, the former Republican Florida governor who switched parties to become a Democratic congressman, and challenged DeSantis for governor in 2022, said it was an “absurd and embarrassing” effort to silence residents.</p> <p>“It’s hard to understand. We have a right to free speech in this country, and these murals in our cities and our communities reflect the values of those communities and cities,” he said.</p> <p>“The notion that the state government would want to suppress that right of free speech is bizarre.”</p> <p>Crist said he also saw the move as an extension of DeSantis’s targeting of minority groups: “It’s hard to draw a different conclusion, frankly, and I don’t understand it. I believe in the golden rule to do unto others as you would have done unto you, and I don’t think DeSantis knows what that is. It’s disappointing.”</p> <p>Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, predicted the push to remove pride street art would backfire.</p> <p>“DeSantis may paint over rainbows and art, but people are answering with defiance, chalking sidewalks, raising flags, covering cars with stickers, and businesses painting their parking lots with rainbows. These acts declare we are not intimidated and we will not be erased,” she said <a href="https://www.eqfl.org/defying-desantis-show-your-rainbow">in a statement</a>.</p> <p>“This isn’t about safety. It’s a cowardly abuse of power and the latest in his campaign to ban books, whitewash history, and attack LGBTQ people. Cities must push back to protect the values that make them welcoming places to live, work, and visit.”</p>
