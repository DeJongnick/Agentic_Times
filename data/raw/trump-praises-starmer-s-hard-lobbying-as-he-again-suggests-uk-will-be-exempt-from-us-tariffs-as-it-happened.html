  <p>Keir Starmer stressed the UK guards free speech “preciously” and said he “got on very well” with Vice President JD Vance during Thursday’s meeting.</p> 
  <p>Speaking to Fox News, Starmer said: “We actually had some exchanges today about things like freedom of speech. We got on very well, by the way.</p> 
  <p>“We had a really good discussion over lunch and I made clear we’ve had freedom of speech in the United Kingdom for a very, very long time and we guard it preciously.”</p> 
  <p>Asked if the UK’s Online Safety Act meant it was trying censor speech,Starmer said: “No we don’t believe in censoring speech, but of course we do need to deal with terrorism. We need to deal with paedophiles and issues like that.</p> 
  <p>“But I talked to the vice president about it today and we had a good exchange about it. And of course, he’s right to champion free speech. We champion free speech in the United Kingdom.”</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a>’s meeting with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> this week comes at a crucial moment for the war in Ukraine and the future of the Nato alliance. Europe is looking for leaders who can engage Trump on the future of the continent as the US leader appears more inclined to demand tribute from his allies and cosy up to Vladimir Putin. Sir Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador the US, has called this one of the “most consequential meetings of a British prime minister and president that we have had since the second world war”.</p> 
  <p>Can the “special relationship” between the US and the UK save the day? Or has the era of transatlantic cooperation ended in the era of “America first”? Starmer has already established a friendly rapport with Trump and comes bearing promises to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/25/starmer-slashes-aid-to-fund-major-increase-in-defence-spending">raise defense spending</a> and negotiate on trade, but can that overcome Trump’s impulse to abandon Europe and strike a deal with Russia to end the war as quickly as possible?</p> 
  <p>The US president is notoriously mercurial. His decisions are said to be influenced by the last person with whom he spoke. On Thursday, that person will be Starmer, who comes to the White House on the heels of France’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/emmanuel-macron">Emmanuel Macron</a> to try his best to argue Europe’s case to the new US president.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Donald Trump has insisted that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> would “keep his word” on a peace deal for Ukraine, arguing that US workers extracting critical minerals in the country would act as a security backstop to deter Russia from invading again.</p> 
  <p>During highly anticipated talks at the White House with the prime minister, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/keir-starmer">Keir Starmer</a>, the US president said that Putin could be trusted not to breach any agreement, which could aim to return as much of the land as possible to Ukraine that was seized by Russia during the brutal three-year conflict.</p> 
  <p>But, sitting alongside Starmer in the Oval Office taking questions from journalists, Trump refused to commit to deploying US forces to support a European-led peacekeeping force, although he said the US would “always” help the British military in the unlikely event it needed it.</p> 
  <p>He later indicated the US would make “great trade agreements” with the UK that could progress “very quickly”, adding that Starmer had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2025/feb/27/trump-praises-starmers-negotiating-as-he-suggests-uk-will-be-exempt-from-us-tariffs-video">tried to persuade him against imposing tariffs</a>, saying: “He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer's first White House meeting with Trump – snap analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Earlier this week this encounter was widely described as the most difficult, and consequential, first White House meeting a PM would have with a new president in the postwar era. As Keir Starmer and his Downing Street team head for home, they will probably be delighted with how it has gone.</p> 
  <p>On the basis of the public-facing events, the press conference and the earlier Q&amp;A in the Oval Office (which may even have lasted longer than the press conference), the relationship between the two men is solid and genuine.</p> 
  <p>Starmer resorted to exactly the same tactic Theresa May deployed when she first met Trump in the White House, offering Trump a state visit (the highest category of ceremonial visit that Buckingham Palace can offer – a carnival of coaches, pageantry, banquets etc). Only this was an even bigger honour, because a second state visit is unprecedented, and Starmer flattered his host shamelessly on this point, laying it on with a trowel. It certainly seemed to work.</p> 
  <p>But Starmer managed to pull this off without sounding impossibly needy. While Trump dominated the conversation in the Oval Office, Starmer did intervene reasonably often to drag Trump back to his talking points, and he was prepared to contradict Trump on at least one point (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-ukraine-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-67c0bd278f08f021a67bebeb#block-67c0bd278f08f021a67bebeb">7.34pm</a>.) He was also a bit more forceful towards JD Vance (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-ukraine-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-67c0c17f8f08f021a67bec30#block-67c0c17f8f08f021a67bec30">8.15pm</a>.)</p> 
  <p>Assuming that Trump was not completely making it up, Starmer was clearly quite assertive when they spoke in private. Trump’s comments about Starmer being a “very tough negotiator” (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-ukraine-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-67c0c99b8f08824e5d8ca7b4#block-67c0c99b8f08824e5d8ca7b4">8.32pm</a>) and earning his money lobbying for his country (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-ukraine-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-67c0d2ab8f08f021a67bece5#block-67c0d2ab8f08f021a67bece5">9.05pm</a>) were ideal copy for No 10 (not least because they directly contradict the Conservative party’s <a href="https://x.com/KemiBadenoch/status/1886854407939097068">main attack line</a> against him).</p> 
  <p>However, words are just words. <strong>Morgan McSweeney</strong>, Starmer’s chief of staff, has been telling colleagues in relation to Trump recently:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The important thing is what happens rather than what people say.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>McSweeney has been making this point to persuade Labour officials and ministers not to worry too much about Trump’s wilder, lunatic outbursts. But the same logic applies for Trump’s friendly rhetoric.</p> 
  <p>The real test of today’s meetings will come when the Trump administration takes decisions, and at this point it is hard to tell how useful the positive language will turn out to be.</p> 
  <p>On tariffs, from what Trump said, it sounded as if the prospect of the UK being hit by US tariffs is now very slight indeed. That would be a big, significant win for Starmer.</p> 
  <p>Trump was also quite explicit about a trade deal, which potentially could be a bonus for the UK, although it was hard to know quite what he meant. A full-on free trade deal would be difficult to square with Labour’s commitment to aligning the UK more closely with the EU on agriproducts. Maybe Trump was referring to something more limited.</p> 
  <p>And on Ukraine, despite the efforts of both leaders to play down their differences, Starmer did not quite get the assurances about a US military “backstop” to a Ukraine peace deal that he is seeking (see<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-ukraine-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-67c0b8078f08f021a67bebbc#block-67c0b8078f08f021a67bebbc"> 8.06pm</a>.) Or at least he didn’t in public. This issue seems unresolved.</p> 
  <p>That is all from me for tonight. <strong>Léonie Chao-Fong</strong> is now taking over.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump refuses to give firm US military 'backstop' commitment to Ukraine peace deal, saying Putin will keep his word</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>During the exchanges in the Oval Office the most difficult topic for Keir Starmer was probably Russia. That is not because President Trump said anything intentionally critical of Britain (apart from an apparent joke about Britain not being able to fight off Russia on its own – see below). But he made it clear that his view of President Putin is miles away from Starmer’s, and he did not offer the robust security assurances, in relation to Ukraine, that Starmer is seeking.</p> 
  <p>Here are the main points Russia-related points that came out.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump suggested he was confident Putin could be expected to honour any peace agreement for Ukraine that he signed. </strong>Asked what he would do if Putin did not stick to the terms of a Ukraine deal, Trump replied:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think he’ll keep his word. I’ve spoken to him. I’ve known him for a long time now.</p> 
   <p>You know we had to go through the Russian hoax together [the claim that Russia colluded with Trump to rig the 2016 election]. That was not a good thing …</p> 
   <p>I’ve known him for a long time now, and I don’t believe he’s going to violate his word.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>But Starmer said it was important to get assurances that the peace would hold.</strong> He said:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>If there’s a deal in, we’ve got to make sure it’s a deal that lasts, that is not temporary, that lasts, and that’s why we need to make sure that it’s secure.</p> 
   <p>And we’ve leant in and said we’ll play our part, and we’ve talked and we will talk about how we work with yourself, Mr President, to ensure that this deal is something which is not violated because it’s very important, if there is a deal, we keep it.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Starmer also praised Trump for creating the conditions that led to peace talks. “I don’t think it would have happened if the space hadn’t been created by yourself,” he told Trump.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump said that Putin was someone he could trust. </strong>When it was put to him that he seemed to trust Putin, while Starmer did not, he replied:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I know a lot of people that you would say no chance that they would ever deceive you, and they are the worst people in the world.</p> 
   <p>I know others that you would guarantee they would deceive you, and you know what, they’re 100% honourable, so you never know what you’re getting.</p> 
   <p>No, I have confidence that if we make a deal, it’s going to hold.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump claimed he had a good relationship with both Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president.</strong></p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I have a very good relationship with President Putin. I think I have a very good relationship with President Zelenskyy.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump refused to commit to deploying US forces as a backstop to a European-led peacekeeping force. </strong>Asked if he would be willing to do this, in a way that might lead to them being in confrontation with Russian forces, Trump replied:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Well, there is a backstop thing, you know. First, you can have European countries because they’re right there. We’re very far away. We have an ocean between us.</p> 
   <p>But we want to make sure it works. I don’t know when you say backstop – you mean a backstop psychologically or militarily or what.</p> 
   <p>But we are a backstop, because we’ll be over there, we’ll be working in the country. [See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2025/feb/27/keir-starmer-donald-trump-white-house-ukraine-uk-politics-live-news?page=with%3Ablock-67c0b5748f08824e5d8ca6f3#block-67c0b5748f08824e5d8ca6f3">7pm</a>.]</p> 
   <p>So I just don’t think you’re going to have a problem.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Trump said the US would always “help” the British – but played down the prospect of the Americans provding a military backstop to a British or European force in Ukraine. </strong>Asked if America woulld help the British if their forces in Ukraine were attacked by Russia, he replied:</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You know, I’ve always found about the British, they don’t need much help. They can take care of themselves very well.</p> 
   <p>Now, it sounds like it’s evasive, but it’s not evasive.</p> 
   <p>You know, the British have been incredible soldiers, incredible military, and they can take care of themselves.</p> 
   <p>But if they need help, I’ll always be with the British, OK, I’ll always be with them, but they don’t need help.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> said the British had always done very well. But he said he also believed it was important for the two countries to be there “backing each other up”.</p> 
  <p>But then <strong>Trump</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Could you take on Russia by yourselves?</p>

  <p><strong>Starmer</strong> replied: “Well …”</p>

  <p>When it was put to him that he said yesterday the EU was constructed to “screw” the EU on trade, and when he was asked what Keir Starmer could say to him that would ensure that Britain did not face tariffs, Trump at first claimed not to have said that “bad word”.</p> 
  <p>He then launched into a long attack on the EU over trade policy, claiming that people thought it was “politically correct” to say the US’s trade relationship with the EU was good even thought it wasn’t. </p> 
  <p>Then, referring to the UK, he went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I can say that, we’re here for a different reason – we’re talking about a very different place. This is some place that I have investments there. I own Turnberry, I own Aberdeen, and I own a great place called Doonbeg in Ireland. So, I have a great warm spot for your country.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>At this point <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> interrupted, saying:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>And our trade, obviously, is fair and balanced and, in fact, you’ve got a bit of surplus. So, we’re in a different position there.</p> 
   <p>And obviously we contributed hugely in relation to Ukraine.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><strong>Trump</strong> then added: “It’s going to work out.”</p>

   <p>I can only say that it would be … pleasure to extend that invitation once again, in the hope that you … some stage be visiting Turnberry and a detour to a relatively near neighbour might not cause you too much inconvenience. An alternative might perhaps be for you to visit Balmoral …</p> 
   <p>There is much on both estates which I think you might find interesting, and enjoy – particularly as my foundation at Dumfries House provides hospitality skills-training for young people who often end up as staff on your own establishments!</p> 
   <p>Quite apart from this presenting an opportunity to discuss a wide range of issues of mutual interest, it would also offer a valuable chance to plan a historic second state visit to the United Kingdom.</p> 
   <p>As you will know this is unprecedented by a US president. That is why I would find it helpful for us to be able to discuss, together, a range of options for location and programme content.</p> 
   <p>In so doing, working together, I know we will further enhance the special relationship between our two countries of which we are both so proud.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump claims minerals deal could be seen as 'backstop' for Ukraine</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has claimed that his planned deal with Volodymyr Zelenskyy on minerals would effectively be a security “backstop”. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>President Zelenskyy is coming to see me on Friday morning. And we’re going be signing really a very important agreement for both sides because it’s really going to get us into that country, working there.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He added it was “a backstop, you could say”.</p> 
  <p>Trump is using the term because a “backstop” is the word that some Europeans have been using to describe the security guarantee they want from US to back up a European-led troop contingent, based in Ukraine, that could protect the country in the event of a peace deal.</p> 
  <p>But, although a minerals deal would notionally give the US some stake in Ukrainian stability, it is not the military backstop that Starmer and other European leaders want.

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer invites Trump to UK for a state visit</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Keir Starmer handed Donald Trump a letter from the king, the BBC is reporting. It’s an invitation for a state visit.</p> 
  <p>Trump has already had one state visit to the UK and there is no precedent for a head of state making a second one. But his first took place when the late queen was on the throne.</p> 
  <p>When Theresa May visited Trump in the White House after his first inauguration, beating all other leaders through the door, she also came armed with a state visit invitation. That was seen as a bit premature, given that Trump had only just taken office But Downing Street judged that this was a necessary lubricant to relations. Trump is a great fan of royalty, and particularly admired the queen.</p> 
  <p>UPDATE:</p> 
  <p>Here is the copy from the White House pool on what happened when Starmer gave the king’s letter to Trump (POTUS – president of the United States).</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>[Starmer] also brought a letter from King Charles. </p> 
   <p>POTUS: “Am I supposed to read it right now?”</p> 
   <p>POTUS opens it and calls Charles “a great great gentleman”</p> 
   <p>Says “well, that’s really nice” and displayed letter, calling Charles “a beautiful man and a wonderful man.”</p>

  <p>At a press gallery lunch today, <strong>Steve Reed</strong>, the environment secretary, said he did not think Keir Starmer should adopt this approach during his meeting with the president. Asked if Starmer should correct Trump in real time, Reed replied:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The question on Donald Trump, I don’t think it is for the prime minister on any visit to be factchecking, as you put it, his host … It’s for the British prime minister to advocate for the interest of the United Kingdom in a way that is most likely to secure the outcomes that we want.</p> 
   <p>So that is the approach the prime minister will be taking.</p> 
   <p>It’s not performative. It’s extremely serious about getting the outcomes that we need, whether that would be on trade, on security, or any other issue I’m sure that might come up during those kinds of meetings.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>I’m Andrew Sparrow, picking up the blog from Jane Clinton.</p> 
  <p>Keir Starmer is not the only prominent Briton in the US who might be meeting President Trump. According to Sky News, Andrew Tate and his brother Tristan, who have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c70wq044znxt">just arrived in Florida</a> despite facing charges in Romania for rape, people trafficking and money laundering (which they deny), hope that at some point they might get a meeting with the president. Andrew Tate, a “misogynist influencer” with a huge online following, has been a vocal Trump supporter.</p> 
  <p>The Liberal Democrats are urging Starmer to raise this case with Trump and urge him to ensure the brothers do not evade justice. <strong>Lisa Smart</strong>, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesperson, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Andrew Tate is accused of rape and trafficking children in the UK. Allowing the Tate brothers to hide from justice in Florida would be ignoring the rule of law and our extradition treaties.</p> 
   <p>An attempt by Trump to stand in the way of Britain’s justice system would be deeply wrong. The prime minister should raise this as a priority, and make clear that any interference in this way would be unacceptable.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Visa numbers for travel to UK down by third in 2024, figures show</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Nearly 935,000 <strong>visas</strong> were issued in 2024 to people coming to the <strong>UK</strong> for work, study or family reasons, or through one of the government’s settlement schemes, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-december-2024">according to new </a><strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-december-2024">Home Office </a></strong><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-december-2024">data.</a></p> 
  <p>The figure, which covers main applicants and dependants, is <strong>down by a third (33%) from just under 1.4 million in 2023.</strong></p> 
  <p>The fall has been driven by a steep drop in the number of people issued with work-related visas, which was down 40% from 613,627 in 2023 to 369,419 last year.</p> 
  <p>The number of study visas fell year-on-year by 31% from 604,253 to 419,312. By contrast, there was a small rise in family visas, up 7% from 80,083 to 86,049.</p> 
  <p>Among the resettlement categories, 19,346 visas were issued under the Ukraine schemes (down 52% year-on-year), 19,273 were granted to British National Overseas status holders from Hong Kong (down 32%), and 13,869 were under the EU Settlement Scheme (down 20%), PA Medis reports.</p> 
  <p>In addition, 3,864 were for dependants joining or accompanying others and 3,426 were under other settlement schemes.</p> 
  <p>The total number of visas issued across all these categories last year, 934,558, is down sharply from 1,393,079 in 2023.</p> 
  <p>It is also the lowest total for any 12-month period since the year to December 2021, when the figure stood at 858,766.</p> 
  <p>The drop is likely to reflect changes in legal migration rules introduced since January 2024 by the previous Conservative government, including a ban on overseas care workers and students bringing family dependants, and a steep rise in the salary threshold for skilled workers to £38,700.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The number of people offered safe and legal routes to the <strong>UK</strong> dropped by more than a fifth in a year, figures show.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>government</strong> said this was mainly down to a fall in the number of visa and extensions granted on the schemes set up in 2022 in the wake of <strong>Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</strong></p> 
  <p>A migrant help charity said changes to the schemes had made it “much harder” for Ukrainians to apply and called for more to be done “so that Ukrainians can bring all their loved ones to safety”.</p> 
  <p>The Ukraine Family Scheme, under which people were able to apply to live, work and study in the UK and access public funds for up to three years, closed under the Conservative government in February last year, PA Media reports. </p> 
  <p>The Ukraine Extension Scheme (UES), which had allowed people already in the UK to remain, closed to most people last May and fully earlier this month.</p> 
  <p>It was replaced by the Ukraine Permission Extension (UPE) scheme, allowing Ukrainians to extend their stay for a further 18 months.</p> 
  <p>There were 22,873 people offered visas or extensions under the Ukraine schemes last year, down 53% on 2023 (49,027 people).</p> 
  <p>Last year’s figure was less than a tenth of the 232,135 people offered visas or extensions on the Ukraine schemes in their first year of existence in 2022.</p> 
  <p>A total of 79,312 people were offered safe and legal routes to come to or stay in the UK in 2024.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Lawyers and <strong>human rights campaigners</strong> have warned of a “hostile environment” for Afghans in the UK who have fled the Taliban amid a sharp rise in the number having their <strong>asylum claims</strong> refused.</p> 
  <p>Quarterly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-december-2024">immigration statistics</a> released on Thursday showed that 2,000 Afghan asylum seekers had their claims refused in the last quarter, an increase from 48 in the same quarter of 2023. The grant rate for Afghan cases has gone down from 98.5% in the last quarter of 2023 to 36% in the last quarter of 2024.</p> 
  <p>However, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office">Home Office</a> has said it cannot send anyone back to Afghanistan, which has been ruled by the Taliban since 2021.</p> 
  <p>This means those whose cases are refused will be stuck in limbo, without the right to work or move on with their lives and at risk of destitution. </p> 
  <p>A recent internal Home Office document about returns to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan">Afghanistan</a> seen by the Guardian states: “Enforced or voluntary removals are currently paused and cannot be progressed at present. This is due to the Taliban informing the UK that they will no longer accept travel documents issued from the Afghan embassy in London.</p> 
  <p>“The UK government’s position is that they do not recognise the Taliban as an accepted foreign government. There is currently no timescale for when this will be resolved.”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The cut to the <strong>foreign aid budget</strong> announced this week will “cost lives and create chaos”, the last Labour first minister in <strong>Scotland</strong> has claimed.</p> 
  <p><strong>Lord Jack McConnell</strong> urged Number 10 to rethink the decision taken this week, which will see the international development budget cut from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3% in an effort to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP, PA Media reports.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/keir-starmer-must-re-think-decision-to-slash-foreign-aid-budget-says-former-scottish-first-minister_uk_67c06d18e4b01375e5ece4f3">an article for HuffPost</a>, <strong>McConnell</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I am not proud that the UK will finance that expansion of our national defence forces by reducing our investment in the lives and opportunities of the poorest people on the planet.</p> 
   <p>To do so without warning or a proper transition will cost lives and create chaos in fragile states that are already too vulnerable to the influence and money of the malign forces we seek to combat.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Schools will close, medical supplies will stop and economic programmes helping the least developed countries stand on their own feet will come to an end. It is bad in principle, but it is also bad strategically.</p> 
   <p>The focus on Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine does prioritise the most significant humanitarian emergencies of our time.</p> 
   <p>But UK withdrawal from everywhere else, and substantial cuts to multilateral programmes that generate billions more from donors and the private sector, will reduce our influence and soft power.</p>

  <p><strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> wants sovereignty not territory, a <strong>Conservative</strong> former leader has said, as he argued <strong>Donald Trump</strong> is making a “completely wrong judgement” if he thinks otherwise.</p> 
  <p>The Prime Minister should tell the <strong>US president</strong> that if they “fail” on<strong> Ukraine</strong>, the world will be vulnerable to totalitarian states, <strong>Iain Duncan Smith</strong> told the Commons, PA Media reports. </p> 
  <p>During a debate on Ukraine, Duncan Smith said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The idea that just meeting Putin’s demand for territory - that he may have got or not - at the moment somehow will appease him and will satisfy his requirements is, I think, a completely wrong judgement.</p> 
   <p>I noticed in a telephone call between President Trump and Putin this is what President Trump said was important. The truth is Putin is an ex-KGB man. Once KGB, always KGB.</p> 
   <p>He’s not interested in territory, he’s interested in sovereignty.</p>

  <p>He added: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What we have to get lined up in here is the real nature of what Putin wants, and it’s not territory, it’s sovereignty.</p> 
   <p>He wants to recreate and has always wanted to recreate the full borders of the old Soviet Union in a greater Russia, we know that. And Ukraine isn’t about 20% of their territory, for him it’s all of Ukraine.</p> 
   <p>So you have a peace deal which isn’t stable, he will be back.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Rough sleeping in England in late 2024 up 20% on figure for previous year, survey says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Rough sleeping in England has risen by a fifth in a year, according to new snapshot estimates branded “devastating and shameful”, PA Media reports. PA says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There were an estimated 4,667 people sleeping on the streets on a single night in autumn last year, according to<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dashboards-on-rough-sleeping"> annual government statistics</a>.</p> 
   <p>This was an increase of 769 people – or 20% – on the previous year’s snapshot estimate of 3,898.</p> 
   <p>The latest figure is more than twice the number since the estimates – the latest of which are based on a single date in October or November chosen by local authorities – began being recorded in 2010, when it was 1,768.</p> 
   <p>While the latest figure remains just below the peak in 2017- when it stood at 4,751 – it is the third year in a row the number has risen.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Commenting on the figures, Rick Henderson, CEO of <strong>Homeless Link</strong>, which represents homelessness charities, said <a href="https://homeless.org.uk/news/devastating-rough-sleeping-must-end-here-says-homeless-link/">in a statement</a>:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is beyond devastating and shameful that our society has allowed thousands upon thousands of people to face the trauma of sleeping rough across this country. In recent memory we almost halved rough sleeping (from its 2017 peak). We know what works and yet once again the situation is getting worse every year. More and more lives are being irreparably damaged, failed by the systems that meant to support them.</p> 
   <p>We can see the causes of homelessness wherever we look. A welfare system unfit for purpose, an acute shortage of truly affordable housing, extremely over-stretched homelessness, health and social care services and a disconnect between government policies – from hospitals and prisons discharging people onto the streets to people leaving the asylum system with nowhere to live.</p> 
   <p>This must end here. The Labour government must do what its predecessor failed to – to put the right funding and support in place to prevent and end homelessness for good.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>And Josh Nicholson, senior researcher at the <strong>Centre for Social Justice</strong> (CSJ), a centre-right social justice thinktank, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The progress made towards ending rough sleeping during the pandemic has been squandered. Today’s figures point to a tidal wave of need among Britain’s rough sleepers.<br><br>This is why the CSJ has today launched a campaign calling on the government to roll out a proven solution to ending rough sleeping, <a href="https://www.housing.org.uk/our-work/homelessness/housing-first/">Housing First</a>. Housing First provides ordinary settled housing alongside intensive, person-centred support for people whose homelessness is compounded by multiple and complex support needs. Housing is offered without conditions other than an individual’s willingness to maintain a tenancy. This contrasts to the traditional approach which requires people to prove their ‘tenancy readiness’ before accessing mainstream housing.</p>

  <p>None of this is very new, but the news that the White House is “very pleased” about the increase in UK defence spending (as opposed to just being “pleased” with the commitment about troops for Ukraine) is noteworthy.

   <p>An estimated 14.4% of young men and 12.3% of young women were NEET, said the ONS.</p>

  <p>Here are some more voices saying the decision is wrong.</p> 
  <p>From the Green MP <strong>Siân Berry</strong></p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The Labour government is trashing its climate credentials one absurd decision at a time. Only one day after receiving critical advice from its own climate advisors on the need to lower flying demand, ministers decide to support yet more unnecessary expansion for the benefit of wealthy investors.</p> 
   <p>Pushing through these damaging plans shows such poor economic judgement. Over 100,000 extra flights a year won’t deliver for our communities. Labour should listen to the public who think airport expansion is the wrong priority. Most of us fly once a year if at all and would rather see cheaper train tickets and more bus routes instead to help with our daily journeys and create jobs where we live, in contrast with frequent flyers leaching money out of the economy. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>From Alex Chapman, an economist at the <strong>New Economics Foundation</strong>, a leftwing thinktank</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Growing Gatwick will not magic up the economic growth the government so desperately wants. Business air travel has collapsed while expansion will see three times as many tourists leave the country as come in.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Voters living outside London and the south east will not thank the government for this decision. Expanding airports like Gatwick doesn’t create new jobs - it displaces jobs from the wider UK regions, and particularly the domestic tourism industry which is a key source of spending outside London and the south east.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>From Hannah Lawrence, a spokesperson at <strong>Stay Grounded</strong>, a network representing groups campaigning to reduce air travel</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Encouraging Gatwick’s expansion in the middle of a climate crisis is irresponsible. Allowing such a polluting industry to expand in the name of supposed ‘economic growth’ would actually create further inequality, suffering and a lack of prosperity in years to come. All while those who have never set foot on a plane suffer the worst consequences.</p> 
   <p>There is no such thing as green flying which is why we need an immediate end to airport expansion and an urgent reduction in the number of flights that take off each day.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>For a government focused on clean economic growth, there are plenty of projects they can support that will achieve their goals, but airport expansion is not one of them. Were the government to approve expansion of both Gatwick and Luton airports, emissions would increase to such an extent that all the CO2 savings that the government hopes to achieve from its Clean Power Plan would be wiped out by 2050.<br></em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>More than 108,000 people applied for asylum in the UK last year – the highest number for any 12-month period since current records began in 2001, PA Media reports. PA says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The total of 108,138 asylum seekers is up 18% from 91,811 in 2023, according to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-december-2024">data</a> published by the <strong>Home Office.</strong></p> 
   <p>The previous record was 103,081 in the 12 months to December 2002.</p> 
   <p>Migrants who made the journey to the UK across the Channel in small boats accounted for 32% of the total in 2024.</p> 
   <p>The data shows 38,079 asylum seekers were being housed temporarily in hotels at the end of December, up 2,428 from 35,651 at the end of September.</p> 
   <p>This is the second quarterly rise in a row, although the figure is still some way below the recent peak of 56,042 at the end of September 2023.</p> 
   <p>Asylum seekers and their families are housed in temporary accommodation if they are waiting for the outcome of a claim or an appeal and have been assessed as not being able to support themselves independently.</p> 
   <p>They are housed in hotels if there is not enough space in accommodation provided by local authorities or other organisations.</p> 
   <p>The rise comes as the government plans to close nine more asylum hotels by the end of March.</p> 
   <p>Responding to the figures, Marley Morris, from the <strong>Institute for Public Policy Research</strong> think tank, said: “If the Home Office wants to end the use of hotels, it will need to double down on efforts to improve the speed and quality of decision-making. Applications should be triaged early and decisions for high-grant nationalities should be streamlined. Crucially, the government must take care that its efforts to accelerate decision-making do not result in these cases simply shifting over into appeals.”</p> 
   <p>There were 124,802 people waiting for an initial decision on an asylum application at the end of December – down 6% from 133,409 at the end of September.</p> 
   <p>The total peaked at 175,457 at the end of June 2023, which was the highest figure since current records began in 2010.</p> 
   <p>The number of people waiting more than six months for an initial decision was 73,866 at the end of December, down from 83,888 at the end of September and well below the recent peak of 139,961 in June 2023.</p> 
   <p>The data also shows that the most common nationality among asylum applicants in 2024 was Pakistani, accounting for 10,542 people or 9.7% of the total.</p> 
   <p>Afghan was the second most common nationality (8,508 people, 7.9% of the total), down from 9,710 (10.6%) in 2023, when it was the most common.</p> 
   <p>Along with Pakistan, the largest increase in asylum claims in 2024 came from Vietnamese nationals, at 5,259 (4.9% of the total), up from 2,469 (2.7%) in 2023.</p>

   <p>The reason for that is because we have a shared military and intelligence interest with the United States, and of course they’ve got to be happy with the deal, or there is no deal.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The government says the deal is necessary because otherwise there there is a risk that an international court will soon issue a binding ruling saying the islands belong to Mauritius. This would make it harder for the UK to maintain its joint airbase with the US on Diego Garcia, the main island in the Chagos archipelago.</p> 
  <p>But the Conservative party, and some American rightwingers, argue that the deal costs too much (it will reportedly involve the UK paying Mauritius £90m a year for the lease on Diego Garcia) and that the UK should just stay put and face down attempts to contest sovereignty.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Starmer says he wants UK and US to have 'new partnership'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Keir Starmer</strong> also spoke at the reception at the ambassador’s residence last night, and he used his speech to suggest that the Labour government and the Trump administration have more in common than people might assume.</p> 
  <p>Referring to Elon Musk, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/23/cpac-elon-musk">his recent appearance </a>alongside the Argentinian president Javier Milei and a chainsaw, Starmer said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>My message is really simple, that there is no more important relationship for the United Kingdom [than the US], in defence, in security, in trade, in tech, in finance, and so much more.</p> 
   <p>So we want to strike a new partnership. We share the view that our best days lie ahead.</p> 
   <p>And you know, taking out a chainsaw isn’t quite my style. But we are stripping away red tape and bureaucracy.</p> 
   <p>We are reforming permitting [planning rules], getting things built, reducing barriers to investment and growth. And we’re open for business, open for investment, and we’re determined to help US innovators thrive in the United Kingdom.</p> 
   <p>So my message is we want to work with you, we want to welcome you to Britain, we want a new partnership, because our history shows that when we work together, great things happen.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Starmer also cracked a joke about Peter Mandelson. Starmer said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’ve only just arrived but already I can feel there’s real buzz around Washington right now. You can sense that there’s a new leader. He’s a true one-off, a pioneer in business, in politics. Many people love him. Others love to hate him. But to us, he’ s just … Peter.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump will be 'very consequential president', Mandelson says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Keir Starmer attended a reception at the British embassy in Washington last night, where <strong>Peter Mandelson,</strong> the new UK ambassador, predicted that Donald Trump would be a “very consequential president”.</p> 
  <p>In his speech, Mandelson this was a “very significant moment for our lives, between our two countries and indeed for all the freedom-loving democracies in the world”. He told his guests:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The US and the United Kingdom, we basically share everything together.</p> 
   <p>We share people, we share cultures, we share a lot of intelligence, we share technologies, and … we also share some of the fighting of our adversaries as well.</p> 
   <p>And of course one thing we don’t need to fight over is trade, because we have this fantastically fair and balanced trade relationship when we reciprocate so much – that’s just a little thing for you to remember in the coming weeks.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Trump has not yet said whether or not the UK will be exempt from the tariffs he says he will impose on the rest of Europe, and the UK government is arguing that its exports should be tariff-free because trade between the two countries is broadly balanced.</p> 
  <p>Referring to Trump, Mandelson also said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>You have a leader in this country in the president who in my view is going to be a very consequential president for this country indeed.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Mandelson intended his American guests to take that as a compliment. But even Trump’s fiercest critics probably would not quibble with Mandelson’s description.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Donald Trump says US won't give Ukraine security guarantee 'beyond very much' ahead of meeting with Keir Starmer</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Good morning. Keir Starmer is in Washington where later today he will have his first meeting with President Trump since the inauguration. With Trump aligning with Moscow even more explicitly than he did during his first administration, and threatening to wind down the Nato guarantees that have underpinned the security of western Europe since the second world war, the stakes could not be higher. Starmer, despite leading a party whose activists mostly loathe Trump and everything he represents, has managed to establish a warm relationship with the president and today will give some clues as to what extent he can sustain that, and protect the UK from the tariff warfare that Trump is threatening to unleash on the EU. But Starmer is one of three European leaders in Washington this week (Emmanuel Macron was there on Monday, Volodymyr Zelenskyy is there tomorrow) and today’s meeting is also part of a wider story about the fracturing of the US/Europe alliance. It is definitely in trouble; what is not yet clear is whether after four years of Trump it will still be fully functional.</p> 
  <p>Starmer spoke to reporters on his flight to the US yesterday. <strong>Pippa Crerar,</strong> the Guardian’s political editor, was on the plane and, as she reports, Starmer said he wants Trump to agree that, in the event of a peace settlement in Ukraine, the US will offer security guarantees that will make it durable. The PM has already said that Britain would contribute troops to a European so-called “tripwire” peace-keeping force, there to defend Ukraine and deter Russia. But European soldiers would need US air and logistical support to be effective, and Starmer is looking for assurances that Washington will provide this level of support.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>But the backdrop is not promising. As Starmer was flying across the Atlantic, Trump was holding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/trump-cabinet-elon-musk">a televised cabinet meeting</a> where, Soviet-style, his ministers laughed heartily at his jokes as they all congratulated each other on how brilliantly they were doing. In the course of the meeting, on the subject of Ukraine, <strong>Trump</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m not going to make security guarantees beyond very much. We’re going to have Europe do that.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Starmer is due to arrive at the White House shortly after 5pm UK time and the press conference is meant to start at 7pm. We will, of course, be covering it live. It should be fascinating. During Trump’s first term, Theresa May managed to get the first foreign leader invite to the White House and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-and-theresa-may-hold-joint-white-house-press-conference-politics-live?filterKeyEvents=false&amp;page=with%3Ablock-588baa30e4b0860ce556955e#block-588baa30e4b0860ce556955e">her visit</a>, during which she offered the president a state visit, was deemed a success. But it did not stop Trump treating her very badly later during the presidency, regularly patronising her when they spoke in private, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/13/donald-trump-sun-diplomacy-theresa-may-insults">sometimes in public</a> too, and openly suggesting at one point that Boris Johnson would make a better replacement.</p> 
  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> 
  <p><em>9.30am:</em> The Home Office publishes its latest asylum, resettlement and returns figures.</p> 
  <p><em>9.30am:</em> Lisa Nandy, the culture secretary, takes questions in the Commons.</p> 
  <p><em>After 10.30am:</em> Lucy Powell, the leader of the Commons, makes a statement to MPs about next week’s parliamentary business.</p> 
  <p><em>11.30am:</em> Downing Street holds a lobby briefing.</p> 
  <p><em>Around 5.15pm (UK time):</em> Keir Starmer is due to arrive at the White House for his meeting with President Trump.</p> 
  <p><em>Around 7pm (UK time):</em> Starmer and Trump are due to hold a press conference.</p> 
  <p>And at some point today Heidi Alexander, the transport secretary, is expected to announce that she is approving a decision to expand Gatwick.</p>
