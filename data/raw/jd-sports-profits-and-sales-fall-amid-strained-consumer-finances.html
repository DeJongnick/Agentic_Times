<p>JD Sports has said consumers’ wallets are “strained” as sales struggled on either side of the Atlantic and the retailer reported a fall in profits.</p> <p>The company, which sells a range of sports brands including Nike and Adidas, reported a 13.5% fall in adjusted profits to £351m in the six months to 2 August and warned that annual comparable sales will be down compared with its last financial year.</p> <p>JD Sports Fashion posted falls in sales at established stores across all geographical regions. North America – its biggest market accounting for 39% of its £5.94bn sales in the first half – was the worst hit, dropping 3.8%.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/23/b-and-q-owner-profits-kitchens-kingfisher-uk">B&amp;Q owner lifts profit forecast amid strong demand for kitchens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second biggest fall in sales was in the UK, down 3.3% to £1.46bn, where overall there was a net reduction of 13 stores as JD Sports seeks to improve locations and optimise shop sizes.</p> <p>In June the company opened a new flagship store at the Trafford Centre in Manchester, the largest of the 4,872 stores it operates under all brands globally.</p> <p>Asia Pacific and Europe also suffered falls as overall JD Sports reported a 2.5% decline in comparable sales in the first half of it financial year.</p> <p>“In an environment of strained consumer finances and evolving brand product cycles, operating and financial discipline remains a core focus for JD,” said Régis Schultz, the chief executive of JD Sports. “We are controlling our costs and cash well.”</p> <p>Schultz added that the company expected a “limited impact” from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">tariffs imposed by Donald Trump</a>, with “direct exposure” accounting for less than 10% of its sales in the US.</p> <p>However, JD Sports – which also owns the Finish Line brand in the US and Sport Zone and Sprinter in mainland Europe – added that the limited impact was in part a result of buying stock before tariffs came into force.</p> <p>“Looking further ahead, uncertainty remains over broader tariff impacts as well as US consumer sentiment,” it said.</p> <p>Schulz would not comment on the performance of specific brands that JD sells but said there had been a clear change in fashion trends.</p> <p>“We have observed a shift in terms of the mix of footwear sales,” he said. “The last four years have been dominated by retro basketball, and that trend is finishing. We see growth coming from the running sector and smaller brands.”</p> <p>He does not expect the UK budget in November to affect the buying habits of its largely young consumer customer base.</p> <p>“The customer doesn’t care about the date; they care about the right product,” he said. “The level of uncertainty in the market [generally] is high, and that impacts the consumer, but we are not seeing a big difference between markets.”</p> <p>However, he added that it was important that the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s budget “doesn’t increase the cost of labour”.</p> <p>Garry White, the chief investment commentator at Charles Stanley, said: “It’s going to be a tricky second half at JD Sports Fashion. Consumers are cautious – especially in the UK.</p> <p>“To add to sticky inflation and a slowing economy, British consumers face the unknown of Rachel Reeves’s looming budget, where tax rises look a certainty. Positively, management expects limited impact from Donald Trump’s tariffs this financial year, but it does not expect no impact.”</p> <p>The company said operating costs rose by a fifth from £1.9bn to £2.4bn year on year in the first half. It expects to make £30m in cost savings and efficiencies this financial year.</p> <p>Overall, JD reported a 20% increase in sales year on year. However, this was because of the acquisition of Hibbett in the US and Courir in France.</p> <p>The tough trading environment has resulted in JD Sport’s share price falling by just over 40% over the past year.</p>
