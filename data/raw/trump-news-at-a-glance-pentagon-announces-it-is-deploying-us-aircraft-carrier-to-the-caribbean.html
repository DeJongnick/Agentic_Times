<p>The Pentagon said on Friday that it was deploying the United States’ most advanced aircraft carrier to the Caribbean, a serious escalation in the Trump administration’s war against drug cartels that provides the resources to start conducting strikes against targets on the ground.</p> <p>The move will bring the USS Gerald Ford carrier, with dozens of stealth fighter jets and surveillance aircraft, in addition to other warships that accompany the carrier, to the coast of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a> as the carrier nears the end of its deployment in the Mediterranean.</p> <p>Sending the carrier strike group to the Caribbean is the clearest sign to date that the administration intends to dramatically expand the scope of its lethal military campaign from hitting small boats alleged to be carrying drugs bound for the US to targets on land.</p>  <h2>Pentagon deploys top aircraft carrier as Trump militarisation of Caribbean ratchets up</h2>  <p>The carrier strike group has dozens of F35 fighter jets, increasing the firepower and ability of the US to hit air-defense systems in Venezuela. That would clear the way for US special operations or drones to destroy land-based targets, current and former officials said.</p> <p>The expanded naval presence “will bolster US capacity to detect, monitor, and disrupt illicit actors and activities that compromise the safety and prosperity of the United States homeland and our security in the western hemisphere,” Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/trump-caribbean-uss-gerald-ford-carrier"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US and Canada spar over ad of Reagan denouncing tariffs that led to derailed trade talks</h2>  <p>The latest breakdown in relations between the US and Canada appears to stem from a one-minute television advertisement featuring former US president Ronald Reagan declaring “trade barriers hurt every American worker”.</p> <p>Canadian prime minister Mark Carney says he is ready to resume trade talks with the US. However, Ontario premier Doug Ford – whose provincial government ran the ad earlier in the week – says it will run again during the first game of the World Series Friday night.
