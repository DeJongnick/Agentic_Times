<p>A children’s literature professor at Texas A&amp;M <a href="https://www.kbtx.com/2025/09/09/am-dean-professor-removed-following-student-complaints-over-curriculum/">was fired</a> on Tuesday after a video showing a student objecting to course material about gender identity and sexuality went viral.</p> <p>The dean of the school’s college of arts and science and the head of department were also removed from their roles, the university president, Mark Welsh III, said in a statement.</p> <p>The <a href="https://x.com/brianeharrison/status/1965093848520294565">undated video</a> does not show the professor or the student involved.</p> <p>“I’m not sure this is legal to be teaching,” the student says. “According to our president, there’s only two genders and he said he would be freezing agencies’ funding programs that promote gender ideology. And this also very much goes against not only myself but a lot of people’s religious beliefs.”</p> <p>Welsh said he had first learned of potential problems with the course over the summer and “made changes to ensure this course content does not continue in future semesters”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/19/univeristy-texas-austin-lawsuit-affirmative-action">Judge throws out rightwing affirmative action lawsuit against Texas university</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I made it clear to our academic leadership that course content must match catalog descriptions for each and every one of our course sections,” he wrote <a href="https://president.tamu.edu/messages/an-update-from-president-mark-a-welsh-iii.html">in a letter</a> to faculty and students on Tuesday. “I learned late yesterday that despite that directive, the college continued to teach content that was inconsistent with the published course description for another course this fall.”</p> <p>The firing of the professor, whom university officials have identified as Melissa McCoul, comes shortly after Welsh <a href="https://x.com/brianeharrison/status/1965093859488399406">appeared in another video </a>in which he told the student that firing the professor was “not happening”, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/09/08/texas-am-video-professor-student-gender-identity-content/">according to the Texas Tribune</a>.</p> <p>“It is unacceptable for A&amp;M system faculty to push a political agenda,” Glenn Hegar, the school’s chancellor, said in a statement. “Early investigations appear to indicate this course failed to comply with clear instructions to align course descriptions with course materials.”</p> <p>Texas A&amp;M <a href="https://thebatt.com/news/dean-of-college-of-arts-and-sciences-department-head-removed-after-viral-video/">passed an audit </a>earlier this year to ensure that the school complies with a new <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/SB00017F.htm">state law</a> banning DEI in public universities, according to the Battalion, the student newspaper.</p> <p>The videos prompted enormous pressure on the school from Republican politicians and officials. Brian Harrison, a Republican state lawmaker, posted the clips as well as what he said was <a href="https://x.com/brianeharrison/status/1965093864412504194">material</a> from the class and <a href="https://x.com/brianeharrison/status/1965093851531444722">asked</a> Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, to intervene to get the professor fired. He also asked the Trump <a href="https://x.com/brianeharrison/status/1965093854974988706">administration to intervene</a>. The post was amplified by Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the justice department’s civil rights division.</p> <p>Abbott called for McCoul’s firing and cheered the removals on X. “The professor has now been fired,” <a href="https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1965574408556400983">he posted </a>on Tuesday.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 10 September 2025 to correct Melissa McCoul’s surname.</p>
