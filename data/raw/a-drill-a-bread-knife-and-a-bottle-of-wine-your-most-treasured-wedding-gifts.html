<p>What makes a great <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/jul/17/best-wedding-gift-ideas-couples-uk">wedding gift</a>? Does it need to be extravagant to be memorable? Or is it the sentimental presents that stand the test of time? To find out, we asked readers to share the best gifts from their big day – or one they had given that was well received. </p> <p>For many, it was the sentimental gifts you treasured most. One reader told us a friend had made their wedding cake. “The cake is long gone, but the icing decorations are still in a Tupperware box,” they said. For <strong>Lauren Alergant</strong>, it was a hand-designed card displaying her and her partner’s names and their wedding date: “We framed it and it has pride of place on our mantelpiece,” she said. <strong>Margaret </strong>sent us a picture of the slender blue vase that still reminds her of the friend who gave it to her 63 years ago.</p> <p>Practical, everyday wedding gifts were another hit with you. <strong>Mark Sadler</strong> told us about the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.halfords.com%2Ftools%2Fpower-tools-and-accessories%2Fpower-tools%2F%3Fprefn1%3Dtype%26prefv1%3DDrills&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Faug%2F08%2Fa-drill-a-bread-knife-and-a-bottle-of-wine-your-most-treasured-wedding-gifts">electric drill</a> he is still using 39 years later. Similarly, <strong>Andrew </strong>and <strong>Jane</strong> said the most memorable gift from their wedding 46 years ago was a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Frobert-welch-signature-stainless-steel-bread-knife-22cm%2Fp230486489&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Faug%2F08%2Fyour-most-treasured-wedding-gifts">bread knife</a> they still use daily. <strong>Alison</strong> shared how much use she had got out of the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_nkw%3Delna%2Blotus%2Bsewing%2Bmachine%26_sacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp2540003.m570.l1311&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Faug%2F08%2Fa-drill-a-bread-knife-and-a-bottle-of-wine-your-most-treasured-wedding-gifts">Elna Lotus sewing machine</a> she was given. “We’ve made clothes for the children, curtains and soft furnishings for four houses, gifts for other people and items to sell for charity,” she said.</p> <p>A few readers mentioned the gifts they’d given. <strong>Sarah </strong>told us about the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=114047X1572903&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Fshop%2FBarkAndBirch&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fthefilter%2F2025%2Faug%2F08%2Fa-drill-a-bread-knife-and-a-bottle-of-wine-your-most-treasured-wedding-gifts">chopping board</a> she had given to her son and his wife. “It was made from upcycled olive wood. They got engaged while travelling the Greek islands, and the pattern of the grain looked exactly like a group of islands in the Med,” she said.</p> <p><strong>Ellen Fenton</strong> said her go-to gift is “three bottles of wine chosen with advice from a specialist: one to drink on the first anniversary, one for the fifth and one for the tenth”. The proof is in the pudding, she said: “Three different couples have messaged on various anniversaries to thank us for the wine. And if they break up, one of them can drink the wine to drown their sorrows!” she joked.</p> <p>***</p> <h2><strong>This week’s picks</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/10/summer-cycling-essentials">‘Your nether regions will know if you’ve skimped’: 16 summer cycling essentials</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/08/summer-beauty-essentials-hot-weather-make-up">Summer beauty saviours: the best skincare, makeup and body products for hot weather</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/09/best-supermarket-frozen-fruit-smoothie-mixes-tom-hunt">‘Whizzes up to a vibrant, candyfloss pink’: the best supermarket frozen fruit smoothie mixes</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/07/best-uk-vineyards-wine">The best UK vineyards to visit this summer – and what to drink at them</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/aug/03/millbrook-wool-luxury-4000-mattress-review">Can the Millbrook Wool Luxury 4000 mattress really keep you cool at night?
