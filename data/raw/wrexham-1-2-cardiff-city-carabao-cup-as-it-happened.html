But Cardiff were so superior in the first period, it’s hard to argue that they don’t deserve their victory on balance, even if the final possession stat was exactly 50-50 and the xG wasn’t quite as lopsided as one might imagine: 1.27-1.88. Thing is, the Bluebirds could very easily have been out of sight by the break, and only a woodwork-bothering mix of profligacy and bad luck kept their score down. Omari Kellyman was particularly impressive during that first half; Cardiff would have surely won easier had he not gone off. They go onto the quarters, while Wrexham must take solace from their second-half performance, and the fact they’re still one division above their Welsh rivals.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-69013c0d8f088d0f8172816c" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-28T21:59:06.527Z">9.59pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>In the meantime, Fulham have beaten Wycombe Wanderers 5-4 on penalties, and join both Cardiff and their west-London pals Brentford in the quarter-finals.</strong> Here are tonight’s results …</p> <ul> <li><p>Grimsby Town 0-5 Brentford</p></li> <li><p>Wrexham 1-2 Cardiff City</p></li> <li><p>Wycombe Wanderers 1-1 Fulham (4-5 pens)</p></li> </ul> <p>… and here’s the card for tomorrow night.

Still, it could have been worse: while Cardiff were battling on the big stage for glamorous bits of silverware, that same season, 2011-12, saw Wrexham fail to extricate themselves from the Conference National for the fourth season in a row.</p> <p><strong>How times change.</strong> Wrexham required another 11 seasons, and a large sprinkle of Hollywood stardust, to regain their Football League status, but having done so, look at them now. They’re currently mid-table in the Championship, ten places and one division above Cardiff, who got themselves relegated last season while Wrexham were heading the other way. So it’s a big status switcheroo, and tonight it’s the Dragons who get the bookies’ nod over their Welsh rivals. Times change all right.</p> <p><strong>Having said all that, there’s unlikely to be too much in it.</strong> Neither team are in the greatest form right now. Wrexham have only lost one of their last six matches, but they’ve only won one too; Cardiff, after a blistering start to their promotion campaign, have lost three of their last five. And yet the feelgood vibes are still strong at both clubs. Throw in the fact these two haven’t met since a Welsh Cup semi-final in 2004 and last met in the league in March 2002 – Wrexham won the cup game, Cardiff the one in the league – and this is poised beautifully. <strong>Kick-off is at 8pm GMT.</strong> It’s on! </p> </div>   </div>
