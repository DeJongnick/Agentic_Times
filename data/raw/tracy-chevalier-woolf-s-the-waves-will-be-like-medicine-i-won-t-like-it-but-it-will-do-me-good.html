<p><strong>My earliest reading memory<br></strong>My parents read me most of the Dr Seuss books. My favourite was Ten Apples Up on Top, about a lion, a tiger and a dog counting apples. I can still conjure up the illustrations, including the last one where there’s an explosion of apples all over the page.</p> <p><strong>My favourite book growing up<br></strong>The Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I was riveted by her descriptions of pioneer life and all the how-to information: how to build a log cabin, plough a field, make a ball out of a pig’s bladder. I suspect those books affected my approach to my own writing of historical fiction. Also I related to Laura’s bad-tempered rebelliousness compared with her perfect sister Mary.</p> <p><strong>The book that changed me as a teenager<br></strong>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers. It was the first book I read as a teenager where I thought, “I am reading about the world, and it is a strange, hard place that needs fixing.”</p> <p><strong>The writer who changed my mind<br></strong>Toni Morrison, with Song of Solomon, when I was 20. It combines gritty realism with magic realism in a way I hadn’t thought possible. I still remember how I imagined the opening scene, where a man jumps from a building wearing blue silk wings; it was so visual and vivid, it was like Morrison had placed a camera in my head.</p> <p><strong>The book that made me want to be a writer<br></strong>Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant by Anne Tyler. I read it when I was still at university. After so much studying the classics as a literature student, it was a relief to read about this Baltimore family and be reminded that profundity can emerge from domestic detail. I didn’t have to be like Dickens or Shakespeare – I could be like Tyler.</p> <p><strong>The book </strong><strong>I came back to<br></strong>Many years ago I read all of Virginia Woolf’s novels in order. I did fine until I reached The Waves, when its experimental stream of consciousness defeated me. I have been bracing myself to try again, as I feel I should be more open to different forms of writing. I can’t help feeling it will be like taking medicine – I won’t like it, but it will do me good.</p> <p><strong>The book I reread<br></strong>I don’t reread books. There are so many books in the world and so few reading slots left in my life that it seems wasteful to use one on a book I’ve already read. Having said that, I would be curious to reread Anna Karenina and The Portrait of a Lady; I read both when I was in my early 20s, and suspect I’d respond to them very differently now.</p> <p><strong>The book I could never read again<br></strong>I loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy as a teenager, and have no intention of ever ruining that magical experience by rereading it.</p> <p><strong>The book I discovered later in life<br></strong>Dorothy Whipple’s They Were Sisters, about three sisters trying to deal with one’s abusive husband. Written in the 1940s, it has a surprisingly modern feel about it. It’s so good I’m now on a Whipple kick, with the help of Persephone Books, which has republished most of her work.</p> <p><strong>The book I am currently reading<br></strong>Cuddy by Benjamin Myers. My next novel is set in Northumberland and I wanted to read his take on Saint Cuthbert, patron saint of the north-east.</p> <p><strong>My comfort read<br></strong>During pandemic lockdowns I found reading books set in the earlier 20th century were the most comforting, perhaps because they seemed a long way from our reality. What helped the most: The Enchanted April by Elizabeth von Arnim, The Fortnight in September by RC Sherriff, The Feast by Margaret Kennedy, I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith.</p> <p>• The Glassmaker by Tracy Chevalier is published by Borough Press.
