Nearly every billboard advertises an AI related product: “We’ve Automated 2,412 BDRs.” “All that AI and still no ROI?” “Cheap on-demand GPU clusters.” It’s hard to know if you’re interpreting the industry jargon correctly while zooming past in your vehicle.</p> <p>The signs are just one example of the tech industry’s en-masse pivot to AI, a technology that the executives who have the most to gain from it say will be universe-shifting, inevitable and unavoidable. In California’s tech heartland, every company is now an AI company, just like every company became a tech company sometime in the 2010s.</p> <p>But just beneath the surface of the breathless promotion of every startup’s AI prowess, cracks are beginning to appear. Some of AI’s biggest boosters, such as OpenAI’s Sam Altman, have warned that investors are overvaluing the potential returns on AI. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said at a private dinner with reporters. “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/759965/sam-altman-openai-ai-bubble-interview\">My opinion is yes.</a>”</p> <p>Altman’s statements coincided with a concession that OpenAI <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt5-launch-data-centers-investments/\">botched the roll-out</a> of the latest ChatGPT model – which he <a href=\"https://futurism.com/disastrous-gpt-5-sam-altman-hyping-up-gpt-6\">once promised</a> would be a significant improvement over the current GPT 4.5 model.</p> <p>Sure, Altman’s comments may have been geared at getting investors to consider not investing in his competitors. But there are other signs. Just this past week, a new study from MIT found that 95% of generative AI projects have <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/\">delivered little to no growth in revenue</a>. And tech stocks of companies with huge AI pushes tumbled this week: Palantir saw a 9% drop in shares, Oracle saw a 5.8% drop, chipmaker Nvidia fell 3.5% and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices as well as semiconductor designer Arm each saw 5% or more drop in shares. Not even the possibility of lower interest rates, which <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/stocks/tech-stocks-magnificent-seven-losing-steam-e948af4d?mod=hp_lead_pos1\">buoyed stocks in other sectors</a> last week, was enough to turn around tech’s market slide.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Just beneath the breathless promotion of AI, cracks are beginning to appear</p> </blockquote> <p>Even Meta, which had been reportedly spending billions to recruit the top AI talent, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-ai-hiring-freeze-fda6b3c4?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAgpOxxs8vMjkPbLVa21L8QvX6GPCDkDg27Ycg18_GJrIRv_lnxrLi51RXm6UFs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68a8d77b&amp;gaa_sig=TQSTt_34WFXNIwxp_2VMF9yMnm0-q3r07mZYVF5HLqKt0r-0TIhfWkMH9bRmtZiyvhPNNL0XJAW5N4liNCKKYA%3D%3D\">announced an AI hiring freeze</a>. Meta sought to downplay the news, with the company’s chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, posting on X last week: “We are truly only investing more and more into Meta Superintelligence Labs as a company. Any reporting to the contrary of that is clearly mistaken.”</p> <p>The sudden AI cooling-off period comes just a week after many of these companies reported largely stellar earnings despite upping their expectation for how many billions they plan to spend on building out their AI capacity over the next few months and years. At the same dinner with reporters, Altman said he expected OpenAI to spend “trillions” on datacenter expansion in the “not very distant future”, according to the Verge.</p> <p>While the latest round of AI jitters is being framed as a sign that the AI hype bubble may soon burst, it’s perhaps more of a needed market correction – a reality check for investors who can’t see outside of the Silicon Valley echo chamber. Even the former Google CEO Eric Schmidt warns that some of the laser focus on achieving artificial general intelligence – or the idea that AI could at some point match or surpass human intelligence – is misguided.</p> <p>“It is uncertain how soon artificial general intelligence can be achieved,” reads a column Schmidt co-wrote with China and AI policy lead Selina Xu. “We worry that Silicon Valley has grown so enamored with accomplishing this goal that it’s alienating the general public and, worse, bypassing crucial opportunities to use the technology that already exists.” Schmidt and Xu spend much of the rest of the column boosting the benefits and milestones AI has already met but raising concerns about how the build-at-all-costs strategy Silicon Valley is taking in pursuit of a super-intelligent AI is not reflective of the reality for the general public.</p> <p>“There’s a widening schism between the technologists who feel the A.G.I. – a mantra for believers who see themselves on the cusp of the technology – and members of the general public who are skeptical about the hype and see A.I. as a nuisance in their daily lives,” they wrote.</p> <p>It’s unclear if the industry will take heed of these warnings. Investors look to every quarterly earnings report for signs that each company’s billions in capex spending is somehow being justified and executives are eager to give them hope. Boosting, boasting about and hyping the supposed promise and inevitability of AI is a big part of keeping investor concerns about the extra $10bn each company adds to its spending projections every quarter at bay. Mark Zuckerberg, for instance, recently said in the future if you’re not using AI glasses you’ll be at a cognitive disadvantage much like not wearing corrective lenses. That means tech firms such as Meta and Google will probably continue making the AI features that they offer today an almost inescapable part of using their products in a play to boost their training data and user numbers.</p> <p>That said, the first big test of this AI reality check will come on Wednesday when chipmaker Nvidia – one of the building blocks of most LLMs – will report its latest earnings. Analysts seem pretty optimistic but after a shaky week for its stocks, investor reactions to Nvidia’s earnings and any updates on spending will be a strong signal of whether they have a continued appetite for the AI hype machine.</p> <h2>Have you bonded with an AI?</h2>    <p>Heavy ChatGPT users have formed strong emotional attachments to the AI, which means that, when it changes, they notice. In the case of OpenAI’s most recent update, the release of the AI model GPT-5, these users got upset. My colleague Dani Anguiano reports:</p> <p><em>“It was really horrible, and it was a really tough time,” said Linn Vailt, a software developer in Sweden, about the update. “It’s like somebody just moved all of the furniture in your house.”</em></p> <p><em>ChatGPTquickly made adjustments, promising an update to 5’s personality and restoring access to older models – for subscribers only – while acknowledging it had underestimated the importance of some features to its users.</em></p> <p>***<br><strong>Have you bonded with an AI?

Automated systems already carry out some 85% of content removals on the app, according to TikTok. ByteDance, its parent company, seems to want to move the percentage upward.</p> <p>The company is not hemming and hawing about the importance of human oversight and insight into thorny issues. Business is booming, with a 38% increase in revenue in the UK and Europe, per regulatory filings. American tech giants are moving in the same direction, led by Meta’s disbandment of its fact-checking initiatives and Elon Musk’s deep cuts to the trust and safety teams at X.</p> <p>TikTokhas carried out <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tiktok-lays-staff-u-s-trust-safety-global-e-commerce-teams\">smaller-scale layoffs</a> of trust and safety teams in the United States. There have not been mass firings of content moderators. Why? Perhaps because any move that might elicit backlash would be dangerous at a moment when the official US attitude toward the app couldn’t be less clear. The White House created a TikTok account that launched last Tuesday. You may recall that the past two American presidents have tried to shut the app out of the US. The ban is still in place, held off only by flimsy executive orders extending a pause on its enforcement, which may only persist as long as Donald Trump’s goodwill does.</p> <h2>The wider TechScape</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/21/ai-author-articles-wired-business-insider\">Wired and Business Insider remove articles by AI-generated ‘freelancer’</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/21/sunniest-cafe-paris-app-jveuxdusoleil\">There’s an app for that: finding a sunny cafe in Paris, the city of light</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/20/french-government-investigating-death-of-man-during-live-stream\">French streamer dies live online after months of apparent mistreatment</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/19/uk-has-backed-down-on-demand-to-access-us-apple-user-data-spy-chief-says\">UK has backed down on demand to access US Apple user data, spy chief says</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/19/microsoft-workers-protest-washington-israel\">Microsoft workers occupy HQ in protest against company’s ties to Israeli military</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/19/intel-stake-trump-chips-science-act\">US pursuing stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, commerce secretary says</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/19/openai-chatgpt-stock-sale-reports\">OpenAI eyes world’s largest valuation for private company in stock sale talks</a></p></li> </ul>'},\n",

One issue that remains unaddressed is that even if the technology delivers on its promise, many, if not most of the current players are bound to fail. The knock-on effects of these failures may be catastrophic, especially for equity investors.</p> <p>Depending on how you count, there are either five or six essentially identical LLM development programs in AI from big tech players in the US: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta\">Meta</a>, xAi, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/microsoft\">Microsoft</a>/<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/openai\">OpenAI</a>, who may be either allies or competitors.

Each one of the five or six big tech programs appears to be seeking a global monopoly, the cost of which will be measured in hundreds of billions of dollars.</p> <p>Investment in AI in by corporate customers in 2022 was <a href=\"https://guides.ai/ai-statistics/\">$91.9bn</a>, which does not include investments from industry, investors and other sources. <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-09-17-gartner-says-worldwide-ai-spending-will-total-1-point-5-trillion-in-2025\">Gartner group estimates</a> that total investment in LLMs, related infrastructure and other AI services will be $1.48tn, up nearly 50% on 2024.

Revenue from all sources this year may be between <a href=\"https://blogs.idc.com/2024/08/21/idcs-worldwide-ai-and-generative-ai-spending-industry-outlook/\">$235bn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/artificial-intelligence/worldwide\">$244bn</a>, but the vast majority of that will go to the infrastructure required to train and operate LLMs. Almost every forecast anticipates continued high revenue growth for many years, reaching <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/artificial-intelligence/worldwide\">$1tn by 2031</a>. At least one <a href=\"https://www.cognitivemarketresearch.com/ai-market-report\">forecaster</a> is predicting global revenues in excess of $3tn by 2033. But to achieve those figures, investment will have to remain gargantuan.</p> <p>The huge gap between capital investment in infrastructure and end user license revenue from AI software is not sustainable. Every participant is confident that the gap will close with a huge increase in end user revenue, but they may be wrong. In the meantime, investors take comfort in the fact that one company’s investment is another company’s revenue. For example, cloud services revenue at Microsoft, Google and Amazon has exploded during the industry’s investment phase. A similar thing has happened with semiconductor sales at Nvidia. Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia have made large investments in startups, providing capital that then comes back to them as revenue.</p> <p>All of this investment has not yielded equivalent success for customers. Media has reported failures with AI in the <a href=\"https://www.damiencharlotin.com/hallucinations/\">law</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencing.com/1781766/worst-ways-ai-affected-school/\">education</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/10/nx-s1-5222574/kids-character-ai-lawsuit\">wellness</a>, <a href=\"https://necodex.com/resources/the-dark-side-of-ai-risks-in-software-development\">software development</a> and other categories that range between disappointing and catastrophic. The industry promises that it will fix the problems with AI, and perhaps it will. But that is a big bet, and not the only one investors and customers are making today.</p> <p>Investors have assumed that every major US player in LLMs will be a winner. This assumption is essential, as the monopolies that power big tech – such as Microsoft’s Office suite, Google Search, Gmail, and Docs, and Meta’s Facebook – are, without exception, approaching the end of their useful lives. The vast majority of customers believe that these products have gotten worse – and made users less productive – over the past decade or more. Each big tech company needs a global monopoly in AI to sustain their success and market value. They are not all going to get one.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/10/tech-companies-are-stealing-our-books-music-and-films-for-ai-its-brazen-theft-and-must-be-stopped\">Tech companies are stealing our books, music and films for AI.

From there, he went on to design the first iPod, iPhone, MacBook Air, Apple Watch and AirPods.</p> <p>For his work on creating such distinctive products, Ive was<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/may/23/apple-designer-jonathan-ive-knighthood\"> knighted by Princess Anne</a> at Buckingham Palace in 2012, a moment he called “thrilling” and “particularly humbling”.</p> <p>In Altman and Ive’s blog post on Wednesday, they wrote that the io team will merge with OpenAI to work “more intimately with the research, engineering and product teams in San Francisco”. Ive himself will not join OpenAI as an employee, but his company will “take over design for all of OpenAI, including its software”, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-21/openai-to-buy-apple-veteran-jony-ive-s-ai-device-startup-in-6-5-billion-deal?sref=fqqmZ8gi\">Bloomberg</a>.</p> <p>Since leaving Apple and starting LoveFrom, Ive has mostly remained quiet, and io has not debuted any hardware. His company’s list of clients reportedly includes Christie’s, Airbnb and Ferrari, though. Another project Ive has been working on is LoveFrom’s headquarters in San Francisco, according to the<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/technology/jony-ive-apple-lovefrom.html\"> New York Times</a>. Ives told the paper he is designing the headquarters of the company he is developing with OpenAI.</p> <p>OpenAI has likewise yet to unveil a hardware device, but it has indicated it is heading in that direction. It has hired hardware and robotics staff, including Caitlin “CK” Kalinowski, who headed Meta’s <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/05/openai-hires-metas-former-orion-head-to-lead-its-robotics-efforts.html\">augmented reality glasses</a> initiative. In her LinkedIn announcement, Kalinowski wrote that her new role at OpenAI is to focus on “robotics work and partnerships to help bring AI into the physical world”. OpenAI has also invested in the robot startup <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/04/jeff-bezos-and-openai-invest-in-robot-startup-physical-intelligence.html\">Physical Intelligence</a>, which aims to bring “general-purpose AI into the physical world”.</p> <p>Investors have been throwing money at OpenAI over the past couple of years, which is now valued at $300bn, according to Bloomberg. In March, it closed a funding round of $40bn led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. Microsoft has a 49% stake in the AI company after investing $13bn in 2023.</p> <p>Along with io, OpenAI moved to make other mammoth acquisitions over the last year. It purchased the AI-assisted coding tool Windsurf for $3bn earlier this month and bought the real-time analytics database Rockset for an undisclosed sum last summer.</p>'},\n",

The next needs an AI boost</h1>\\n<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2024-12-26T14:43:50Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Nils Pratley &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Business</div>\\n<p>The first quarter of the 21st century is almost up, assuming one regards 31 December 1999 to have been the last day of the last millennium (non-partying pedants insist the date actually fell on the final day of 2000). It is the cue for analysts at Deutsche Bank to remind investors how much can change in the course of 25 years, in this case from the days when Nokia phones and fax machines, rather than iPhones and Amazon, were everyday features of life.</p> <p>Here’s one jaw-dropper: back in sunny days of 1999, there was a live debate as to when the US would pay down its entire stock of government debt. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reckoned the glorious day would arrive sometime in 2013. In reality, borrowing headed in the other direction almost immediately – and the US debt-to-GDP ratio is now above 100%. The CBO reckons annual deficits will take the ratio to 160% by 2050.</p> <p>In similar fashion, delusional dotcom thinking at the turn of the century provoked ridiculous speculation that the stock market was heading for the moon. A book called Dow 36,000 became a bestseller, predicting that the Dow Jones industrial average, then about 10,000, would hit the named level “within a few years”. It took 22 years.</p> <p>Deutsche calculates that, for stock market investors, the quarter century wasn’t much to shout about. US equities have left most other markets – including the UK – for dust, but they recorded their second-worst performance in the nine quarter centuries since 1800 with a 4.9% return above inflation. That is despite the increase in recent years from dominant tech superstars such as Apple and Nvidia.</p> <p>Gold actually did better in an era of aggressive central bank and government interventions to combat everything from the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000, 9/11 in 2001, the global financial crisis in 2008, Covid in 2020, and the surge in energy and food prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “There’s still a big outstanding question as to whether this buildup of debt is storing up significant problems for the future,” writes Jim Reid, the Deutsche head of global economics. You bet.</p> <p>Debt is one of his three helicopter-view big factors for the next quarter century, he argues. Another is demographics, where there is strong correlation to both growth in gross domestic product and returns from equities. Unfortunately, trends there are not encouraging.</p> <p>“Given that demographics almost certainly deteriorate further in the 2024-49 quarter century, it stands to reason that all other things being equal (they may not be), you would expect another quarter century of below long-term average real GDP growth and real equity returns, especially in the developed market world,” Reid writes.</p> <p>Thus it’s hard to argue with the conclusion that that if debt and demographics are weighing on rates of productivity growth, as they did in the last 25 years, AI is “the great hope” for investors: “The prospect of artificial general intelligence arriving as we reach the second half of the 2025-49 quarter century is real and could completely revolutionise the world.”</p> <p>That doesn’t necessarily mean the outperformance of tech-heavy, but already richly valued, US markets is the way to bet. AI products could become “commoditised and inexpensive”, making it hard for the tech companies to recoup their hundreds of billions of investment while lifting the tide for everyone. Rather, Deutsche’s point is that “with regards to AI and tech-led productivity gains, it feels like we desperately need it given demographics and debt”.</p> <p>That is the slightly depressing conclusion of its grand multidecade sweep of the horizon. Deutsche still sees equities recording “notably higher” real returns than government bonds, as is normal in most multidecade periods. But, geopolitics aside, the swing factor for returns is whether the AI-led revolution also revolutionises productivity.</p>'}]"
