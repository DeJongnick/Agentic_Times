<p>European financial markets have rallied sharply and German borrowing costs have soared after the country’s prospective leaders announced a historic deal to loosen its “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/21/willingness-to-ease-off-debt-brake-may-decide-the-german-election">debt brake</a>” rule to boost spending on defence.</p> <p>The yield – in effect the interest rate – on 30-year German government bonds rose by about 25 basis points to 3.08% in its biggest daily increase since October 1998.</p> <p>The Dax 30 index, which tracks the largest German companies, rose by 3.6%, powered by industrial stocks. Share prices also leapt in London, Paris and Milan amid investor hopes that a massive boost in European spending on defence and infrastructure would kickstart the region’s ailing economy.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/03/european-defence-stocks-surge-as-arms-manufacturers-eye-orders-boom">European defence stocks soar as arms makers expect orders boom</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Defence stocks have gained sharply in recent weeks as world leaders scramble to piece together the funding for a vast increase in military expenditure amid mounting concern over Donald Trump’s commitment to European security.</p> <p>The EU <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/eu-plan-to-bolster-europes-defences-could-raise-800bn-for-ukraine">outlined a plan on Tuesday to unlock almost €800bn (£670bn)</a> for defence spending, while the UK government said last week it would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/feb/25/starmer-slashes-aid-to-fund-major-increase-in-defence-spending">raise its spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027</a>, two years earlier than planned, worth an additional £6bn a year.</p> <p>Shares in Rheinmetall, the German automotive and arms manufacturer, rose by 7.2% on Wednesday and have rocketed by 99% this year. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/03/european-defence-stocks-surge-as-arms-manufacturers-eye-orders-boom">Britain’s BAE Systems has rallied</a> by 41% so far this year, Italy’s Leonardo is up 73% and Paris-listed Thales has risen by 78%.</p> <p>The euro rose by 1.5% against the US dollar to about €1.08. The pound also gained against the dollar on a day of dramatic moves in markets, as investors also reacted to the US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, suggesting a deal could “probably” be reached to de-escalate Trump’s trade war with Canada and Mexico.</p> <p>Some analysts said there was a danger of the dollar losing its “safe-haven” status among global investors as Trump’s trade wars rattle the world’s largest economy. “The speed and scale of global shifts is so rapid that this needs to be acknowledged as a possibility,” said George Saravelos, global head of currency research at Deutsche Bank.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/yAWwr/1/" data-alt="."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/yAWwr/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>In a sea change for economic policy after years of sticking to tough rules on government debt, Germany’s chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, said on Tuesday that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/04/germanys-future-coalition-partners-to-relax-debt-rules-to-boost-defence-budget">defence spending above 1% of GDP would be exempt</a> from the country’s debt rule.</p> <p>Agreed with the centre-left Social Democrats, who are expected to form a coalition with Merz’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the plan also includes the creation of a €500bn fund to finance spending on Germany’s infrastructure over the next 10 years. Any lifting of the debt brake must command a two-thirds majority in the Bundestag.</p> <p>In response, Germany’s biggest construction and engineering companies posted sharp share gains on Wednesday. Cement maker Heidelberg Materials jumped by 17%, industrial services firm Bilfinger leapt by 18% and construction group Hochtief advanced by 15.5%. Engineering and steel firm ThyssenKrupp rose by 13.4%.</p> <p>Echoing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/euro-irreversible-mario-draghi-ecb">the words of Mario Draghi</a>, the former European Central Bank president during the eurozone debt crisis, Merz said Germany would do “whatever it takes” on defence. Under pressure to raise spending on defence from 2.1% of GDP last year, analysts at Morgan Stanley said the overall size of the German plan could reach more than €1tn.</p> <p>Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, said the plan amounted to a “really big bazooka” with potential to transform Europe’s largest economy. “They are a fiscal sea change for Germany,” he said.</p> <p>“The extra room for defence spending sends a clear signal to Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump as well as to Germany’s European friends that Germany is serious about defending itself and helping Ukraine.”</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/foESw/1/" data-alt="."> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/foESw/1/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Described as “one of the most historic paradigm shifts in German postwar history” by economists at Deutsche Bank, the deal will effectively sideline the constitutional debt brake, or <em>schuldenbremse, </em>for spending on defence.</p> <p>Introduced in 2009 by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/angela-merkel">Angela Merkel</a> after the financial crisis, the rule, often restricting annual federal borrowing to 0.35% of GDP, had been symbolic of Germany’s strict approach to tax and spending policy.</p> <p>City analysts said sidelining the rule would be a gamechanger for the country’s economy amid big challenges from collapsing industrial output, weakened by slack demand and competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers.</p> <p>“Germany was facing a potential growth trajectory heading towards zero over coming years. [The defence and infrastructure boost] catapults growth prospects closer to 1.5-2% for 2027 onwards,” analysts at Bank of America wrote in a note to clients.</p> <p>The debt-fuelled stimulus package comes with a cost, reflected in a rise in 10-year bond yields to almost 2.7%. However, German borrowing costs still remain significantly lower than in the US and the UK, where yields have reached more than 4%.</p>
