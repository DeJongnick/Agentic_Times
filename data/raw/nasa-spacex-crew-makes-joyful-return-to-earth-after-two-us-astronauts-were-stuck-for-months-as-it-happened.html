 <h2 class="block-title">Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We’re wrapping up our coverage of the highly publicized and very politicized return of Nasa astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who ended up staying on the International Space Station for nine months after what they thought would be a quick mission of less than two weeks. Here are the key points:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>A SpaceX capsule holding the two astronauts</strong>, as well as Nasa’s Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, splashed down successfully off the coast of Florida at about 5.57pm EST on Tuesday.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The capsule’s photogenic landing</strong>, on an exceptionally calm and sunny day, was capped off with the appearance of several dolphins who swam around the bobbing spacecraft. Read <strong>Richard Luscombe</strong>’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/18/nasa-astronauts-iss-spacex-dragon-capsule-return-time-sunita-williams-barry-wilmore"> detailed account here</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The four astronauts emerged, grinning, from the space capsule onto the recovery vessel</strong>, and then were taken for medical evaluation. They were slated to fly by helicopter to Florida, and then to the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, where they would be reunited with their families and continue to adjust to their return to Earth.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>At </strong><strong>a Nasa press conference in Houston, Nasa administrators largely dodged questions about the truth of Trump and Musk’s claims about the astronauts </strong><strong>having been “stranded” or “abandoned”</strong> by the Biden administration, as well as Musk’s suggestion that Trump deserved credit for “prioritizing this mission”. One official said Nasa was responsible for safe missions and doing science in space, not for what is said in the media.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>But Nasa officials did emphasize that they saw value in working with multiple private contractors</strong>, both Boeing and SpaceX, to transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station, and that Boeing, despite problems with its previous mission, remained committed to its spaceflight program.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Guardian’s Michael Sainato had an<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/18/nasa-cuts-elon-musk-spacex"> inside look at Nasa workers’ concerns at coming cuts</a></strong> at the government agency and the role of Elon Musk, currently the most powerful member of Trump’s administration, who also owns SpaceX, a private space company and major government contractor.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Meanwhile, if you’re wondering what exactly is happening to the astronauts as their bodies adjust</strong> to earth after nine months in space, my colleague <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/14/swollen-eyeballs-baby-like-skin-and-the-overview-effect-how-astronauts-feel-when-they-return-to-earth">Helen Sullivan has the answers</a>.</p></li>

  <p>Why had Nasa not pushed back “more emphatically” against the use of astronauts as “political pawns” by prominent space contractors, and against the “fictitious narrative” that was “woven around” this mission, particularly since these space missions are actually funded by the public, a British journalist from the Times asked.</p> 
  <p>“Our job at Nasa is to successfully and safely fly these missions. We fly it with the laws of physics and we fly it with commercial partners. Oftentimes, there may be [information] out in the press that may not be exactly what happens. Our job is to fly these missions,” Joel Montalbano, deputy associate administrator of Nasa’s space operations mission directorate, said, emphasising that Nasa wanted to focus on completing the important scientific research they do in space.</p>

  <p>Another question: will there be any psychological studies of Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to evaluate the effects not just of a prolonged stay in space, but an unexpected and more uncertain one? </p> 
  <p>All crew members go through lots of surveys and evaluations, and Bill Spetch, operations integration manager of Nasa’s International Space Station program. “There’s always adjustments we have to make,” Spetch said, emphasizing that many space flights have last-minute changes that astronauts have to adapt to. </p>

  <p>The New York Times’ Kenneth Chang asked a direct question: as Trump and Musk claim victory for “rescuing” the two astronauts, and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1902141220505243751">Musk said that Trump had prioritized the mission</a>, was it the case that anything would have actually gone differently in the return mission’s timing if Kamala Harris had been elected president?</p> 
  <p>Nasa works for the president, and they work hard to carry out the directives of whoever is president, said Joel Montalbano, the deputy associate administrator of Nasa’s space operations mission Directorate, not really answering the question.</p>

  <p>Nasa officials have continued to emphasise that they see value in having multiple commercial contractors working to transport astronauts back and forth to the International Space Station, and that both Boeing and Musk’s SpaceX are important partners going forward.</p> 
  <p>Yes, in this case, Stich said, there was a problem with Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, and SpaceX brought the astronauts home.</p> 
  <p>“Someday there may be a case where we’re using [Boeing’s] Starliner to handle a [SpaceX] Dragon contingency,” added Stich, the manager of Nasa’s commercial crew program.</p> 
  <p>When a journalist pressed on whether Boeing was really committed to continuing its spacecraft program, given its tremendous cost, Stich said he believed the company was.</p> 
  <p>“Boeing all the way up to their new CEO Kelly [Ortberg] has been committed to Starliner. I can see that in how they’re approaching their solution to the problems,” he said.</p>

  <p>Stich, the manager of Nasa’s commercial crew program, mildly talks around this question, saying: “We looked for opportunities to bring the crew back when it was safe to do so.”</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Nasa's Steve Stich praises Wilmore and Williams' adaptability</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Steve Stich, the manager of Nasa’s commercial crew program, said that the incredible adaptability of Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, in pivoting from serving on what they thought would be a short-term mission to becoming longer-term members of the ISS crew, is a good sign of astronauts’ preparation for future space exploration. He mentioned in particular possible “harsh” missions to the surface of Mars, as well as missions to the moon.</p>

  <p>Boeing also had a watch party for the splashdown and are “keenly interested” in Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams’ return and have been texting him about it, Steve Stich, the manager of Nasa’s commercial crew program, said.</p> 
  <p>This comment is interesting because it comes more than nine months after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/04/nasa-boeing-astronauts-not-stranded-story">failure of Boeing’s pioneering Starliner capsule</a> scuppered the two astronauts’ originally scheduled week-long mission, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/18/nasa-astronauts-iss-spacex-dragon-capsule-return-time-sunita-williams-barry-wilmore">my colleague </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/18/nasa-astronauts-iss-spacex-dragon-capsule-return-time-sunita-williams-barry-wilmore">Richard Luscombe</a></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/18/nasa-astronauts-iss-spacex-dragon-capsule-return-time-sunita-williams-barry-wilmore"> explained</a>.</p> 
  <p>Both Boeing and SpaceX, which is owned by Elon Musk, are major space contractors that work with the US government and the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX, Musk’s company, is the one that worked with Nasa to bring the astronauts home today.</p> 
  <p>Williams and Wilmore <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/jun/06/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-helium-leaks">arrived at the ISS</a> on 6 June last year, intending to stay long enough to evaluate Starliner’s docking and operational capabilities during its first crewed flight and return home no more than 10 days later. But a series of technical issues and safety fears led Nasa and Boeing to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/sep/06/boeing-starliner-iss">send the capsule back to Earth empty</a> in September, and extend the pair’s stay by making them crew members onboard the space station in place of two other astronauts still on the ground, who were reassigned to other, future missions.</p>

  <p><strong>Nasa cuts raise fears of handing more influence to SpaceX owner Musk</strong></p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s decision to shutter two offices at Nasa risks “dramatically” increasing the costs of space exploration, while handing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> more influence over the agency, fired workers have warned.</p> 
  <p>Nasa’s office of technology, policy and strategy and office of the chief scientist provide independent analysis on key investments and strategies. Both are set to close, amid widespread cuts at the agency.</p> 
  <p>Workers inside the two offices told the Guardian these cuts would undermine the ongoing goals of manned missions to the moon and Mars – and raise questions over conflicts of interest for Musk, who remains CEO of SpaceX, the rocket and satellite giant, while leading the so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, which has led the charge to cut back the federal government under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>.</p> 
  <p>“Musk wants to go to Mars. They need no detractors,” said one senior Nasa official. “The most independent and unbiased views on this come from these offices, not centers or directorates who don’t care as long as there is money flowing in.”</p>

  <p>Yes, it’s a compelling human story. But we’re also witnessing a very choreographed day of political messaging for SpaceX, and its CEO Elon Musk, for the Trump administration, and for Nasa itself, which is occupying a somewhat precarious political position as a government agency in the new Trump-Musk era.</p>

  <p>Trump, in turn, has attempted to paint last week’s long-scheduled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/16/spacex-capsule-docks-with-iss-to-bring-back-stranded-nasa-astronauts">routine crew-rotation flight</a>, carrying replacements for Williams and Wilmore, as a special rescue mission ordered by the White House.</p> 
  <p>Wilmore told reporters from space earlier this month that he believed Musk’s claim that <strong>Joe Biden</strong> had rebuffed an offer to bring them home last year was “absolutely factual”, while also admitting: “We have no information on … what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that process went.”</p> 
  <p>Yet, in February <a href="https://x.com/Acyn/status/1890277921904029940">he told CNN</a>: “We don’t feel abandoned, we don’t feel stuck, we don’t feel stranded. I understand why others may think that … if you’ll help us change the rhetoric, help us change the narrative, let’s change it to ‘prepared and committed’, that’s what we prefer.”</p> 
  <p>Musk subsequently became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/feb/21/elon-musk-butch-wilmore-suni-williams-nasa-astronaut-iss-claims-biden">embroiled in a public dispute</a> with the Danish astronaut and space station veteran <strong>Andreas Mogensen</strong>, who accused him of lying, and pointed out that Tuesday’s return of Williams and Wilmore, alongside their ISS Crew 9 colleagues, had been scheduled as long ago as September.</p> 
  <p>In response, Musk posted to the X platform he owns that Mogensen was “fully retarded”, drawing him deeper into conflict with retired astronauts and ISS veterans and brothers <strong>Scott</strong> and <strong>Mark Kelly</strong>, who defended their European colleague.</p> 
  <p>The bad blood has continued, with Musk calling Mark Kelly, Democratic senator for Arizona, “a traitor” for visiting Ukraine and urging US military and humanitarian support for the country in its war against Russia; and the politician retorting that Musk is “not a serious guy”.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Two US astronauts stuck after Boeing Starliner issues</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The two US astronauts stuck on the ISS were meant to return home onboard a Boeing Starliner – but Nasa decided to move them on to a SpaceX-crewed flight instead due to “too much uncertainty” about the Starliner, which had problems after the capsule sprang small leaks and some of its thrusters failed.</p> 
  <p>Williams and Wilmore, two veteran astronauts, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/23/nasa-stranded-astronauts-spacex">arrived</a> at the ISS on 6 June as part of a crucial test by Starliner before it could receive Nasa approval for routine flights. However, their planned eight-day mission turned into a months-long stay after technical issues emerged, including reaction-control thrusters that failed during Starliner’s first docking attempt.</p> 
  <p>Four of the spacecraft’s five failed thrusters later reactivated in orbit, the Associated Press <a href="https://apnews.com/article/boeing-astronauts-starliner-nasa-spacex-e2912c86bcb19dbcecee407fd146e3df">reported</a>, adding that the thrusters are crucial for the spacecraft to back away from the ISS after undocking and for maintaining the capsule in proper position for the deorbit.</p> 
  <p>On 2 August, Boeing <a href="https://starlinerupdates.com/">said</a> in a blog post that it had conducted “extensive testing of its propulsion system in space and on the ground”.</p> 
  <p>The embattled manufacturer, which has struggled to compete with SpaceX and has taken in $1.6bn in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/aug/23/nasa-stranded-astronauts-spacex">losses</a> on the Starliner program, added: “The testing has confirmed 27 of 28 RCS [reaction control system] thrusters are healthy and back to full operational capability. Starliner’s propulsion system also maintains redundancy and the helium levels remain stable.”</p> 
  <p>Describing the decision to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/sep/06/boeing-starliner-iss">bring the Starliner back uncrewed</a> in September, <strong>Steve Stich</strong>, program manager for Nasa’s commercial crew program, said: “The bottom line relative to bringing Starliner back is … there was just too much uncertainty in the prediction of the thrusters … it was just too much risk with the crew.”</p>

  <p>When Williams, Wilmore, Hague and Gorbunov left the ISS, they were replaced by a new crew, whose arrival led to emotional scenes on Sunday.</p> 
  <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/spacex">SpaceX</a> capsule delivered four astronauts in a Nasa crew-swap mission that will allow Williams and Wilmore to return home after nine months on the orbiting lab. Williams said it was a wonderful day and “great to see our friends arrive”, speaking shortly after her colleagues emerged on to the orbital lab.</p> 
  <p>In a live video, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa">Nasa</a> astronaut and team commander <strong>Anne McClain</strong> said: “Hi, everybody down there on Earth. Crew 10 has had a great journey up here, about 28 hours to get back up to the space station. And I cannot tell you the immense joy of our crew when we looked out the window and saw the space station for the first time.”</p> 
  <p>She said: “You can hardly even put it into words … orbiting the Earth for the last couple of days, it has been absolutely incredible.”</p> 
  <p>McClain’s team were welcomed by the station’s seven-member crew, which included Wilmore and Williams, veteran astronauts and retired Navy test pilots who have remained on the station after problems with Boeing’s Starliner capsule forced Nasa to bring it back empty.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Nasa astronauts expected to splash down just before 6pm Florida time</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Hello, and welcome to our live coverage of two US astronauts – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/13/ride-home-secured-for-us-astronauts-stranded-in-orbit-for-eight-months-nasa-spacex">stuck for more than nine months</a> on the International Space Station – returning to Earth today.</p> 
  <p>Nasa said it expects the astronauts to splash down off the Florida coast at approximately 5.57pm ET Tuesday (21.57 GMT). Favourable weather meant their expected re-entry was moved forward from Wednesday.</p> 
  <p><strong>Barry “Butch” Wilmore</strong> and <strong>Sunita Williams</strong> are heading home with another American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon craft, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/16/spacex-capsule-docks-with-iss-to-bring-back-stranded-nasa-astronauts">arrived at the ISS early on Sunday</a>.</p> 
  <p>The duo had been on the ISS since June, after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft they were testing on its maiden crewed voyage suffered propulsion issues and was deemed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/sep/06/boeing-starliner-iss">unfit to fly them back to Earth</a>.</p> 
  <p>On Sunday, Nasa said: “The updated return target continues to allow the space station crew members time to complete handover duties while providing operational flexibility ahead of less favorable weather conditions expected for later in the week.”</p> 
  <p>Nasa astronaut <strong>Nick Hague</strong> and Roscosmos cosmonaut <strong>Aleksandr Gorbunov</strong> are also returning on the Dragon capsule, which undocked from the space station at 1.05am ET on Monday.</p> 
  <p>The final stages of their journey will be <a href="https://plus.nasa.gov/">broadcast live on the new Nasa+</a> streaming service. We will have a live feed at the top of this live blog.</p>
