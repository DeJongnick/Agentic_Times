<p>Your article (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/08/national-security-threatened-climate-crisis-uk-defence-chiefs-warn">National security threatened by climate crisis, UK intelligence chiefs due to warn, 8 October</a>) exposed&nbsp;the dangerous disconnect between climate policy and defence. It raises vital questions about Britain’s – and the world’s – readiness to face the security threats posed by the climate crisis, none of which can be met if leaders keep treating climate and defence as separate issues.</p> <p>This summer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/02/earths-wildfires-growing-in-number">wildfires linked to climate change</a> brought Europe to its knees, wreaking economic havoc, overwhelming health systems and draining military resources. All over the world, climate breakdown is fuelling instability,&nbsp;conflict and displacement. The EU’s failure to break free from Moscow’s pipelines is jeopardising its energy&nbsp;sovereignty. Too many governments treat climate and security as separate priorities, but true security will depend on how quickly we integrate climate resilience into national defence.</p> <p>As world leaders increase their defence budgets, they must redefine what security means. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/25/trump-praises-nato-states-as-summit-prepares-to-lift-defence-spending-target">Nato’s pledge to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP</a>, agreed this summer, should be used to invest in innovation, something the British military has a proud history of. </p> <p>The navy’s shift from burning coal to oil before the first world war was controversial, but ended up strengthening the British fleet. Today, dual-use technologies – which have both civilian and military applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles and sustainable aviation fuel – can similarly reduce emissions while boosting&nbsp;military&nbsp;performance.<br><strong>Lt Gen (retd) Richard Nugee </strong><br><em>Devizes, Wiltshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
