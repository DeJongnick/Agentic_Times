<p>Members of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) reportedly gained access to a payroll system over the weekend that processes salaries for about 276,000 federal employees across various government agencies, despite warnings from senior staff about the potential risks.</p> <p>Senior career officials at the interior department reportedly issued a memo last week highlighting the unusual nature of the request to gain access to the Federal Personnel and Payroll System and the associated risks with granting it, the New York Times reported.</p> <p>The memo, reviewed by the Times, stated that “such elevated access to critical high-value asset systems is rare with respect to individual systems and no single [Department of Interior] official presently has access to all HR, payroll and credentialing systems.”</p>  <h2>Doge gains access to federal payroll system despite warnings</h2>  <p>Senior employees at the interior department reportedly warned that granting Doge employees this level of access to the federal payroll system would allow them to be able to view highly sensitive personal information that is subject to controls under the Privacy Act.</p> <p>They cautioned that individuals given this elevated access could become targets for cybersecurity attacks by terrorists, nations or other malicious actors.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/31/doge-musk-federal-payroll-system"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Contempt as Trump claims he can
