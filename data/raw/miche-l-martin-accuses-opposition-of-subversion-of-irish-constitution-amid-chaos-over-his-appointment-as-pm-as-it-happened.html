  <p>“This is the first time in 100 years the Dail has failed to elect a government to fulfill its constitutional obligation,” <strong>Martin</strong> said in a strongly worded statement outside government buildings.</p> 
  <p>Standing beside him, the outgoing taoiseach <strong>Simon Harris</strong> said it was an “utter disgrace” the house did not deliver on its duty to vote in the new government, especially with “so many pressing issues” facing the country.</p> 
  <p>But they faced an immediate backlash. Labour TD <strong>Alan Kelly</strong> said the words should “haunt” Martin for the rest of his career.</p> 
  <p>All opposition parties were trying to do was fight for the “principles of democracy” and ensure the “farce” of independent TDs who support the government were not on opposition benches, he said.</p>

   <p>What we witnessed today was a subversion of the Irish constitution. The most fundamental obligation of the Dail is to elect a taoiseach and to elect a government.

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Attempts to elect a new taoiseach in Ireland lay in tatters on Wednesday after a rebellion by opposition parties resulting in the suspension of the Dáil until Thursday morning, <strong>Lisa O’Carroll</strong> writes in from Dublin.</p> 
  <p><strong>Micheál Martin</strong> had been due to be officially appointed by the president of Ireland at 2pm with a cabinet unveiled around 5.30pm.</p> 
  <p>Unable to control the house, speaker <strong>Verona Murphy</strong> stood up, adjourned the Dail until tomorrow morning and walked out.</p> 
  <p>The extraordinary scenes meant a cancellation of the set piece pageant involving Martin being elected for taoiseach and then travelling to the the official residence of the Irish president where <strong>Michael D Higgins</strong> would sign the warrant of appointment of the taoiseach.</p> 
  <p>The day was derailed as soon as the new Dail tried to take office just after 11am.</p> 
  <p><strong>Sinn Féin</strong>, <strong>Labour</strong> and other opposition parties protested in angry scenes over attempts by opposition TDs propping up the government remaining on opposition benches.</p> 
  <p>Murphy suspended the Dail twice and a further 30m adjournment just before midday turned into a four hour hiatus.</p> 
  <p>She tried to reboot proceedings just after 4pm instructing the house to get on with the business of electing the taoiseach Micheál Martin.</p> 
  <p>But her instructions were drowned out by a cacophony of protests from opposition benches shouting “disgrace”, “outrageous” and “no agreement”.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in Dublin… <strong>Micheál Martin’s</strong> big day which was supposed to be a procedural ceremony confirming him formally as Ireland’s new taoiseach is current remains in tatters, Lisa O’Carroll writes.</p> 
  <p>The Dail has still not returned after a shouting match erupted this morning in the chamber over the speaking rights independents who are supporting the government will have. </p> 
  <p>Speaking on RTE, Labour MP Alan Kelly, said he was “embarrassed” by the situation, which he compared to the United Kingdom parliament in recent years. </p> 
  <p>“We looked over at the House of Parliament a couple of years ago during Brexit and said, what a laugh, what a shambles. Well, are we now going to be the only parliament in the world where members of the government are actually in opposition?”</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Continuing his speech on social media, <strong>Sánchez </strong>called for an end of anonymity on social media and urged EU leaders to pass new rules that would force platforms to verify people’s identities before allowing them to post.</p> 
  <p>He said he would propose this measure at the new meeting of EU leaders in Brussels.</p> 
  <p>The politician argued that while he understood why some people opted to simply to leave social media – and he briefly considered doing the same - he thought that they played too important a role to just give up on them.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>In our countries, no one can walk the streets with a mask on their face, or drive a car without a licence plate. No one can send packages without showing their ID, or buy a hunting weapon without giving their name. And yet, we are allowing to roam freely on social networks without linking their profiles to their real identity.</em></p> 
   <p><em>In democracies, people have the right to privacy, not to anonymity or impunity. … We must force all these platforms to link every user account to a European digital identity wallet. This way citizens could use nicknames, but in case [they commit] a crime, public authorities would be able to connect these nicknames to real people and hold them responsible.</em></p>

  <p>I feel privacy campaigners would have a lot to say about this idea.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Speaking in Davos in the last few minutes, Spanish prime minister <strong>Pedro Sánchez </strong>blamed social media platforms for causing harm to democratic societies and undermining social cohesion.</p> 
  <p>Here is what he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Back in the early 2000s, social media started to thrive … Their founders told us they would unite people and strengthen our democracies with new ideas, more pluralism, and extended accountability of the powerful. Based on that promise, we all joined. …</em></p> 
   <p><em>But with all these gains, also came huge downsides, hidden in the bowels of the algorithms as invaders concealed in the belly of a Trojan horse. We did not realise it then, but we do now.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Now we know that the seamless and free connectivity offered by social media also came with cyberbullying, hate speech, sex offences, privacy violations, and a terrible rise of anxiety, violence and loneliness.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Now we know that far from bringing humanity together and empowering the people, these platforms have resulted in a concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a just a few - all at the cost of our social cohesion, our mental health, and democracies.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Let’s open our eyes. Major social media are harming the liberal order and the democratic system.</em> </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said that constant pursuit of clicks is “making us replace rigour for immediacy, and complexity with brevity.”</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>It is preventing us from explaining things properly, from recognising that choices often involve trade-offs, and in engaging in substantial conversations with those thinking differently.</em></p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Now, as promised earlier, let’s take a quick look at what is happening in Dublin where <strong>Micheál Martin</strong> is set to become Ireland’s taoiseach for a second time with a new coalition government to take office later today.</p>

  <p>Opposition parties including <strong>Sinn Fein</strong>, <strong>Labour</strong> and independents in <strong>the People Before Profit alliance</strong> are furious that independent TDs who have entered a formal agreement to prop up the coalition government are looking to sit on opposition benches eating up critical speaking time. </p>

  <p><strong>Martin</strong> was expected to travel to Dublin to <strong>Aras an Uachtarain</strong>, the official residence of the president, where <strong>Michael D Higgins</strong> will sign the warrant of appointment and hand him the Seal of the Taoiseach at around 2pm.</p> 
  <p>But this is now <strong>likely to be delayed by up to an hour</strong> after proceedings had to be suspended after the angry row over speaking rights, with the new cabinet not expected to be named until late afternoon. </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Tusk's comments show EU tensions over climate, nature protection laws - analysis</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Poland’s prime minister <strong>Donald Tusk</strong> has said the EU needs to “have the courage” to change environmental rules that he blamed for high energy prices, our Brussels correspondent <strong>Jennifer Rankin writes in our first take on his speech.</strong></p> 
  <p>In a wide-ranging speech to the European parliament on Europe’s role in the world (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/22/olaf-scholz-emmanuel-macron-france-germany-europe-live?page=with:block-6790c46f8f08ab7f174b4121#block-6790c46f8f08ab7f174b4121">11.28 CET</a>) and defence (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/22/olaf-scholz-emmanuel-macron-france-germany-europe-live?page=with:block-6790cb108f08b3d6306c009d#block-6790cb108f08b3d6306c009d">see 11.51am</a>), Tusk also devoted substantial attention to the EU’s competitiveness, urging deregulation and “simplification” of EU rules.</p> 
  <p>It was a further sign that tensions over climate and nature protection laws are set to be a defining argument of the next five years for the EU.</p> 
  <p>Between 2019 and 2024 the EU adopted some of the most ambitious environmental legislation in the world. With many key policies yet to be fully implemented, there is a growing chorus to rethink elements of the EU green deal or other laws.</p> 
  <p>Tusk said no one in the room would question the need for action on climate change - a heroic assumption, given the high numbers of climate sceptic lawmakers in attendance - then added his own caveat.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>But, here is a “but”. Europe cannot lose the global competition, it cannot become a continent of naive people and ideas. If we go bankrupt, no one will care about the natural environment in the world anymore.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He went on to blame EU regulations for high energy prices and called for “a deep, critical and courageous reflection” on moving ahead with the updated and stricter version of the EU’s emissions trading system.</p> 
  <p>The ETS, launched in 2005 and tightened up in 2023, requires polluters, such as energy firms and heavy industry, to pay for carbon emissions.</p> 
  <p>Tusk said he warned against introducing the revised law at the current pace: “High energy prices may sweep away many a democratic government in the European Union.”</p> 
  <p>At the weekend, the centre-right European People’s Party (Tusk’s political family) called for a two-year pause on the EU’s corporate sustainability reporting directive, the corporate sustainability due diligence directive and the carbon border adjustment mechanism, essentially a tax on imports made in polluting factories outside Europe.</p> 
  <p>Meanwhile Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz has called for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/20/eu-carmakers-emissions-fines-olaf-scholz-germany-vw">rethink of plans to fine carmakers </a>who fail to produce cars in line with EU emission-reduction targets, following lobbying from European companies that are struggling to sell their vehicles amid fierce Chinese competition.</p> 
  <p>Politicians from the liberal, socialist and green groups responded to Tusk by putting greater emphasis on the need to support the EU’s green legislation.</p> 
  <p>Picking up the Polish presidency’s security theme, Terry Reintke, the co-leader of the Greens in the European parliament, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Security also goes hand in hand with environmental security, because what security is there if floods are endangering our people and are destroying our homes, droughts are killing our crops and when masses of water and wildfires ruin entire infrastructures or [the] economies of whole regions.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But Tusk also faces pressure from the far-right and nationalist politicians, who are the third and fourth strongest forces in the European parliament.</p> 
  <p>“Were you not president of the European council when this green madness was introduced,” said Anna Bryłka, an MEP for the far-right Polish Confederation party, in a speech laced with hyperbole and personal attacks directed at Tusk. Such interventions are seen as pressuring the EPP to move in a less climate-friendly direction.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">German opposition leader Merz calls for pragmatic approach to Trump</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>As we wait for French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron </strong>to welcome German chancellor <strong>Olaf Scholz</strong> to Paris later today, it’s probably worth catching up with some news lines from Scholz’s likely successor after next month’s elections.</p> 
  <p>Here’s a brief note from our Berlin correspondent, <strong>Deborah Cole.</strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, the frontrunner in Germany’s election campaign, conservative opposition leader <strong>Friedrich Merz</strong>, had called for a pragmatic European approach to <strong>Trump</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Describing the US president as an <strong>“interesting partner”</strong>, Merz said: “I think he’ll be ready to do business, also with the Europeans.” </p> 
  <p>“He’s a dealmaker, so let’s think about what we can offer,” said Merz, head of the centre-right Christian Democratic Union, which has a double-digit lead in the German polls.</p>

  </aside> 
  <p>Merz said if he became German chancellor after the 23 February election, he would seek to meet Trump “as quickly as possible”. But he stressed it was crucial the Europeans speak with one voice: “As soon as we have a common European position we’ll be seen as a strong partner.”</p> 
  <p>Asked about Italy’s far-right prime minister <strong>Georgia Meloni</strong>, who attended Monday’s inauguration and has been mentioned as a potential “Trump whisperer” for the EU during his second term, Merz said the bloc should no longer hold her at arm’s length.</p> 
  <p>“I don’t understand the reservations about her,” he said, noting her staunch support for Ukraine. “I think she’s very pro-European.” </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Spanish PM pushes back on Trump's defence comments</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Meanwhile, Spanish prime minister <strong>Pedro Sánchez </strong>pushed back on <strong>Trump’s</strong> criticism of European defence spending earlier (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/jan/22/olaf-scholz-emmanuel-macron-france-germany-europe-live?page=with:block-6790b4938f08d392158d6bc7#block-6790b4938f08d392158d6bc7">see 10:19</a>).</p> 
  <p>Speaking to CNBC at <strong>the World Economic Forum</strong> in Davos, where he is due to speak later today, he insisted that “you have to look more broadly to see if a country is committed or not with the security of NATO’s allies.”</p> 
  <p>Spain has increased defence spending by 70% in the last decade while its investment of 30% on new equipment was above the 20% required by NATO, he added.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Reuters</strong> noted that Spain’s defence contribution may very well be 10th largest in absolute terms among the 31 Nato allies, but amounts to an estimated 1.28% of its GDP, the lowest in relative terms. </p> 
  <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Trump specifically picked up on Spain in his comments on defence spending earlier this week, which I brought you yesterday.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Let me bring you just a few more lines from <strong>Tusk’s</strong> speech this morning as he urged Europe to revisit some of its green energy policies and think about a deregulatory push to help European companies compete with US and Chinese rivals.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Let us be courageous and stay away from routines. … [We] should not just read <strong>the Draghi report</strong> and other words of warning, but actually roll our sleeves and start working. We need to change the status quo … propose to Europe a big campaign of deregulation.</p>

  </aside> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s unacceptable that our European energy is the most expensive [in the world]. If it cannot be the cheapest one, at least it should be more or less on the same level as in other countries. … We all want to compete against the US or China, but our energy prices are three times as high. …</p> 
   <p>We are well aware of the potentially disastrous consequences that would follow if we do not act [on climate], but we cannot afford not to be competitive. <strong>If we do go bankrupt as Europe, who will protect the environment instead of us?</strong></p> 
   <p>So, let us put our thinking caps on and conduct a thorough review of all legal acts, including those under the Green Deal. We should identify problems, and have the courage to change those rules that might result in excessively high, prohibitively high energy prices. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said that politicians ignoring calls to review these policies do it at their peril, as “too high energy prices may bring down many democratic governments.”</p> 
  <p>But he closes on a positive note again as he says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>It’s all up to us.</strong> The future is in our hands, not in the hands of the Chinese or the American people.</p>

  <p><strong>Tusk</strong>, a historian by training, also urged Europe to increase its defence spending:</p>

   <p>We spend 5% not on our own security, but also on the security of the whole of Europe. … If Europe is to survive, it needs to be armed. </p> 
   <p>It is not our choice. I’m not a militarist. No one in Poland would like to see another war. We have suffered greatly, most in Europe, and perhaps that is why we understand it so well: in order to avoid repeating history, we need to be armed. </p>

  <p>His speech has at times <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mc2IWZOWXA">a Love Actually-esque vibe</a> about it as Tusk insists that Europe has no reason to feel inferior to or afraid of changes in the US administration.</p> 
  <p>He goes on to talk about how Europe should take pride in its achievements and being “the birthplace of the greatest discoverers, inventors, strategists,” name-checking Alexander the Great, the Vikings, and Columbus (and somewhat on-the-nose reminding everyone that we discovered America).</p> 
  <p>But as he turns to solutions, he picks up more serious language again:</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Much was said over the last 48 hours about <strong>Elon Musk’s</strong> apparent use of a salute banned for its Nazi links in Germany. </p> 
  <p>Do you wonder what the Germans make of it? The Guardian’s <strong>Kate Connolly</strong> looked into this and it’s complicated. Some say it was an unambiguous Nazi salute but others are unsure and say focus should be on Musk’s stated support for far-right.</p> 
  <p>Here is her report.</p>

  <p>Speaking overnight, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> addressed this topic too, saying it <strong>“sounds likely”</strong> that the US would impose sanctions on Russia if they refuse to take part in negotiations on the war in Ukraine. </p> 
  <p>But then he also raised his longstanding grievance about European allies not contributing enough financially.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are talking to <strong>Zelenskyy</strong>, we are going to be talking to <strong>President Putin</strong> very soon, and we will see how it all happens. ... </p> 
   <p>One thing I do feel is that the <strong>European Union</strong> should be paying a lot more than they are paying. </p>

Now, it affect them more than it affects us. <strong>We have an ocean in between.</strong> A little thing in between called an ocean. The European Union should equalise.

 <h2 class="block-title">Morning opening: Scholz travels to Paris for Macron meeting</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Guten tag</em>, <em>bonjour</em>, and good morning. It’s Wednesday, 22 January 2025.</p> 
  <p>German chancellor <strong>Olaf Scholz</strong> is travelling to Paris this morning to meet French president <strong>Emmanuel</strong> <strong>Macron</strong> in what would once be seen as the absolute power meeting at the top of European politics.</p> 
  <p>This time, it is different – to the point that the German weekly Der Spiegel called it <strong>a meeting of two lame ducks.</strong></p> 
  <p>As Scholz struggles to get his message across and trails in the polls ahead of next month’s parliamentary elections and Macron struggles to deal with a near-permanent political crisis domestically, the celebrations of the 62nd anniversary of the <strong><a href="https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/germany/france-and-germany/elysee-treaty/#:~:text=The%20%C3%89lys%C3%A9e%20Treaty%20in%20six%20questions&amp;text=Signed%20on%2022%20January%201963,cooperation%20to%20support%20European%20integration.">Élysée Treaty</a></strong> are likely to be somewhat muted.</p> 
  <p>Still there is plenty to talk about: how to best deal with the small matter of <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, the war in <strong>Ukraine</strong>, and all sorts of questions about <strong>Europe’s position and competitiveness in a dynamically changing world.</strong></p> 
  <p>What makes things worse, though, is that the two do not seem to particularly get along personally. And they are not alone in this.</p> 
  <p>A representative poll of 1203 French adults, <a href="https://allemagneenfrance.diplo.de/resource/blob/2693368/c0899e743c0739616b9c35a73944aa92/2025-01-14-sondage-csa-2024-2025-datei-data.pdf">published last week,</a> shows that for the first time, a narrow majority of the French—51%—actually <strong>do not like Germany that much,</strong> even if they think Franco-German relations are generally good.</p> 
  <p>Two-thirds say they do not know Germany particularly well. When asked about their leading associations with the country, they point to the importance of work, the country’s economic power, and, erm, budgetary discipline, all mentioned by over 80% of respondents. Not particularly inspiring.</p> 
  <p>In a particularly stinging (and, frankly, quite hilarious given the German Embassy in France commissioned the poll) response, the French said that it is all good and well that Germans have a great education system, a strong economy, and inspiring culture, noting the importance of the Franco-German Arte TV channel, but it is... the German language that they see as a particular liability (67%).</p> 
  <p>Politically, you can see how much has changed over the last few years: in 2020, 53% cited France and Germany as the joint leading force for European integration. Four years later, it was a mere 18%. Ouch.</p> 
  <p>But some took the results in good stride. In its morning newsletter, the German business daily Handelsblatt spotted that 40% of the French also associated Germans with arrogance.</p> 
  <p>“Coming from them, it’s surely a compliment?” it quipped.</p>
