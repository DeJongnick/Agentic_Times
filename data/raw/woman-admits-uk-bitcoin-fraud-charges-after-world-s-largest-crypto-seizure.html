<p>A woman has been convicted for her role in a multibillion-pound bitcoin fraud after what is thought to have been the world’s largest cryptocurrency seizure.</p> <p>Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, 45, orchestrated a fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket.</p> <p>She stored the proceeds in bitcoin, but UK authorities made a breakthrough in the case when they raided a Hampstead mansion in 2018 and seized devices from Qian holding 61,000 bitcoins, worth more than £5bn at current prices.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police believe it is the largest single cryptocurrency seizure in the world.</p> <p>Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court on Monday to acquiring cryptocurrency that was criminal property and possessing it between October 2017 and April 2024.</p> <p>She had fled China using a bogus St Kitts and Nevis passport in 2017 and entered the UK, where a year later she attempted to launder the money by buying property with the help of Jian Wen, 43, a Chinese takeaway worker. Wen was jailed for six years and eight months for her part in the scam in May 2024.</p> <p>Qian appeared in court aided by a Mandarin interpreter. She will be sentenced at a later date.</p> <p>Wen had arrived in the UK in 2007 and lived modestly in Leeds between 2011 and 2017 before working at a Chinese takeaway in south-east London. She moved in with Qian at a six-bedroom house in Hampstead Heath, north London, in September 2017.</p> <p>While laundering the proceeds of the fraud, Wen drove around in a Mercedes and flew her son over from China 18 months later to attend a private school.</p> <p>Qian fled after police raided the Hamsptead property, known as the Manor House, and seized a safety deposit box containing digital wallets that held vast sums in bitcoin.</p> <p>Wen insisted she had no idea that the bitcoin came from the proceeds of fraud and claimed Qian had duped her. She said she helped Qian run a jewellery business which had branches in Singapore, Malaysia and China.</p> <p>In January this year a judge ordered Wen to pay back more than £3m within three months or serve another seven years in jail. The recoverable amount derived from the bitcoin and two properties in Dubai.</p> <p>The head of the Met’s economic and cybercrime command, Will Lyne, said: “This is one of the largest money-laundering cases in UK history and among the highest-value cryptocurrency cases globally. I am extremely proud of the team.</p> <p>“Through a meticulous investigation and unprecedented cooperation with Chinese law enforcement, we were able to obtain compelling evidence of the criminal origins of the cryptoassets Qian attempted to launder in the UK … My thoughts are with the thousands of victims defrauded in this scheme.”</p> <p>DS Isabella Grotto, who led the Met’s investigation, said: “Today marks the result of years of painstaking work. When our team located Zhimin Qian, she had been evading justice for five years, and her arrest triggered a complex investigation requiring evidence from multiple jurisdictions and the careful review of thousands of documents.</p> <p>“I am immensely proud of the investigation team and our partners who have worked tirelessly on this case.”</p>
