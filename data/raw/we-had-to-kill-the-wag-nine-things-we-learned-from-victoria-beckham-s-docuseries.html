<p>Two years after David Beckham and Netflix let us into the family’s sprawling Cotswolds home, offering us a glimpse into everything from his legendary football career to his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/apr/28/david-beckham-ocd-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-netflix-documentary">OCD cleaning rituals</a>, the Beckhams (minus Brooklyn, aside from footage of him as a baby) are back on our screens. On Thursday, the streaming giant released Victoria Beckham, a three-part series that follows the pop star turned fashion designer ahead of showing her spring/summer ‘25 at Paris fashion week. There are TikTok dances, tears, a lot of chat about mud, and one big revelation, which you can read more about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/oct/09/victoria-beckham-documentary-review-netflix">here</a>. And now for nine other things we learned from the show.</p> <p><strong>They don’t seem to own any mugs<br></strong>Kitchen cabinets are usually filled with a range of questionable novelty mugs alongside the usual dinnerware, but not at the Beckham headquarters, it appears. Victoria seems to exclusively drink out of sippy cups, including glass and steel versions. She also uses a glass straw with a tiny monogrammed VB – a birthday gift from her parents that her mum, Jackie Adams, reminds her about as Victoria mixes her a gin and Coke. The only time we see Victoria sip from a traditional vessel is when she glugs a glass of red wine before the couple head to a dinner with King Charles. A pretty confident move when wearing white silk.</p> <p><strong>David follows instructions to stand on her right side</strong></p>    <p>It is part of a strategy to make her look less “miserable” when they pose for photographers. The idea came about when Victoria realised that David was always standing on her left. “When I smile, I smile from the left because if I smile from the right I look unwell. So I was smiling … but no one could see it.” Perhaps proof that examining pictures of yourself and having multiple mirrors in a home is not great for self-esteem.</p> <p><strong>She sort of pissed off Donatella Versace<br></strong>In 1997, Victoria attended her very first fashion show when Donatella Versace – whose daughter was obsessed at the time with the Spice Girls – invited her to Milan. After sending a private jet to collect her, Donatella told her to visit the store and pick whatever she wanted to wear to the show. Victoria chose a black leather dress but on the condition they would shorten it and change the sleeves. At the time, Donatella says she thought: “How dare she do it!” But after seeing Posh Spice on the front row at the show, she had to admit: “She knows what works for her body.”</p> <p><strong>Fashion cameos are a power flex<br></strong>For someone who was not originally “taken seriously in the industry”, getting Vogue’s Anna Wintour, the designers Tom Ford, Donatella Versace and Roland Mouret, alongside the photographer Juergen Teller to sit down and talk about your fashion success is quite the trump card.</p> <p><strong>She </strong><strong>‘buried her boobs in Baden-Baden’</strong></p>    <p>After leaning heavily into her WAG aesthetic (all low-cut tank tops, teeny hot pants, and giant bags and sunglasses) at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Victoria ditched it and her <a href="https://graziadaily.co.uk/celebrity/news/victoria-beckham-admits-purchasing-boobs/">“purchased boobs”</a> to “become a much more simpler, more elegant version of myself”.</p> <p><strong>Victoria bought ‘Beckingham Palace’ by herself<br></strong>As Victoria was “richer” than David when they married, she bought them their first home, a sprawling mansion in Hertfordshire. Before moving in, she did a £3m renovation that included the addition of a maze, Disney-themed friezes and an Audrey Hepburn-themed bathroom, resulting in the tabloids quickly renaming the house “Beckingham Palace”.</p> <p><strong>She has spent £70,000 on house</strong><strong>plants<br></strong>Plus an additional £15,000 for someone to water them once a month. To be honest, we are more shocked she loves a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/31/houseplant-clinic-why-is-my-monstera-turning-yellow">monstera</a>.</p> <p><strong>The designer Roland Mouret made her ‘cry a lot’<br></strong>The creator of the “Galaxy dress” mentored Victoria as she pivoted from pop star to fashion entrepreneur. On meeting her, the French designer decided “we had to kill the Wag”. Cue the post-Baden-Baden transformation.</p> <p>Victoria didn’t have formal fashion training so she couldn’t sketch - instead she used to drape fabric around her body to fashion the type of dress she wanted to create. Mouret kept making her re-do them because if he wasn’t tough, then “Victoria Beckham will walk all over me”. Cue multiple tears but eventually a collection of 10 dresses she launched during New York fashion week in 2008.</p> <p><strong>David has a ‘magnificent’ cock<br></strong>Following on from that “Islands in the Stream” kitchen dance and the viral “Be honest” moment from the first docuseries, there is a lot of gentle piss-taking between the couple, who have been married for 26 years. Victoria teases David for wearing fake tan, he attempts to give her some styling advice pre-show. She mocks him for arriving to parties before the hosts and when a team member asks about the size of his chicken coop, without missing a beat Victoria quips: “You should see his cock – it’s magnificent”.</p> <p><em>To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/sep/20/sign-up-for-the-fashion-statement-newsletter-our-free-fashion-email">subscribe to receive Fashion Statement</a> in your inbox every Thursday.</em></p>
