We spin through the headlines and look ahead to Saturday’s seven Premier League fixtures, with team news and breaking stories. Plus updates from the Championship, where Chris Wilder returns for Sheffield United as the Blades face Charlton, and eight other games, including Leicester v Coventry. The first action of the day is the lunchtime kick-off in the Merseyside derby. While Everton have made a positive start to the season, their recent record against their city rivals is lamentable: just two wins in their last 29 league games against Liverpool. What’s more they’ve failed to score in five of their last seven. </p> <p>10.30am</p> <p>World championships live</p> <p>Athletics</p>  <p>A big day ahead for British athletes in Tokyo and <strong>Luke McLaughlin</strong> has all the latest breaking news and headline action. There is certain to be plenty of focus on Katarina Johnson-Thompson at her seventh world championships. Four years ago, the 32-year-old fell agonisingly short of Olympic gold after sustaining an injury in the 200m. The two-time world champion and Olympic silver medallist goes in the javelin (11am) and 800m (1.11pm), the event where she missed out on gold by a mere two seconds the last time she raced in Tokyo. <strong>Sean Ingle</strong> reports.</p>   <p>12.30pm</p> <p>Liverpool v Everton live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Whether you are on the red or blue side of the Merseyside divide, there are promising signs aplenty for Saturday’s derby. With four wins from their opening four league games, Liverpool could win each of their first five matches of a campaign for the third time, after 2018-19 and 2019-20. Everton, meanwhile, have won six of their last 11 away league matches, as many as their previous 30 combined. All six wins have been in 2025 and included a 2-0 win at Anfield. <strong>Barry Glendenning</strong> helms our live blog, with <strong>Will Unwin</strong> at the ground.</p> <p>1pm</p> <p>Azerbaijan GP qualifying live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>Welcome to Baku, where Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc is chasing a fifth successive pole position. “We are historically always in good shape in Baku,” says Ferrari’s team principal, Fred Vasseur. Red Bull could also be back in the mix, with the four-time world champion Max Verstappen winning at Monza from pole. The Dutch driver had a hard time in Baku last year, finishing fifth and one place behind McLaren’s Lando Norris, who had started 15th. <strong>Giles Richards</strong> reports on Saturday’s race for pole. </p>   <p>3pm</p> <p>Premier League clockwatch</p> <p>Football</p>  <p>The action comes thick and fast with a tranche of 3pm kick-offs keeping <strong>Billy Munday</strong> busy at the helm of our live blog. While keeping tabs on Burnley v Nottingham Forest, West Ham v Crystal Palace and Wolves v Leeds, he’ll be focusing on Brighton v Tottenham. The home side completed a Premier League double over Spurs last season. Against that, Tottenham have never before lost three successive visits to the south coast club and are buzzing under their new manager, Thomas Frank. His side kept a fourth clean sheet in the sixth match of his tenure at N17 with a 1-0 victory over Villarreal in their Champions League opener. That followed last Saturday’s 3-0 victory at West Ham, where the future of the Hammers manager, Graham Potter, is again on the line in a London derby against Palace. </p> <p>3.30pm</p> <p>France v England live</p> <p>Women’s Rugby World Cup</p>  <p>The Red Roses’ forward dominance offers the best route to victory in Saturday’s World Cup semi-final against France at Ashton Gate. Of the 38 tries England have scored in their four World Cup matches to date, 22 have been supplied by their hard-charging pack. Hannah Botterman, restored to the front row after recovering from a back spasm, will be a key cog for England and is one of four changes to the side that thumped Scotland 40-8, with the full-back Ellie Kildunne, the fly-half Zoe Harrison and the second-row Abbie Ward also given starts. In a boost for the Red Roses, Kildunne is available after recovering from the concussion that forced the world player of the year to miss the quarter-final. <strong>Lee Calvert</strong> helms our live coverage, with <strong>Sarah Rendell</strong> and <strong>Robert Kitson</strong> our reporting team in Bristol.</p> <p>5.30pm</p> <p>Manchester United v Chelsea live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>Ruben Amorim is clearly not a man for turning, yet his tactical obduracy shows no tangible improvement. The season is barely under way and United have lost two of their four league matches and been humiliated by Grimsby in the Carabao Cup. A sole home victory – against Burnley – was only secured by a Bruno Fernandes penalty in the closing minutes of a 3-2 win. With United thumped 3-0 by Manchester City last time out, it is little wonder that the Portuguese is the latest to find life as manager at Old Trafford an unrelenting misery. By contrast, Chelsea’s have claimed two wins and two draws from their opening four games and have Cole Palmer back from injury. The England international is a key component of Enzo Maresca’s team – he has been directly involved in 73 goals in 100 appearances for Chelsea. The Blues’ midweek Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich will have hurt, though. <strong>Scott Murray</strong> helms our live blog, with <strong>Jamie Jackson</strong> reporting from Old Trafford. </p> <h2>Sunday</h2> <p>8am</p> <p>Matchday live</p> <p>Football</p>  <p><strong>Tom Bassam</strong> and <strong>John Brewin</strong> are your hosts as we look forward to Sunday’s key football action as well as following up on the headlines from Saturday’s fixtures. Our unmissable live countdown will bring you all the buildup to the day’s big games in the Premier League – Bournemouth v Newcastle, Sunderland v Aston Villa and Arsenal v Manchester City – as well as the key WSL fixture, Manchester United v Arsenal. Plus Sunday afternoon’s Scottish League Cup quarter-final as Partick take on Celtic.</p> <p>10.30am</p> <p>World championships</p> <p>Athletics</p>  <p>The final day in Tokyo and <strong>Daniel Harris</strong> will be offering updates from the closing track and field events. Highlight of the evening session is the women’s 800m final, where Great Britain’s Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson is seeking a first world title. The 23-year-old will be joined by her training partner Georgia Hunter Bell – a British one-two in the event would be a spectacular signoff. <strong>Sean Ingle</strong> reports from Tokyo.</p>   <p>12pm</p> <p>Azerbaijan Grand Prix live</p> <p>Formula One</p>  <p>It would be quite a surprise should McLaren fail to secure the constructors’ title in Baku – with seven rounds to spare. The reigning F1 champions have won 12 of 16 races so far, with seven one-two finishes, and are returning to a city circuit where Oscar Piastri, this season’s championship pacesetter, claimed victory last year. Another one-two result would clinch a 10th constructors’ crown for McLaren, and a second in succession, but so too would beating closest rivals Ferrari by nine points, providing Mercedes or Red Bull do not win big. To put it in perspective, Ferrari have outscored McLaren only once and then by only six points in Canada after Lando Norris and teammate Piastri collided, with the Briton retiring. McLaren have scored 22 points more than Ferrari on average in the other 15 races and arrive in Baku with a lead of 337 points and 346 still to be won after Sunday’s race. <strong>Will Magee</strong> is live-blogging the race, with <strong>Giles Richards</strong> reporting.</p> <p>1.30pm</p> <p>Ireland v England live</p> <p>Cricket</p>  <p><strong>James Wallace</strong> has over-by-over coverage of the third and final T20 in Dublin. Phil Salt’s spectacular form is certainly catching the eye. His 89 off 46 balls underpinned a comfortable England chase of 197 to beat Ireland in the first match. That came after a 141 not out against South Africa at Old Trafford the previous Friday, heaping on 230 runs from 106 balls in Manchester and Malahide. After Friday’s washout, they’ll be keeping a close eye on the weather at Malahide.</p> <p>2pm</p> <p> Bournemouth v Newcastle live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p><strong>Simon Burnton</strong> helms our live blog as Eddie Howe returns to his former club seeking to rebound from Newcastle’s 2-0 Champions League disappointment against Barcelona on Thursday evening. The Cherries have enjoyed the upper hand at home – in six league games, they remain unbeaten against the Magpies. What’s more, Howe has yet to beat Bournemouth in six attempts in the Premier League, drawing four and losing two games. <strong>Billy Munday</strong> reports from the Vitality Stadium.</p>   <p>2.50pm</p> <p>Manchester United v Arsenal live</p> <p>Women’s Super League</p>  <p><strong>Emillia Hawkins</strong> has minute-by-minute coverage from Sunday’s key WSL fixture at Leigh Sports Village. Last time out, Arsenal came from behind to make it two wins out of two with a 5-1 victory at West Ham, while United will be on a high after reaching the Women’s Champions League latter stages for the first time after a midweek victory over the Norwegian side Brann thanks to Elisabeth Terland’s hat-trick. <strong>Tom Garry</strong> is our match reporter.</p> <p>4.30pm</p> <p>Arsenal v Manchester City live</p> <p>Premier League</p>  <p>The weekend’s final Premier League fixture features the collision of potential title rivals. Mikel Arteta’s side have started the campaign with vigour, winning three of their first four games and beating Athletic Bilbao in the Champions League. Their record against City is ominous – the Gunners have won two of their last four league meetings, those victories coming in their two most recent encounters. Pep Guardiola’s side have lost five of their last seven Premier League games but bounced back from a poor start with a convincing derby win last weekend. That 5-1 defeat at Arsenal in February must still rankle, however. <strong>Rob Smyth</strong> steers our live blog, with our reporting team of <strong>David Hytner</strong>, <strong>Barney Ronay</strong> and <strong>Ed Aarons</strong> at the Emirates.</p>
