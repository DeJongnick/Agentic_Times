<p>A national system to track childcare worker misconduct is key to keeping children safe, one of Australia’s largest early education providers has said, arguing every worker in every state should be subject to mandatory reporting.</p> <p>It comes amid disagreement among states and territories about moves to ban mobile phones in childcare centres, before a critical meeting of education ministers to decide on new rules about safety training, CCTV and a database to track worker movements.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/20/victoria-childcare-safety-review-recommendations-unveiled-ntwnfb">Childcare needs a ‘fundamental reset’ to improve safety. These are Victoria’s key recommendations</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After several allegations of abuse of children in early education, state and federal governments have been scrambling to update rules and crack down on safety in childcare.</p> <p>Amid several snap state reviews, the federal education minister, Jason Clare, will bring together his counterparts on Friday, where a national register of workers is expected to be agreed.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Attorneys general last week agreed to work toward a nationally consistent working with children check scheme.</p> <p>Dr Ros Baxter, the chief executive of Goodstart Early Learning – which runs more than 650 centres nationwide – said a national system to log worker misconduct was also critical.</p> <p>“We need a national reportable conduct scheme. Five states have these, each operating with different rules. Every person in every state should be subject to mandatory reporting rules,” she told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>Baxter backed a nationally consistent working with children check, raising concerns about employers in some states currently not being notified about problems registered in other states, and the national register of employment histories.</p> <p>South Australia is expected to strongly push for nationally consistent bans for personal mobile phones in centres.</p> <p>SA and Victoria have begun implementing bans on personal mobiles, which will become a national requirement from 1 September, while Western Australia announced it would also soon implement a ban.</p> <p>SA’s early education minister, Blair Boyer, is expected to address Friday’s meeting, outlining how his state will monitor the ban and ensure compliance by childcare services.</p> <p>“South Australia was also the first jurisdiction with Victoria to implement a personal device ban in early learning settings,” he told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>“I’m looking forward to discussing with my state and territory colleagues about how we have rolled this out to ensure all jurisdictions are in line with each other.”</p> <p>Guardian Australia understands that Queensland is more hesitant to implement the mobile phone ban, and has concerns over unintended consequences for some centres.</p> <p>This week, Victoria, South Australia and WA have also committed millions in new funding to update and increase compliance measures.</p> <p>It is understood some major childcare providers are also hesitant to fully back calls for CCTV to be rolled out further, with questions about costs to install and maintain the technology, as well as concerns about keeping camera footage secure and avoiding misuse.</p> <p>The WA early childhood minister, Sabine Winton, said she would also be pushing for immediate actions including mandatory safety training.</p> <p>“I will also be placing strong focus on advocating for building the capacity of the Australian Children’s Education and Care Quality Authority and state-based regulators,” she said.</p> <p>“While all measures to increase child safety should be explored, my focus is on tangible actions that can be implemented now.”</p> <p>NSW and Queensland will be pushing for the national register of childcare workers as the highest priority.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/20/its-time-for-australia-politicians-to-take-childcare-safety-out-of-the-too-hard-basket-and-commit-to-real-reform-ntwnfb">Here is what needs to be done to address Australia’s childcare abuse crisis - and politicians can’t say they didn’t know</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Queensland education minister, John-Paul Langbroek, said a register will be critical to ensuring child safety, promising to, “continue calling for the urgent introduction of a national early childhood educator register at this week’s education ministers meeting”.</p> <p>Meanwhile, NSW will also push for a national register, but the acting minister for education and early learning, Courtney Houssos, said the state would be prepared to move alone if other states weren’t willing to rapidly implement stronger reforms.</p> <p>“While NSW is prepared to act alone if necessary to implement nation-leading reforms that will put children’s safety and wellbeing first, we are also working with other states and the commonwealth to reform childcare regulation at a national level.</p> <p>“This includes work on the proposed register for early childhood educators, which will be most effective if it is implemented nationally.”</p> <p>Baxter said Goodstart also wanted to see the extension of federal incentive payments to childcare workers beyond its December 2026 cut-off to help attract and retain high-quality workers.</p> <p>“Ultimately, the best protection for children remains a stable, well trained workforce and a strong safeguarding culture which welcomes and encourages reporting where any concerns arise.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
