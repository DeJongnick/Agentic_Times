<p>Good afternoon readers. Optus is investigating a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/29/optus-suffers-fresh-triple-zero-outage-in-nsw-as-police-check-welfare-of-callers">fresh triple-zero outage</a>, this time in the Illawarra region of New South Wales.</p> 
<p>The telco said an issue with a mobile phone tower in Dapto had affected calls made between 3am and 12.20pm on Sunday, including those to the triple-zero network. Nine triple-zero call failures were identified, including a caller who required an ambulance.</p> 
<p>It comes after more than 600 households in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were impacted by an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/20/optus-network-outage-in-which-three-people-died-lasted-eight-hours-longer-than-telco-initially-said">Optus triple-zero outage two weeks ago</a>.</p> 
<p>The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said news of the latest outage was “disappointing” and that Australians should still have faith in their ability to call emergency services. “There’s clearly more work to be done,” she told the ABC on Monday.</p>

<p>“This has nothing to do with any migrant or migrant community.”</p> 
<p>The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said she was not worried about speculation Andrew Hastie is after her job and has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/29/sussan-ley-andrew-hastie-immigration-comments-liberal-party-leadership">subtly rebuffed his claims</a> that immigration levels are making Australians feel like “strangers in our own home”. She has blamed the government for not building the infrastructure needed to cope with a growing population.</p>

<h2>Before bed read</h2> 
<p>Blake Johnston’s father was gentle and loving. He never complained about anything. But he wasn’t the first person Johnston knew who died by suicide. And he wouldn’t be the last. Every day, about nine Australians end their lives; three-quarters of them are men.</p> 
<p>“That is a shocking statistic,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/29/dad-extraordinarily-selfless-disciplined-stoic-until-it-all-got-too-much">writes the surfer</a> and mental health advocate. “But nothing can prepare you for the shock when that statistic includes someone you love.”</p>
