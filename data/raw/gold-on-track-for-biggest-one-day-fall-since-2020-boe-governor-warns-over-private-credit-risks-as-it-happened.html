But on each occasion, it ran into resistance around $4,380. That is pretty much what happened this morning. The big question for investors and traders alike is if this the start of a much-needed correction?</p> </blockquote>    <p>But, after its recent parabolic surge, could the top be in for gold?</p> <p><strong>Morrison</strong> says it’s very difficult to know, adding:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Analyst speculation will centre around the shape and extent of this sell-off, as well as giving some consideration as to how long this rally has been going. If you trace it back to the lows hit this time in 2023, then the rally is relatively young. But if you go back to the lows of 2015 as your starting point, it all looks a bit different. The first major test to the downside comes in around $4,000.</p> <p>But it’s also quite possible that this is all we get from the dip, and that buyers come back in around $4,200. It’s really a question of having some patience to see how the situation progresses from here.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-21T15:27:44.575Z">at 4.27pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68f79f408f08ab4b3b4599ab" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-21T15:03:01.849Z">4.03pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Crumbs, gold’s fall is gathering pace – it’s now down 5.2% at $4,126 per ounce.</strong></p> <p>There doesn’t seem to be a single trigger for the selloff, though.</p> <p><strong>Nitesh</strong> <strong>Shah</strong>, commodities strategist at <strong>WisdomTree</strong>, has suggested:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Gold prices are still yet to go much higher, but the speed is being a bit aggressive and as a result of that, we will get pullbacks each time we hit those fresh highs.”</p> </blockquote> <p>By my maths, this is now the biggest one-day drop since 11 August 2020.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-21T15:14:42.259Z">at 4.14pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68f78e818f082fc3b1775d82" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-21T13:59:43.597Z">2.59pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Gold on track for biggest fall since 2020</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Back in the precious metals market, gold is on track for its biggest one-day fall in over a year.</strong></p> <p>Bullion has dropped by over 4% so far today to $4,175 per ounce, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/07/gold-futures-prices-economy">a blistering rally that reached a series of fresh record highs fades</a>.</p> <p>That would be its biggest one-day fall since 9 November 2020, the day when Pfizer and BioNTech announced that their Covid-19 vaccine was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/09/covid-19-vaccine-candidate-effective-pfizer-biontech">90% effective in trials</a>, triggering a surge into shares.</p> <p>Gold has been a traditional safe-haven away from risky assets, and has also benefited from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/09/the-debasement-trade-is-this-whats-driving-gold-bitcoin-and-shares-to-record-highs">the ‘debasement trade’ where investors move out of fiat currencies and into harder assets</a>.</p> <p><strong>Daniela</strong> <strong>Sabin</strong> <strong>Hathorn</strong>, senior market analyst at <strong>capital.com, </strong>reckons easing trade war tensions have hit gold.</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The upside in gold and silver seems to have run out of steam at the start of the week….

An expected downgrade to the OBR’s long-term growth forecasts will only add to the squeeze. Despite ruling out another £40bn tax grab, fresh tax rises and spending cuts now look unavoidable as she tries to rebuild her £10bn buffer. The IFS estimates she’ll need to find around £22 billion to do so.</p> </blockquote> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/oct/11/rachel-reeves-looks-for-extra-headroom-in-budget-to-insulate-uk-economy-against-bond-market">Rachel Reeves looks for extra headroom in budget to insulate UK economy against bond market</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-21T06:40:52.052Z">at 7.40am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68f728e78f08649afd49dfd3" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-21T06:36:04.957Z">7.36am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Tax take rose in September</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Tax receipts rose last month, partly thanks to Rachel Reeves’s decision to raise taxes on businesses, but it wasn’t enough to bring the deficit down.</strong></p> <p>Today’s public finances report shows that central government’s current receipts rose by £6.8bn in September to £86.2bn.</p> <p>That was partly due to a £3.2bn increase in compulsory social contributions, to £16.9bn, following the increase in employers’ national insurance contributions in April.</p> <p>There were also increases of £1.3bn in Income Tax, £1.0bn in Value Added Tax and £700m in Corporation Tax receipts.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-21T06:36:19.145Z">at 7.36am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68f724158f084228cf842261" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-21T06:27:49.911Z">7.27am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK borrowed £20.2bn in September</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>In September alone, UK borrowing rose to £20.2bn, as</strong> <strong>the public sector spent more than it received in taxes and other income last month.</strong></p> <p>That’s £1.6bn more than in September 2024 and the highest September borrowing since 2020.</p> <p>Nearly half of that deficit was due to the cost of servicing the existing national debt, after a rise in inflation pushed up the interest bill.</p> <p>The ONS explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>central government debt interest payable increased by £3.8bn to £9.7bn, with movements in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) adding volatility to the monthly debt interest costs.</p> </blockquote> <p>Today’s public finances also show:</p> <ul> <li><p>central government departmental spending on goods and services increased by £2.6bn to £38.3bn, as pay rises and inflation increased running costs</p></li> <li><p>net social benefits paid by central government increased by £2.0bn to £27.5bn, largely caused by inflation-linked increases in many benefits and earnings-linked increases to State Pension payments</p></li> <li><p>payments to support the day-to-day running of local government decreased by £1.1bn to £10.0bn; these intra-government transfers are both central government spending and a local government receipt, so they have no effect on overall public sector borrowing</p></li> </ul> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-21T06:59:12.034Z">at 7.59am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68f723028f08ae83a2058ad4" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-21T06:20:49.148Z">7.20am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">UK borrowing this financial year is highest since 2020</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Newsflash: UK government borrowing has hit its highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in the first half of this tax year, eating into chancellor Rachel Reeves’s headroom.</strong></p> <p>The Office for National Statistics has reported that the government has borrowed £99.8bn so far this finanical year – which is £11.5bn more than in April-September 2024.</p> <p>That’s the second-highest April to September borrowing since monthly records began in 1993, after that of 2020.</p> <p>The problem for Reeves is that this is £7.2bn more than the £92.6bn forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility back in March.
