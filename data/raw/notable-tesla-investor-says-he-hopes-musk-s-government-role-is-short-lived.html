<p>A devoted investor in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>’s Tesla – and once a<strong> </strong>close childhood friend of the US president’s eldest son and namesake – says he hopes the world’s richest man’s role in cutting federal spending for Donald Trump’s administration is “short-lived” and that he returns to managing his businesses.</p> <p>Investment manager Christopher Tsai, whose firm has tens of millions of dollars tied up in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/mar/14/tesla-trump-trade-war-harm-car-companies-elon-musk-tariffs">Tesla</a>, said the stock market had demonstrated clear signs of displeasure with Musk’s activities at the so-called “department of government efficiency”. And in an interview with the Guardian, Tsai said: “I hope his involvement with [Doge] is short-lived so he can spend even more time on his businesses.”</p> <p>The chief investment officer and president of Tsai Capital, which reportedly manages a portfolio of about $137m, made it a point to say that his stated hope does not constitute a loss of faith in Musk or his company’s earning potential, despite opinion polls establishing the Tesla boss’s unpopularity with the American public and his net worth evidently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/03/11/a-timeline-of-elon-musks-terrible-24-hours-a-dark-day-for-x-tesla-and-more/">tumbling</a> about $23bn in recent days.</p> <p>Tsai said the stock markets also reacted negatively when Musk bought Twitter, the social media platform now known as X, in 2022 for $44bn. Yet he said Tsai Capital – which holds about 75,000 shares in Tesla as of its most recent quarterly filings – had made more than six times its money since first investing in the company in February 2020, even with the downturn in performance of late.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/14/trump-musk-white-house-tesla-boycott">A president touting Musk’s cars from the White House shows this: the Tesla boycott really irks him | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tsai recently told his investors in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsai-capital-views-tesla-tsla-142844025.html">a letter</a> that his firm considers Tesla to be more of a creator of advanced electronics and software that it attaches to cars rather than a traditional automotive manufacturer and he insisted that the EV maker remained “on a path to become one of the most valuable companies on the planet”.</p> <p>Nonetheless, he said “the market … reacting unfavorably to Elon Musk’s recent involvement in politics” was real. And though he said he thought Musk’s self-professed belief that government reforms are needed was genuine, Tsai expressed a hope that the Tesla boss’s role in Doge ultimately proved to be like other temporary commitments he had previously taken on.</p> <p>Tsai’s comments on what is his firm’s largest holding come at a time when Musk – who prominently supported Trump’s successful run for a second presidency – has advised the White House on the widespread firings of government employees and the dismantling of various services. Those services include US humanitarian aid and development work, with experts warning that their elimination could have life-threatening consequences.</p> <p>If a CNN poll conducted by the research firm SSRS is any indication, such measures have not gone over well with the public. The <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25558091/cnn-poll-trumps-performance-and-economy.pdf">survey</a> showed 53% of Americans disapproved of Musk, and 35% approved – leaving him about 18 points underwater.</p> <p>Those results were <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25558091/cnn-poll-trumps-performance-and-economy.pdf">released</a> on Wednesday, two days after Tesla’s stock fell more than 15% amid public protests against the company and vandalism reported at some of the brand’s dealerships.</p> <p>Tsai’s descent from a lineage of legendary investors sets his voice apart from some of the others who have weighed in on Musk, Doge and Tesla at the two-month mark of the second Trump presidency.</p> <p>His paternal grandmother was Ruth Tsai, who became the first woman to trade on the floor of the stock exchange in Shanghai, China, in 1939 during the second world war. Her earnings helped her send her son – Tsai’s father, Gerald – to college in the US, where he ultimately settled and made a name for himself as a financier and fund manager.</p> <p>Gerald Tsai Jr also eventually became the chief executive officer of the financial services giant Primerica, which – along with its subsidiary Commercial Credit Group – helped build Citigroup, as the New York Times has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-11tsai.14414279.html">reported</a>.</p> <p>A notable aspect of Tsai’s trajectory was his father’s acquaintance with Trump when the latter was primarily a real estate mogul in Manhattan. The families were close enough that, in his youth, Tsai considered Donald Trump Jr his best friend, vacationing with him and once going to a baseball game with his siblings, their mother and their father.</p> <p>Tsai said the younger Trump was one of the first people to whom he came out as a gay man, doing so before he did to Gerald. “That’s cool,” Tsai recalled Trump Jr telling him, while he said Gerald took a longer time to accept it.</p> <p>A registered Democrat, Tsai said he had not had “a meaningful conversation with any member of” the president’s family since a lunch with Donald Jr in January 2014 – more than two years before Trump Sr clinched the Republican White House nomination and won his first presidency. Tsai said they just “went in different directions” as the Trumps moved into politics, and their family patriarch aligned himself closely with Musk as he clinched the White House a second time in November’s election.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the elder Tsai, who married and divorced four times and once survived crashing in a helicopter into New York’s Hudson River before his death in 2008, did not pass on much of his larger-than-life personality to Christopher.</p> <p>The younger Tsai for instance has been married to his spouse – with whom he is raising teenaged twins – since 2005.</p> <p>But, as Christopher put it, Gerald Tsai Jr did teach him to learn about – and love – trading stocks in his childhood. He began investing at 12 and started his capital firm in 1997 at age 22.</p> <p>Tsai said some of the principles to which he adheres – whether as a philanthropic donor to artistic as well as environmental causes – were inherited from the first Chinese American to be CEO of a Dow Jones Industrial company.</p> <p>“My father would say you have to do deep work in order to figure out where value is and to uncover great situations,” Tsai said. “Our job as investors is to figure out what’s real, what’s not real, what that’s worth, what’s priced into the stock and where the company’s valuation is going.”</p>
