Simply <em>magnifique </em>for club and country.</p>    <h2><strong>Women’s player of the season</strong></h2> <p>Ilona Maher (Bristol Bears). In terms of popularising women’s rugby <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/02/premiership-womens-rugby-union-gloucester-hartpury-bristol-match-report">she is doing a fabulous job</a>. “The impact she’s had on the game as a whole is pretty phenomenal,” said her club captain, Amber Reed.</p> <h2><strong>Best comeback</strong></h2> <p>Leicester conceding 80 points in Toulouse in January and bouncing back to make the Premiership final in June.</p> <h2><strong>Most influential Premiership players</strong></h2> <p>1 =) Finn Russell (Bath), Thomas du Toit (Bath), Ben Spencer (Bath).</p> <h2><strong>Coaches of the season</strong></h2> <p>1) Johann van Graan (Bath).</p> <p>2) Michael Cheika (Leicester).</p> <p>3) Yannick Bru (Bordeaux).</p>    <h2><strong>Best interviewee</strong></h2> <p>An <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/01/rugby-union-england-autumn-series-ellis-genge-new-zealand">audience with Ellis Genge</a> is never dull.</p> <h2><strong>Success stories</strong></h2> <p>1) The rebirth of the Premiership as fast-paced sporting entertainment.
