<p>On the back of hailing US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities as a “victory for everybody”, president Trump has claimed success at the Nato summit in The Hague, praising the commitment by Nato allies to boost defence spending to 5% of GDP.</p> 
<p>The US president described the summit as “a very historic milestone”. It was, he said, “something that no one really thought possible. And they said: ‘You did it, sir, you did it’. Well, I don’t know if I did it … but I think I did.”</p> 
<p>The US president also received sycophantic praise from Nato secretary general Mark Rutte who, referring to Trump’s foul mouthed outburst about Iran and Israel a day earlier, said rather remarkably: “Daddy sometimes has to use strong language”.</p>
