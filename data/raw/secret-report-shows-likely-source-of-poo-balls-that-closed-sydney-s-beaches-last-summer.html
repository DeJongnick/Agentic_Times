<p>A secret report reveals the likely source of the fatberg balls that closed a raft of Sydney beaches last summer – with most coming from the deepwater ocean outfall at Malabar.</p> <p>The partly redacted scientific report, obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, points to a combination of heavy rains and a buildup of fats, oils and greases as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jan/15/ball-shaped-debris-washes-up-at-sydneys-bondi-coogee-maroubra-and-cronulla-beaches">likely cause of the “poo balls”</a> being discharged from outfalls at Malabar, Bondi and North Head.</p> <p>The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) said on Friday that subsequent evidence “collected by Sydney Water … narrowed the origin of the debris to within the Malabar system”.</p> <p>“Sydney Water’s Malabar wastewater treatment system has been identified as the likely source of debris balls that washed up on NSW beaches between October 2024 and February 2025,” the EPA said in a statement.</p> <p>Authorities were unable to say when balls could wash up again – but were urgently working on solutions.</p> <p>“We do believe that fat is accumulating somewhere in the system. We know [it’s] in the pipes, definitely, [but] we’re unsure of its whereabouts specifically,” Sydney Water’s environment manager, Ben Armstrong, told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>The secret report notes that the debris balls “are assumed to be of a sewage origin” and their “discharge is most likely to be from an outfall, but the stormwater system may also be implicated”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/01/pumping-sewage-into-the-sea-has-long-been-a-sydney-thing-and-even-32bn-wont-change-that">Pumping sewage into the sea has long been a Sydney thing – and even $32bn won’t change that</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Fats, oils and greases (FOGs) in the sewerage system provide the ‘stickiness’ for the debris balls. They possibly adhere to the sides of pipes. Particulate material may then stick to these FOGs,” the oceanographic modelling report by WQ Data states.</p> <p>“High rainfall in the year or so leading up to the discharge of the debris balls effectively ‘primes’ the sewerage (or stormwater) system. Within a few days prior to their discharge, further rainfall is sufficient to move the combined FOGs and particles out of the pipes.”</p> <p>Wave action then rolls the combined FOGs and particulate matter into balls. Between October 2024 and February 2025, “the oceanographic/meteorological conditions were suitable for the debris balls to be released and for them to be moved to the Sydney and NSW south coast beaches”.</p>    <p>Work by Sydney Water and the NSW EPA suggested the so-called fatbergs were due to an increased use of vegetable oils, which break down slowly, an increase in food outlets and the overall growth of the city’s population.</p> <p>The EPA previously said testing revealed the balls were consistent with human-generated waste such as grease and faecal matter.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>There are particular concerns about the Malabar sewage treatment plant. The EPA said on Friday that its independent expert panel reviewed the new evidence in September, and “recommended Sydney Water undertake further investigations and actions to pinpoint potential sources of the debris within the Malabar system”.</p> <p>“There are global issues about fatbergs and sewers, and it’s effectively the same thing,” the chair of the EPA’s advisory panel, and an independent expert, Prof Stuart Khan said.</p> <p>“This particular sewer [at Malabar] has had a long time for fats, oils and grease to build up.</p> <p>“There’s nearly 2 million customers in that system, and over the past 10 years, not only has there been growth in population using that system, but also increasing numbers of food outlets that may or may not have appropriate trade waste licences in place or the right infrastructure in terms of grease traps and things to be preventing runoff of fats, oils and grease.”</p> <p>The release of the oceanographic report, commissioned by Sydney Water, suggests the state-owned corporation could have known as early as 3 February 2025 that the debris balls were likely from its ocean outfalls. That is the date of the “preliminary draft”. The final report was completed in late May.</p> <p>Guardian Australia first reported in October 2024 that a team of scientists was investigating whether the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/18/tar-balls-sydney-beaches-update-coogee-bondi-suspected-oil-spill">balls could be linked to sewage</a> and whether they could have come from water treatment plants.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/09/nsw-regulator-chose-to-reveal-content-of-sydneys-mystery-beach-balls-on-day-of-us-election">EPA chose to reveal the content</a> – but not the source – of the beach balls on the day of the US election in November. At that time, Sydney Water told Guardian Australia the debris balls “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/09/nsw-regulator-chose-to-reveal-content-of-sydneys-mystery-beach-balls-on-day-of-us-election#:~:text=A%20Sydney%20Water,our%20wastewater%20discharges.%E2%80%9D">did not form as a result of our wastewater discharges</a>”.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/04/sydney-sewage-treatment-plants-debris-balls-epa-investigation">EPA publicly confirmed their potential origin in April</a> 2025 when it issued a preliminary investigation notice to Sydney Water.</p> <p>Since then, the two agencies have been conducting urgent studies to ascertain the extent of the problem.</p> <p>Sydney’s sewage system relies on three “deepwater ocean outfall” pipes that run up to 4km out to sea at Malabar, Bondi and North Head. The sewage receives primary treatment to remove some solids and is then pumped through pipes, exiting through diffusers 60 metres below the surface, where the plume mixes with seawater.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/01/archive-zip/giv-4559IDEWJnL32Jql/" data-alt="Treatment plants map"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2025/01/archive-zip/giv-4559IDEWJnL32Jql/">Interactive</a> </figure>  <p>Prior to 1990, Sydney’s sewage was discharged from the bottom of the cliffs near the plants, just a few hundred metres out to sea. Pollution was a regular phenomenon, particularly after rain, with faecal contamination and other rubbish regularly washing on to beaches.</p> <p>The ocean <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-16/where-sydney-sends-its-sewerage/6945904">outfalls were highly successful in improving water quality,</a> with faecal contamination becoming almost negligible except immediately after rain, when stormwater runoff sometimes caused problems.</p> <p>But the growth in population, food outlets and industry, particularly in Sydney’s west, is causing a buildup of fats, oils and greases in the system which threatens to overwhelm it.</p> <h2>The oceanographic study</h2> <p>The study commissioned by Sydney Water, which mapped oceanographic currents and winds, traced the balls back to more than one of the three major sewage outfalls.</p> <p>It hypothesises that heavy rain about six months prior to the discharge of the balls, which occurred between October 2024 and January 2025, primed the system and further heavy rain then dislodged the fatbergs.</p> <p>“No single discharge from a single origin could be responsible for the appearance of the debris ball on all beaches between October 2024 and February 2025,” the final report from May stated.</p> <p>“Ten (or perhaps more) discharge events may be responsible for the observed debris balls on the beaches during this period.”</p> <p>The report studied 10 incidents. The first balls were found on Coogee beach in October 2024. Subsequent incidents occurred at other eastern suburbs beaches and Botany Bay, Manly, the northern beaches and on the south coast.</p> <p>The report and subsequent studies raise the question of whether Sydney Water’s sewage system has reached its limits and whether debris balls will return to the beaches this summer if rainfall conditions are repeated.</p> <p>“We’ve had rainfall events and pulses going through the system without having debris balls previously, to our knowledge,” Khan said.</p> <p>“So we’re trying to find out: why now? And why only sometimes now? Why not after every wet weather event? There are questions around whether the catchment to the sewer is changing, and therefore whether or not it’s something that we’re going to see more often. If that’s the case, then better controls over what goes into the sewer will be important.”</p>    <p>There are concerns about what is lurking in the deepwater outfall pipes.</p> <p>Sydney Water can inspect other parts of the system, but is unable to inspect these pipes, which are 35 years old. To undertake maintenance would require decommissioning the outfalls and reverting to releasing barely treated sewage at Sydney’s cliffs.</p> <h2>The solution</h2> <p>Armstrong said Sydney Water’s “Save our sinks” campaign encouraged businesses and households to avoid putting oils and fats, milk, coffee grounds and other solids down the sink.</p> <p>Changing consumer behaviour was an important part of the solution, he said. Maintenance was also crucial.</p> <p>Julian Thompson, operations manager at the Environmental Protection Authority, said Sydney Water had “a fairly stringent” maintenance program, particularly around the Malabar catchment.</p> <p>“They spend quite a lot of money on desilting their sewers. They have crews that can get into those pipes. It sounds like a pretty unpleasant job, but they’re basically within those large pipes … taking out fats, oils and greases, taking out wet wipes and other things that block up sewers.”</p> <p>The longer-term solutions require greater investment and some hard decisions for the NSW government.</p> <p><strong>“</strong>What we’re currently doing now is not sustainable – discharging 80% of the sewage produced by 5 million people into the ocean after only primary treatment,” Khan said. “Every drop of water we send out into the Pacific Ocean is wasted water.”</p> <p>Sydney Water was looking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/feb/01/pumping-sewage-into-the-sea-has-long-been-a-sydney-thing-and-even-32bn-wont-change-that#:~:text=Between%202024%20and%202033%2C%20a%20new%20treatment%20plant%20or%20%E2%80%9Cwater%20resource%20recovery%20facility%E2%80%9D%20(WRRF)%20is%20scheduled%20to%20be%20built%20in%20Camellia%20in%20western%20Sydney.%20Other%20purified%20recycled%20water%20schemes%20will%20be%20expanded%20or%20constructed%20at%20Quakers%20Hill%20and%20Liverpool.">expand or build water resource recovery facilities</a> which take sewage, highly treat it and render it suitable for reuse.
