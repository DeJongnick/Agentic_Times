This was the close contest that the series needed. Bosch and Rabada were terrific, Markram bowled well. Earlier it was Ellis, Hazlewood, Zampa and Maxwell who kept a lid on South Africa’s batting after Brevis again threatened to blow it off. But in the end, it was Maxwell’s experience that saw Australia home with the bat. The creativity and flourish is still there, but also a player who knows this format back to front.</p> <p>It’s been fun, thanks for keeping us company. We’ll be back for the one-day series in a few days. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68a0800e8f083c08b2003b0e" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-16T12:57:58.755Z">1.57pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>20th over: Australia 173-8 (Maxwell 62, Zampa 0) </strong>Glenn Maxwell saves the game and the series. 62 from 36 balls tonight, eight fours, only hit a couple of sixes unlike some of his knocks.

Another high full toss, this time at the body, arrowing in at the upper thigh, but Maxwell somehow sends it soaring down to deep third! How do those angles work? He reverses the bat, has it facing up, and deflects that ball using Ngidi’s pace. Having short third up in the circle is a bad move to Maxwell, at any time. He makes full use of it.

No-ball from Rabada, it slips out of his hand and lobs over Maxwell to the keeper on the full. Rabada stares at his palm like he’s looking for his fortune. His immediate future is going to include bowling a free hit… <strong>and Maxwell smacks it for six!</strong> Another high full toss, but just legal, and Maxwell can throw the entire kitchen at it. Dot ball to follow, but then Maxwell plays a little uppercut, backing away to get space to play the short ball, and accounting for the lack of pace by holding the bat in place rather than swinging it. That gets the angle fine for four, beating the deep third fielder. A single and his milestone comes up, and he’s played well for it, found his touch. Was that celebration Maxwell impersonating a crocodile? Is that a north Queensland reference? Bob Katter joke? We’ll find out someday.</p> <p>Dwarshuis turns over strike with a bottom edge, his first run, and Maxwell clips another very deliberate two, with soft hands. <strong>That means 12 from 12 balls required.</strong></p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-08-16T12:50:58.033Z">at 1.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68a07b0b8f08609ca0a74fc0" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-16T12:38:25.950Z">1.38pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>17th over: Australia 146-6 (Maxwell 39, Dwarshuis 0) </strong>Bosch is back.

Contact at last, Maxwell slices two runs. But a brilliant yorker follows, between the batter’s legs! Gets his front foot out of the way, trying to squeeze it behind square, but can’t. Sliced drive for one through point to end the over, fantastic from Bosch, only cost his team four runs. </p> <p><strong>We’re back out to 27 from 18 balls.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68a079a48f08609ca0a74fb9" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-16T12:33:50.913Z">1.33pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>16th over: Australia 142-6 (Maxwell 36, Dwarshuis 0) </strong>Ngidi is back, pace off to begin, and Maxwell tries for two with a dink through square, but has to bail on the second.

Maxwell waits for the slower ball… <strong>and reverse sweeps it for four!</strong> Ngidi, if you’re going to bowl like a spinner, I’ll hit you like one: that’s the message. Down on one knee, times it perfectly. Then a smart hit with the fielders right back, chips it into the midwicket gap and yells for two, makes it this time.

Has hit plenty in the Big Bash, hit a big one the other night in the second match. But maybe Maxwell wants the pace? <strong>Because he hooks the next ball for six!</strong> Clean as you like. Way back into the crowd, just behind square. </p> <p>Maxwell is beaten by the fifth ball, trying to nurdle it square, but keeps strike from the sixth. <strong>They need 40 from 30.</strong> Carey, 12th man, comes out in the bib to chat to Maxwell, who nods. </p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68a0785a8f083c08b2003ae8" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-08-16T12:25:01.035Z">1.25pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>14th over: Australia 122-6 (Maxwell 17, Dwarshuis 0) </strong>Two for two in the over!
