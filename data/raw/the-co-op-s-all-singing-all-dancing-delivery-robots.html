<p>Starship Technologies’ robot delivery vehicles (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/04/delivery-robots-skype-co-founder-ahti-heinla-starship">‘Delivery robots will happen’: Skype co-founder on his fast-growing venture Starship, 4 October</a>) were introduced to&nbsp;Sale, Greater Manchester, by Co-op stores about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/15/co-op-hires-delivery-droids-to-drop-groceries-in-greater-manchester">two years ago</a>. Though their use has dwindled&nbsp;(their size limits them to smallish deliveries), a few still cluster outside each Co-op. </p> <p>They have a charm of their own, and I&nbsp;feel quite maternal about them. I&nbsp;worry about their safety and have&nbsp;escorted a robot across a pedestrian crossing so that the cars would stop for it.</p> <p>They can sing too! Once, the dog and I caught up with a robot which (I am tempted to write “who”) was struggling up a very small incline. When it finally made it to the top, it stopped, as if to catch its breath. “Oi,” I told it, “Do something. I’m trying to video you.” It trundled a short way up the path, turned, and, singing Baby Shark, zigzagged back&nbsp;towards me.</p> <p>My video was hopeless. The dog was tugging at the lead and barking frantically. Whether her behaviour was because of the performance or the&nbsp;sight of another dog further away, I do not know.<br><strong>Nell Steele</strong><br><em>Sale, </em><em>Greater Manchester</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
