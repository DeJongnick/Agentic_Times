<p>The wise among us would never forgo our <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/jun/26/11-best-sunscreens-spf-solid-mineral-body-face-children-transparent-oily-dry-skin-hair">safe-sun protocol</a>, but there’s no denying that many of us feel happier and healthier with a tan. The irresistible lure of sunkissed skin has long been a summer staple – and from tanning waters to wipes, instant tans to gradual tanning moisturisers, there are now more ways than ever to get a faux glow.</p> <p>There’s also been a growing demand for multitasking beauty products, so the newest fake tan formulas often add skincare benefits alongside the bronze. Self-tans infused with hyaluronic acid, niacinamide and vitamin C hydrate, nourish and protect much like your usual body cream or facial serum.</p> <p>As with all skincare, there’s no one-size-fits-all; what works for you very much depends on your skin tone and type, not to mention the time you have to perfect your glow. While clear tanning waters and fast-drying mousses are great for developing a golden tan overnight, you can find even more express options in the form of serums or drops, so you can float into the office just a few hours later with a post-holiday-worthy glow.</p> <p>Then there are the gradual tanners – the hydrating moisturising lotions that reign supreme in the world of the budget self-tan. These are great for beginners, letting you build your glow slowly – apply Monday to Friday, and by the weekend you’ll have beautifully bronzed skin. To help you pick, I tested my way through the noise to find the products that will give you a seamless sunkissed colour.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/23/best-mascara-uk">The best mascaras for longer, fuller and fluttery lashes: 10 favourites worn and rated by our beauty expert</a> </p> </aside>  <p>***</p> <h2>At a glance</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Best fake tan overall:</strong><br>Bare by Vogue Williams clear tan water<br><a href="https://www.debenhams.com/product/bare-by-vogue-clear-tan-water_ydd14022"><sub>£22.50 for 150ml at Debenhams</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best budget fake tan:</strong><em><br></em>Boots Glow tanning milk<br><a href="https://www.boots.com/boots-glow-tanning-milk-300ml-10321270"><sub>£6 for 300ml at Boots</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best fake tan drops:</strong> <br>Caudalíe Self-Tan sun drops<br><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/caudalie-vinobronze-self-tan-sun-drops-15ml/p113272682"><sub>£19 for 15ml at John Lewis</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best fake tan for mature skin:</strong><br>St Tropez Luxe body serum<br><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/St-Tropez-Luxe-Body-Serum-Self/dp/B0BLVXTVQQ/?&amp;tag=gnm17-21"><sub>£12.50 for 200ml at Amazon</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best gradual tan:</strong><br>This Works Perfect Legs gradual tan<br><a href="https://www.thisworks.com/products/perfect-legs-gradual-tan"><sub>£33.60 for 150ml at This Works</sub></a></p></li> <li><p><strong>Best fake tan with a mitt:<br></strong>Bali Body Deep Violet self-tanning mousse<strong><br></strong><a href="https://uk.balibodyco.com/products/deep-violet-self-tan-mousse"><sub>£37 for 200ml at Bali Body</sub></a></p></li> </ul> <p>***</p> <h2>Why you should trust me</h2> <p>I’m an experienced beauty and lifestyle journalist who’s reviewed and written about everything from LED masks and beauty blenders to mascaras and moisturisers – but I still fear applying fake tan. I love the sunkissed look, though, so gradual tanning moisturisers and drops have become my go-to, and I’ve pretty much tried them all in my quest to replicate that holiday glow at home. I’m also the busy mother of two young boys, so everything in my skincare routine needs to work without fuss. In short, if I’ve found these products foolproof, then I’m sure most others will too.</p> <h2>How I tested</h2>    <p>I’ve used some of the clear tanning waters, serums, mousses, gradual tanning lotions, facial tanning drops and self-tan wipes included here for years (and retested for this piece), while others are new formulas that hit the mark in my testing.</p> <p>With so many fake tan products out there – many of which perform well – it was difficult to whittle this edit down to the 10 best. I spritzed, sprayed and slathered myself in more than 20 self-tan products over five weeks (seriously, my exfoliating mitt has never seen so much action), considering everything from ease of application to colour payoff and staying power, while also noting each product’s texture, fragrance and cost. These are my top recommendations.</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best fake tan for sunkissed skin</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best fake tan overall:<br></em>Bare by Vogue Williams clear tan water</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.debenhams.com/product/bare-by-vogue-clear-tan-water_ydd14022"><sub>£22.50 for 150ml at Debenhams</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://www.boots.com/bare-by-vogue-clear-tan-water-dark-150ml-10338377"><sub>£23 for 150ml at Boots</sub></a></p> <p>Bare by Vogue Williams’ tanning products have garnered hundreds of five-star reviews since launching in 2019. And when the clear tan water, one of its bestsellers, can take you from winter ravaged to suitably summer in as little as four hours, it’s easy to see why.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>I loved this winning formula’s light and subtle scent and, rather surprisingly, it was also one of the most hydrating. Thanks to ingredients such as fruit extracts and aloe vera, skin feels smooth rather than sticky on application, with the lightweight formula drying quickly, with no need to wash off.</p>    <p>The clear tan water sprays out as a colourless foam, meaning you’ll have to work quickly or you won’t be able to use the formula’s glisten to see any areas you might have missed before it dries.</p> <p>I’d usually opt for the medium shade, but tried the dark here and it was perfect. The tan developed evenly over four hours, and three days later, I was still sporting a gorgeous, even golden glow without any dryness. Even my bed sheets were spotless.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> it doesn’t come in a bigger bottle.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> all skin types; those looking for a no-rinse tan<strong><br>Development time:</strong> four to eight hours<br><strong>Is it vegan-friendly?</strong> Yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best budget fake tan:<br></em>Boots Glow tanning milk</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.boots.com/boots-glow-tanning-milk-300ml-10321270"><sub>£6 for 300ml at Boots</sub></a></p> <p>Big-name brands such as Dove and Garnier tend to dominate the gradual tanning category, but this excellent, budget-friendly tanning milk from Boots definitely gives its more popular counterparts a run for their money.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Designed to be applied just as you would a normal body lotion, this light, milky formula melts into skin. It leaves the skin feeling soft and nourished, and with the ever-so-slight hue of honey. And if you’re worried about the smell, don’t be – the uplifting coconut scent on application will transport you to sunnier climes, and it dries to almost fragrance-free.</p> <p>Just one application is enough to see subtle results, so it’s great for tanning beginners or those with pale skin. For a deeper bronzed look, continue applying daily. At just £6 for a 300ml bottle, this is a budget buy that’s hard to beat.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> the coconut scent doesn’t last on the skin – but no scent is better than lingering fake tan smell any day.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> pale skin tones; those looking for a buildable tan<strong><br>Development time:</strong> up to eight hours<br><strong>Is it vegan-friendly? </strong>Yes </p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best fake tan drops:</em> <br>Caudalíe Self-Tan sun drops</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/caudalie-vinobronze-self-tan-sun-drops-15ml/p113272682"><sub>£19 for 15ml at John Lewis</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://www.lookfantastic.com/p/caudalie-vinobronze-self-tan-sun-drops-15ml/15909695/"><sub>£19 for 15ml at Look Fantastic</sub></a></p> <p>With absolutely zero odour, these brilliant and beautifully gentle fake tan drops from French skincare label Caudalíe deliver a sunning-it-up-on-a-yacht glow – with no stickiness, patchiness or marks on your pillow.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it</strong><br>I’ve tried my fair share of tanning drops over the years, but Caudalíe’s drops have fast become a firm favourite. Lightweight and super easy to incorporate into your routine – just add two to six drops to your usual moisturiser – you’ll have an even, radiant glow by lunchtime.</p> <p>Infused with the brand’s signature grape water to deliver an extra boost of hydration, this formula is the perfect base for makeup.</p>    <p>I found two drops super subtle on my skin – four seemed perfect for me – and colour faded naturally over a couple of days, despite using acids in my evening skincare routine. Perfect for a range of skin tones.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> you’ll need to apply six drops or more for a deeper tan.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> all skin tones; those who prefer a more natural-looking finish<br><strong>Development time:</strong> three to four hours<br><strong>Is it vegan-friendly?</strong> Yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best fake tan for mature skin:<br></em>St Tropez Luxe body serum</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.boots.com/st-tropez-self-tan-luxe-body-serum-200ml-10322771"><sub>£23.33 for 200ml at Boots</sub></a><br><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/St-Tropez-Luxe-Body-Serum-Self/dp/B0BLVXTVQQ/?&amp;tag=gnm17-21"><sub>£12.50 for 200ml at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>Trust the OG of fake tan formulas to deliver yet another outstanding self-tanning product. St Tropez’s feather-light serum blends niacinamide with a collagen-enhancing complex to feel super hydrating, and delivers a beautiful, natural-looking finish.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>From the lightweight, non-greasy texture to the subtle floral scent, the Luxe body serum is a dream to apply. Infused with active ingredients such as niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and vitamin B5, the formula works to hydrate, firm, soothe and even tone, making it a great option for all skin types but particularly those with mature skin who want to improve elasticity and reduce the appearance of crepiness. </p> <p>The serum pumps out beautifully, with its lightly golden colour helping to guide application. It blends seamlessly and dries quickly without any tackiness (a huge plus, considering it’s a no-rinse formula). The result? My skin was a natural-looking bronze and felt well nourished.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> the colour is on the subtler side, so you may need a second application if you’re looking for a darker tan.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> an overnight tan; those who want a no-rinse formula<br><strong>Development time:</strong> eight hours<br><strong>Is it vegan-friendly?</strong> Yes</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/apr/13/best-at-home-beauty-treatments-uk">The beauty treatments you can do at home – and the ones you really shouldn’t, according to the experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best gradual tan:<br></em>This Works Perfect Legs gradual tan</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.thisworks.com/products/perfect-legs-gradual-tan"><sub>£33.60 for 150ml at This Works</sub></a><sub><br></sub><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Works-Perfect-Gradual-150ml/dp/B097CRFWL1/"><sub>£40 for 150ml at Amazon</sub></a></p> <p>If you want to ease yourself into the bronzed life, a gradual tan lotion is the best way to do it. This moisturising formula from This Works comes packing shea butter, natural caramel and vitamin C to hydrate and nourish as it gets to work on the colour. And don’t be put off by the name: it’s great for an all-over glow, not just your legs.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Guide colour can be helpful for avoiding missed areas, but it can also be alarming at first glance. Don’t let the deep caramel colour of this product deter you – it blends beautifully into the skin, giving it an instant but subtle tint that darkens over time. The sumptuous, premium-feeling formula absorbed quickly and left my skin soft and velvety as it dried. The combination of geranium and sweet orange oils gives it a pleasant scent, and the slight shimmery finish works well to blur any blemishes.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> it’s a bit pricey for an everyday moisturiser, so you might want to save it for special occasions.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> all skin types; those who want a blemish-blurring instant glow<br><strong>Development time:</strong> four to eight hours<br><strong>Is it vegan-friendly?</strong> Yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2><em>Best fake tan with a mitt:<br></em>Bali Body Deep Violet self-tanning mousse</h2>    <p><a href="https://uk.balibodyco.com/products/deep-violet-self-tan-mousse"><sub>£37 for 200ml at Bali Body</sub></a> </p> <p>There may be more ways to get a faux glow than ever before, but sometimes you just can’t beat the classic mousse and mitt combo. The Bali Body Deep Violet self-tanning mousse is a velvety, whipped formula that’s super easy to apply and gives a rich, olive-toned colour in six to eight hours.</p> <p><strong>Why we love it<br></strong>Formulated with a violet base to counteract yellow and orange undertones, it’s enriched with nourishing oils and tanning boosters for longer-lasting results. This one is definitely for the tanning enthusiasts who want to take their glow to the next level.</p> <p>The mousse glides on effortlessly with the mitt and takes just minutes to absorb into the skin. It’s free of the unpleasant chemical or biscuit-like scent usually associated with tanning products, and promises up to seven days of bold, even colour – and I can report that four days later, it’s still going strong. No orange, no streaks; just a perfect golden glow.</p> <p><strong>It’s a shame that …</strong> it’s a tad more expensive than your average mousse tan.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> medium complexions with yellow or orange undertones<br><strong>Development time:</strong> six to eight hours<br><strong>Is it vegan-friendly?</strong> Yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2>The best of the rest</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2>Dr Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Glow Pads</h2>    <p><a href="https://www.spacenk.com/uk/sun-tan/tanning/self-tanning/alpha-beta-glow-pad-self-tanner-for-body-8-pack-UK200055943.html"><sub>£49 for eight at Space NK</sub></a> </p> <p><strong>Best for: </strong>an express tan for special occasions</p> <p>I can’t resist a multitasker that promises to streamline my tanning routine, so when Dr Dennis Gross launched the Alpha Beta Glow Pads that allow you to exfoliate and tan in one step, I had to give them a go. The waffle-texture towel is infused with glycolic and salicylic acids, vitamin E and phospholipids to smooth, polish and hydrate the skin as it tans. The formula is quick to dry and produces a gorgeous, even colour, without any tell-tale streaks on my bedsheets the following morning. I highly recommend moisturising and using SPF when it dries to protect the colour.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> a tan wipe isn’t the <em>easiest</em> and most sustainable way to apply tan, in my opinion. While I loved the glow this product gave, certain areas were missed, and I was conscious that I was getting a lot of the product on my hands.

The wash-off serum adapts to your skin tone for even coverage, lightly blurs imperfections and instantly makes you look more radiant. At first glance, I was a little concerned by the gold shimmer, but it was super subtle on contact with the skin and the product blended seamlessly without any stickiness. It contains vitamin C, arnica extract and skin-toning coffee butter to nourish the skin, and I loved the sweet coconut and grapefruit scent.</p> <p><strong>It didn’t make the final cut because …</strong> a lot of product transfers on to hands, so I’d highly recommend buffing with a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tanologist-KABUKI-Applicator-Airbrushed-Finish/dp/B08WDN4XRL/">fake tan brush</a> if you can get hold of one.</p> <p><strong>Suitable for:</strong> a quick fix; those who want instant results<br><strong>Development time:</strong> instant<br><strong>Is it vegan-friendly?</strong> Yes</p> <p>***</p> <h2>What you need to know</h2>    <p>***</p> <h2>How to choose the best fake tan for your skin</h2> <p>Opt for a fake tan product that’s suitable for your skin type to help prevent irritation and ensure a longer-lasting tan.</p> <p>“If you’re someone who has particularly dry skin, a lotion would be ideal to lock in moisture, while oily or acne-prone skins should look for non-comedogenic mousses or sprays,” suggests Emily Rose Lansley, facialist, manicurist and tanning expert to A-listers including Florence Pugh and Jourdan Dunn.</p> <p>“If you’re someone who has sensitive skin, look for fragrance-free options to avoid any irritation,” she adds.</p> <h2>How long does fake tan last?</h2> <p>If you’re ready to make winter pallor a thing of the past, you’ll need to put in the work beforehand. Exfoliate with a salt scrub and moisturise 24 hours in advance to create a hydrated base for your tan. This will help prevent a patchy finish and ensure your tan goes the distance. You should also do any hair removal 24 hours before tanning to give your skin time to recover.</p> <p>“Typically, a fake tan will last about five to seven days,” says Lansley. “Moisturising daily with an oil-free moisturiser – this is important, as oil will break down the tan – will keep the skin hydrated and prolong your tan. Avoid chlorine and taking long baths.”</p> <h2>Should you moisturise before fake tan?</h2> <p>Moisturising skin after exfoliating is vital before applying fake tan. “It will prevent your skin from becoming dehydrated and scaly,” says Lansley. “Moisturising also prevents the tan from clinging to dry patches, so pay close attention to areas such as knees, elbows and ankles 24 hours before you tan.”</p> <h2>How to remove fake tan</h2> <p>The best way to lift a fake tan is to exfoliate gently and use a dedicated fake tan remover. These usually include exfoliating acids such as salicylic acid to gently break down the tanning agents and smooth the skin.</p> <p>And to avoid those tell-tale orange palms? “Always wear a mitt when you’re self-tanning, and wash your hands thoroughly after use,” says Lansley.</p> <p>***</p> <p><em>Danielle Wilkins is a </em><em>lifestyle journalist and former </em><em>magazine editor with almost two decades of experience writing about beauty, parenting and all things weddings for some of the biggest names in publishing.
