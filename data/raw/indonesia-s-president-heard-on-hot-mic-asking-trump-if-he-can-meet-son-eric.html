<p>Indonesian president Prabowo Subianto has been heard on a hot mic asking Donald Trump if he can meet with the president’s son Eric, as the leaders gathered in Egypt for a summit aimed at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/israelis-and-palestinians-celebrate-truce-as-trump-promises-new-era-of-peace">securing a lasting peace in Gaza</a>.</p> 
<p>Prabowo appeared to be unaware that a live microphone was recording his conversation as he spoke to the president and referenced a region that is “not safe, security-wise”. He then asks Trump: “Can I meet Eric?”</p> 
<p>Trump says: “I’ll have Eric call. Should I do that? He’s such a good boy. I’ll have Eric call.”</p> 
<p>Eric Trump and his brother Donald Trump Jr both serve as executive vice-presidents of the Trump Organisation.</p> 
<p>Prabowo follows up by telling Trump “we’ll look for a better place”, and Trump says again “I’ll have Eric call you”.</p> 
<p>Prabowo says “Eric or Don Jr”.</p> 
<p>It was not clear in the audio whether the two were referencing the Trump Organisation or any business deals involving the president or his family, but the company opened its first golf club in Indonesia under the Trump name in March, in collaboration with a local company.</p> 
<p>Another property in Indonesia and a resort in Bali are <a href="https://www.trump.com/media/coming-soon">listed on the Trump Organisation’s website as “coming soon”</a>.</p> 
<p>Since returning to office, Trump has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/trump-conflict-of-interest">faced renewed scrutiny</a> of his business interests and accusations that he is monetising the presidency, with potential conflicts of interest emerging through his growing real estate empire around the world.</p> 
<p>Trump handed over management of his businesses to his children, Eric and Don Jr, before returning to the White House and he has no role in day-to-day decision making, according to his company. The arrangement largely mirrors that which he had during his first term from 2017-21, which ethics experts said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/19/donald-trump-businesses-hotels-conflict-of-interest">did not do enough to prevent conflicts</a> between his official duties and his business empire.</p> 
<p>Trump and Prabowo spoke in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh after Trump delivered remarks to a group of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/13/donald-trump-sets-sights-peace-iran-hails-end-war-israel-hamas">world leaders gathered for the summit</a>, in which he declared “peace in the Middle East”.</p> 
<p>The White House and office of the Indonesia president have been approached for comment.</p>
