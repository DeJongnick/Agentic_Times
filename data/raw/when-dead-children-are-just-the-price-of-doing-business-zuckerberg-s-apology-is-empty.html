<h1>When dead children are just the price of doing business, Zuckerberg’s apology is empty</h1>

<p>I don’t generally approve of blood sports but I’m happy to make an exception for the hunting and baiting of Silicon Valley executives in a congressional committee room. But then I like expensive, pointless spectacles. And waterboarding tech CEOs in Congress is right up there with firework displays, a brief, thrillingly meaningless sensation on the retina and then darkness.</p> <p>Last week’s grilling of Mark Zuckerberg and his fellow Silicon Valley Übermenschen was a classic of the genre: front pages, headlines, and a genuinely stand-out moment of awkwardness in which he was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/31/tiktok-meta-x-congress-hearing-child-sexual-exploitation">forced to face&nbsp;victims</a> for the first time ever and apologise: stricken parents holding the photographs of their dead children lost to cyberbullying and sexual exploitation on&nbsp;his platform.</p> <p>Less than six hours later, his company delivered its quarterly results, Meta’s stock price <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/335184c7-4fa4-47b1-9778-d8331eca31c1">surged by 20.3%</a> delivering a $200bn bump to the company’s market capitalisation and, if you’re counting, which as CEO he presumably does, a $700m sweetener for Zuckerberg himself. Those who listened to the earnings call tell me there was no mention of dead children.</p> <p>A day later, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/02/us-airstrikes-iraq-syria-drone-attack">Biden announced,</a> “If you harm an American, we will respond”, and dropped missiles on more than 80 targets across Syria and Iraq. Sure bro, just so long as the Americans aren’t teenagers with smart phones. US tech companies routinely harm Americans, and in particular, American children, though to be fair they routinely harm all other nationalities’ children too: the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has shown Meta’s algorithms <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-vast-pedophile-network-4ab7189">enable paedophiles to find each other</a>. New Mexico’s attorney general is suing the company for being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/jan/31/meta-worlds-single-largest-marketplace-for-paedophiles-new-mexico-attorney-general-facebook-instagram">the “largest marketplace for predators and paedophiles globally”.</a> A coroner in Britain found that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/01/business/instagram-suicide-ruling-britain.html">14-year-old Molly Jane Russell,</a> “died from an act of self-harm while suffering from depression and the negative effects of online content” – which included Instagram videos depicting suicide.</p> <p>And while dispatching a crack squad of Navy Seals to Menlo Park might be too much to hope for, there are other responses that the US Congress could have mandated, such as, here’s an idea, a law. Any law. One that, say, prohibits tech companies from treating dead children as just a cost of doing business.</p> <p>Because demanding that tech companies don’t enable paedophiles to find and groom children is the lowest of all low-hanging fruit in the tech regulation space. And yet even that hasn’t happened yet. What America urgently needs is to act on its anti-trust laws and break&nbsp;up these companies as a first basic step. It needs to take an axe to Section 230, the law that gives platforms immunity from lawsuits for hosting harmful or illegal content.</p> <p>It needs basic product safety legislation. Imagine GlaxoSmithKline launched an experimental new wonder&nbsp;drug last year. A drug that has shown incredible benefits, including curing some forms of cancer and slowing down ageing. It might also cause brain haemorrhages and abort foetuses, but the data on that is not yet in so we’ll just have to wait and see. There’s a reason that doesn’t happen. They’re called laws. Drug companies go through years of testing. Because they have to. Because at some point, a long time ago, Congress and other legislatures across the world did their job.</p> <p>Yet Silicon Valley’s latest extremely disruptive technology, generative AI, was released into the wild last year without even the most basic federally mandated product testing. Last week, deep fake porn images of the most famous female star on the planet, Taylor Swift, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/31/inside-the-taylor-swift-deepfake-scandal-its-men-telling-a-powerful-woman-to-get-back-in-her-box">flooded social media platforms</a>, which had no legal obligation to take them down – and hence many of them didn’t.</p> <p>But who cares? It’s only violence being perpetrated against a woman. It’s only non-consensual sexual assault, algorithmically distributed to millions of people across the planet. Punishing women is the first step in the rollout of any disruptive new technology, so get used to that, and if you think deep fakes are going to stop with pop stars, good luck with that too.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--supporting"> <blockquote> <p>Could there be any possible downside to releasing this untested new technology in a year more people will go to the polls than at any time in history?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You thought misinformation during the US election and Brexit vote in 2016 was bad? Well, let’s wait and see what 2024 has to offer. Could there be any possible downside to releasing this untested new technology – one that enables the creation of mass disinformation at scale for no cost – at the exact moment in which more people will <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/12/2024-elections-around-world/">go to the polls</a> than at any time in history?</p> <p>You don’t actually have to imagine where that might lead because it’s already happened. A deep fake <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/slovakia-election-deepfakes">targeting&nbsp;a progressive candidate</a> dropped days before the Slovakian general election in October. It’s impossible to know what impact it had or who created it, but the candidate lost, and the opposition pro-Putin candidate won. CNN reports that the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/01/politics/election-deepfake-threats-invs/index.html">messaging of the deepfake echoed</a> that put out by Russia’s foreign intelligence service, just an hour before it dropped. And where was Facebook in all of this, you ask? Where it usually is, refusing to take many of the deep fake posts down.</p> <p>Back in Congress, grilling tech execs is something to do to fill the time in between the difficult job of not passing tech legislation. It’s now six years since the Cambridge Analytica scandal when Zuckerberg became the first major tech executive to be commanded to appear before Congress. That was a revelation because it felt like Facebook might finally be&nbsp;brought to heel.</p> <p>But Wednesday’s outing was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-68161632">Zuckerberg’s eighth</a>. And&nbsp;neither Facebook, nor any other tech platform, has been brought to heel. The US has passed not a single federal law. Meanwhile, Facebook has done some exculpatory techwashing of its name to remove the stench of data scandals and Kremlin infiltration and occasionally offers up its CEO for a ritual slaughtering on the Senate floor.</p> <p>To understand America’s end-of-empire waning dominance in the world, its broken legislature and its capture by corporate interests, the symbolism of a senator forcing Zuckerberg to apologise to bereaved parents while Congress – that big white&nbsp;building stormed by insurrectionists who&nbsp;found each other on social media platforms&nbsp;– does absolutely nothing to curb his company’s singular power is as good as any place to start.</p> <p>We’ve had eight years to learn the lessons of 2016 and yet here we are. Britain has responded by <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/38752/the-electoral-commission-is-now-under-government-control.-we-should-fear-for-uk-democracy">weakening the body</a> that protects our elections and degrading our data protection laws to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/changes-to-data-protection-laws-to-unlock-post-brexit-opportunity">“unlock post-Brexit opportunities”</a>. American congressional committees are now a cargo cult that go through ritualised motions of accountability. Meanwhile, there’s a new tech wonder drug on the market that may create untold economic opportunities or lethal bioweapons and the destabilisation of what is left of liberal democracy. Probably both.</p> <p>• Carole Cadwalladr is a reporter and feature writer for the Observer</p> <p>• In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
