<h2>The most WNBA-ready prospect not named Paige Bueckers …</h2> <p><strong>Kiki Iriafen</strong> looks like a plug-and-play forward whose agility, rebounding instincts and face-up scoring will make her an immediate asset. She can defend across positions and has a reliable mid-range game. After transferring to USC, she showcased polish and poise against top-tier competition, traits that will translate quickly to the pro level. Her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOqt4JMTZN8">36-point outburst</a> in the second round of the NCAA Tournament after JuJu Watkins <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/25/uscs-juju-watkins-in-tears-as-apparent-torn-acl-ends-her-ncaa-tournament">went down with a knee injury</a> only solidified her standing. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Dominique Malonga</strong>, and not just because she’s widely expected to be the No 2 pick. At 19, Malonga is set to become the highest-drafted foreign player in WNBA history and defines versatility: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTpuh-NsRxY">she can dunk</a>, her shooting is elite, and she can drive – and she’s nowhere near her peak. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Hailey Van Lith</strong>. The 23-year-old proved to be one of the most dynamic guards in college basketball this season, averaging 17.9 points and 5.4 assists for TCU. She proved as long as the ball is in her hands, she will excel at any level. <strong>OW</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/apr/07/paige-bueckers-uconn-national-title">The national title was a test the great Paige Bueckers didn’t need to pass</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>This will be a good draft for …</h2> <p>This is a strong draft for <strong>versatile wings and combo forwards</strong>. With expansion looming and multiple teams rebuilding, players like Saniya Rivers, Sonia Citron and Justė Jocytė – who can guard multiple spots and handle the ball – will be at a premium. Teams craving flexibility and upside will find plenty of options. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>I’m really intrigued about what the <strong>Washington Mystics</strong> are about to do. They have No 3, 4, and 6 in the first round. This draft class is strong, and Citron and Iriafen are fantastic players if available – both are the two best options in terms of their positions. If the Mystics can, drafting Shyanne Sellers at No 6 would be a steal. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>The Dallas Wings</strong>. Adding Bueckers to a backcourt alongside Arike Ogunbowale immediately vaunts the Wings into the “best backcourt in the league” conversation. Despite losing Satou Sabally in free agency, Bueckers allows the Wings to quickly retool and try to win on the 28-year-old Ogunbowale’s timeline. <strong>OW</strong></p> <h2>Whose stock has risen the most in the last month?</h2> <p><strong>Sania Feagin</strong> has surged into first-round consideration. Given more minutes after Ashlyn Watkins’ ACL injury, the 6ft 3in forward showcased her defensive range and scoring touch for South Carolina’s national runners-up. Long overshadowed by the Gamecocks’ other frontcourt stars, she’s now viewed as a sleeper big who could contribute early, especially for teams thin in the post. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p><strong>Hailey Van Lith.</strong> She was already a strong second-round prospect at the beginning of the season, but she has since proven she fully deserves to be drafted in the first round. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>During an impressive three years at Louisville, <strong>Van Lith</strong> looked every part of a first-round WNBA draft pick. However, a regrettable transfer to LSU left her WNBA future in doubt until she came soaring back on to the scene at TCU this season, helping the Horned Frogs go 34-4 and reach their first Elite Eight. <strong>OW</strong></p> <h2>Who is the best fit for Caitlin Clark in Indiana (if they don’t trade)?</h2> <p><strong>Madison Scott</strong> could be a sneaky-good second-round fit. The 6ft 2in Ole Miss wing is a defensive ace who thrives in transition and doesn’t need touches to make an impact. Clark’s offensive gravity would let Scott feast on cuts and mismatches while giving Indiana another switchable perimeter defender. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>The Fever aren’t likely to be major players in this draft, but there are a few strong options for their second-round picks. <strong>Annika Soltau</strong> would be an awesome addition: she’s tall (6ft 4in) and defensively strong – she doesn’t always get a lot of minutes but when she does, she makes them count. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Sarah Te-Biasu</strong>. Like many players from Montreal, Te-Biasu plays a physical brand of defense despite being just 5ft 5in. Meanwhile, her offensive game progressed this season at Maryland, where she shot 45% from deep and scored in double figures in 12 of her last 15 games, leading the Terrapins to the Sweet 16. <strong>OW</strong></p>    <h2>Which international player could surprise?</h2> <p><strong>Justė Jocytė</strong> has real star potential. The 6ft 1in Lithuanian guard already excels in EuroLeague play, showcasing advanced reads, range and maturity beyond her 19 years. If she joins the WNBA this year, she could crack a rotation by midseason. If stashed, she’s still one of the class’s better long-term bets. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>I am definitely surprised by any mock draft that doesn’t have <strong>Ajsa Sivka</strong> in the first round. She’s 6ft 3in and can guard just about anyone on the court, her three-point shooting is exceptional and, like Malonga, she’s only 19 – so there’s plenty of time for her to develop. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Annika Soltau</strong>. The German forward averaged 21.2 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.8 STOCKS for Baden Basket 54 of the Swiss Basketball League, playing so well that she received a call-up to the German national team. There isn’t much precedent for a 20-year-old being that productive overseas, making Soltau a worthwhile bet. <strong>OW</strong></p> <h2>Lower-round gem to watch …</h2> <p><strong>Harmoni Turner</strong> is the mid-major playmaker to watch. The Harvard standout lit up Ivy League defenses and was one of the most efficient pick-and-roll scorers in the country. Her ability to generate offense off the bounce and defend across the backcourt could make her a valuable second-unit weapon. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Turner has made a major name for herself in the last few weeks and <strong>Deasia Merrill</strong> was one of the most exciting players to watch during the NCAA Tournament (which is saying something, considering how well TCU played). <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Te-Hina Paopao</strong>. While Paopao might slip due to being on the smaller and older side of the draft, the 22-year-old guard plays a mature, two-way brand of basketball that saw her shoot 40% from three throughout her five-year college career, including the final two as a starter for Dawn Staley’s South Carolina. <strong>OW</strong></p> <h2>The team who drafted best last year were …</h2> <p>Sure, it would have been hard to screw up, but it’s the <strong>Indiana Fever</strong>, who landed Caitlin Clark at No 1 to pair with 2023 Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston. Clark’s elite shooting and playmaking filled a glaring need and instantly transformed Indiana into a must-watch team with playoff potential. The franchise-altering pick everyone expected. <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>Clearly <strong>the Fever</strong>, full stop. Will there ever be enough words to fully describe Clark’s impact on the WNBA? I am looking forward to Cameron Brink having the opportunity to show the world what she can really do, and also will forever be in awe of the Sky managing to snag Angel Reese at No 7. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Los Angeles Sparks</strong>. Brink looked every bit the modern-day unicorn she was projected to be coming out of Stanford, averaging 2.3 blocks before a torn ACL limited her to 15 games. Rickea Jackson, meanwhile, showcased her on-ball juice by averaging 13.4 points while shooting 49.8% from two and 34.7% from three. <strong>OW</strong></p> <h2>The first round will be:</h2> <p>1) Dallas Wings – Paige Bueckers, guard, UConn<br>2) Seattle Storm – Dominique Malonga, forward-center, France<br>3) Washington Mystics – Sonia Citron, guard, Notre Dame<br>4) Washington Mystics – Kiki Iriafen, forward, USC<br>5) Golden State Valkyries – Saniya Rivers, guard, NC State<br>6) Washington Mystics – Shyanne Sellers, guard, Maryland<br>7) Connecticut Sun – Aneesah Morrow forward, LSU<br>8) Connecticut Sun – Justė Jocytė, guard, Lithuania<br>9) Los Angeles Sparks – Georgia Amoore, guard, Kentucky<br>10) Chicago Sky – Te-Hina Paopao, guard, South Carolina<br>11) Chicago Sky – Sania Feagin, forward, South Carolina<br>12) Dallas Wings – Sarah Ashlee Barker, guard, Alabama <strong>BAG</strong></p> <p>1) Dallas Wings, Paige Bueckers, guard, UConn<br>2) Seattle Storm, Dominique Malonga, forward-center, France<br>3) Washington Mystics, Sonia Citron, guard, Notre Dame<br>4) Washington Mystics, Kiki Iriafen, forward, USC<br>5) Golden State Valkyries, Aneesah Morrow, forward, LSU<br>6) Washington Mystics, Shyanne Sellers, guard, Maryland<br>7) Connecticut Sun, Ajsa Sivka, forward, Slovenia<br>8) Connecticut Sun, Hailey Van Lith, guard, TCU<br>9) Los Angeles Sparks, Georgia Amoore, guard, Kentucky<br>10) Chicago Sky, Saniya Rivers, guard, NC State<br>11) Chicago Sky, Sarah Ashlee Barker, guard, Alabama<br>12) Dallas Wings, Justė Jocytė, guard, Lithuania <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>1) Dallas Wings, Paige Bueckers, guard, UConn<br>2) Seattle Storm, Dominique Malonga, forward-center, France<br>3) Washington Mystics, Kiki Iriafen, forward, USC<br>4) Washington Mystics, Sonia Citron, guard, Notre Dame<br>5) Golden State Valkyries, Saniya Rivers, guard, NC State<br>6) Washington Mystics, Hailey Van Lith, guard, TCU<br>7) Connecticut Sun, Aneesah Morrow, forward, LSU<br>8) Connecticut Sun, Shyanne Sellers, guard, Maryland<br>9) Los Angeles Sparks, Aziaha James, guard, NC State<br>10) Chicago Sky, Georgia Amoore, guard, Kentucky<br>11) Chicago Sky, Justė Jocytė, guard, Lithuania<br>12) Dallas Wings, Sedona Prince, Center, TCU <strong>OW</strong></p>
