<p>A Portrush restaurant chain has been forced to back down on huge price increases after complaints from visitors to the Open. The Ramore Restaurant Group suffered a combination of furious online backlash and ridicule after hiking the price of a chicken pasta dish from £14.95 to £27.95 for Open week.</p> <p>AI generated images online showed local heroes Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke cleaning dishes, alongside commentary suggesting this is what they would have to do to pay a restaurant bill.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/15/what-is-the-point-scottie-scheffler-questions-golf-and-life-before-the-open">‘What is the point?’ Scottie Scheffler questions golf and life before Open</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The company owns Portrush’s Harbour Bar, Ramore Wine Bar, Basalt and Neptune and Prawn. At the Ramore Wine Bar, a chicken and bacon burger rose in price from £7.95 to £17.95. The operators blamed increased costs associated with the Open as cause for the situation.</p> <p>With more than 275,000 spectators expected in town for the Open, price changes would not be regarded as unusual but the scale of Ramore’s alterations drew sharp focus.</p> <p>In a statement, the Ramore Group said it was “aware of recent conversations around pricing during the Open” and as a result had “revised and adjusted” menus immediately.</p> <p>The statement added: “As a family-run business proud to be part of the Portrush community, our goal throughout this week is to deliver the best possible experience and ensure safety for those visiting.</p> <p>“In anticipation of the large influx of guests, we’ve employed over 30+ agency staff to support our kitchens and front-of-house teams, 30+ security personnel operating around the clock to ensure everyone’s safety and more than 20 entertainers performing across our six venues seven days a week.</p> <p>“We have simply been investing more as a business for our customers to ensure enjoyment and safety. Which of course creates additional business bills. We would also like to remind people that there is a family behind this business. A family who are involved every day, trying their very best, and reading every single comment. Everyone can make mistakes, however nobody deserves slander and hatred.”</p> <p>The Northern Ireland assembly member, Cara Hunter, told the BBC: “I think that even if some messaging had been put out to say that prices were increasing, it might have been a little less shocking. I also understand Ramore’s perspective on this.”</p>
