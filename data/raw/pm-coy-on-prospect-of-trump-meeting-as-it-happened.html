  <p><strong>Inaction on climate crisis ‘will be seen as culpable negligence’, Andrew Forrest says</strong></p> 
  <p>The founder and executive chair of Fortescue, <strong>Andrew Forrest</strong>, says the Australian climate risk assessment underlines that countries and companies who “have put their head in the sand” when it comes to fighting the climate crisis will soon be seen as committing “culpable negligence”.</p> 
  <p>Forrest said in a statement on Monday:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Climate action is no longer tomorrow’s problem. Inaction condemns the people we love around us to rising costs, destruction and lost opportunities. The Government’s own, well-anticipated climate risk assessment now makes this obvious to everyone.</p> 
   <p>Some countries and companies have put their head in the sand. This will soon not be seen as excusable inaction. It will be seen as culpable negligence.</p> 
   <p>No community in Australia will be spared the escalating costs of climate change. A recent Nature study directly links more than 200 heatwaves since 2000 to emissions from the world’s biggest carbon polluters.</p> 
   <p>Lethal heat and humidity is closing in and the evidence is everywhere. It includes our own companies. Our business leaders, like government, are becoming directly culpable if we continue to kick the can down the road. We must demand they act.</p> 
   <p>Shareholders, community leaders, all Australians: please no longer allow companies to hide behind vague, conditional 2050 pledges while continuing with business as usual. They are condemning our communities, our workers and our children to face the worst impacts of climate change.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Albanese coy on prospect of Trump meeting</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Albanese was also asked on Sky and the ABC about the prospect of a meeting US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> in coming days.</p> 
  <p>He was coy, but didn’t deny it was possible, though wouldn’t confirm a time. Albanese told the ABC:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’m saying that we will meet when we meet – obviously there are things that occur such as the funeral of course as a result of Mr [Charlie] Kirk’s tragic murder [which] will occur on Sunday, there are a range of events occurring as well that means that the arrangements will be finalised when they are finalised.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Albanese clarified that didn’t mean the meeting had been scheduled for Sunday, but that he mentioned this as another reporter asked him earlier about whether the meeting would occur that day.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I gotta tell you as I go around Australia or indeed anywhere else, it is journalists who are obsessed by this.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p><br>He also wouldn’t be drawn on what he could discuss with Trump, including the US withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement. Albanese was then asked what he described as a “hypothetical on a hypothetical”: If he did meet Trump would he invite him to address the Australian parliament. Albanese responded:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Any US president will always be welcome in Australia of course as our other world leaders.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">PM says PNG defence treaty will be an ‘upgrade’ to security relationship</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Back to the PM in PNG. <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong> is speaking with the ABC now from Port Moresby. He has said that the defence treaty to be signed with PNG on Wednesday will be made public.</p> 
  <p>He will not be drawn on whether PNG “had chosen us over China”, as asked by the ABC presenter, but says that the agreement respects PNG’s sovereignty, despite the concerns of some local politicians.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s certainly an upgrade to the relationship, I will have more to say once we have signed the agreement going forward, I think that’s the respectful thing to do rather than foreshadow it all, it’s an upgrade in our security relationship to a treaty level to the sort of level that we have with the United States and … other allies so it is important going forward.</p> 
   <p>It’s increased interoperability, it’s increased engagement and security relationship … our economic relationship is important and our people to people relations as well.</p> 
   <p>It means that Papua New Guinea is choosing … it’s own interest, going forward, and it’s sovereignty.</p>

  <p><strong>Springwater flows set to resume in Murray Darling</strong></p> 
  <p>Important spring water flows will resume in some areas of the Murray-Darling Basin in New South Wales after the commonwealth lifted a pause on environmental watering in some parts of the state.</p> 
  <p>The Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder had put a statewide temporary stop to environmental flows last month amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/20/legal-stoush-between-nsw-and-commonwealth-halts-crucial-water-flows-into-murray-darling">a legal stoush</a> with the Minns government over how environmental water releases should be interpreted under the NSW non-urban water metering policy.</p> 
  <p>At the heart of the dispute was whether environmental water should be treated as “take” in the same way as water extracted by irrigators and comply with metering rules.</p> 
  <p>Late last week, the state government updated its water management regulations to clarify when river operators need a water licence to release water for the environment.</p> 
  <p>The NSW water minister, <strong>Rose Jackson</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I know the delay on some environmental water flows in the past few weeks has caused concern. That’s why as soon as we found this technical issue, I asked my department to respond as an absolute priority.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In a statement published Friday, the Commonwealth Environment Water Holder Dr <strong>Simon Banks</strong> said the amendment meant the pause on environmental water could be lifted in some circumstances, including scheduled environmental watering for the Macquarie Marshes:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I am now satisfied that our regulatory obligations can be met for planned in-stream, within-channel watering actions in the Barwon-Darling, Lower Darling and Murray. I am also pleased to be able to progress important watering actions in the Macquarie Marshes and the Murrumbidgee.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Banks said while this was good news for the environment and NSW communities, it was likely some other watering actions would need to remain paused “for some time, while NSW works to ensure metering compliance or alternative measurement methods are assured for remaining actions”.</p>

  <p><strong>Australians should be reassured not alarmed about climate risk, Coalition says</strong></p> 
  <p>The federal opposition says now is the time to “reassure Australians” and not for “alarmist language” after the release of a landmark report on the risks of the climate crisis.</p> 
  <p>The national climate risk assessment, released on Monday, revealed the far-reaching social and economic impacts of global heating, including the potential for a surge in heat-related deaths and an increase in the number of coastal communities at risk of flooding, erosion and inundation.</p> 
  <p>In a statement, the opposition leader, <strong>Sussan Ley,</strong> and the acting shadow energy minister,<strong> Ted O’Brien</strong>, said climate change was a “global problem, and it demands global action”.</p> 
  <p>The statement said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Australia cannot make a difference on its own, but we must play our part. The Coalition will always support sensible action to reduce emissions, strengthen resilience, and protect communities.</p> 
   <p>Our nation has the capacity and resources to meet the challenge of climate change with the right policies and priorities. <strong>This is a moment to reassure Australians</strong>. What Australians do not need is alarmist language being used to distract from Labor’s failures.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Ley and O’Brien said the government’s 2035 emissions target, expected to be released later this week, must be “credible” and Labor must be upfront about the financial cost to households and businesses.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We need to reduce emissions, but not at any cost. If Labor cannot outline the cost and a credible pathway, why should Australians trust them not to force households and small businesses to pay even more? Don’t look at what Labor says, look at what it does.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>It’s worth remembering the Coalition is considering ditching its commitment to net zero by 2050 as part of a post-election review.</p>

  <p><strong>Independent authority finds NDIS pricing arrangements are ‘not working’</strong></p> 
  <p>NDIS pricing arrangements are not working, says the Independent Health and Aged Care Pricing Authority (IHACPA), after consulting participants, providers and stakeholders. <br><br>The government has <a href="https://www.ihacpa.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-09/A_fresh_approach_to_NDIS_pricing_A_snapshot_of_what_weve_heard.pdf">released the consultation snapshot</a>, but has refused to release IHACPA’s final report on pricing, claiming public interest immunity, and maintaining that the release would “undermine cabinet deliberations”.</p> 
  <p>The consultations found pricing “doesn’t reflect the reality of delivering services” particularly in regional areas and for people with complex disabilities.</p> 
  <p>Participants said pricing isn’t helping with choice of services or access, while providers told IHACPA pricing doesn’t take into account the complexity of some cases that can impact resourcing. Where providers are unable to hire sufficient or quality staff, this can result in “lower worker to participant ratios, and potentially unsafe environments”.</p> 
  <p>The snapshot also states the “one-size-fits-all” model has an adverse impact on participants rural and regional areas. It states:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A one-size-fits-all model doesn’t account for the differences between states and territories, nor between metro, regional and remote areas. This means inequitable access and service delivery. Remote participants are most affected, especially in rural and remote areas where the cost of delivering services is higher …</p> 
   <p>We found that the current NDIS pricing model is causing big ripples in unintended ways for participants, providers and the disability sector.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The consultation was done between June and November 2024.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Queensland police investigating 20 deaths linked to 'end of life service business'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Queensland police have charged a Gold Coast business owner with allegedly operating a business supplying veterinary drugs to aid in suicides.<br><br>Gold Coast Det Insp <strong>Mark Mooney</strong> said the police are investigating the deaths of 20 people who have died as a result of what he called an “end of life service business”, including in Victoria and New South Wales.</p> 
  <p>A 53-year-old man from Main Beach has been charged with two counts of aiding suicide and several drug offences including trafficking dangerous drugs. An 81-year-old woman from Southport and an 80-year-old man from Ashmore have also been charged with drug offences, over the same alleged incident.</p> 
  <p>“Toxicology confirmed the cause of death as acute pentobarbitone toxicity, a drug commonly used by veterinarians to euthanise animals, and is tightly controlled under Queensland law,” Mooney said.<br><br>Police allege the man obtained the drugs through a “front” charity set up to euthanise whales.<br><br>Instead he offered a range of services to aid people’s death, including wills and finding a person after their death. It’s alleged that he did so as a “business transaction”, “just for pure money”, Mooney said. <br><br>Mooney said detectives were also investigating other deaths from as early as 2021.<br><br>“The alleged conduct involves deliberately targeting vulnerable people and exploiting them in their most desperate moments,” he said.<br><br>Voluntary assisted dying is legal in Queensland but is strictly regulated under state law, and requires an application to a regulatory body.</p> 
  <p>The maximum penalty for aiding suicide is life in prison.</p> 
  <p>Last year, the Queensland coroner labelled the state’s euthanasia laws “inadequate”, warning that “further calamity and heartbreak” will be caused if reforms were not made.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW Coalition slump in polls, but leader appears safe for now</strong></p> 
  <p>A new Resolve Strategic poll revealed a further slump of 4 percentage points in the NSW Coalition’s primary vote since its last poll in July, adding to the party’s fears of a drubbing in March 2027 and the pressure on opposition leader, <strong>Mark Speakman</strong>.</p> 
  <p>But despite the new poll and the disappointing result in the Kiama byelection on the weekend, Speakman appears to have stared down the doubters, and possible challengers have retreated.</p> 
  <p>Sources said they did not expect a spill motion at the party room meeting to be held Tuesday morning. The frontrunner to replace Speakman, Liberal MP for Vaucluse, <strong>Kellie Sloane</strong> has ruled out calling a spill as has the MP for Manly, <strong>James Griffin</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Unless a backbencher moves an “empty chair” spill – calling a spill without a nomination – the leadership unease in NSW looks set to simmer on, without resolution.</p> 
  <p>The statewide Resolve poll, taken before the byelection on 8-11 September shows the NSW Coalition primary vote at 28%, compared to a Labor primary vote of 38%.</p> 
  <p>If repeated at the general election, the result would see the Coalition lose a swathe of marginal seats, leaving it with less than 30 seats in the 93-seat NSW parliament.</p> 
  <p>The issue for the NSW Coalition is that changing the leader may make little difference. Polling points to far more serious and ingrained problems for the conservative side of politics.</p> 
  <p>Two polls on federal voting intentions, released on Monday, were even worse than the NSW result.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW warned to expect late bushfire season amid rain-driven growth</strong></p> 
  <p>NSW can expect a late onset to the bushfire season this summer, as the rural fire service says heavy rain this year has driven higher growth in bushland areas, creating the risk of fast-moving grass fires.</p> 
  <p>The NSW emergency services minister, <strong>Jihad Dib</strong>, has given a press conference today alongside the NSW rural fire service (RFS), which is releasing its annual outlook this week. He has warned 2024-25’s severe flooding and cyclone events have hampered efforts to meet hazard reduction burning targets, expected to be limited further by a wetter than average spring.</p> 
  <p>“What we’re really focused on this year is getting out of the complacency. We’ve had about a year or so of rain, and there’s been a lot of focus on floods, rightfully so, but our attention needs to turn to the upcoming fire season. Now, with the rain, we see a lot of growth that’s developed, and as a result of that, as soon as we get some dry hot weather, that grass will start to dry out and become quite easy for burning.”</p> 
  <p>RFS commissioner <strong>Trent Curtin</strong>, who took over from outgoing commissioner Rob Rogers in July, has warned that areas which burnt in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/ng-interactive/2025/feb/10/black-summer-after-the-fires-andrew-odwyer-geoffrey-keaton-death-toll-five-years">2019-20 black summer bushfires</a> have now regrown and can sustain fire again.</p> 
  <p>“We’re expecting fast-running grass fires to occur, that will impact communities, that will potentially threaten lives. We want to make sure everyone is prepared for those grassfires.”</p>

  <p><strong>Gout Gout says he is ‘ready to rumble’ for World Athletics Championships debut</strong></p> 
  <p>Australian teenage sprint phenomenon <strong>Gout Gout</strong> has declared his legs are “ready to rumble” before his major international debut on Wednesday at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/world-athletics-championships">World Athletics Championships</a>.</p> 
  <p>The 17-year-old participated in a panel session with international press today, his only pre-meet media opportunity, as he prepares to contest the 200m in Tokyo. Gout was asked what his legs would tell him if they could talk.</p> 
  <p>“They’ll be ready to go, like in F1 when the cars are warming up the tyres,” he said, making a swerving gesture with his hands. “They’ll be just … ready to rumble, that’s what they’d say”.</p> 
  <p>The confident teenager said he did have some nerves about his major international debut.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Greens said the party is deeply troubled by the findings released in today’s national climate risk assessment, saying any commitment less than net zero by 2035 would lock the planet into exceeding 2C of warming and set off a host of climate-related ills.</p>

   <p>If Labor fails to set a science-based climate target then it’s crystal clear: they have utterly prioritised coal and gas profits at the expense of community safety and nature.</p>

  <p>In 2021, the state government announced it was going to deliver more housing in the estate as part of its<a href="https://www.premier.vic.gov.au/victorias-big-housing-build"> $5.3b Big Housing Build project</a> to address Victoria’s critical social housing shortage. It said more than 60 old dwellings in the estate would be demolished, to be replaced with a mix of social and affordable housing.</p> 
  <p>Relocation was completed in late 2023, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/12/treating-us-like-chess-pieces-big-housing-build-turns-into-big-wait-for-leawarra-residents">residents uprooted from their neighbourhood</a> but promised first right of return to new homes that would be “energy efficient and environmentally sustainable”.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Nationals MP and former deputy PM <strong>Barnaby Joyce</strong> has used a morning TV appearance to offer a plan for the flagging Coalition, but does not believe replacing <strong>Sussan Ley</strong> as leader is the answer to their fortunes as there’s “not a great number to pick from”.</p> 
  <p>Joyce told Sunrise that he had a five-point plan to turn things around for the party. It appeared he had four points – one of which was sticking a map on the fridge – and two somewhat relevant opinions, but let’s not quibble. Joyce said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Number one, get a map of Australia and stick it on your fridge and from that point on, just start worrying about them. Don’t worry about climate conferences or worry about what’s happening in the Middle East or worry about the fact that you’ve got people coming in – worry about the cost of living.</p> 
   <p>The next thing is basically pick three issues that are binary, that you’re all for them and Labor’s all against them or you’re against them and Labor is all for them because that helps you define the map on the fridge.</p> 
   <p>The third thing is put your best team on the paddock, not your best mates. Put your best team on the paddock and follow through with that.</p> 
   <p>Then I would say the Labor party’s been there before, after Julia Gillard they were down at the same numbers and came back. So you can come back. You’ve really got to focus.</p> 
   <p>The last thing I will say, if you don’t come back in the next three years, as a political movement, you might be replaced by another one.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>When asked if Ley was safe, Joyce responded:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s not about Sussan, it’s about making sure you have the right people for the right positions because you want to present as competent across the field.</p> 
   <p>You haven’t got a great number to pick from, to be complete and frank.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, has told ABC Perth he has relocated his Sydney electorate office because people attending funerals at a church next door were being abused by protesters.</p> 
  <p>Albanese announced the decision yesterday, saying his hand had been forced by repeated protests outside the office in the inner-west suburb of Marrickville. Many of those protests have been against the war in Gaza. He said in a statement on Sunday:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Sadly, over the past two years, aggressive protesters have repeatedly blocked access to the electorate office for people seeking assistance.</p> 
   <p>This has also significantly affected churchgoers attending the neighbouring St Clements Church, including disruption to funerals and other church services.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The office will reopen in a new location in the electorate of Grayndler soon, he said.</p> 
  <p>Albanese told the ABC today that:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>People were being abused going to funerals.</p> 
   <p>It just does my head in that people think that a cause is advanced by that sort of behaviour.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The AFL’s marquee State of Origin fixture will return next year to end a 27-year hiatus, with Western Australia to host Victoria in Perth on Valentine’s Day. After a clamour from fans and players for the state-based rivalry’s return, the 2026 game will be played at Optus Stadium.</p> 
  <p>The last time an Origin game was contested between state teams was in 1999, when Victoria beat South Australia by 54 points at the MCG, but South Australia was overlooked this time after strong lobbying from the Western Australian government.</p> 
  <p>It follows a successful Indigenous All-Stars clash at Optus Stadium earlier this year, when 37,865 fans turned out to watch the representative side beat the Fremantle Dockers. AFL CEO <strong>Andrew Dillon</strong> says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>State football is one of the great traditions of our game, with fans and players alike calling for its return for some time and we are thrilled to see it back.</p> 
   <p>Origin inspires passion, state pride and draws upon years’ old rivalries that are central to the history of our game and our very greatest players. It will be a special moment to see a Big V and a Sandgroper jumper back on the field before we start our 2026 AFL premiership season.</p>

  <p>There were more than 115,000 rooftop solar units installed across Australia in the first half of 2025, an 18% decrease from the same period a year ago.

  <p>Another key findingwas battery sales hitting record highs, with 85,000 units sold in the first half of 2025, bolstered by government incentives making the systems more affordable. That figure is a 191% increase over the same period last year.</p>

  <p><strong>Scientists fear this ‘cute’ and ‘chonky’ flying fox could be one cyclone away from extinction</strong></p> 
  <p>It’s the last native mammal on the island, but the “incredibly cute and fluffy” Christmas Island flying fox is critically endangered with no recovery plan and severely outdated conservation advice.</p> 
  <p>The flying fox is smaller and fluffier than many of Australia’s mainland flying fox species, according to animal ecologist Dr <strong>Annabel Dorrestein</strong>, from Western Sydney University, who has studied the species for nine years.</p> 
  <p>The bats are “incredibly cute” and “chonky”; a bit like teddy bears, Dorrestein said.</p> 
  <p>Christmas Island, located 1,550km off north-west Western Australia, originally had five native mammals – two rodents, two bats and a shrew. The rodents disappeared in the early 1900s. The shrew has not been seen since 1985 and is probably extinct.</p>

  <p>Infighting and the sacking of a frontbencher have left the federal Coalition with its worst-ever primary vote result in Newspoll history, with One Nation appearing to have scooped up disaffected voters, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>The Coalition’s primary vote collapsed to 27%, the lowest since the poll began tracking first preferences in 1985, the Newspoll conducted last week and published in The Australian on Monday found.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Richard Marles </strong>says the closure of Albanese’s electoral office in Marrickville is “very sad”, saying a spate of protests there had not helped any causes but deprived locals of their ability to go to their local member.</p> 
  <p>The prime minister said the site would close after serving as Grayndler’s electorate office for more than 30 years. Albanese cited a string of protests there, many related to the ongoing crisis in Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Marles, the deputy prime minister, told RN Breakfast this morning of the decision:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think it’s very sad. I think the kind of protests that we’ve seen outside of the prime minister’s electoral office over the last couple of years have been a complete disgrace. It does nothing to advance the arguments associated with any of these issues. It really, I think, ends up being much more about the protesters than the cause that they pretend to espouse.</p> 
   <p>It is certainly denying the constituents of Grayndler being able to go to their local member and the office of their local member and receive basic services. I mean, I think there is an intimidatory degree to what’s been going on here, but it is appalling behaviour that it has resulted in this moment.</p>
