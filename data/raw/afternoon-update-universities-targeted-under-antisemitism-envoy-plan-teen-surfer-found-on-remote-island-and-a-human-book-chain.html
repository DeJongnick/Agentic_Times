<p>Good afternoon. Universities and artists would have funding withheld if they fail to act against antisemitism, AI tools would be banned from sharing Jewish hatred, and the government would have new grounds to deport visitors under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/10/antisemitism-plan-envoy-jillian-segal-australian-government-ntwnfb">a wide-ranging plan presented to the prime minister</a> by Australia’s antisemitism envoy, Jillian Segal.</p> 
<p>“There is no place in Australia for antisemitism. The kind of hatred and violence that we have seen on our streets recently is despicable and it won’t be tolerated and I want those responsible to face the full force of the law,” Anthony Albanese <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2025/jul/10/albanese-condemns-antisemitism-after-receiving-special-envoy-jillian-segals-report-video-ntwnfb">said on Thursday morning</a>.</p> 
<p>The government has not committed to the plan in full, but Albanese indicated he was open to parts of it, saying some components <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jul/10/jillian-segal-special-envoy-antisemitism-anthony-albanese-labor-recommendations-ntwnfb">could be implemented quickly</a>.</p> 
<p>Albanese <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2025/jul/10/albanese-says-hes-always-advocated-for-a-two-state-solution-in-the-middle-east-video">denied the plan</a> would limit legitimate criticism of the Israeli government, including its military actions in Gaza and the deaths of thousands of Palestinian civilians, despite the report recommending all levels of government adopt <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/oct/15/australian-government-to-adopt-international-groups-definition-of-antisemitism">a contested definition of antisemitism</a> which critics say conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel. The executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, Dr Max Kaiser, said the document reads “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/jul/10/australia-news-live-anthony-albanese-antisemitism-melbourne-chris-minns-sydney-ntwnfb?page=with%3Ablock-686f4ffe8f082b1b9475496b#block-686f4ffe8f082b1b9475496b">more like a blueprint for silencing dissent</a> rather than a strategy to build inclusion”. </p>
