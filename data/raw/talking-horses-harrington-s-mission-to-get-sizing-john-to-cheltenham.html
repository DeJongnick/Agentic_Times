<h2>Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook</h2> <p>In among the heady speculation at Jessica Harrington’s yard about what Sizing John might do this season, there was a moment of realism yesterday. It came when the trainer stated her baseline ambition for the horse.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/nov/20/gordon-elliott-outlander-sizing-john-jessica-harrington-betfair-chase-haydock-horse-racing-tips">Gordon Elliott’s Outlander joins Sizing John in Irish raid on Betfair Chase</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“I’d like to get him back to the Gold Cup because the last two Gold Cup winners haven’t even got back. That’s Plan A, to get him there.&nbsp; Whatever happens after that will be a bonus.”</p> <p>Harrington is right about this. Neither Coneygree nor Don Cossack made it back to the Gold Cup the year after winning it. This is part of being a top-class staying chaser, in my view; in most cases, you only get a year at the top. Winning a race like that comes at a cost, which can be that the winner is either unwilling or incapable of a reprise.</p> <p>“My only worry,” Harrington continued, “is maybe the three hard races last year might leave a mark on him. But he’d had a good few hard races the year before and he seemed to come out of it very well.”</p> <p>Sizing John is only seven, rising eight, and he looked a picture yesterday. I have high hopes for him.</p> <p>To Southwell for some jump racing, where <strong>Pretty Reckless (12.30)</strong> is the nap. This is a rarity, a four-year-old filly being campaigned over fences as her trainer, Dan Skelton, makes best use of her fluent jumping.&nbsp;</p> <p>She hasn’t won by wide margins in her two successes since Harry Skelton returned to her saddle in September but she gives the distinct impression of more to come. She’s a half-sister to Heath Hunter (who won from 20lb higher) and is 2-1 to go in again today.</p> <p>At a more generous 12-1, <strong>Whin Park (1.30)</strong> may be worth chancing in a handicap hurdle, just his second attempt in a handicap. From the excellent Ben Pauling yard that had a double on Sunday, he put up a fine performance on his seasonal return here last month but ultimately needed the run and tired into fourth. An improved showing here puts him right in the argument.</p> <p><strong>Windy Writer (3.00)</strong> is an interesting 10-1 on his second start for Sam England, who has proved effective in handicaps. Four of his five best runs have been at this track and he went well for a long way on his seasonal reappearance last month. If he’s sharper this time or benefits from the fitting of a tongue tie, he can get into this, having been dropped 5lb for his latest defeat. He was previously with Shaun Lycett, who went winless through the last season he had the horse.</p> <h2>Tips for all Tuesday races</h2> <p><strong>Southwell<br>12.30</strong> Pretty Reckless (nap) <strong>1.00</strong> Work In Progress <strong>1.30 </strong>Whin Park (nb) <strong>2.00</strong> Equus Secretus <strong>2.30</strong> Passing Call <strong>3.00</strong> Windy Writer <strong>3.30</strong> Jane Lamb</p> <p><strong>Lingfield<br>12.40</strong> Elhafei <strong>1.10</strong> Dun Shan na nGall <strong>1.40</strong> Gorgeous Noora <strong>2.10</strong> Celestial Spheres <strong>2.40</strong> Unforgiving Minute <strong>3.10</strong> Inuk <strong>3.40</strong> Kohinoor Diamond</p> <p><strong>Fakenham<br>12.50</strong> Cliffside Park <strong>1.20</strong> Maid Of Milan <strong>1.50</strong> Bardd <strong>2.20</strong> Red Hanrahan <strong>2.50</strong> Saucysioux <strong>3.20</strong> Bach De Clermont&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><br></p>
