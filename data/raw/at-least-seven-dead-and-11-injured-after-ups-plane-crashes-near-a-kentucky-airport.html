<p>A UPS cargo plane crashed shortly after take off, erupting into a massive fireball near the Louisville Muhammad Ali international airport in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kentucky">Kentucky</a>, leaving at least seven dead and 11 injured, the state’s governor, Andy Beshear, said. Beshear said he expects those numbers to grow.</p> 
<p>Flames from the crash ignited a string of fires on the ground in an industrial corridor adjacent to the international airport, apparently accounting for one of the confirmed fatalities and the injuries of 11 people, who according to airport officials were taken to the hospital.</p> 
<p>The plane, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, had three crew members on board and crashed around 5.15pm local time, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. It was bound for Honolulu.</p> 
<p>Beshear said early on that he believes there were at least three fatalities, but that number would increase as emergency crews parse through the debris. He added that the crash took place near two businesses: a recycling center, which took a direct hit, and an auto parts shop where all but two employees were accounted for. Their identities will be released soon, Beshear added.</p> 
<p>The governor said there was no hazardous cargo onboard the aircraft.</p> 
<p>Federal officials said all those aboard were feared dead. A Louisville airport spokesperson later said a fourth fatality was confirmed. Craig Greenberg, the Louisville mayor, said in a news conference late Tuesday night that the four people who were confirmed dead were not on board the plane.</p>

<p>Television channel WLKY, a CBS affiliate, showed video footage of the crash as it occurred. The plane took off with fire on one wing, and a huge fireball erupted as it hit the ground. Several buildings in an industrial area beyond the runway were on fire after the crash, with thick black smoke rising into the evening sky.</p> 
<p>“Watching that video, I think we’re all very, very worried about them,” he said of the airplane crew members and missing employees.</p> 
<p>All flights departing Tuesday night have been cancelled, read a note on the Louisville <a href="https://www.flylouisville.com/">airport website</a>.</p> 
<p>FAA records show the plane involved in the crash, an MD-11 freighter, was 34 years old. Boeing, which shut down the MD-11 program after acquiring it in its merger with McDonnell Douglas, said it was concerned for the safety and well-being of all those affected, and it would provide technical support to the investigation.</p> 
<p>Flightradar24 said the plane, which began operations with UPS in 2006, had flown from Louisville to Baltimore earlier on Tuesday before returning to Louisville. The flight from Louisville to Honolulu typically takes 8.5 hours, the flight tracking service said.</p>

<p>The aircraft climbed to an altitude of 175 ft and reached a speed of 184 knots before making a sharp descent, according to data from Flightradar24.</p> 
<p>The National Transportation Safety Board will be leading the official investigation going forward, a UPS spokesperson said in a statement to the Guardian.</p> 
<p>Greenberg urged residents to report any debris that may have landed in their neighborhoods via an <a href="https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/4b676a3fce7e44339b5ccdb450243cb7">online form</a>. “We ask that residents do not touch or move any debris on their own,” Greenberg said.</p> 
<p>“I’d like to send my prayers to the families of the victims in this tragic crash,” he said.</p> 
<p>A huge plume of smoke was visible south of the airport shortly afterwards. The Louisville metro police department (LMPD) said multiple agencies were responding to reports of a crash.</p> 
<p>In a post on X, Beshear, described the situation as “serious” and said that he is heading to Louisville.</p> 
<p>“We have virtually every fire, police, emergency response group that is responding right now to what you’re seeing,” Beshear said during the press conference.</p> 
<p>“This is an active scene with fire and debris,” LMPD said in a statement. “Stay away.”</p> 
<p>Videos posted on social media appeared to show an active blaze.</p> 
<p>A shelter-in-place order was issued for all locations within 5 miles of the airport, which was closed. The order was later extended to “all areas north of the airport to the Ohio River”, covering much of the city.</p> 
<p>“Please remain away from the area until further notice,” added LMPD.</p> 
<p>“There are multiple injuries and the fire is still burning. There are many road closures in the area – please avoid the scene,” Craig Greenberg, the Louisville mayor, said in a social media post shortly before 7pmET</p>
