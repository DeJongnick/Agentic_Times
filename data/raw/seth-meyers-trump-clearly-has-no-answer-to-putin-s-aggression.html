<p>As several late-night hosts take a break for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/emmys">Emmys</a> – which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/sep/14/emmy-awards-2025-winners-adolescence-the-studio">went to the Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a> on Sunday night – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/seth-meyers">Seth Meyers</a> looked into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s lack of international leadership.</p> <h2><strong>Seth Meyers</strong></h2> <p>On Monday’s Late Night, Meyers pointed out the hypocrisy behind the Trump’ administration’s foreign policy agenda. “Trump and the GOP spent years whining that Democrats were supposedly leading from behind, and have now declared that America will be setting the world’s agenda,” he explained. “No more waiting for other countries to act – America acts first and other countries follow us. You got that, world?”</p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumFiZt6P6k"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gumFiZt6P6k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Except earlier this week, Trump announced on Truth Social that he was ready to enact sanctions against Russia for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/poland-shoots-down-drones-over-its-territory-amid-russian-attack-on-ukraine-says-military">flying drones into Poland’s airspace</a> … but not until all Nato nations had agreed to stop buying oil from Russia. As he put it: “I am ready to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing.”</p> <p>Meyers had to laugh. “I thought America was back? And now you’ll only act if everyone else does it first?” he said. “Trump is using the same logic for American foreign policy that eighth graders use for smoking pot in the local school parking lot – ‘I’ll do it first if you do it first.’ ‘No way, man, you first!’ ‘OK, let’s do it at the same time. I’m ready to go when you are, just say when.’”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/sep/12/seth-meyers-charlie-kirk-shooting">Seth Meyers on Charlie Kirk shooting: ‘Political violence is abhorrent to the highest ideals of this country’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meyers also wondered: “Why does the president of the United States write with the uneven grammar and syntax of a scammer sending you a fake job listing?”</p> <p>The sanctions talk heated up because Russia invaded Poland’s airspace with drones, “a dangerous incursion”, Meyers explained, given that Poland is a Nato ally. “But don’t worry, the president reassured everyone and put our minds at ease.”</p> <p>Well … not quite. Asked last week what he thought about Russia’s actions, Trump answered: “It could’ve been a mistake. But regardless I’m not happy about anything having to do with that whole situation. But hopefully it’s going to come to an end.”</p> <p>“What do you mean ‘hopefully’? I thought you were going to end the war on day one and get the Nobel peace prize!” Meyers laughed. “Now you’re talking in vague generalities like a dad whose daughter is dating a biker who did doughnuts on your front lawn – ‘As for the doughnuts, it might have been a mistake, I don’t know. Also might’ve been a mistake when he was screaming fuck you old man and giving me the finger.’”</p> <p>It’s not that Meyers was against sanctions – “I would love it if we had a president who actually pursued serious diplomacy and got Putin himself to come out and reassure the world after encroaching on Nato airspace and threatening global conflict,” he said. “Instead, we have a president who’s less concerned with the boundaries of Nato than he is with the boundaries of the White House ballroom.”</p> <p>“Trump clearly has no answer to Putin’s aggression,” Meyers concluded. “Diplomacy is good, de-escalation is good, but you can’t have either without competence and leadership, and those are just not Trump’s strong suits.”</p>
