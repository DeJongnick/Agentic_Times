appropriately without reliable data about the labour market.</p> <p>Earlier this week, top Bank of England officials told the committee that the monthly Labour Force Survey (LFS) produced by the Office for National Statistics may not give them a “good read” about what’s happening in the labour market.</p> <p>The LFS has been hit by a sharp fall in the response rate from participants, which
