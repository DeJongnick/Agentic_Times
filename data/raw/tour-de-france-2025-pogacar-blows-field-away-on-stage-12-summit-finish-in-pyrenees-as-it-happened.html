I was trying with my “head through the wall” to get back the yellow jersey, but Visma were too strong back then. I forgot about this, I was just looking forward to today, but then all the people were saying [before this stage]: ‘It is revenge time, blah blah blah.’</p> <p>“When we approached the bottom of the climb, it was just a reverse of a few years ago, one Belgian guy on the front, Tim [Wellens] … I’m super happy to win on this climb, and to take time.</p> <p><strong>Did he have doubts after yesterday’s crash?</strong> “For sure you don’t know how the body reacts after the crash. It was not too bad. I feel my hip but only when I do acrobatics. But here I am just riding the bike. I sweat a bit more, but maybe it’s good.</p> <p>“We did a super job. The team rode really well. yeah, chapeau also to Ben Healy and EF. They were trying to defend the jersey, they showed big spirit, and also Uno-X, they fight for their own GC, so it was a hard day for everybody. But in the end we were super-strong. We had this stage in mind a long time, and we did it.</p> <p>“I think this stage can go today for Samuele [Privitera, the 19-year-old Italian cyclist who died yesterday] and to all his family. It was really sad, it was the first thing I read in the morning, and I was thinking in the last kilometre about him and how this tough sport can be.
