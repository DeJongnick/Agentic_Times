 <h2 class="block-title">ONS table showing which European countries have best and worst excess deaths record</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The headlines from <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020#relative-cumulative-age-standardised-mortality-rates">the ONS report into excess deaths in Europe</a> have focused on England, because the main report treats the UK as four separate countries. It justifies this by saying that “each of the four nations of the UK has its own health services and policies, and has made different decisions around responses to the pandemic, such as the date and extent of implementation of lockdown measures” and that “it is therefore meaningful to report on each of the nations of the UK separately”.</p> 
  <p>But the ONS has also produced data for the UK and this shows that, although England’s record is worse than the UK’s as a whole, the UK’s was worse than any other country too in the relevant period.</p> 
  <p>If you are interested in the detail, it is worth looking at <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=%2fpeoplepopulationandcommunity%2fbirthsdeathsandmarriages%2fdeaths%2fdatasets%2fcomparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions%2fcurrent/referencetablesv2.xlsx">the data tables</a> published alongside the main reports. The key one is probably the one that shows relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rates (rcASMRs) for countries, for every week up until week 24 (the week ending 12 June). But it has focused on week 22 (the week ending 29 May) because that is the last week for which full data from all countries is available.</p> 
  <p>In week 22, the rcASMR for England was 7.55. That means that the death rate in England up to that point in the year was 7.55% higher than you would expect from the average from 2015-19.</p> 
  <p>The figure for the UK in week 22 was 6.9. The figure for Spain, the country with the next highest total, was 6.65.</p> 
  <p>Here is a chart from the ONS report showing all countries in order in week 19 (the week ending 8 May) and week 22. This shows that in week 19, Spain had the worst record (when it was ahead of both England and the UK), but that by week 22 England and the UK were both ahead of Spain.</p> 
  <p>The data for week 24, which is in the tables but not highlighted in the main report, shows that by then England and the UK were in an even worse position in relation to other European countries. Spain was still in second place, with an rcASMR of 6, but England’s was 7.61, and the UK’s was 6.94 – both higher than two weeks earlier. (The rcASMR can go down as the year goes on if death rates in a country fall below the long-term average.) </p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Jackson Carlaw resigns as Scottish Tory leader, saying party needs someone better</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Jackson Carlaw</strong> has resigned suddenly as the Scottish Conservatives’ leader, claiming he is not the right person to lead his party into the forthcoming Holyrood elections.</p> 
  <p>Hours after a combative session at first minister’s questions, Carlaw issued a statement saying he had reached “a simple if painful conclusion” over the last few weeks that the Scottish party needed a new and better leader.</p> 
  <p>Carlaw only became leader in February, after a drawn-out campaign to replace his predecessor, Ruth Davidson, a pro-European who quit last year rather than work with Boris Johnson. <br></p> 
  <p>Carlaw said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In the last few weeks I have reached a simple if painful conclusion – that I am not, in the present circumstances, the person best placed to lead that case over these next vital months in Scottish politics prior to the Holyrood elections.</p> 
   <p>Given the importance I attach to the job, I’ve therefore decided to stand down with immediate effect.</p> 
   <p>[I] simply believe that a new leader will be able, as we recover from the Covid emergency, to make the case for the Scottish Conservatives and the union better than me. That is all that matters.</p>

  <p>The <strong>Royal College of General Practitioners</strong> has expressed concern about Matt Hancock’s call earlier today for all GP consultations to be by phone or video unless there is a “compelling reason” for the patient to be seen face to face. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jul/30/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-latest-updates-isolation-period?page=with:block-5f22a8908f088e9f6f92d686#block-5f22a8908f088e9f6f92d686">12.08pm.)</a> In a lengthy response to Hancock’s speech, Prof Martin Marshall, the RCGP chair, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Mr Hancock is also keen for GPs and our teams to continue making greater use of technology post-pandemic, and the college is too, to an extent, and as long as it is safe. We should remember that the changes were made out of necessity – to keep our patients and our teams safe and to help stop the spread of Covid-19. While there is a compelling case to retain some aspects of the different ways we’ve been working, we certainly do not want to see general practice become a totally remote service. </p> 
   <p>A totally, or even predominantly, remote general practice service wouldn’t be in anybody’s best interests long-term, and throughout the pandemic face-to-face appointments have been facilitated when they’ve been necessary. Remote consultations have benefits – they can be convenient for patients, and GPs have reported they have found them to be an efficient way of delivering care – but there are some things that simply can’t be done remotely, for example, when a physical examination is necessary or for a vaccination. Many patients also prefer seeing their GP in person, and many GPs prefer this too, particularly for patients with complex health needs who really value the relationship-based care that GPs excel at delivering. </p>

  <p><strong>Ian Murray</strong>, the shadow Scottish secretary, has said that today’s ONS report about excess death rates in Europe shows the Scottish National party government in Holyrood has failed as well as the Conservative UK government in Westminster.</p> 
  <p>The figures show that by the week ending 29 May, England had a relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate of 7.55% – meaning it was 7.55% higher than the average mortality rate between 2015 and 2019. Spain ranked second, at 6.65%, followed by Scotland (5.11%), Belgium (3.89%) and Wales (2.78%).</p> 
  <p>Murray said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The confirmation that England and Scotland recorded the highest levels of excess deaths in Europe is devastating. </p> 
   <p>Every life lost is a tragedy and leaves behind grieving families. </p> 
   <p>This is a stark reminder of the catastrophic failures of the Tory government in Westminster and the SNP government in Edinburgh.</p> 
   <p>Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon must now take responsibility for why we were so badly prepared.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Referring to the reprimand to the Scottish government issued by the Office of Statistics Regulation (see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jul/30/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-latest-updates-isolation-period?page=with:block-5f22a10e8f08c608faf06011#block-5f22a10e8f08c608faf06011">11.33am)</a>, Murray said: “The first minister should also apologise for making false claims about prevalence rate comparisons and stop seeing everything through her constitutional prism.”</p>

  <p>Johnson then went on to stress that the crisis was not yet over. (See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jul/30/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-latest-updates-isolation-period?page=with:block-5f22bd398f08bb96099b57ab#block-5f22bd398f08bb96099b57ab">1.46pm.)</a></p>

  </blockquote> 
  <p>It is interesting that Johnson could not quite bring himself to say that people should holiday at home instead of abroad (“not going to discourage anybody from having a staycation” was an odd way of putting it). <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jul/28/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-latest-updates-quarantine-spain?page=with:block-5f201b1c8f080665365e742a#block-5f201b1c8f080665365e742a">Nicola Sturgeon has effectively been advising people to holiday in Scotland</a>, but Johnson is a libertarian who does not like telling people what to do, and he seems to find it harder telling people how to plan their summer.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Johnson tells Britons not to 'delude' themselves into thinking Covid crisis over</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Boris Johnson </strong>has said Britons should not delude themselves that the coronavirus crisis is over, because it isn’t. In a clip for broadcasters on a visit to Yorkshire, he said that Britain was getting the virus under some measure of control. But he went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>But I have to tell you that we are looking at a resurgence of the virus in some other European countries, you can see what’s been happening in the United States, and so it is absolutely vital as a country that we continue to keep our focus and our discipline and that we don’t delude ourselves that somehow we are out of the woods or that this is all over, because it isn’t all over. </p> 
   <p>And the most important thing we can do to stop a really damaging second wave, which would have real, real consequences - not just medical, but for the economy - is everybody continue to observe social distancing guidelines, to wash your hands and to wear a mask on public transport or in shops. And the most important thing we need to do is get the test if you have symptoms.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>This is quite a change of tone from Johnson. Less than two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-17-july-2020">in a speech</a>, he was implying the crisis was abating and he was floating the prospect of social distancing measures being abandoned from November. “It is my strong and sincere hope that we will be able to review the outstanding restrictions and allow a more significant return to normality from November at the earliest – possibly in time for Christmas,” he said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sturgeon's statement to Scottish parliament - Summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Here are the main points from <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>’s statement about coronavirus to the Scottish parliament.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Sturgeon confirmed that pupils in Scotland would return to school from 11 August. </strong>Some schools would have a phased return, she said, but she said she expected “all pupils to be at school full-time from 18 August at the latest”. She went on:</li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The guidance makes clear that in general, physical distancing between pupils will not be required while on the school estate, although distance should be maintained between pupils in secondary schools where possible - provided this does not compromise the return to full-time schooling. </p> 
   <p>Distancing should also be maintained between staff members, and between staff and pupils. </p> 
   <p>The guidance also sets out the risk-mitigation measures that must be introduced in all educational settings. These include ventilation, good hygiene practices, and improved cleaning regimes. </p> 
   <p>It is vital for the safe re-opening of schools that these measure are applied rigorously in all settings.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>She said she was not ruling out schools having to opt for “blended learning arrangements”, either nationally or locally, if coronavirus crisis increased. </strong>That would involve a mixture of learning from school and learning from home. (At one point “blended learning” was the model for when schools went back, but the Scottish government then committed to getting all pupils back in school, partly in response to protests from parents.)</li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>She said the Scottish government would spend a further £30m on teacher recruitment (taking the total to £75m) and a further £30m on its education recovery fund (taking the total to £50m).</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>But she said it was not safe for Scotland to move from phase three of its route map out of coronavirus to phase four.</strong> She explained:</li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Three weeks ago, we estimated that 1,000 people had been infectious with the virus in Scotland in the week before. Our estimate for last week is that 300 people in Scotland were infectious. </p> 
   <p>In addition, our latest modelling suggests that the R number remains below 1. </p> 
   <p>So our progress is substantial, and it has been hard earned. </p> 
   <p>But - and I am afraid this is a necessary ‘but’ - the virus has not gone away. It is still circulating and it remains highly infectious and very dangerous. </p> 
   <p>And that is why I am not able to indicate, today, a move from phase three of our route map out of lockdown to phase four.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>In <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making-scotlands-route-map-through-out-crisis/">the route map it published in May</a>, the Scottish government said phase four would apply when coronavirus was “suppressed to very low levels” and was “no longer considered a significant threat to public health”. The document said it might take “many months, or longer” before Scotland reached that phase.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>Explaining what those “minimal” changes would be, she said:</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>From Monday, routine eye care services - including regular eye exams – can be carried out in community optometry premises, and in people’s homes. </p> 
   <p>Counselling services – such as drug and alcohol support groups – will be able to provide essential services, following relevant guidance and with physical distancing. </p> 
   <p>In addition, sports coaches will be able to meet with groups of more than four households at a time. We will also confirm when they can work with larger groups.</p> 
   <p>And from 17 August, a wider range of dental care can resume. In particular, aerosol procedures - which create a fine mist through use of a high speed drill – will be allowed to restart if they are necessary for urgent dental care. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Sturgeon also said that from 24 August the Scottish government hoped to allow live events like concerts and comedy outdoors to take place, and some indoor facilities, like bingo, to open with social distancing. Funfairs and driving lessons could be allowed from that day too, she said. But non-essential offices and call centres would expect to remain closed until 14 September, she said.</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>She said from 1 August people deemed extremely clinically vulnerable would no longer be asked to shield</strong>. She said:</li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For those of you have been shielding, this means that from Saturday, you can now follow the guidance for the general population. But please be especially careful about face coverings, hand hygiene and physical distancing.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>She said that new guidance was being published for childcare providers to come into force from 10 August.</strong> She said:</li> 
  </ul> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The new guidance doesn’t represent a return to complete normality for childcare providers – but it reduces the current restrictions, while setting out age-appropriate measures to minimise risks for staff, children and families, and communities. </p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>She said there had been no further coronavirus deaths in Scotland in the last 24 hours.</strong></li> 
  </ul> 
  <ul> 
   <li><strong>She said that a cluster of cases in the Glasgow area had been linked to the M&amp;D pharmacy in Port Glasgow and to an Amazon warehouse in Gourock.</strong></li> 
  </ul>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Hancock</strong> said people used to argue before the coronavirus crisis that “anyone over the age of 25 simply could not cope with anything other than a face-to-face to appointment”.</p> 
  <p>But the crisis had shown that that was not true, he said. In the four weeks to 12 April, 71% of routine GP consultations were delivered remotely, he said.</p> 
  <p>He went on:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We shouldn’t patronise older people by saying they don’t do tech. </p> 
   <p>The feedback from this transformation has been hugely positive.</p> 
   <p>And especially valued by doctors in rural areas, who saw how it could save long travel times for doctors and patients.</p> 
   <p>So from now on, all consultations should be teleconsultations unless there’s a compelling clinical reason not to.</p> 
   <p>Of course, if there’s an emergency, the NHS will be ready and waiting to see you in person - just as it always has been.</p> 
   <p>But if they are able to, patients should get in contact first - via the web or by calling in advance.</p> 
   <p>That way, care is easier to manage and the NHS can deliver a much better service.</p>

  <p>As an example of the way coronavirus changed how the NHS operated for the better, <strong>Hancock</strong> cited the example of data-sharing. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Complex, confusing advice leads to over-cautious interpretation. For example, without changing a jot of the law, early in the crisis NHSx issued radically simplified new guidance to support new ways of working.</p> 
   <p>The guidance was on one page, and targeted at every single frontline professional - not just at information governance experts. </p> 
   <p>For example, we made clear that it’s fine to use secure messaging services like WhatsApp to share information with colleagues or patients where the benefits outweigh the risks. </p> 
   <p>And we made it easier to link the primary care records of millions to the latest data on coronavirus.</p>

  <p>Nicola Sturgeon has been censured by the UK’s chief statistician after using incomplete data to claim the coronavirus was five times less prevalent in Scotland than in England.</p> 
  <p>Ed Humpherson, the director general for the <strong>Office of Statistics Regulation</strong>, said Sturgeon’s claims earlier in July were not based on comparable or published data, and should not have been made. “The sources used to underpin this claim have been difficult to identify,” he has told Sturgeon’s government.</p> 
  <p>In <a href="https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/correspondence/ed-humpherson-to-roger-halliday-use-of-covid-19-prevalence-rates-by-scottish-government/">an official letter to Roger Halliday</a>, the Scottish government’s chief statistician, Humpherson said he did not believe the sources used by Sturgeon were robust enough, after an investigation into complaints about the first minister’s statements.</p> 
  <p>After analysing the data sources given to him by Sturgeon’s officials, he told Halliday: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We do not think that the sources [provided] allow for a quantified and uncaveated comparison of the kind that was made. In future if such comparisons are made, we would expect to.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Sturgeon told the media and viewers watching daily briefings earlier this month that she was worried Scotland could be put at risk because of “shambolic” policies on foreign travel and air bridges then being pushed by ministers in England. </p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-update-first-ministers-speech-3-july-2020/">On 3 July she said</a>: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We assess that the prevalence of the virus in Scotland, right now, is five times lower than it is in England. Northern Ireland actually faces a similar issue.</p> 
   <p>So that means that there may well be cases where the UK government is admitting visitors to England without quarantine from countries that don’t present a significant risk of raising infection levels there, but would create that risk in Scotland.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Humpherson said that claim could not be substantiated. The Scottish government had used Scottish modelling done by its experts and then compared it against unpublished modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which used a UK prevalence figure as a proxy for England. It then used other data from the Office for National Statistics which was based on a different time period and estimates than the Scottish data.</p>

  <p>This is from Dr Veena Raleigh, a senior fellow at the <strong>King’s Fund</strong>, the health thinktank, on the ONS report into excess deaths in Europe. </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Over the past decade, life expectancy improvements in the UK have lagged behind our European peers. With the worst coronavirus death toll in Europe, there is a very real risk that the UK will slide even further down the life expectancy league tables. The priority for the UK is to control the pandemic and learn lessons ahead of a potential second wave, but it is also essential to tackle the underlying reasons for stalling life expectancy in recent years – many of which contribute to poor Covid-19 outcomes. This requires increased effort in prevention and public health, action to tackle the underlying socio-economic inequalities driving much of the preventable ill health, and a cross-government strategy to reduce health inequalities.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>In an interview with BBC News earlier<strong> Ben Humberstone,</strong> head of health analysis and life events at the ONS, said that the picture presented by its report into excess deaths in Europe was “really complex”. He explained:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The pattern is really complex. What we’ve seen, for example in Italy and Spain, which were the other countries really heavily affected by Covid-19, was that they had a very localised pandemic, so the impact in the regions of northern Italy and central Spain was much higher than anything that we saw in the UK. But in the UK it was much wider spread. So we saw excess deaths from Cornwall to Shetland, and everywhere in-between.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He said that one problem for the UK was that, although excess deaths were not as high at their peak as in some other countries, they went on for longer. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Although the UK, at the peak of the pandemic, didn’t see the highest rate of deaths, the pandemic and the effect on excess deaths did last slightly longer in the UK, which pushed up that total number of deaths.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>But he also stressed that the pandemic was not over, and that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jul/28/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-latest-updates-quarantine-spain?page=with:block-5f1fe38b8f080665365e70e0#block-5f1fe38b8f080665365e70e0">the below-average death figures in recent weeks in England and Wales</a> could over time change the overall picture. He said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It is important to note that the pandemic isn’t over yet, and we’ll continue doing this analysis to see what happens. What we’ve seen in the UK, for example, over the last few weeks are rates of deaths below what we would normally see in these weeks of the year, and so that will have an impact and bring figures into line.</p>

  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>In symptomatic people Covid-19 is most infectious just before, and for the first few days after symptoms begin. It is very important people with symptoms self-isolate and get a test, which will allow contact tracing.</p> 
   <p>Evidence, although still limited, has strengthened and shows that people with Covid-19 who are mildly ill and are recovering have a low but real possibility of infectiousness between 7 and 9 days after illness onset.</p> 
   <p>We have considered how best to target interventions to reduce risk to the general population and consider that at this point in the epidemic, with widespread and rapid testing available and considering the relaxation of other measures, it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self-isolation period from 7 to 10 days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result.</p> 
   <p>This will help provide additional protection to others in the community. This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission.</p>

  <p>This is from <strong>Edwin Morgan</strong>, from the health analysis and life events division at the ONS, commenting on today’s ONS report on excess deaths. (See<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jul/30/uk-coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-latest-updates-isolation-period?page=with:block-5f22858b8f08bb338d708c34#block-5f22858b8f08bb338d708c34"> 9.37am.)</a> Morgan said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the first half of 2020 saw extraordinary increases in mortality rates across countries in Western Europe above the 2015 to 2019 average.</p> 
   <p>The highest peak excess mortality at national level was in Spain, with some local areas in Northern Italy and Central Spain having excess mortality levels as high as 847.7% of the average.</p> 
   <p>While none of the four UK nations had a peak mortality level as high as Spain or the worst-hit local areas of Spain and Italy, excess mortality was geographically widespread throughout the UK during the pandemic, whereas it was more geographically localised in most countries of Western Europe.</p> 
   <p>Combined with the relatively slow downward ‘tail’ of the pandemic in the UK, this meant that by the end of May, England had seen the highest overall relative excess mortality out of all the European countries compared.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">England had highest levels of excess deaths in Europe in first half of 2020, ONS says</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Office of National Statistics has just published <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020">its report on excess deaths in Europe in the first six months of 2020.</a> And it says England had “the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe for the period as a whole”.</p> 
  <p>This is significant because government scientists have repeatedly said excess deaths are the best measure of impact of coronavirus on a country, because coronavirus death figures are not counted in the same way in different places, and those headline figures do not include other people who have died as a consequence of the crisis.</p> 
  <p>Here is an extract.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While England did not have the highest peak mortality, it did have the longest continuous period of excess mortality of any country compared, resulting in England having the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe for the period as a whole.</p>

  <p>The health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, said the “big scientific challenge” with testing people at the border was that you “can incubate this disease for many days without displaying any symptoms, and that wouldn’t show up in a test”, PA Media reports.</p> 
  <p>He told BBC Breakfast:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>So if people get off a plane coming from somewhere that has a high degree of disease and therefore they have to quarantine, if you get the test, and the test result comes back negative, you could still have the disease, you’re just incubating it.</p> 
   <p>Mr Hancock said he was not against testing people at the border but more work was needed on the timing of Covid-19 tests to make them effective.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Second wave 'starting to roll across Europe', says Hancock</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The health secretary, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, has warned that a “second wave” of coronavirus is “starting to roll across Europe”, according to a write-up by PA Media.</p> 
  <p>He told Sky News: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I am worried about a second wave. I think you can see a second wave starting to roll across Europe and we’ve got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores and to tackle it.</p> 
   <p>The measures that the chief medical officer will set out later are part of that but so too are the measures we’re taking, for instance to ensure that we don’t directly bring cases back to this country where there’s a big spike in cases.</p> 
   <p>So absolutely on a second wave it is something I worry about and I worry about it because we can see it happening.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Hancock has been doing the media rounds this morning. He said ministers were investigating ways to reduce the 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK from at-risk countries when it was safe to do so.</p> 
  <p>Hancock told Sky News: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’re always looking at how we can have the least-possible burden of the measures that we have to put into place so that is something on which we’re doing some work but we’ll only come forward with a proposal when we’re confident that it is safe to do so.</p> 
   <p>So again this is very much guided by the clinical science and the CMO (chief medical officer) will be speaking on it later today, but the broader point is that there’s a serious concern about a second wave that’s clearly now moving across Europe and we need to take action.</p> 
   <p>If that means increasing the number of days that people who test positive have to self-isolate then so be it because these measures are necessary to keep people safe.</p>

  <p>Jessica Elgot, chief political correspondent, reports:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The Guardian understands that the government is looking at increasing the isolation period for those who have symptoms from seven to 10 days in line with the developing science on the virus’s incubation period and how long it remains contagious.</p>

  <p>The UK’s government’s official dashboard showed 83 Covid-19 associated deaths and 763 newly lab-confirmed infections on Wednesday, and there appears to have been a slight rise in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/easing-several-lockdown-rules-at-once-could-boost-virus-say-uk-scientists">infections as lockdown restrictions have eased</a>.</p> 
  <p>Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS leaders, told MPs that NHS managers were very worried about a second wave. He said: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I would say in relation to the second spike issue or something coming, the levels of concern among our members – the people who are leading NHS trusts, who are leading in primary care and all levels in the systems – is very high.</p> 
   <p>I mean, of course, there’s real concern about winter and the compounding factors there, but also about an earlier spike. We have already mentioned exhausted staff [and] we are already trying to rebuild other services.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has also hinted that the length of time people with coronavirus symptoms must self-isolate for will be increased to 10 days in England, PA reports.</p> 
  <p>Hancock told Sky News: </p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>This is a decision that’s clinically led. The chief medical officer will be setting out details later today.</p> 
   <p>I can’t steal his thunder but what I will say is we will always do what is necessary to protect people and we’re guided by the clinical judgment, by the science in this.</p>
