They refuse or are reluctant to walk away from these confrontations, even when police are in the area trying to meet with them. They even engage in the same trespassing behavior on federal … property as the main protesters.”</p> <p>Another witness, the conservative influencer <strong>Nick Sortor</strong>, complained of being arrested recently by the Portland police after a skirmish. However, video recorded on multiple nights in the past week shows that Sortor has repeatedly antagonized protesters in the course of filming outside the Ice facility.</p> <p>One clip, for instance, showed that Sortor initiated conflict by trying to force his way through a protest encampment on a sidewalk near the Ice facility. He was then <a href="https://x.com/bennetthaselton/status/1975330600207982837">involved in a scuffle</a> over an American flag he had previously <a href="https://x.com/BillMelugin_/status/1974088103829926100">taken from a protester</a> who was trying to burn it.</p> <p>The charges against Sortor were later dropped after an outcry in the conservative media prompted the head of the civil rights division of the Department of Justice, Harmeet Dhillon, to <a href="https://x.com/AAGDhillon/status/1974175518435217577/photo/1">threaten an investigation</a> of the Portland police bureau over supposed anti-conservative bias.</p> <p>The two women Sortor was arrested for fighting with still face charges, as does a Trump supporter who intervened in Sortor’s scuffle over the flag and punched a protester, knocking him to the ground.</p> <p>The event is still going on.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-10-08T22:34:41.361Z">at 11.34pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-68e6c1058f0871610d006ac9" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-08T19:56:23.549Z">8.56pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Sortor is now speaking at the roundtable, and is chastising the Portland police for arresting him, and baselessly claiming that local officials are “willing to sacrifice their own citizens just to appease these Antifa terrorists”.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68e6bf4e8f08e1d65d2a57b4" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-10-08T19:50:15.373Z">8.50pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Pam Bondi just mentioned the arrest of rightwing influencer <strong>Nick Sortor</strong>, who was arrested by police in Portland, Oregon, last week while covering the ongoing protests outside an immigration facility.
