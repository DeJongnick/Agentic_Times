<p>Reflections on the former US president Jimmy Carter’s character in stark contrast to President-elect Trump make sober reading (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/dec/29/jimmy-carter-death-trump-biden">Jimmy Carter’s death comes at a time when rancour and uncertainty prevail, 30 December</a>). With only days to go before the return to the politics of chaos in the US, I believe that many Americans (and indeed many people across the globe) still highly value decency.</p> <p>While I accept that in recent years in both the UK and US, decency has come under fire (and become unfashionable), surely we owe it to the next generation not to accept the narrative that indecent politics is the norm and the only way to get things done.</p> <p>As I write this letter, on the last day of 2024, I am reminded of Alfred Lord Tennyson’s epic new year’s poem, <a href="https://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poem/ring-out-wild-bells/">Ring out, wild bells</a>. It represents a clarion call to ring out those negative things in society that break individuals down such as those “ancient forms of party strife”, “the faithless coldness of the times”, “the civic slander and the spite” – and to ring in the positives namely, “the nobler modes of life / with sweeter manners, purer laws” and “the love of truth and right”, all that make for the common good. We have it in our power to ensure that decency isn’t consigned to a bygone era, but can flourish again the public sphere if we continue to nurture and care for it.<br><strong>Rev Mike Corcoran</strong><br><em>Great Bowden, Market Harborough</em></p>
