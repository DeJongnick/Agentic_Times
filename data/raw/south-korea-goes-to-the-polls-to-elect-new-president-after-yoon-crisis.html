<p>South Koreans are voting for a new president in a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/14/after-chaos-of-the-yoon-era-south-korea-prepares-to-pick-a-new-president-ntwnfb"> snap election</a> triggered by a brief period of martial law imposed by the now-impeached former leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/yoon-suk-yeol">Yoon Suk Yeol</a>.</p> <p>Polls suggested that Yoon’s liberal arch-rival, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/as-south-korea-heads-to-the-polls-can-lee-jae-myung-bring-the-country-back-from-the-brink">Lee Jae-myung</a>, was heading for a comfortable victory in what Lee has described as “judgment day” for Asia’s fourth-biggest economy.</p> <p>Lee, a 61-year-old former human rights lawyer who has made two failed attempts to reach the presidential Blue House, has ridden a wave of public anger that followed Yoon’s declaration of martial law in early December.</p> <p>The order, which was overturned in a matter of hours, sparked South Korea’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/06/k-pop-and-autocrats-jolt-to-democracy-lays-bare-south-korea-two-sides">biggest political crisis in decades</a>, while the country also battles an economic downturn, income inequality and doubts over the US’s commitment to its security under Donald Trump.</p> <p>The main conservative candidate, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/03/south-koreas-conservatives-pick-hardline-kim-moon-soo-as-presidential-candidate">Kim Moon-soo</a>, has struggled to win over moderate swing voters while his People Power party feuds over how to view Yoon’s legacy.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/02/as-south-korea-heads-to-the-polls-can-lee-jae-myung-bring-the-country-back-from-the-brink">As South Korea heads to the polls, can Lee Jae-myung bring the country back from the brink?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Turnout was expected to be high. In early voting last Thursday and Friday, more than a third of the 44.39 million eligible voters cast their ballots. Polling stations close at 8pm on Tuesday, and the winner will be declared several hours later, possibly before midnight.</p> <p>Some South Koreans view the election, called after the constitutional court <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/04/south-korea-president-yoon-suk-yeol-impeachment-verdict-results-removal">upheld Yoon’s impeachment</a> in early April, as evidence that their democracy is in good health.</p> <p>But the division unleashed by Yoon is expected to follow the new president into his single five-year term, which begins on Wednesday without the traditional two-month transition period.</p> <p>Large crowds have taken to the streets in recent months to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/04/south-koreans-celebrating-yoon-suk-yeol-impeachment-saga-is-far-from-over">denounce</a> or support Yoon, whose suspension, and then removal, left a leadership vacuum that shook the country’s diplomatic activities and financial markets.</p> <p>The new president will face several major challenges, including a slowing economy, Trump’s trade war and the nuclear threat posed by North Korea.</p>    <p>In his final campaign speeches on Monday, Lee promised to revitalise the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions, warning that victory for Kim would allow Yoon’s “rebellion forces” to return.</p> <p>“If they somehow win, that would mean the return of the rebellion forces, the destruction of democracy, the deprival of people’s human rights, the normalisation of martial law and our country’s downfall into a backward, third-world nation,” Lee told a crowd at a party in Seoul.</p> <p>Kim, a former labour minister under Yoon, warned that a victorious Lee would abuse his powers to retaliate against his political opponents and use his party’s majority in the national assembly to protect him in several court cases that will resume after the election.</p> <p>Lee “is now trying to seize all power in South Korea and establish a Hitler-like dictatorship,” Kim told a rally in the south-eastern city of Busan.</p> <p>Lee, who led the opposition-led campaign to oust Yoon, is a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics. He faces multiple criminal trials, including charges of bribery and alleged involvement in a property development scandal.</p> <p>Courts have agreed to postpone further hearings of ongoing trials until after the election, allowing him to contest the presidency while the cases remain unresolved. Lee denies all charges, describing them as politically motivated persecution.</p> <p>Lee, who grew up in a poor household and worked in factories as a child, has shown a more cautious side in recent speeches, despite his reputation as a radical reformer determined to take on the country’s conservative establishment.</p> <p>He has promised to be pragmatic in foreign affairs, committing himself to South Korea’s alliance with the US and vowing to continue Seoul’s partnership with Washington and Tokyo, mirroring the policies of his conservative predecessor.</p> <p>Lee, however, wants to move away from Yoon’s confrontational approach towards North Korea and re-engage with the South’s nuclear-armed neighbour, although he has conceded that it will be “very difficult” to quickly resume summits with the North’s leader, Kim Jong-un.</p>
