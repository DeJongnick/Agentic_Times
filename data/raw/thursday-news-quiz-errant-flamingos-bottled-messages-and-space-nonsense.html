<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2025-11-06T06:30:47Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p>Once upon a time the Thursday quiz cared deeply about the changing of the seasons and the sanctity of November. Now, however, Christmas adverts are already everywhere, flamingos are on the loose, and people are questioning the moon landings again. It all feels too much. So why not distract yourself with our 15 questions about topical news and general knowledge. There are no prizes, but do let us know how you get on in the comments. <em>Allons-y!</em></p>
