It’s absurd that he’s trying to rebrand himself as someone who cares about working families when he couldn’t even be bothered to show up to vote for scrapping the two-child benefit cap in July.</p> <p>He calls himself a patriot, but he’s the very opposite. Real patriotism is about looking after one another, not turning people against each other for political gain.</p> <p>I again invite Nigel to a public debate on climate change. If he believes what he says, let’s see if his bluster holds up in a full hour-long TV debate.</p> <p>Net zero, done right, is our best shot at building a resilient economy, lowering bills for families, and preventing climate catastrophe. If Farage really cared about working people, he’d back a sector growing three times faster than the rest of the economy. But he won’t.</p> <p>Why? Because Farage isn’t fighting for working people.

He said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>You will all be lined up in your droves to say to me, how on earth can you afford all of this? How on earth can you afford £5bn here or £5bn there, almost forgetting that the national debt is now £2.8tn, and that not just the last government, but this one too, are hopelessly adrift when it comes to government borrowing.</p> <p>We are going to make big savings. We will stand here before you in one year’s time and show you the excessive costs that we’ve taken out of local government and at a national level.</p> <p>If we win the next election, we will scrap net zero, something that is costing the exchequer an extraordinary £40bn plus pounds every year.</p> <p>There will be no more asylum hotels or houses of multiple occupancy. People who come here illegally across the channel or on the back of lorries will not be allowed to stay.</p> <p>We will scrap the DEI agenda, which is costing the taxpayer up to £7bn pounds a year throughout the public sector. And yes, we see considerable savings to be made amongst the quangos.</p> <p>So yes, I do accept that these proposals, especially the one of lifting to £20,000 the level at which people start paying tax. I accept that it’s expensive.</p> <p>But I genuinely believe that we can pay for it because we’re not ideologically tied to the same ideas upon which we believe the Conservative and Labour governments have gone so wrong over the course of the last few years. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6835ad2e8f08dd3114f2f3e6" class="block is-summary" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-05-27T12:20:41.742Z">1.20pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">The day so far</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <ul> <li><p><strong>Nigel Farage</strong> says prime minister <strong>Keir Starmer</strong> doesn’t believe in anything, and that “while I don’t bear him any personal grudge, I don’t think there’s any malice in him at all” he did not appear to have a plan for government</p></li> <li><p><strong>Farage</strong> said it is Reform UK policy to lift the two-child benefit cap, and the removal of a universal winter fuel allowance.
