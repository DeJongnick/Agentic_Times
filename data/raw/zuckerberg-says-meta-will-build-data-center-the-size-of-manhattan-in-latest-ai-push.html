<p>Mark Zuckerberg proclaimed that Meta would spend hundreds of billions of dollars on developing artificial intelligence products in the near future and, to that end, construct a data center planned to be nearly the size of Manhattan.</p> <p>The parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is among the large tech companies that have struck high-profile deals, and doled out multimillion-dollar pay packages to AI researchers in recent months – some as high as $100m – to fast-track work on machines that could outthink humans on many tasks, a concept known as “super-intelligence” or “artificial general intelligence”.</p> <p>Its first multi-gigawatt data center, dubbed Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, while another, called Hyperion, will be able to scale up to 5 gigawatts over the coming years, Zuckerberg said.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/28/mark-zuckerberg-ai-list">Mark Zuckerberg’s secret list of top AI talent to poach has tech world atwitter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We’re building multiple more titan clusters as well.

It is betting that the division will generate new cashflows from the Meta AI app, image-to-video ad tools and smart glasses.</p> <p>DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria said Meta was investing aggressively in AI as the technology has already boosted its ad business by allowing it to sell more ads and at higher prices.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Zuckerberg has personally led an aggressive talent raid for the Meta Superintelligence Labs, which will be led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and ex-GitHub chief Nat Friedman, after Meta invested $14.3bn in Scale.</p> <p>Meta had raised its 2025 capital expenditure predictions to between $64bn and $72bn in April, aiming to bolster the company’s position against rivals OpenAI and Google.</p>
