<p>Among the ancient woods of the west, ghosts of creatures long gone linger in an odour that grows stronger by the day. That first whiff came in February with a lift of a chill breeze. Or was it stirred by the brush of a blackbird’s wing? Either way, a jolt of recognition made me exclaim in soft exultation:&nbsp;“<em>Bärlauch!”</em></p> <p>The leaves poking up at that <a href="https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discover/blogs-and-features/2016/01/29/exit-pursued-by-a-bear/">winter’s tail</a> were no more than fingernail extensions. Today, the hand-length spears make sprays that splay outwards, lapping and overlapping each other, carpeting the slopes to the exclusion of all else. A feast of greens.</p> <p>Legend has it that the strengthening smell would rouse great beasts from their winter slumber, to chow down on the only&nbsp;available edible and abundant&nbsp;food of the woods. My uncle, who grew up among forests in northern Germany that are so big you would struggle to walk them in a day, told me the story with wonder in his voice. In Britain,&nbsp;we deny the plant its magical resonance by calling it wild garlic, or ramsons – a Saxon word that has lost its meaning. Peep under the Latin cloak and the scientific tag <em>Allium&nbsp;ursinum</em> reveals all – <a href="https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/trees-woods-and-wildlife/plants/wild-flowers/wild-garlic/">it is bear’s garlic</a>.</p> <p>A chive-like scent hangs in the air, a condiment to elevate any walk, though in truth, the tang dips&nbsp;in and out of my consciousness. When it comes again, I hear the smell as the high&nbsp;notes of a violin, keening in a&nbsp;minor&nbsp;key.</p> <p>April has brought out its flowers, a cluster of six-fingered white crowns opening on each plant. In my old woodland haunts of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire, a lilac blaze of bluebells was the norm, bear’s garlic was a rarity and, even then, in spreads not much bigger than a kitchen table. Here, truly the west is white, the plant flourishing in woods, hedges and riverbanks alike.</p> <p>By midsummer, the crowns will fall, scattering their seeds for the next generation in another year. The now-tender leaves will be leathery old flags, exuding an ignoble pong of old onions. And those phantom bears, their&nbsp;bellies&nbsp;full, will have&nbsp;drifted&nbsp;out of&nbsp;memory.</p> <p>• Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order at <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-changing-skies-9781783353101/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=article">guardianbookshop.com</a> and get a 15% discount</p>
