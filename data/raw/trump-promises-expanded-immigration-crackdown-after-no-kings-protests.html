<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has promised an expanded immigration crackdown in several large Democratic-led cities as apparent vengeance for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/no-kings-protests-trump-military-parade">“No Kings” protests</a> against his administration on Saturday that drew millions of people – despite questions over whether the agency in charge of the effort is set to run out of money.</p> 
<p>In new reporting on Monday, Axios claimed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) was <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/16/ice-cash-crisis-immigration-crackdown-trump">$1bn over budget</a> and set to run out of money in the next one to three months.</p> 
<p>The outlet noted that Trump’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/22/what-is-trump-big-beautiful-bill">big, beautiful bill</a>” directed tens of billions of dollars to Ice over the next five years and suggested Trump would direct other government funds to the agency if the bill failed to pass <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">Congress</a>.</p>

<p>Trump raised the specter of an expanded immigration crackdown in a lengthy Sunday night post to his Truth Social network, alleging without evidence that the cities had become the “core of the Democratic power center” by using “illegal aliens to expand their voter base”.</p> 
<p>Non-citizens are not permitted to vote in US elections – and there is no widespread evidence of them ever having done so.</p> 
<p>“ICE Officers are herewith ordered, by notice of this TRUTH, to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114690267066155731">he wrote</a>.</p> 
<p>“We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/home-depot-ice-raids-los-angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.”</p> 
<p>The California city has become a flashpoint for protests against Ice raids, with Trump sending in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/12/los-angeles-national-guard-troops-marines-morale">national guard troops and US marines</a> in an unprecedented show of force. On Saturday, it hosted one of the largest No Kings demonstrations in the country, with an estimated 200,000 in attendance, <a href="https://www.livenowfox.com/news/no-kings-protest-crowds-size">according</a> to organisers.</p> 
<p>Trump’s stance on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/usimmigration">immigration</a> has fluctuated wildly in recent days. Last week, his administration ordered Ice to stop <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/ice-raids-farms-hotels-email">workplace immigration enforcement actions</a> unless related to criminal investigations, in the face of growing public backlash to raids perceived to harm industries with a significant proportion of immigrant labor, such as farming and tourism.</p> 
<p>“Our great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace,” Trump <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114670684664650262">wrote</a> Thursday on Truth Social, promising that “changes are coming”.</p> 
<p>Sunday’s post, however, appeared to reverse his position again. His choice to identify only Democratic-run cities with large immigrant populations, and omit others controlled by, or leaning Republican, was notable.</p> 
<p>His use of the far-right buzzword “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/03/how-remigration-became-a-buzzword-for-europes-far-right">remigration</a>” to describe his administration’s deportation agenda is also seen as deliberate.</p> 
<p>“Our Federal Government will continue to be focused on the REMIGRATION of Aliens to the places from where they came, and preventing the admission of ANYONE who undermines the domestic tranquility of the United States,” he wrote.</p> 
<p>Trump’s statement followed Saturday’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/15/trump-army-parade">military parade</a> in Washington DC, which took place ostensibly to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the US army – but which critics said was hijacked by the president on his 79th birthday as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/trump-military-parade-history">celebration of himself</a>.</p> 
<p>One spectator summed up the general sentiment of the parade: “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/15/trump-army-parade">just kind of … lame</a>”.</p> 
<p>The president was already under pressure for politicizing the military, and his role as commander-in-chief, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/trump-fort-bragg-los-angeles-sketch">his appearance last Tuesday</a> at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, at an event during which a pop-up shop sold Trump merchandise to active-duty soldiers.</p> 
<p>He shredded decades of non-partisan traditions at military events by tearing into Democratic political opponents in California, including the governor, Gavin Newsom, and the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, and showing that the situation there was dominating his thoughts.</p> 
<p>“They’re incompetent, and they paid troublemakers, agitators and insurrectionists,” he said.</p> 
<p>“They’re engaged in this willful attempt to nullify federal law and aid the occupation of the city by criminal invaders.”</p>

<p>Trump’s Sunday order to Ice, and partners including the homeland security department, to step up operations comes as his immigration adviser, White House deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, has called for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/15/trump-immigration-stephen-miller-influence">minimum of 3,000 arrests a day</a>.</p> 
<p>Analyst Chuck Todd, former host of NBC’s Meet the Press, said Trump was “openly admitting that he’s politicizing law enforcement”.</p> 
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/chucktodd/status/1934427597074563387">post to X</a>, Todd wrote: “This will not help Ice’s image because he’s asking them to perform a political task. Throw in the decision to shield the red states from law enforcement and he’s clearly hoping to provoke an angry response.”</p>
