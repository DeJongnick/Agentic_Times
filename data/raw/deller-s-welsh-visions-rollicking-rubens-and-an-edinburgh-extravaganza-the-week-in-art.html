It was a lucky punt as the mixed media artwork turned out to be one of a series of illustrations for an abandoned Arabian Nights project by Salvador Dalí. It is now back up for sale at auction, but at the slightly steeper estimated price of £20,000 to £30,000. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/29/salvador-dali-painting-bought-for-150-house-sale-worth-20-thousand">Read the full story</a>. </p> <h2>What we learned</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/30/a-sidney-nolan-above-the-sofa-inside-artbank-the-collection-that-lets-you-rent-a-masterpiece">Australians can rent a masterpiece from Artbank’s public collection</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/30/casa-susanna-cross-dressing-catskills">Lost photos by a trans community in the 1960s went on show in New York’s Met</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/27/rare-original-proof-of-david-baileys-1965-box-of-pin-ups-discovered">A rare original proof of David Bailey’s benchmark 1965 Box of Pin-Ups has been found</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/29/tate-director-blames-brexit-and-covid-for-slump-in-visitors">Tate director Maria Balshaw blames Brexit and Covid for a huge slump in visitors</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/29/stanley-donwood-thom-yorke-this-is-what-you-get-review-radiohead-ashmolean-museum">Thom Yorke of Radiohead’s work with Stanley Donwood was not a hit with our critic</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/29/matthew-barney-artist-tactical-parallax">Matthew Barney called his new show a western ‘that may involve shooting</a>’</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/jul/30/lady-pink-graffiti-exhibition-london">The daredevil queen of New York graffiti artists recalled scaring Keith Haring</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2> <p><strong>The Feast of Herod by Peter Paul Rubens, circa 1635-38</strong></p>    <p>Salome in a sinfully red frock serves up the head of John the Baptist on a platter in this rollicking work by Rubens at his most lavish. The story of the Baptist’s martyrdom – also painted by Caravaggio and dramatised by Oscar Wilde with illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley – has it that Salome’s mother Herodias got her to demand John’s head in return for dancing before her stepfather Herod. Rubens gives it a cannibalistic twist: he dwells on the banquet’s food and drink and has the head brought up to Herod as an exotic dish. Herodias sticks her fork in its tongue. Yummy! Herod looks shocked and nauseated as he is forced to eat the reward of his sick lust for his stepdaughter. <br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/5382">Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in Touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
