<p>Australia has joined 22 other nations in condemning Israel over its decision to allow limited aid into Gaza while announcing a military expansion to “take control” of the besieged strip.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said his troops <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/19/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-take-control-gaza-uk-france-canada-threaten-action">were “making progress” on taking control of Gaza</a> after Israel’s military had earlier declared a central city a combat zone and killed more than 60 people in airstrikes, while a senior minister said Israel’s army would “wipe out” what remains of Palestinian Gaza.</p> <p>The escalation comes as those in Gaza face a looming famine following Israel’s 11-week blockade of food, fuel and aid supplies from entering the territory.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/19/israel-gaza-war-us-congress-white-house">As key Israel allies threaten action over Gaza catastrophe, Washington is largely unmoved</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a statement on Tuesday morning Australian time, 23 countries, including the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, urged Israel not to politicise humanitarian aid for the starving population.</p> <p>About nine aid trucks were reportedly allowed into Gaza after the nearly three-month siege, but the UN’s humanitarian chief, Tom Fletcher, warned it was a mere “drop in the ocean of what is urgently needed”.</p> <p>The joint statement acknowledged “indications of a limited restart of aid” but implored Israel to uphold humanitarian principles by allowing the full resumption of aid and for aid groups to be able to work independently and impartially.</p> <p>“Food, medicines and essential supplies are exhausted.

Gaza’s people must receive the aid they desperately need,” the countries said.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Netanyahu’s plan for aid distribution in Gaza was yet to be announced, but the Israel-backed and US-led Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) was expected to distribute food through militarised compounds.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/17/israel-backed-food-aid-group-admits-it-wont-be-able-to-reach-most-vulnerable-in-gaza">“Advanced discussions”</a> suggested heads of households would be expected to collect boxes weighing up to 20kg with several days’ worth of food and basic hygiene items like soap for their families.</p> <p>There would be no provision for those too sick or weakened by famine to walk long distances across Gaza’s ruined landscape with heavy loads.</p> <p>The UN has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/17/israel-backed-food-aid-group-admits-it-wont-be-able-to-reach-most-vulnerable-in-gaza">already raised concerns</a> about GHF’s capacity to deliver enough aid to the territory’s population.</p> <p>The 23 countries raised concerns about the GHF proposal, stating existing aid groups already had the “logistical capacity, expertise and operational coverage to deliver assistance across Gaza to those who need it most”.</p> <p>“The UN has raised concerns that the proposed model cannot deliver aid effectively, at the speed and scale required. It places beneficiaries and aid workers at risk, undermines the role and independence of the UN and our trusted partners, and links humanitarian aid to political and military objectives,” the joint statement read.</p> <p>“Humanitarian aid should never be politicised and Palestinian territory must not be reduced nor subjected to any demographic change.”</p> <p>Australia joined the joint donor statement overnight but not a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-from-the-leaders-of-the-united-kingdom-france-and-canada-on-the-situation-in-gaza-and-the-west-bank">separate statement signed</a> by Canada, the UK and France warning Israel against expanding its military campaign in Gaza, threatening “further action”, including targeted sanctions.</p> <p>“The level of human suffering in Gaza is intolerable. Yesterday’s announcement that Israel will allow a basic quantity of food into Gaza is wholly inadequate,” the three countries said, marking a change in tone from the UK and Canada in particular, which have broadly backed Israel’s war after the 7 October Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage.</p> <p>“Israel suffered a heinous attack on October 7. We have always supported Israel’s right to defend Israelis against terrorism. But this escalation is wholly disproportionate.</p> <p>“We will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions. If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response.”</p> <p>Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right critic of any negotiated end to the war, defended Netanyahu’s decision to let in “basic” food aid, saying it would allow Israel to keep its military in Gaza for a campaign of destruction and displacement.</p> <p>“Now we conquer, cleanse and stay – until Hamas is destroyed,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/19/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-take-control-gaza-uk-france-canada-threaten-action">he told a news conference</a>. “Along the way, what remains of the strip is also being wiped out.</p> <p>“As part of the war, the IDF is moving the population out of combat zones … The population will reach the south of the strip, and from there, with God’s help, move to third countries under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/26/trump-resumes-sending-2000-pound-bombs-to-israel-undoing-biden-pause">President [Donald] Trump’s plan</a>.”</p> <p>An Australian government spokesperson said the “abhorrent comments” by the Netanyahu government were “unacceptable”, adding Australia had consistently opposed the military expansion by Israel in Gaza, “just as we have been clear that forced displacement of Palestinians from Gaza would breach international law”.</p> <p>“Abhorrent comments by members of the Netanyahu government and the ongoing denial of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population are unacceptable,” they said.</p> <p>“The statement released by Australia and 22 other countries demands the immediate and full resumption of aid to Gaza.</p> <p>“Australia continues to work with our partners to press for a ceasefire, the return of hostages, and the protection of civilians.”</p> <p>The total toll from the war inside Gaza has reached 53,486, most of them civilians. At least 121,034 Palestinian people have been injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in its latest update.</p>
