<h1>The Guardian view on Donald Trump’s China deal: rare earths pave the green road to militarisation</h1>

<p>It’s an irony that the minerals needed to save the planet&nbsp;may help destroy it. Rare earth elements, the mineral backbones of wind turbines and electric vehicles, are now the prize in a geopolitical arms race. The trade <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/27/us-china-rare-earth-shipments-deal">agreement</a> between Washington and Beijing restores rare earth shipments from China to the US, which had been suspended in retaliation against Donald Trump’s tariffs. Behind the bluster, there has been a realisation in Washington that these are critical inputs for the US. They are needed not just by American icons such as <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ford-ceo-china-rare-earth-shortage-car-production/">Ford</a> and Boeing but for its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/16/china-trade-war-us-arms-firms-rare-earths-supply">fighter jets</a>, missile guidance systems and satellite&nbsp;communications.</p> <p>This understanding suggests that Washington will scale back some of its countermeasures once Beijing resumes delivery of rare earths. The paradox is that to&nbsp;reduce its dependence on China, the US must depend on Beijing a little longer. This is not yet decoupling; it’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jun/11/trump-china-trade-deal">deferment</a>. That, however, may not last. Mr Trump has signed an executive order to boost&nbsp;production of critical minerals, which encourages the faster granting of permits for mining and processing projects. He eyes <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-know-about-signed-us-ukraine-minerals-deal">Ukraine</a> and&nbsp;Greenland’s subterranean riches to break dependence on China.</p> <p>The west became so reliant on a single geopolitical rival for such materials – materials it once extracted and refined domestically before shuttering operations – due to cost and environmental concerns. China, for its part, has come to dominate global rare earth processing. It has used that market power before –&nbsp;notably against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/aug/18/the-guardian-view-on-rare-earths-mining-them-cant-cost-the-earth">Japan</a> in 2010. It’s hard not to think that it was strategic complacency that led to the west relying so heavily on China for key minerals.</p> <p>This month’s Nato summit has seen the west push to reindustrialise via rearming itself. This is also reawakening long-dormant extractive ambitions in the global north. <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/article/carney-says-canada-will-meet-new-nato-spending-target-by-developing-critical-minerals/">Canada</a>, flush with critical mineral deposits, says its planned mining resurgence will be a new foundation for alliance solidarity. This month the EU <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/eu-needs-rare-earths-strategic-reserves-against-china-threat-commissioner-tells-2025-06-23/">called</a> for strategic reserves of rare earths “to prevent supply chain disruptions and economic blackmail from China” – highlighting their importance not just for electric vehicles but for defence and aerospace industries. “Resilience” means <a href="https://www.mining.com/eu-unveils-47-strategic-projects-to-secure-critical-minerals-access/">digging deeper</a> at home and controlling extraction abroad.</p> <p>The same minerals we need for net zero are being justified in terms of zero-sum rivalry. It is uncomfortable that “green growth” and militarism have merged into a single policy frame, collapsing the distinction between ecological transition and arms buildup. A magnet for an <a href="https://www.magnetapplications.com/blog/rare-earth-magnets-in-electric-vehicle-motors">electric car</a> is also a magnet for a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/analysis-china-rare-earth-weapon-090351888.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAExDNTLRvcKywnLzWtUxN-4KiasdeUvsaA2FwYNgrt8eCSOOHWFQo5R5Kzx9ImUSX8QERCVc8135RtRFYrb6ybEcGlcEINChRTxm7j-9q_FY4UaJryVjbaUbCFZ_el92OeazFXMeOljA9sEXMssP0vjwclHk71TVD7K7HmqJat-w">hypersonic missile</a>. And meanwhile, the human and ecological toll continues to rise – largely out of sight and out of sync with the idea of environmental sustainability.</p> <p>A Guardian dispatch last week from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/china-rare-earths-baotou-life-metallic-elements">Baotou</a>, China’s rare earth capital, found evidence of toxic ponds, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep12483">poisoned soil</a> and demolished “cancer villages” – the hidden cost of our digital and electric age. Framing this as an inconvenient necessity risks repeating past mistakes. For mineral-rich nations, the surge in global demand brings opportunity. But as a <a href="https://desapublications.un.org/sites/default/files/publications/2025-01/WESP%202025_Harnessing%20the%20Potential%20of%20Critical%20Minerals%20for%20Sustainable%20Development_WEB.pdf">UN report</a> this year noted, without strong institutions and safeguards, it risks a familiar fate: corruption, conflict and environmental ruin.</p> <p>Today’s scramble for critical minerals must not see the promises of responsible sourcing give way to a familiar logic – extract first, moralise later.</p>
