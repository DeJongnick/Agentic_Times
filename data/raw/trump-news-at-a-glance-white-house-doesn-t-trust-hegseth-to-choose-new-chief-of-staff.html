<p> Exasperated by the turmoil that has dogged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>’s office in recent weeks, the White House will block the US defense secretary’s choice of chief of staff and select a candidate of its own, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>Hegseth had suggested giving the chief of staff position to Marine Col Ricky Buria after the first person in the role, Joe Kasper, left last month in the wake of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/26/pete-hegseth-leak-investigation">contentious leak investigation</a> that brought the ouster of three other senior aides. But the White House has made clear to Hegseth that Buria will not be elevated.</p> <p>Here are the key stories at a glance:</p>  <h2>White House block Hegseth choice for new chief of staff</h2>  <p>The move to block Hegseth’s choice at this juncture is unusual and reflects <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>’s intent to keep Hegseth by trying to insulate him from any more missteps.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/white-house-pentagon-hegseth-chief-of-staff"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump mulls ending habeas corpus</h2>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> is considering suspending the writ of habeas corpus, the legal right to challenge one’s detention, Stephen Miller, a top White House adviser, said on Friday.</p> <p>Suspending habeas corpus would be an extremely aggressive move that would dramatically escalate the Trump administration’s efforts to attack the rule of law in American courts as it tries to deport people without giving them a chance to challenge the basis of their removals.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/may/09/end-habeas-corpus-detention-trump-stephen-miller"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Judge orders release of detained Tufts student</h2>  <p>A federal judge in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vermont">Vermont</a> on Friday morning ordered the release on bail of a Tufts University student arrested in March for her political speech and now held <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/29/ice-detention-centers-immigration-asylum">in Louisiana</a> in what she and her lawyers argue is a breach of her constitutional rights.</p> <p>The judge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/07/detained-tufts-student-rumeysa-ozturk-ruling">had ordered</a> Rümeysa Öztürk’s return to Vermont, where she was briefly held after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/ice-agents-detain-tufts-university-graduate-student">being grabbed</a> on the street by masked immigration agents near Boston, for hearings.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/trump-tufts-student-deportation-rumeysa-ozturk"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump floats China tariff cut to 80%</h2>  <p>Donald Trump has floated cutting tariffs on China from 145% to 80% before a weekend meeting as he looks to de-escalate the trade war.</p> <p>Top US officials are expected to meet a high-level Chinese delegation this weekend in Switzerland in the first significant talks between the two nations since Trump provoked a trade war with stiff tariffs on imports.</p> <p>The US president wrote “80% Tariff on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> seems right!
