  <p><strong>The number of hungry people around the world fell for a third straight year in 2024, retreating from a Covid-era spike, even as conflict and climate shocks deepened malnutrition across much of Africa and western Asia, a UN report said on Monday.</strong></p> 
  <p>Around 673 million people, or 8.2% of the world’s population, experienced hunger in 2024, down from 8.5% in 2023, according to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report, jointly prepared by five UN agencies.</p> 
  <p>They said the report focused on chronic, long-term problems and did not fully reflect the impact of acute crises brought on by specific events and wars, including Gaza.</p> 
  <p>Maximo Torero, the chief economist for the UN Food and Agricultural Organization, said improved access to food in South America and India had driven the overall decline but cautioned that conflict and other factors in places such as Africa and the Middle East risked undoing those gains.</p> 
  <p>“If conflict continues to grow, of course, if vulnerabilities continue to grow, and the debt stress continues to increase, the numbers will increase again,” he told Reuters on the sidelines of a UN food summit in Ethiopia.</p>

  <p>Israel meanwhile eased some aid restrictions as it came under mounting pressure over the spiraling hunger crisis in the war-ravaged territory.</p> 
  <p>Israel announced Sunday that the military would pause operations in Gaza City, Deir al-Balah and Muwasi for 10 hours a day until further notice to allow for the improved flow of aid and designate secure routes for aid delivery.</p> 
  <p>Aid agencies have welcomed the new measures but say they are not enough to counter worsening starvation in the Palestinian territory.</p> 
  <p>Israel said it would continue military operations alongside the new humanitarian measures. The Israeli military had no immediate comment about the latest strikes, which occurred outside the time frame for the pause Israel declared would be held between 10am and 8pm.</p>

  <p>More quotes now from Donald Trump, who has been answering questions from journalists in Scotland alongside British prime minister Keir Starmer.</p> 
  <p>He said the US and others are giving money and food to Gaza and that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has “got to sort of like run it”.</p> 
  <p>“I want him to make sure they get the food,” Trump said. “I want to make sure they get the food.”</p> 
  <p>Trump also said that Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, was “difficult” to deal with and suggested it was reluctant to release the remaining living 20 hostages as Hamas views them as important leverage in negotiations.</p> 
  <p>Trump said now there are fewer hostages it will be harder to make a deal because Hamas uses them as a “shield” and “when they give them up, they no longer have a shield”. He said him and Netanyahu are “coming up with various plans”, without getting into specifics.</p> 
  <p>Trump added:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>I’m going to say it’s a very difficult situation. If they didn’t have the hostages, things would go very quickly, but they do, and we know where they have them, in some cases, and you don’t want to go riding roughshod over that area, because that means those hostages will be killed.</em></p>

  <p>Spain says it will airdrop 12 tonnes of food into Gaza this week, in what will be a rare example of a European nation joining Middle Eastern countries in sending aid into the territory by air.</p> 
  <p>Spanish prime minister <strong>Pedro Sanchez</strong>, who has described Israel’s war as a genocide against the civilian population of Gaza, told a news conference that the delivery would take place from Jordan on Friday using Spanish air force planes.</p> 
  <p>“The famine in Gaza is a shame for all of humanity and stopping it, therefore, is a moral imperative,” he said.</p> 
  <p>Two planes from the Jordanian and UAE air force airdropped 17 tons of humanitarian aid in Gaza on Monday, Jordan’s military said.</p> 
  <p>On Sunday, 180 trucks carrying aid entered Gaza, according to the Israeli military body in charge of overseeing humanitarian aid.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Trump says the US will set up 'food centres' in Gaza</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Donald Trump</strong> has said the US will set up “food centres” in Gaza, without elaborating on what this would actually mean in practice. </p> 
  <p>He did acknowledge that starvation across the territory is real, in contradiction to what Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. </p> 
  <p>Addressing the media alongside Keir Starmer in Scotland, the US president was quoted as having said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We’re going to set up food centres and we’re going to do it in conjunction with some very good people and supply funds and we just took in trillions of dollars.</em></p> 
   <p><em>We’ve got a lot of money and we’re going to spend a little money on some food and other nations are joining us, I know your nation’s joining us, and we have all of the European nations joining us.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>“We’re not going to have fences,” Trump stressed, adding that the British government would support the plan.</p> 
  <p>Trump has described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as “terrible” and has blamed Hamas for the “mess” in the territory and for the failed ceasefire talks.</p> 
  <p>But he rarely openly criticises his close ally, Benjamin Netanyahu, whose war he fuels by providing him with a vast amount of weapons and by sheltering Israel on the diplomatic stage.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><em>Emma Graham-Harrison is the Guardian’s chief Middle East correspondent, based in Jerusalem</em></p> 
  <p>Two leading human rights organisations based in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a>, <strong>B’Tselem</strong> and <strong>Physicians for Human Rights</strong>, say Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and the country’s western allies have a legal and moral duty to stop it.</p> 
  <p>In reports published on Monday, the two groups said Israel had targeted civilians in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza">Gaza</a> only because of their identity as Palestinians over nearly two years of war, causing severe and in some cases irreparable damage to Palestinian society.</p> 
  <p>Multiple international and Palestinian groups have already described the war as genocidal, but reports from two of Israel-Palestine’s most respected human rights organisations, who have for decades documented systemic abuses, is likely to add to pressure for action.</p> 
  <p>The reports detailed crimes including the killing of tens of thousands of women, children and elderly people, mass forced displacement and starvation, and the destruction of homes and civilian infrastructure that have deprived Palestinians of healthcare, education and other basic rights.</p>

  <p>Gaza’s civil defence agency said 16 people have been killed by Israeli forces so far today.</p> 
  <p>Agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency that among the dead were five people killed in an overnight strike on a residential building in the southern Gaza district of <strong>al-Mawasi</strong>, an area Israel has regularly attacked despite declaring it a “safe zone”.</p> 
  <p>A pregnant woman was among those killed, the Palestinian Red Crescent said, adding its teams saved the woman’s foetus by performing a Caesarean section in a field hospital.</p> 
  <p>Bassal said five people were killed in another airstrike in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, and six people were killed in two separate strikes in <strong>Gaza City</strong> and <strong>central Gaza</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Central Gaza’s Al-Awda hospital said, meanwhile, that one person was killed and nine others injured when Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinian people waiting for aid in central Gaza.</p> 
  <p>All of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents have been displaced at least once since the start of the war, and the UN says 88% of the territory is now either under evacuation orders or within Israeli military zones.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Sunday's aid deliveries only a 'drop in the ocean' of what is needed in Gaza, UN warns</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The UN’s aid chief, <strong>Tom Fletcher</strong>, has been interviewed by the BBC’s Today programme. Here are the main takeaways from what he said:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p>Sunday’s aid deliveries were a “start” but represented a “drop in the ocean” of what the civilian population of Gaza needs.</p></li> 
   <li><p>During the 42-day ceasefire (that came into effect after Donald Trump re-entered the White House in January) 600-700 aid trucks were getting into Gaza each day (Israel says Gaza got 120 trucks yesterday).</p></li> 
   <li><p>The next few days “are really make or break” and much more aid needs to be delivered and delivered much more quickly.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The UN and its partners can reach everyone in Gaza in the next couple of weeks with life-saving aid if its teams are granted access at border crossings, are given the security permits they need to operate and are not otherwise blocked.</p></li> 
   <li><p>They got “quite a bit of food in” yesterday but “lots of that got looted” as it went across the border.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The humanitarian pauses implemented by Israel may “last a week or so”, which is clearly insufficient as we are seeing a “21st-century atrocity” unfolding in front of our eyes.</p></li> 
   <li><p>There needs to be a sustained period of weeks or months to stop starvation and ultimately a ceasefire is needed.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Hundreds of thousands of people are “desperately hungry” inside Gaza – so most of the lorries yesterday “were hit by desperate individual civilians, starving”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>“The flour was taken off those lorries … so what we do is we work with local communities, community kitchens, so that what we can get through then gets distributed to those who most need it and importantly that the armed groups, including Hamas, don’t get it”.</p></li> 
   <li><p>Fletcher wishes the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation – an Israeli-backed delivery group – would distribute aid in a “more principled, humanitarian way”. He said the UN could deliver aid in a way that doesn’t harm civilians and deliver aid at a greater scale.</p></li>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israel says Gaza got 120 trucks of aid on first day of 'military pause'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Israel said on Monday that more than 120 truckloads of food aid were distributed by the UN and aid agencies in Gaza yesterday.</p> 
  <p>“Over 120 trucks were collected and distributed yesterday by the UN and international organisations,” said <strong>Cogat</strong>, the Israeli authority responsible for coordinating humanitarian aid in the Gaza Strip.</p> 
  <p>“An additional 180 trucks entered Gaza and are now awaiting collection and distribution, along with hundreds of others still queued for UN pickup,” <a href="https://x.com/cogatonline/status/1949706312327028896">Cogat added in a post on X</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>The World Health Organization</strong> (WHO) has warned malnutrition in Gaza has reached “alarming levels” across the territory,<strong> </strong>with rates on a “dangerous trajectory” after aid air drops resumed over the weekend. </p> 
  <p>Of 74 malnutrition-related deaths in 2025, 63 occurred in July – including 24 children under five, the WHO said, adding that nearly one in five children under five in Gaza City is now “acutely malnourished”.</p> 
  <p>“The crisis remains entirely preventable. Deliberate blocking and delay of large-scale food, health, and humanitarian aid has cost many lives,” <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165504">the WHO said in a press release</a>.</p> 
  <p>Echoing the WHO’s concerns, the World Food Programme (WFP) said 90,000 women and children were in urgent need of treatment for malnutrition and that one in three people were going without food for days.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israel’s new 10-hour military pause in parts of Gaza begins but UN warns measures are not enough to 'stave off famine'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We are continuing our live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza. Stick with us throughout the day as we provide the latest updates.</p> 
  <p>Responding to a global outcry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/23/we-faced-hunger-before-but-never-like-this-skeletal-children-fill-hospital-wards-as-starvation-grips-gaza">provoked by reports and images of widespread starvation and malnutrition in Gaza</a>, the Israeli military said yesterday that it had began a “tactical pause” in the densely populated areas of <strong>Gaza City</strong>, <strong>Deir al-Balah</strong> and <strong>Muwasi</strong> to “increase the scale of humanitarian aid” into the strip.</p> 
  <p>It said the pause would be repeated every day from 10am to 8pm local time until further notice. Today is due to bring the second of these pauses.</p> 
  <p>Soon after the first humanitarian pause began yesterday, Israel carried out an airstrike on a building in Gaza City, killing a woman and her four children.</p> 
  <p>Israel allowed a limited amount of airdrops into Gaza to resume over the weekend but charities have warned the amount is totally inadequate for the population’s needs. Israel, Jordan and the UAE all parachuted aid into the territory that has been devasted by relentless Israeli bombardments.</p> 
  <p>Israel has said humanitarian corridors would be established to facilitate the entry of UN aid trucks into Gaza, though the number of trucks that will be allowed in was not specified.</p> 
  <p>UN aid chief <strong>Tom Fletcher</strong> welcomed Israel’s pledge to start daily humanitarian pauses, but said much more has to be done to alleviate the health crisis engulfing the territory.</p> 
  <p><a href="https://www.unocha.org/news/statement-gaza-tom-fletcher-under-secretary-general-humanitarian-affairs-and-emergency-0">In a statement published yesterday</a>, he said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>We welcome Israel’s decision to support a one-week scale-up of aid, including lifting customs barriers on food, medicine and fuel from Egypt and the reported designation of secure routes for UN humanitarian convoys.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Some movement restrictions appear to have been eased today, with initial reports indicating that over 100 truckloads were collected.</em></p> 
   <p><em>This is progress, but vast amounts of aid are needed to stave off famine and a catastrophic health crisis.</em></p>
