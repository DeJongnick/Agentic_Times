His sitters, some of whom like Michael Caine were already famous, were photographed with head and shoulders tightly cropped against a harshly lit white background. “They’re the hardest shots to do,” he said at the time. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/aug/28/michael-caine-bowie-and-more-david-baileys-iconic-pin-ups-in-pictures">See more images here</a>.</p> <h2>What we learned</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/26/old-master-painting-giuseppe-ghislandi-looted-by-nazis-argentina-property-listing#">An old master painting looted by Nazis was spotted on an estate agent’s website</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/aug/28/australian-painter-william-robinson-dies-aged-89-archibald-prize-winning">Two-time Archibald prize-winning painter William Robinson died aged 89</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/ng-interactive/2025/aug/27/best-art-architecture-autumn-2025-picasso-kerry-james-marshall-lee-miller">There are poses and prizes in the best art this autumn</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/aug/23/one-way-ticket-to-vietnam-catherine-leroys-fearless-war-photography-in-pictures">Catherine Leroy was fearless in the face of war</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/aug/26/overwhelming-and-sublime-the-primal-power-of-apichatpong-weerasethakuls-cinematic-art">Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s cinematic art has a primal power</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/aug/27/uk-garages-philip-butler-in-pictures">The UK has some glorious garages</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/aug/24/theres-something-very-interesting-about-boring-martin-parr-on-his-life-in-pictures">Photographer Martin Parr captures the magic of the mundane</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2025/aug/27/black-spaces-great-depression-in-pictures">African American life during the Great Depression was laid bare</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2> <p><strong>The Charity of St Nicholas of Bari by Girolamo Macchietti, c.1555-60</strong></p>    <p>This quirky painting is typical of the narrative technique of Macchietti’s master Giorgio Vasari, for whom he worked much of his career at the Palazzo Vecchio in Florence. Vasari was not just an architect and painter but also author of The Lives of the Artists, a massive compendium of tales, true and fanciful, about artists themselves. At the Palazzo Vecchio he directed an art of anecdotal storytelling including in the Studiolo of Francesco I where Macchietti was one of the painters. Both the charm and silliness of the Vasari style are seen here. Saint Nicholas of Bari chucks gold balls into the house of an impoverished gentleman at night, while the whole family are asleep: now his daughters will get dowries and be spared having to become sex workers, according to the story. Macchietti captures the sleepiness of the whole household, but also suggests the anxiety that stops these people sleeping comfortably. They sit in their clothes as if they’ve been talking and worrying until they finally fell asleep in the small hours – and that’s when Saint Nicholas delivers his gifts. I’m not going to mention how this saint became Santa Claus – it’s still August.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/girolamo-macchietti-the-charity-of-st-nicholas-of-bari">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in </strong><strong>touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
