<p>Shares in Ocado jumped by as much as 18% after the UK online grocer reported narrowing losses and raised its annual guidance for its technology arm, which sells warehouse robots to other retailers around the world.</p> <p>Technology revenues climbed by nearly 22% year on year in the six months to 2 June, while retail revenues were also up by 11%. Ocado sells groceries in the UK through its joint venture with Marks &amp; Spencer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/16/inflation-football-uk-retail-spending-sales-supermarkets">and was the fastest-growing grocer for the fifth month</a> in a row based on recent sales figures, according to the data analytics company Kantar.</p> <p>Ocado now expects its tech division to achieve a “mid-teens” Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin this year, up from previous guidance of more than 10%. The company’s overall pre-tax loss in the first half of the year narrowed to £154m, from £290m a year earlier.</p> <p>This reassured investors, and drove Ocado shares sharply higher. The stock closed up 8% at 368.1p but hit 409.1p earlier in the day.</p> <p>The share price has lost 47% this year amid concerns that some clients, such as the Canadian supermarket Sobeys and Kroger in the US, are pausing the rollout of robotic warehouses.</p> <p>Tim Steiner, Ocado’s chief executive, explained that clients had based their plans on trends seen during the Covid pandemic when online shopping surged – but then fell back as shops reopened. He said the global shift to online shopping had resumed and brushed off investor concerns, saying: “We expect to see a lot of long-term growth.”</p> <p>With <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/16/inflation-football-uk-retail-spending-sales-supermarkets">grocery inflation slowing sharply from last year’s double-digit increases</a>, consumer sentiment has been rising. Steiner said: “It’s definitely improved. Consumers are in a better position than they were this time about a year ago, when it felt like everything was constantly moving up at crazy levels, other than people’s incomes.”</p> <p>He noted that grocery inflation is now running at 1.6%, according to Kantar, below average wage rises. But he added: “Obviously consumers are still feeling the pinch.”</p> <p>Commenting on whether Ocado would keep its stock market listing in the UK, he said: “The London market can be tough for some companies. Obviously, we’ve got a very strong retail presence here in the UK with Ocado Retail, it’s a natural place for that business to be listed.</p> <p>“In the long-term future as a global tech company, could you consider other markets? You could but we’re actually really focused at the moment on serving our clients well … And those efforts are really where we’re focusing our time and not on where we’re listed.”</p> <p>Steiner reckons that there is still demand for Ocado’s fast-delivery service Zoom, despite the demise of rivals such as Getir and Gorillas. He said: “I do think that there is demand for ultra-fast services.”<br><br></p>
