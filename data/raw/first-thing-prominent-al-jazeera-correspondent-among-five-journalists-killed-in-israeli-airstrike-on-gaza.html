<p>Good morning.</p> <p>A prominent Al Jazeera journalist who had previously been threatened by Israel has been killed along with four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike.</p> <p>Anas al-Sharif, who was one of Al Jazeera’s most recognisable faces in Gaza, was killed while inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City last night.</p> <p>Seven people in total were killed in the attack, including Al Jazeera’s correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What did Israel say about the attack?</strong> The Israel Defense Forces admitted the strike and claimed the reporter had “served as the head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organisation”. It claimed it had intelligence and documents found in Gaza as proof, but rights advocates said he had been targeted for his frontline reporting on the Gaza war and that Israel’s claim lacked evidence.</p></li> <li><p><strong>What else is going on in the region?</strong> Benjamin Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/10/netanyahu-defends-gaza-city-plan-as-un-warns-of-calamity-and-starvation">defended his plan to take control of Gaza City</a> in the face of widespread international outrage.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>JD Vance’s attempt to link Democrats to Epstein revives calls to ‘release the files’</strong></h2>    <p>Four days after JD Vance <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/10/jd-vance-democrats-jeffrey-epstein-files">reportedly asked</a> senior Trump administration officials to come up with a new communications strategy for dealing with the scandal around the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he appears to have put his foot in it, sparking a new round of online outrage even as he tried to defuse the furor.</p> <p>In an interview with Fox News broadcast yesterday, the vice-president tried to deflect criticism of the administration’s refusal to release the Epstein files by blaming Democrats.</p> <p>“And now President Trump has demanded full transparency from this. And yet somehow the Democrats are attacking him and not the Biden administration, which did nothing for four years,” he said.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What was the reaction to the interview?</strong> Within minutes of the Fox News interview being broadcast, social media began to hum with renewed cries of “release the files!” Jon Favreau, Barack Obama’s former head speechwriter, said: “Release the names! Democrats, Republicans, billionaires, or not. What are you afraid of, JD Vance?”</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Colorado prison evacuated as wildfire becomes one of largest in state history</strong></h2>    <p>A Colorado prison was evacuated as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/10/colorado-prison-evacuated-largest-wildfire">one of the largest wildfires in state history</a> continued to grow, and officials advised residents of remote areas to be ready to leave yesterday as gusty winds and low humidity fed the flames.</p> <p>Evacuation orders were in place for mountain communities as the Lee fire charred more than 167 sq miles (433 sq km) across Garfield and Rio Blanco counties.
