<p>Susan Monarez, the ousted director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has stood by her statement that she was fired after resisting changes to vaccine policy advanced by US health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-f-kennedy-jr">Robert F Kennedy Jr</a>, that she believed contradicted scientific evidence.</p> <p>In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, Monarez said she had been directed to pre-approve vaccine recommendations and fire career CDC officials, describing her ouster as part of a broader push to weaken US vaccine standards.</p> <p>However at a fiery Senate hearing on Thursday, Kennedy said she lied and that he had never told Monarez she needed to pre-approve decisions, but that he did order her to fire officials, which she refused to do.</p> <p>“Secretary Kennedy’s claims are false, and at times, patently ridiculous. Monarez stands by what she said in her Wall Street Journal op-ed,” her lawyers said in a statement, adding that she was willing to repeat it under oath.</p> <p>Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have already called for Monarez to be called to testify before the senate, which would be under oath.</p>  <h2>RFK Jr grilled in tense Senate hearing</h2>  <p>The US health secretary faced the Senate finance committee in a tense and combative hearing during which lawmakers questioned his remarks expressing vaccine skepticism, claims that the scientific community is deeply politicized, and the ongoing turmoil plaguing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/04/rfk-jr-hearing-calls-resign-democrats"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US justice department reportedly opens criminal inquiry into Fed governor Lisa Cook</h2>  <p>The US justice department has initiated a criminal investigation into mortgage fraud claims against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve">Federal Reserve</a> governor Lisa Cook, according to new reports, as a lawsuit she filed against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> over her firing makes its way through court.</p> <p>Last month, Trump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/25/trump-fires-federal-reserve-governor-lisa-cook">moved to fire</a> Cook over unconfirmed claims that she listed two properties as her primary residence. Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing and Finance Agency and a close ally of Trump, alleged Cook had lied on bank documents and records to obtain a better mortgage rate. In court documents, lawyers for Cook suggested that a “clerical error” may be behind the discrepancies found in her mortgage records.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/04/lisa-cook-federal-reserve-mortgage-investigation"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Washington DC sues over Trump</h2>  <p>Washington DC sued to stop <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> deployment of the National Guard during law enforcement intervention in Washington.
