<p>Your report highlights the life-changing impact of sport for girls (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/sep/11/girls-who-play-after-school-sport-in-uk-50-more-likely-to-later-get-top-jobs-study-finds">Girls who play after-school sport in UK 50% more likely to later get top jobs, study finds 11 September</a>). But not all girls have equal opportunities, and representation plays a key role: two-thirds of young people say seeing diverse athletes helps them believe sport is for everyone.

Entire communities are missing from view.</p> <p>If girls don’t see themselves reflected, they are more likely to miss out.
