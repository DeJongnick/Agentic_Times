In relation to the case in question, <strong>the commission has not been in contact with the media concerned.</strong> Questions on this specific decision should be addressed to that media.”<br><br>The <strong>Italian journalists’ guild expressed its “dismay” over the case</strong>, saying “you cannot be fired for asking a question”.</p> <p><strong>Sandro Ruotolo</strong>, an MEP for the centre-left Democratic party, said: “Firing a journalist for asking a question, no matter how uncomfortable or controversial, is a very serious matter that should alarm anyone who cares about press freedom.”</p> <p><strong>Nicola Fratoianni,</strong> who leads the Green-Left Alliance, said Nunziati’s dismissal was a “disconcerting and serious matter for which we will hold parliament accountable”. Fratoianni urged Nova to reconsider its decision.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-06T12:24:06.236Z">at 12.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div
