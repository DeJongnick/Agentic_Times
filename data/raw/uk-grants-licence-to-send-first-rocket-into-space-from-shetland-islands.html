<p>The UK has granted permission to send the first rocket into space from the Shetland Islands to a German startup that plans to launch a craft as early as this year.</p> 
<p>Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said on Thursday it had awarded the vertical launch licence to Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA) to take off <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/dec/17/shetland-islands-remote-location-is-giving-uk-space-industry-a-boost">from SaxaVord spaceport in the archipelago</a> 50 miles (80km) north of Scotland’s mainland.</p>

<p>If successful, RFA would join the private-sector space race as the first company in Europe to carry out a vertical launch into orbit. The licence allows the launch of its 30-metre tall RFA One rocket northwards from the island of Unst, away from populated areas.</p> 
<p>Space launch was long the preserve of governments, but in the last two decades it has been revolutionised by private companies – most notably Elon Musk’s SpaceX.</p> 
<p>Musk, now the world’s richest man because of his holdings in SpaceX and the electric car company Tesla, built the company into the dominant player in the space industry by making <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/20/space-explorers-trillion-dollar-lift-off-private-frontier">reusable rockets that pushed costs down</a> dramatically. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/15/spacex-launch-moon">SpaceX launched two privately built lunar landers</a> on Wednesday.</p> 
<p>However, SpaceX’s dominance will soon be tested by others. Blue Origin, the space company owned by the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, on Thursday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/16/bezos-blue-origin-new-glenn-rocket-blasts-off-musk-spacex">launched its New Glenn rocket into orbit</a> at its first attempt. SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket can launch nearly 23 tonnes into low-Earth orbit, while New Glenn will aim to carry 45 tonnes.</p>

<p>In contrast, the RFA One will carry 1.3 tonnes. It hopes to find a niche for its “microlauncher” as demand for space services booms. However, it will have to overcome the technical problems that led to an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/20/spacecraft-explodes-during-launch-test-at-uks-new-spaceport-in-shetland">explosion at the Shetland spaceport during tests</a> in August.</p> 
<p>More rivals for commercial launch abilities would be welcomed by several governments, amid concerns over the reliance on SpaceX, given Musk’s increasingly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/04/elon-musk-x-trump-far-right">outspoken support for the far right</a>.</p> 
<p>European countries already have space launch abilities, but the site used is in French Guiana, a region of France north of Brazil on South America’s coast. The SaxaVord site would add launch abilities from Europe proper.</p> 
<p>A successful launch would also represent a victory for the UK, after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/24/virgin-orbit-ceases-operations-months-after-failure-of-uk-space-mission">collapse of Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit</a> following the failure of a rocket launch from a rival spaceport in Cornwall. The rocket was lost, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/09/uks-first-orbital-rocket-mission-takes-off-from-cornwall">which meant it failed to become the first to be launched into space</a> from British soil.</p> 
<p>RFA has already carried out trials at the SaxaVord spaceport in preparation for its launch plans, but in August last year a nine-engine test went wrong <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/20/spacecraft-explodes-during-launch-test-at-uks-new-spaceport-in-shetland">and the rocket exploded</a>.</p> 
<p>Rob Bishton, the CAA’s chief executive, said: “This is a new era for aerospace and granting the first vertical launch licence from UK soil builds towards a historic milestone for the nation.</p> 
<p>“This licence is the culmination of extensive hard work behind the scenes to put appropriate safety and environmental measures in place before launch.”</p> 
<p>Jörn Spurmann, RFA’s co-founder, said he hopes the launches will be “a turning point for European space innovation”.</p> 
<p>“This licence marks Europe’s bold step toward independent, competitive and sustainable space access,” Spurmann said. “By enabling cost-effective and flexible launches from European mainland, we are laying the foundation for a new era of space exploration and commercialisation, ensuring Europe remains at the forefront of the global space race.”</p> 
<p>Mike Kane, the UK’s aviation minister, said the licence “moves the dial one step closer towards the first commercial vertical space launch in the United Kingdom”.</p>
