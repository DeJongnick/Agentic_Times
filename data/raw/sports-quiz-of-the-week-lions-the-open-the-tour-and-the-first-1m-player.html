    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:B - This year's final was the first since 2002 not to feature one of the big four., 2:B - To put that in some context, the men’s final lasted three hours and four minutes., 3:C - Swiatek served a one-month suspension at the end of last year and Sinner was banned for three months earlier this year., 4:D - The 20-year-old Canadian has signed a four-year contract with the European champions., 5:D - These are the teams that won matches against PSG this season – in the Champions League, Ligue 1 and Club World Cup. PSG were beaten by four English clubs and just two French clubs this season., 6:A - The last men’s World Cup in 2022, which had the same format, produced five shootouts., 7:B - Not only did Roche win the Tour in 1987 but he also won the Giro d’Italia., 8:C - Usyk won their first fight in 2023 but with enough controversy to make the rematch very interesting. Dubois caused Usyk some problems two years ago and he has been on a great run since they met in Poland, beating Jarrell Miller, Filip Hrgovic and Antony Joshua., 9:B - Seven of his last eight fights have been against Brits: Tyson Fury twice, Daniel Dubois, Anthony Joshua (twice), Derek Chisora and Tony Bellew. , 10:C - There are eight starters from Ireland, four from England, three from Scotland and none from Wales. , 11:C - Greenwood made his Lions debut in the summer 1997, a few months before he won the first of his 55 England caps., 12:C - The two teams have only met once, in 1977, when Fiji won 25–21. , 13:B - Lucy Bronze plays for Chelsea, Kosovare Asllani plays for London City, and Stina Blackstenius and Michelle Agyemang play for Arsenal., 14:A - The champion was allowed to keep the belt until the following Open. The claret jug – which is still handed out to the winner – was introduced in 1873., 15:B - He won the PGA Championship, was fourth at the Masters and finished joint-seventh at the US Open. </p>
