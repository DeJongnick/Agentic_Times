<h2>Jimi Hendrix: Electric Church</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Four</strong><strong><br></strong>Part documentary, part concert movie, this feature-length film captures Jimi Hendrix’s last major US gig at the 1970 Atlanta pop festival, just two months before his death – making the inclusion of some of his funkier new songs such as Straight Ahead especially poignant. “We don’t play loud to hit people’s eardrums,” he tells an interviewer. “We play to get inside their souls.” <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Gogglebox</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>Andrew Lincoln’s psychological drama Coldwater and Jude Law’s Netflix thriller Black Rabbit should be the most talked-about shows this week. But this being Gogglebox, which also takes in world events, our armchair critics could drill down on anything. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>The Paper</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>A supreme episode for Sabrina Impacciatore’s Esmeralda – who owns this mockumentary about a failing newspaper. She is in charge of Pride month, but gets distracted by the news of a serial dating app catfisher. There’s also a fantastic cameo from Lost star Josh Holloway. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Fawlty Towers: The Play</h2> <p><strong>9pm, U&amp;Gold</strong></p>    <p>This West End adaptation of the sitcom was written by the series co-creator John Cleese and stays faithful to its source material. It’s nicely staged on a multitiered set, stars Adam Jackson-Smith and Anna-Jane Casey as Basil and Sybil Fawlty and functions as a pitch perfect piece of period-detailed comedy karaoke. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Mitchell and Webb Are Not Helping</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>The Peep Show alumni continue their enjoyable return to sketch comedy. There’s sex and punch-ups in a sweary Aussie drama skit, a reality show called Middle-Aged Man Island and a comically offbeat bit with an MI5 officer who blows his entire career because the spy he’s tailing is really irritating. “My mother can parallel park better than you and she’s 84!” <em>Alexi Duggins</em></p> <h2>Peacemaker</h2> <p><strong>10.10pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>Never mind that to UK ears it always sounds as if it’s called “Argos”: the shady Argus agency has mobilised en masse to bring in top-heavy superhero Chris Smith AKA Peacemaker (John Cena). Surely tetchy Argus boss Rick Flag Sr (Frank Grillo) doesn’t have some secret agenda because Chris murdered his son? <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Swiped</strong><strong> (Rachel Lee Goldenberg, 2025), </strong><strong>Disney+</strong></p>    <p>As she’s still bound by an NDA, Whitney Wolfe Herd did not contribute to her own biopic. But even this fictionalised account of the career of the co-founder of dating app Tinder and creator of Bumble paints a damning picture of the toxic, misogynistic culture that permeates Silicon Valley. In Rachel Lee Goldenberg’s sadly still timely film, Lily James stars as Whitney, a peppy college graduate lucking her way into a startup incubator run by Sean Rad (Ben Schnetzer). It portrays the subsequent diminishing of her key role in the success of Tinder, which runs parallel with the collapse of her relationship with colleague Justin (Jackson White), amid gaslighting, trolling and sexual harassment. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p>
