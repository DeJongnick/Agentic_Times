<p>Marks &amp; Spencer has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/24/how-the-sandwich-consumed-britain#:~:text=The%20first%20official%20M&amp;S%20sandwich,and%20people%20wanted%20those%2C%20too.">always been</a> at the forefront of sandwich innovation, having launched the first pre-packed sandwich in the spring of 1980 and raising eyebrows this summer by selling one with strawberry and cream filling.</p> <p>But now a Scottish chip shop has gone a step further, offering to batter and deep-fry the viral snack. In a video <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hookandcatch/video/7526971664840559895?is_from_webapp=1&amp;web_id=7542089883671643670">posted</a> on TikTok, staff at Hook and Catch near Glasgow can be seen dipping M&amp;S’s controversial “Strawberry and Creme” sandwich into batter, before deep-frying it, slicing it in half and serving with strawberry sauce.</p> <p>A staff member from the chip shop based in Bearsden in East Dunbartonshire said: “We love putting a playful Scottish chippy twist on things people already recognise. When the M&amp;S strawberries buzz kicked off, we thought, why not try them hot, crispy, and a bit cheeky? The strawberry sandwich was our way of leaning into summer with something fun, surprising and very Hook and Catch.”</p> <p>The clip has attracted thousands of views, with commenters describing the treat as a “crazy creation”. Staff say they have already had multiple people come in to try the sandwich, and say they love seeing the reactions.</p> <p>“The reaction’s been brilliant – lots of curious first-timers, plenty of ‘no way … OK, maybe’ moments, and a fair few instant converts,” said a representative. “It’s been a proper conversation starter in the shop and online, and we’ve had people coming in just to try it and film their first bite.</p> <p>“We’ve always had fun with desserts – our famous Glaswegian doughnut has been a customer favourite for ages. It’s our tongue-in-cheek take on the American-style deep-fried doughnut, but done the Glasgow way.”</p> <p>Its Glaswegian doughnut consists of a crispy battered roll stuffed with Nutella and strawberry jam and coated in sugar. The representative added: “Between that and the strawberry sandwich, we love seeing people’s reactions when they try something they never expected from a chippy.”</p> <p>In June, M&amp;S <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/jun/28/mochi-ice-cream-strawberry-sandos-japanese-sweet-treats-uk">launched</a> its take on the strawberry sando, a Japanese convenience store favourite, a sandwich made with soft milk bread, whipped cream and neatly layered fruit. The sandwich split opinion, but 100,000 were sold in the first month after its launch, according to to the director of product development at M&amp;S Food, Kathryn Turner.</p>
