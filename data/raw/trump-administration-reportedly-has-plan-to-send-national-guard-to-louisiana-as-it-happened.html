Kirk supporters, including activists and US government officials, have engaged in online campaigns to track down people allegedly making light of Kirk’s death.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A congressional staffer in Mexico <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-mexican-congressional-staffer-resigns">resigned following a social media campaign</a> targeting him.</strong> The staffer had made comments that criticized Kirk this week during a Mexican television news program. The news network, Milenio, also published a public apology after the deputy secretary of state, <strong>Christopher Landau</strong>, threatened to revoke the visas of foreign nationals criticizing or making light of Kirk’s death.</p></li> <li><p><strong>On Friday in cities across the US, people gathered to pay tribute to Kirk.</strong></p></li> <li><p><strong>And Erika Kirk, the widow of the right</strong><strong>wing provocateur, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/12/erika-kirk-charlie-kirk">said on Friday evening</a> that her late husband’s message and mission will be “stronger, bolder, louder and greater than ever”</strong> and that her “cries will echo around the world like a battle cry”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Meanwhile, the Washington Post revealed today that the Trump administration has drafted a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/louisiana-national-guard-pentagon">plan to send in </a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/louisiana-national-guard-pentagon">national </a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/louisiana-national-guard-pentagon">guard troops</a> to major cities in Louisiana.</strong> This follows a trend by the administration of increasingly using the military for law enforcement and civilian matters.

The Department of Homeland Security said Villegas-Gonzalez drove his car at the officers, injuring one of them.

What did they mean?</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p>Investigators who found a bolt-action rifle near the site where Charlie Kirk was shot on a Utah campus said that they also found casings scrawled with messages.</p> <p><strong>Tyler Robinson</strong>, a 22-year-old college student was reported to have confessed to his family that he had shot and killed Kirk earlier this week. Robinson was arrested after his father recognised him in photos and video footage police released of the shooter escaping the scene.</p> <p>One of the casings read, <strong>“hey fascist! CATCH! (up arrow symbol, right arrow symbol, and three down arrow symbols),”</strong>, according to an affadavit filed on Friday in a Utah court.</p> <p>The arrows were most likely a reference to the popular video game Helldivers 2 and its sequence of controller moves to unleash a powerful bomb, according to an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html">analysis </a>published by the New York Times.</p> <p>Much of the other casings had similar messages steeped in video game references and allusions to different internet subcultures.</p> <p>One of the messages, <strong>“Notices bulges OwO what’s this?,”</strong> is often used to mock participants in online role-play communities, namely furries. Another message said, <strong>“If you read This, you are GAY Lmao,”</strong> its tone suggestive of the kind of humour found on internet messaging boards.</p> <p>Another casing read, <strong>“O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!,”</strong> likely a reference to the popular Italian folk song “Bella Ciao.” Popularised as an antifascist anthem in Italy after the second world war, it resurfaced globally in recent years because of its inclusion in the hit Netflix series “Money Heist” and in video games, including the first-person shooter game Far Cry 6.</p> <p>The casing messages, like Robinson’s political ideology, are difficult to parse. The NYT has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/13/us/politics/tyler-robinson-messages-bullets-charlie-kirk.html">reported</a> that Robinson registered to vote in Utah, but is not affiliated with a political party and had never voted in an election, according to the Washington County Clerk.</p> <p>His parents, Matthew Carl Robinson and Amber Denise Robinson are registered Republicans, according to state records.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c5627b8f084b3c85a4e1ad" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/chris-stein"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-13T12:25:26.026Z">1.25pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>The US government is drawing nearer to a potential shutdown after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans">Republicans</a> on Friday “don’t even bother dealing with” the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats">Democrats</a>, whose congressional leaders are refusing to support spending bills that do not include their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/healthcare">healthcare</a> priorities.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-congress">Congress</a> is up against an end-of-the-month deadline to approve legislation funding the federal government, otherwise many departments will stop work and employees will be told to stay home. While the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-senate">Senate</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/house-of-representatives">House of Representatives</a> have made some progress on passing the 12 appropriations bills that make up the budget, it seems certain that Congress will need to pass a short-term measure to keep the government open beyond 30 September.</p> <p>On Thursday, the top House and Senate Democrats said they would not support any legislation that does not meet their demands on healthcare.</p> <p>Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>We will not support a partisan spending agreement that continues to rip away healthcare from the American people, period, full stop.</p> </blockquote> <p>In an interview with Fox News on Friday morning, Trump insisted that Republicans should go it alone on spending – a tall ask because Democrats can use the Senate’s filibuster to block legislation in the upper chamber.</p> <p>“They want to give away money to this and then that, destroy the country. If you gave them every dream, they would not vote for it,” Trump said of the Democrats. He said he had told Republicans: “Don’t even bother dealing with them.”</p> <p>The squabble is developing as Democrats face pressure from their base to use whatever leverage they have in Congress to stand up to Trump, with an eye towards retaking control of at least one chamber in next year’s midterm elections. While Jeffries and other top Democrats have been vague about what exactly they are demanding in exchange for keeping the government open, they appear to want to undo changes to Medicaid and other federal health insurance programs imposed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/01/what-is-in-big-beautiful-bill-trump">the One Big Beautiful Bill Act</a> Republicans passed in July.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c55d0f8f0880bae9c52e13" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/davidsmith"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-13T12:16:46.019Z">1.16pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>What a swell party it was.

For the Trumps, it was like a death in the family. Don Jr wrote on the X social media platform: “I love you brother.”</p> <p>The shock, grief and anger of Trump and his allies reflected not only their personal closeness to Kirk but his political utility to the “Make America great again” (Maga) movement and prominent role in vetting who would staff Trump’s government. It also raised fears that, in a moment of peril for the nation when cool heads are needed, the president’s response to the killing was just as likely to be shaped by highly charged emotions and calls for vengeance.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/13/charlie-kirk-maga-influence">Charlie Kirk and the rise of Maga in US politics: ‘He changed the ground game’</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-68c53fa38f0880bae9c52d44" class="block is-key-event" data-block-contributor="profile/chris-stein"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-09-13T12:00:14.501Z">1.00pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class="block-title">Charlie Kirk in his own words: &quot;prowling Blacks&quot;, &quot;some gun deaths&quot; worth it for second amendment right</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/charlie-kirk-shooting">Charlie Kirk</a>, the far-right commentator and ally of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a>, was killed on Wednesday doing what he was known for throughout his career – making incendiary and often racist and sexist comments to large audiences.</strong></p> <p>Here’s Kirk, in his own words.

It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am ready to “go” when you are. Just say when? </p> <p>I believe that this, plus Nato, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this deadly, but RIDICULOUS, WAR. China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip. </p> <p>This is not TRUMP’S WAR (it would never have started if I was President!), it is Biden’s and Zelenskyy’s WAR.
