<h2>The Great Plague With Rob Rinder &amp; Ruth Goodman</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 5</strong><br>The barrister and broadcaster Rob Rinder is a captivating history teacher and he is having a ball in this new series, as he learns how wealthy Londoners navigated the plague (even getting into costume for the occasion). Meanwhile, the equally charismatic historian Ruth Goodman finds real cases of poor citizens to explore how differently they experienced it. The two start the story by getting a sense of London life just before the first plague deaths. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Supercruising: Life at Sea</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><br>The easygoing cruise‑time series cranks things up a notch, with one ship celebrating <em>Koningsdag</em> – a Dutch holiday for King’s Day – by throwing an “orange party” for 3,000 passengers. Plus, there is drama in Rotterdam when a passenger goes missing.<em> </em><em>HR</em></p> <h2>The Walking Dead: Dead City</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Max</strong><br>Season two of the enjoyably shlocky zombie spin-off set in the ruins of New York picks up the action a year later. Longstanding frenemies Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) are caught up in a brewing conflict to claim ultimate control of Manhattan. But are they destined to be on opposite sides? <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Outrageous</h2> <p><strong>9pm, U&amp;Drama</strong><br>This underrated drama about the Mitfords continues – and the family are horrified to learn that Unity is now “Hitler’s British girl” – everyone except Diana, that is, who uses this as an advantage to get closer to Oswald Mosley. It leaves the others asking: can you still love your sister if she believes in such evil? <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Such Brave Girls</h2> <p><strong>10pm, BBC Three</strong></p>    <p>Prepare yourself for more excruciating capers in Kat Sadler’s audacious comedy about a dysfunctional family of women. After marrying Seb, Josie has started an affair, while sister Billie is having trouble trying to seduce a man. Meanwhile, their mum, Deb, is depressed after her engagement is called off. Don’t expect any of them to catch a break. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Poker Face</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Sky Max</strong><br>In a season finale directed with some flair by the show’s star, Natasha Lyonne, Charlie and her jittery new pal, Alex (Patti Harrison), are on the run from the Iguana, a fabled assassin. Can they keep a witness from the archvillain’s clutches? It’s all about to go a bit Thelma &amp; Louise.<em> </em><em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Brick (Philip Koch, 2025), Netflix</strong></p>    <p>Philip Koch, last seen directing Netflix’s sadly truncated Tribes of Europa sci-fi series (cancelled after one season), returns with a horror thriller with a chilling premise. Matthias Schweighöfer and Ruby O Fee play a couple who wake up to find their apartment building has been encased in a huge wall made of an unidentified material. Is it a trap or was it put there to protect them? Will their neighbours help them escape or are they in on the secret as well? If Stephen King was an influence (and it certainly seems that way), he should be proud. <em>Stuart Heritage</em></p>
