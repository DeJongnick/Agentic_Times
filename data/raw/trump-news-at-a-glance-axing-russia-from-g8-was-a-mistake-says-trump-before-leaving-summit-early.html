<p>Donald Trump has told G7 leaders gathered for its summit in Canada that removing Russia from the former G8 was a mistake, and is lobbying for the country to be readmitted. Russia was thrown out of the group after it invaded Crimea in 2014.</p> <p>Trump’s defence of Russian leader Vladimir Putin came a day before he was scheduled to meet his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the fringes of the summit.</p> <p>However, that meeting appears unlikely to go ahead after the White House said in a statement that the US president was leaving the summit early due to ongoing developments in the Middle East.</p> <p>Here are the key stories at a glance:</p>  <h2>Trump repeats call for Russia to be readmitted to G7</h2>  <p>Donald Trump has displayed his disdain for the collective western values supposedly championed by the G7 group of industrialised countries by again demanding that Russia be readmitted to the group. He also said the war in Ukraine would not have happened if Moscow had been kept in the club. Trump also announced he is leaving the G7 to return to Washington citing the conflict between Israel and Iran. </p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/16/donald-trump-repeats-call-for-russia-to-be-readmitted-at-g7-summit-in-canada"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Ice agents detain US citizen as LA immigration raids continue: ‘It’s racial profiling’</h2>  <p>US immigration raids continued to target southern California communities in recent days, including at a popular flea market and in a Los Angeles suburb where US citizens were detained.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/los-angeles-immigration-raids-montebello"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump promises expanded immigration crackdown after protests</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has promised an expanded immigration crackdown in several large Democratic-led cities as apparent vengeance for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/no-kings-protests-trump-military-parade">“No Kings” protests</a> against his administration on Saturday that drew millions of people – despite questions over whether the agency in charge of the effort is set to run out of money.</p> <p>Separately, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/journalist-ice-protest-arrest-mario-guevara">prominent Spanish-language journalist</a> in metro <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/atlanta">Atlanta</a> who frequently covers Immigration and customs enforcement raids, will be turned over to Ice detention after being arrested by local police while covering the “No Kings” protests.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/trump-immigration-protests-ice-budget"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump administration notches first big win in assault on higher education</h2>  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> scored its most significant legal victory in its sweeping effort to reshape American higher education when a federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit brought by faculty groups over the government’s cuts to Columbia University’s federal funding.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/trump-administration-columbia-lawsuit-dismissed"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Democratic senator proposes curbing Trump’s war powers amid Israel-Iran conflict</h2>  <p>As Iran and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> exchange missile attacks for a fourth day, Democrats in Washington are moving swiftly to reassert congressional authority over US military engagement in the region amid fears of American involvement in a broader conflict.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/trump-war-powers-iran-israel-conflict"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Suspect in lawmaker killing visited other legislators’ homes</h2>  <p>A man accused of dressing up as a police officer and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/14/democratic-lawmakers-minnesota-shot">shooting two Minnesota state lawmakers</a> in their homes – killing one and her husband – also showed up at the houses of two other legislators the same night intending to assassinate them too, authorities revealed on Monday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/minnesota-lawmaker-killings-suspect-legislator-homes"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump Organization unveils $499 gold phone</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> has launched a mobile phone service and $499 gold smartphone, the latest monetization of his presidency by a family business empire now run by his sons.
