<p>Veterans of the second world war were applauded as they arrived at the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, before being joined by royals and senior politicians to honour those who have died in conflict.</p> 
<p>King Charles laid the first wreath in recognition of those killed in wars and conflicts dating back to the first world war. He was followed by his son, the Prince of Wales.</p> 
<p>The king wore a field marshal uniform – the army’s highest rank – and saluted before withdrawing from the monument after a two-minute silence.</p> 
<p>The Prince of Wales, dressed in Royal Air Force uniform in the rank of wing commander, saluted after laying his wreath at the Cenotaph.</p> 
<p>The prime minister, Keir Starmer, also laid a floral tribute, along with senior politicians including Kemi Badenoch, Ed Davey, Yvette Cooper, Shabana Mahmood and Lindsay Hoyle, and representatives from the Commonwealth.</p> 
<p>Starmer said: “This Remembrance Sunday, we pause as a nation to honour all those who have served our country. We reflect on the extraordinary courage of our armed forces in the world wars and subsequent conflicts, whose service secured the freedoms we cherish today.”</p> 
<p>Reflecting on the 80th anniversary of the second world war, Starmer spoke of “a generation who stood against tyranny and shaped our future”.</p> 
<p>He added: “Such sacrifice deserves more than silence, which is why this government remains committed to supporting veterans, their families and those who serve. Today, we remember, and we renew our promise to uphold the values they fought for.”</p> 
<p>The Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla, both dressed in black, and other members of the royal family viewed the Remembrance Sunday service from a balcony at the Foreign Office overlooking the Cenotaph. The pair were joined by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent and the Duchess of Edinburgh.</p> 
<p>Standing close to the Cenotaph were eight former prime ministers: John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.</p> 
<p>The first minister of Scotland, John Swinney, marked the occasion in Edinburgh, laying a wreath at the Stone of Remembrance outside the City Chambers.</p> 
<p>As well as royals and political leaders, 10,000 members of the armed forces participated in the Royal British Legion’s annual march past, including about three D-day veterans among the 20 second world war veterans marking 80 years since the conflict ended in 1945.</p> 
<p>About a dozen people wearing military uniforms and poppies were pushed in wheelchairs along Whitehall while applause rang out near the Cenotaph and one veteran saluted.</p> 
<p>Among the marchers was 101-year-old Donald Poole, a Royal Army Ordnance Corps technician who served in India in 1945 when Japan’s surrender was announced, sparking an impromptu celebration.</p> 
<p>Poole, originally from Bromley, Greater London, said: “It is a great honour to be able to pay tribute to the poor souls who have died in all conflicts, and I know how lucky I am to still be here thanks to all those who have fought and served, past and present.</p> 
<p>“I also want to pay tribute to the civilian services who suffered during the second world war, particularly the fire service, who saved so many lives during the blitz – many of whom lost their own.”</p> 
<p>Henry Rice, a former signalman who arrived off Juno beach five days after D-day, and Mervyn Kersh, who arrived in Normandy aged 19, three days after the start of the D-day invasion, were also in attendance on Sunday.</p> 
<p>Sid Machin, one of six 101-year-olds registered to march, is one of the last surviving Chindit special forces soldiers the second world war’s Burma (now Myanmar) campaign.</p> 
<p>When he was only 19, Machin found himself behind enemy lines in a glider at night in the jungle as part of a unit that disrupted Japanese supply lines and infrastructure.</p> 
<p>As well as the Cenotaph wreath-laying ceremony, commemorations were held at war memorials in villages, towns and cities across the UK.</p>
