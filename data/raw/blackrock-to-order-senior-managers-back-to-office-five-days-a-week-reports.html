<p>BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management company, is reportedly preparing to order its senior managers to work from the office five days a week.</p> <p>The New-York based company is expected to tell its staff as early as Thursday that about 1,000 managing directors around the world should work in the office full-time, the Financial Times has reported.</p> <p>BlackRock last told staff in 2023 they had to go into the office at least four days a week. More junior staff will still be allowed to work from home one day a week under the new guidance, according to the report.</p> <p>BlackRock, which has more than 21,000 staff around the world, is one of many big American corporations calling time on an era of remote and hybrid working triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/jan/10/jp-morgan-chase-return-to-office">summoned all its workers back into the office</a>. Jamie Dimon, the head of the bank, has long been a proponent of restoring pre-pandemic working patterns.</p> <p>In an internal memo to staff, Dimon and other executives acknowledged that some workers preferred a hybrid schedule and that they “respectfully understand that not everyone will agree with this decision”. However they insisted that it was “the best way to run the company”.</p> <p>Barclays also hardened its stance on remote working earlier this year, ordering that all staff should work from the office at least three days a week, up from a previous requirement of two days.</p> <p>While technology companies led the shift in working patterns during the pandemic, businesses in the sector are also beginning to mandate a return to the office. This year Amazon increased its requirement <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/18/quit-if-you-dont-like-our-office-working-policy-amazon-executive-suggests">from three days to five days a week</a> in the office for its staff.</p> <p>On Thursday, a House of Lords committee set up to investigate how the rise of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/working-from-home">remote and hybrid working</a> has affected employers, employees and the wider British economy, was told that the traditional Friday post-work drink had all but disappeared from UK city centres as a result of changes in working patterns.</p> <p>“In London’s instance, the Friday night drink hasn’t gone away; it has just shifted to a Thursday,” Paul Swinney, the director of policy and research at the thinktank <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/">Centre for Cities</a>, told the committee.</p> <p>“When we looked at other large cities … it appeared from the data that we have, that the post-work drink has reduced.”</p> <p>The committee was told that recent <a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/reader/the-impact-of-hybrid-working-on-the-high-street/there-has-been-a-shift-away-from-city-centres-and-spending/">Centre for Cities research</a> had found increased home-working had changed the spending habits of commuters and this could pose a challenge for service businesses that depended on footfall from office workers, such as hospitality venues, sandwich bars and coffee shops.</p> <p>Swinney said: “In London it seems like it’s potentially a reallocation during the working week, whereas in other large cities, hybrid working seems to have led to a reduction of weekday spending by workers in the city centre.” </p> <p>Despite an initial push after the pandemic to get workers back into the office, 28% of working adults in the UK still had hybrid working arrangements in autumn of 2024, according to official data. </p> <p>These workers on average <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/11/hybrid-working-ons-social-divisions-work-from-home">saved 56 minutes from commuting</a>, spent 24 minutes more on sleep, and 15 minutes more on exercise, sports and wellbeing, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics.</p> <p>A recent poll also found <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/31/half-of-uk-professionals-might-quit-if-ordered-back-to-the-office-full-time-poll-shows">nearly half of professionals would consider quitting</a> if their employer forced them back to the office on a full-time basis, according to a poll by the recruitment company Hays.</p> <p>However, return to office mandates, combined with a slowdown in development over the past few years, has meant that rent prices have gone up. Rent for prime City office space rose 7.5% over the course of last year, according to research by the estate agent Savills.</p> <p>BlackRock has been approached for comment.</p>
