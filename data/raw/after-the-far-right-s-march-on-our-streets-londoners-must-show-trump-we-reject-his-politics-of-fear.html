<p>Something in our country changed at the weekend. Like cities across the UK, London has seen protests organised by the far right before, but this felt different. Over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/sep/13/unite-the-kingdom-far-right-rally-london-tommy-robinson-police-assaulted">100,000 people filled the capital</a>. Tens of thousands of them marched peacefully. But some violently attacked the police officers tasked with keeping Londoners safe. Elon Musk tried to rally protesters against our democracy, telling them to “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/what-did-elon-musk-say-at-far-right-uk-rally-and-did-his-remarks-break-the-law">fight back or you die</a>”.</p> <p>The scenes we saw didn’t come from nowhere. For far too long, our politicians and pundits have refused to condemn the rising tide of hatred in this country, instead choosing to dabble in dog-whistle politics and dangerous rhetoric themselves.</p> <p>Now, this toxic form of politics is spilling out on to our streets. Many minority Londoners have expressed fear and millions more in the capital and across the country are horrified. For our leaders, silence is no longer enough. The time has come to stand up and say: this is not who we are. We must unite to take on the reactionary populists and nativists who are exploiting economic concerns, the atomisation of modern life and a growing distrust of political and media institutions – something we have seen in countries across Europe and, of course, in the US.</p> <p>President Donald Trump and his coterie have perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years. When he came to the UK on his first state visit, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/01/donald-trump-state-visit-red-carpet-unbritish">I highlighted how</a> the president had deliberately used xenophobia, racism and “otherness” as an electoral tactic, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/06/the-full-text-trump-revised-travel-ban">introducing a travel ban</a> on a number of Muslim-majority countries and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/116973/documents/HHRG-118-ED00-20240417-SD006.pdf">praising white nationalists</a> in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/16/keir-starmer-jeffrey-epstein-donald-trump-state-visit">Just when Keir Starmer thought he’d got Jeffrey Epstein off his plate – look who’s coming to dinner | Marina Hyde</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Six years later, the tactics we see from today’s White House seem no different. Scapegoating minorities, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g8yj2n33yo">illegally deporting US citizens</a>, deploying the military to the streets of diverse cities. These actions aren’t just inconsistent with western values – they’re straight out of the autocrat’s playbook.</p> <p>I understand the UK government’s position of being pragmatic on the international stage and wanting to maintain a good relationship with the leader of the most powerful country in the world. Faced with a revanchist Russia, Europe’s security feels less certain now than at any time since the second world war. And the threat of even higher US tariffs is ever present.</p> <p>But it’s also important to ensure our special relationship includes being open and honest with each other. At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power – and being clear that we reject the politics of fear and division. Showing President Trump why he must back Ukraine, not Putin. Making the case for taking the climate emergency seriously. Urging the president to stop the tariff wars that are tearing global trade apart. And putting pressure on him to do much more to end Israel’s horrific onslaught on Gaza, as only he has the power to bring Israel’s brazen and repeated violations of international law to an end.</p> <p>We must also tell President Trump and his supporters to stop talking down and denigrating our great capital city. London is a global success story, no matter how much he wants to pretend otherwise. It’s open, dynamic and safer than every US state in terms of homicide rates. Perhaps that’s why record numbers of Americans are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/record-numbers-of-americans-have-applied-for-uk-citizenship-because-of-londons-values-says-khan">making London their home</a>.</p> <p>The president and his supporters often talk about the importance of free speech, painting a picture of Britain as a dystopian society where repression means <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/aug/13/trump-administration-accuses-uk-of-failing-to-uphold-human-rights">our rights are under threat</a>. Nothing could be further from the truth. This week, I’m sure many Londoners will speak up to tell President Trump and his followers that we cannot be divided by those who seek to sow fear. That we are determined for our city to stand strong as a bastion against hate, and shine bright as a beacon of hope. That we see strength in our diversity, not weakness. And that we hold our progressive principles high with pride, rather than hiding them in shame.</p> <p>Since the president’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/03/donald-trump-arrives-in-buckingham-palace-for-state-visit">last state visit</a> six years ago, the way we talk about politics has become darker, more divisive and dangerous. But London’s soul and spirit are as inclusive and optimistic as ever – because our modern, multicultural city isn’t going anywhere. Those who seek to divide us will find a city determined to defend its liberal, democratic values more fiercely than ever.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
