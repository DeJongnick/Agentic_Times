<p>It could take 20 years for GB Energy to meet its pledge to employ 1,000 people, its chair acknowledged on Monday.</p> <p>Jürgen Maier also refused to put a date on when it would bring down energy bills.</p> <p>GB Energy is a vital cog in Keir Starmer’s plans to boost renewable energy and reduce household bills. The agency was set up after Labour’s general election win, with the decision made last year to headquarter it in Aberdeen – the oil and gas capital of Europe – and the ambition of cutting costs for consumers.</p> <p>Maier said the Labour-backed organisation would create 200 to 300 roles in Aberdeen over the next five years.</p> <p>He told Sky News: “In the very long term, as we become a major energy champion, it may be many more [jobs] than that. Energy companies grow over 10 or 20 years. We are going to be around in 20 years as a British energy champion.”</p> <p>Asked if it could take 20 years to get to 1,000 jobs, he responded: “Absolutely.”</p> <p>Maier, a former chief executive of machine industry firm Siemens UK, highlighted there would also be thousands of jobs created in the wider renewable energy supply chain through the activities of GB Energy.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/06/could-labour-gb-energy-plan-future-proof-power-generation-uk">Can Labour’s GB Energy plan future-proof UK’s power generation sector?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, he could not give a fixed date on when energy bills would be cut by up to £300 as a result of its activities.</p> <p>Maier said: “I know that you are asking me for a date as to when I can bring that, but GB Energy has only just been brought into creation and we will bring energy bills down.”</p> <p>Scotland’s first minister, John Swinney, accused the UK government of “hoodwinking” the public over GB Energy’s ability to reduce bills.</p> <p>During a visit to Fife, Swinney told Bauer Radio: “I very much support the steps that have been taken by GB Energy, but I think the problem that we’ve got is that the Labour party, the Labour government, promised something that GB Energy is not able to deliver.</p> <p>“They’ve been hoodwinking the public about this point. People were promised lower fuel bills because of GB Energy. The chair of GB Energy told the media this morning that won’t be realised for some considerable time to come.”</p> <p>Scottish Tory leader Russell Findlay said: “Prior to the election, they couldn’t even tell us what GB Energy was going to be, other than a plaque on a building in Aberdeen.</p> <p>“It now turns out that Keir Starmer will be 80 years old before they employ the number of people they say it is going to employ, but I would even take that with a gigantic pinch of salt.”</p>
