<p>The UK self-driving car technology startup Wayve has secured more than $1bn (£800m) of investment to develop the next generation of artificial intelligence-powered vehicles, with the funding round led by Japan’s SoftBank.</p> <p>The $1.05bn investment is backed by the Japanese conglomerate along with the California chipmaker Nvidia and Microsoft, and is the biggest investment to date in a European AI startup. </p> <p>Wayve, which was founded in London in 2017, will use the funds to develop and launch the first “embodied AI” technology for self-driving vehicles in the UK.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2024/may/07/uk-house-prices-halifax-bp-profits-miss-forecasts-car-sales-ftse-100-business-live">UK housing market ‘finding its feet’ as prices inch higher; BP profits miss forecasts – business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Embodied AI will enable automated vehicles to learn from and interact with a real-world environment, including the ability to learn from situations that do not follow strict patterns or rules, such as unexpected actions by drivers or pedestrians.</p> <p>Alex Kendall, a co-founder and the chief executive of Wayve, said: “This investment will help us launch our embodied AI products and expand our operations globally. It sends a crucial signal to the market of the strength of the UK’s AI ecosystem, and we look forward to watching more AI companies here thrive and scale.”</p> <p>Kentaro Matsui, managing partner at SoftBank Investment Advisers, has taken a seat on Wayve’s board as part of the investment, and said Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s founder, was personally involved.</p> <p>Matsui said: “We have a vision of a peaceful world, free from traffic accidents. Once we learned that we shared a common vision, our team members and Masa were excited and felt we needed to help. We are very proud that we are taking part in this effort.”</p> <p>Wayve’s current technology is integrated into six vehicle platforms including electric cars such as the Jaguar I-Pace and the Ford Mustang MachE, as part of advanced driver assistance systems.</p> <p>All big carmakers are investing in autonomous cars, and a number of startups have sprung up in recent years, including the Alphabet-owned Waymo and the General Motors-owned Cruise in the US.</p> <p>In the UK, Wayve has carried out <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/17/taking-ride-self-driving-car-nissan-servcity-autonomous-vehicles">autonomous car trials</a>, along with the Oxfordshire startup Oxa, formerly called Oxbotica, and the Academy of Robotics. The transport secretary, Mark Harper, has predicted that self-driving cars could be on Britain’s roads <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/dec/27/self-driving-cars-could-be-on-uk-roads-by-2026-says-transport-secretary">by 2026</a>.</p> <p>The automated vehicle bill is expected to become law in the coming weeks and is designed to unlock a “transport revolution” by enabling the safe deployment of self-driving cars, according to the government.</p> <p>The self-driving vehicle industry in the UK is still in its infancy, but the government expects it to be worth £42bn and to create 38,000 skilled jobs by 2035. Between 2018 and 2022, the sector generated £475m of investment and created 1,500 new jobs.</p> <p>Rishi Sunak said the deal “anchors the UK’s position as an AI superpower,” adding: “The fact that a homegrown, British business has secured the biggest investment yet in a UK AI company is a testament to our leadership in this industry.”</p>
