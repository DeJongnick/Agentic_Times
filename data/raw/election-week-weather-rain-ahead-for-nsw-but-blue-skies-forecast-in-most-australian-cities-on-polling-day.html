<p>Wet and stormy weather is forecast to continue across eastern New South Wales in coming days, but as conditions clear, the state – and much of the country – can look forward to clearer skies on election day.</p> 
<p>Persistent showers were due to continue to build across the NSW coast and eastern Victoria on Tuesday and Wednesday. Strong, chilly winds from the south were also forecast, and could whip up large waves along the coast.</p> 
<p>“Once again, it’s New South Wales which is going to cop the brunt of the wet weather this week – much like it did over the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/apr/24/wet-and-stormy-weather-forecast-for-australias-east-coast-over-anzac-day-long-weekend">weekend</a> and late last week – with this frequent wet and stormy weather,” the Bureau of Meteorology’s Angus Hines said.</p>

<p>Away from that south-eastern coastline, rain would be “pretty hard to come by”, he said.</p> 
<p>There was a chance of light showers in southern Australia, including areas of South Australia that have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/apr/16/south-australia-historic-dry-weather-parched-waterways-dead-fish-and-trees-ready-to-give-up">gripped by drought</a>. But any rain was likely to be patchy, Hines said, “not a soaking spell”.</p> 
<p>Showers were also becoming less frequent up north, as the “tail end of the wet season” approached.</p> 
<p>Temperatures nationwide were expected to be cool over Tuesday and Wednesday, with daily maximums and overnight minimums below average.</p> 
<h2>Heading to the polls on Saturday? Here’s the capital city forecast for election day</h2> 
<p>While Saturday’s weather was expected be settled and warm for much of the country, those casting their vote in south-western Western Australia or north-eastern Queensland might consider taking a raincoat.</p> 
<p>By Saturday, showers in Sydney would start to clear, Hines said.</p> 
<p>“We could see the odd shower or two,” he said, “especially through the morning, but few and far between for the second half of the day.” A high of 23C was expected.</p>

<p>A fine and sunny day was expected in Canberra, with light winds and a high of 20C. Melbourne was also forecast to be fine, with temperatures reaching 22C.</p> 
<p>In Adelaide, Saturday was due to be sunny with a high of 25C, and Hobart dry and cloudy, with a maximum of 18C.</p> 
<p>The forecast for Darwin was hot and sunny, Hines said. Temperatures were expected to reach the low 30s, with the “outside chance of a shower”.</p> 
<p>Polling day in Perth would be “a different story”, he said, with a cold front crossing on Saturday, bringing cool winds and morning showers. A top of 22C was forecast, although southerly winds would make it feel colder, he said.</p> 
<p>In Brisbane, onshore winds were likely to bring showers across the city on Saturday, Hines said. “It’s going to be a cloudy day with some passing light showers – probably not more than about 10mm of rain – but a little bit damp if you’re out waiting in line to vote.” A maximum of 23C was expected.</p> 
<p>Alex Dawson from the <a href="https://democracysausage.org/federal_election_2025/m/@-29.49990,133.3308,z4.358966/">Democracy Sausage</a> project noted hot food and drinks – such as sausage sizzles, and tea and coffee – are usually popular at polling booths, particularly when the weather is wet or cool.</p> 
<p>Many polling centres are located at schools, churches and community halls, many of which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/sep/21/hail-australias-public-school-pcs-the-unsung-heroes-of-the-election-sausage">take the opportunity to fundraise</a> by offering a barbecue, cake stall, or even selling plants or books.</p>

<p>While cake stalls are common in Tasmania, the ACT has had “an incredibly high turnout for sausage sizzles”, Dawson said, noting that every single polling station had barbecues out at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/19/australia-labor-retain-power-in-act-election-but-lose-ground-to-liberals">the ACT election</a> in October.</p> 
<p>Saturday was expected to be a bumper day for fundraising activities, with more than 1,600 sausage sizzles, cake stalls and other stands already listed for polling places days out from the election – 900 more than at the same point in the last federal election, he said.</p> 
<p>Any wet weather was unlikely to impact on polling activities, though the Australian Electoral Commission was keeping a close eye on the weather throughout the election period and up to polling day.</p> 
<p>“Our messaging to voters is simple: plan your vote and if it’s raining, bring an umbrella!” a spokesperson said.</p>
