<p>The former prime minister Theresa May has condemned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/02/kemi-badenoch-vows-to-repeal-climate-change-act">a promise made by Kemi Badenoch to repeal the Climate Change Act</a> if the Tories win the next general election, calling the plans a “catastrophic mistake”.</p> <p>She joined other leading Tories, business groups, scientists and the Church of England in attacking the Conservative leader’s announcement, which would remove the requirement for governments to set “carbon budgets” laying out how far greenhouse gas emissions will be cut every five years, up to 2050.</p> <p>May called it a “retrograde” step that upended 17 years of consensus between the UK’s main political parties and the scientific community. She continued: “To row back now would be a catastrophic mistake for while that consensus is being tested, the science remains the same. We owe it to our children and grandchildren to ensure we protect the planet for their futures and that means giving business the reassurance it needs to find the solutions for the very grave challenges we face.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/15/weakening-net-zero-policy-will-spook-investors-warns-uks-climate-adviser">Weakening net zero policy ‘will spook investors’, warns UK’s climate adviser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Green Tories have been increasingly concerned at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/15/tories-reform-net-zero-climate-science">Badenoch’s move to position the Tories closer to the Reform party</a>, whose senior leaders <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/jun/15/labour-will-drop-unaffordable-net-zero-policies-predicts-reforms-deputy-leader">deny climate science</a>, on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/13/tory-shadow-energy-minister-claims-2050-net-zero-goal-not-based-on-science">energy and net zero policy</a>.</p> <p>Repealing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/27/climate-change-carbon-emissions-politics">2008 Climate Change Act</a> and cancellation of the target of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 would remove obligations to cut carbon and dismantle the cornerstone of climate policy.</p> <p>Under the act, which was passed by Labour with the support of David Cameron’s Conservative party, with <a href="https://www.publicwhip.org.uk/division.php?date=2008-10-28&amp;number=298">only five rebels voting against</a>, ministers must set five-yearly limits on the UK’s future emissions and bring in policies to meet them. It was the first such legislation in the world, but scores of other countries have since followed suit.</p> <p>Alok Sharma, the Tory former minister and peer who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/15/ratchets-phase-downs-and-a-fragile-agreement-how-cop26-played-out">president of the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow in 2021</a>, told the Guardian: “Thanks to the strong and consistent commitment of the previous Conservative government to climate action and net zero, the UK attracted many tens of billions of pounds of private sector investment and accompanying jobs. This is a story of British innovation, economic growth, skilled jobs and global leadership – not just a matter of environmental stewardship.”</p> <p>He warned that Badenoch risked not just alienating allies on the world stage, but discouraging voters. “Turning our back on this progress now risks future investment and jobs into our country, as well as our international standing,” he said. “The path to a prosperous, secure, and electable future for the Conservative party lies in building on our achievements, not abandoning them.”</p> <p>Lord Deben, who served as environment secretary under Margaret Thatcher and John Major, said none of Badenoch’s predecessors would have countenanced such a move. “This is not what Margaret Thatcher would have done,” he told the Guardian. “She understood this. If you want de-industrialisation of Britain, then [repealing the Climate Change Act] is the right way to go about it.”</p> <p>Business leaders also warned of serious economic damage. Rain Newton-Smith, the chief executive of the CBI, the UK’s biggest business association, said: “The scientific reality of climate change makes action from both government and business imperative. Scrapping the Climate Change Act would be a backwards step in achieving our shared objectives of reaching economic growth, boosting energy security, protecting our environment and making life healthier for future generations.”</p> <p>She said investment had been stimulated, not stifled as Badenoch suggested, by the legislation. “The Climate Act has been the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/24/britain-net-zero-economy-booming-cbi-green-sector-jobs-energy-security">bedrock for investment flowing into the UK and shows that decarbonisation and economic growth are not a zero-sum game</a>. Businesses delivering the energy transition added £83bn to the economy last year alone, providing high-paying jobs to almost a million people across the UK,” she said. “Ripping up the framework that’s given investors confidence that the UK is serious about sustainable growth through a low-carbon future would damage our economy.”</p> <p>If Badenoch were to repeal the Climate Change Act, Britain’s exports could be hit under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/22/government-under-pressure-to-set-up-green-levy-on-uk-imports">the EU’s green tariffs</a>. The EU’s carbon border adjustment mechanism, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/dec/13/eu-becomes-first-leading-economy-to-legislate-for-green-tariff-on-imports">now in its trial stages</a>, imposes levies on companies from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/13/green-tariffs-what-are-they-and-why-do-they-matter">countries that are not judged to have an adequate price on carbon</a>. The measure, intended to prevent other countries from undercutting climate rules, could add crippling costs to the UK’s industrial exports to its biggest trading partner.</p> <p>Civil society also rallied to reject Badenoch’s plans. Both the Church of England and the Catholic church spoke out, with Graham Usher, the bishop of Norwich, lead for environmental affairs for the Church of England, saying: “For Britain, the Climate Change Act reflects the best of who we are as a country: a nation that cares for creation, protects the vulnerable and builds hope for future generations. To weaken it now would be to turn our back on that calling and on the values we share as a nation. That is why the Church of England has committed to strive for net zero by 2030, because caring for God’s creation is not optional; it is essential if we are to safeguard the Earth for those who come after us.”</p> <p>Bishop John Arnold, the Catholic lead for the the environment, referred <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/01/pope-leo-climate-change-sceptics-cry-of-the-earth">to the speech</a> by Pope Leo XIV on Wednesday, criticising climate sceptics. “Pope Leo XIV yesterday inspired us to work with unity and togetherness on the challenges facing our common home … More than ever, we need to work together, to think of future generations and take urgent action if we are to truly respond to the scale of this climate crisis. A crisis which affects those who are poorest and most vulnerable and have done least to cause it.”</p>
