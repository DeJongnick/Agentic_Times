<p>A white military horse that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/apr/25/runaway-horses-in-serious-condition-after-bolting-through-central-london">galloped through central London</a> drenched in blood after bolting with other horses from routine exercises has returned home after more than six months of recovery, a charity has said.</p> 
<p>Vida was one of five horses that bolted near Buckingham Palace on 24 April after becoming spooked by noise from a nearby construction site and ran for several miles through the city during morning rush hour. </p> 
<p>The five horses smashed into vehicles, including a doubledecker bus, and caused a number of injuries. Three soldiers thrown from their horses were taken to hospital. Footage and pictures shared on social media showed the horses running through central London.</p>

<p>Three of the horses returned to service soon afterwards, but Vida, who was treated for lacerations, was one of two that required operations after colliding with vehicles during the stampede. Quaker, a black horse that dashed alongside Vida and sideswiped a taxi as it ran a red light and turned into oncoming traffic, is the only horse that has still not returned to the regiment.</p> 
<p>The three other horses that made a getaway, Tennyson, Trojan and Vanquish, returned to service in time to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/04/three-of-the-horses-that-bolted-across-london-expected-to-troop-the-colour">take part in trooping the colour</a> in June.</p> 
<p>The Horse Trust, an equine charity that cared for Vida, said the animal had returned to the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, the ceremonial guard of the monarch that is a feature of state functions in London, after recovering “physically and emotionally” in the countryside.</p>

<p>The charity said the departure of Vida, who enjoyed rolling in the mud almost as much as the attention he had received from staff, was bittersweet.</p> 
<p>Nicola Housby-Skeggs, the veterinary director at the Horse Trust, said: “He has been an absolute superstar, winning the groom’s hearts (and treats). We are so pleased to see him make such a fantastic recovery. While he will be missed here, as a relative youngster, he is certainly now ready for some exercise.”</p> 
<p>“It’s been our honour to give Vida a place of respite and recovery. Vida has come to hold a particular place in our hearts,” said Jeanette Allen, the chief executive of the Horse Trust. “He’s been a joy to care for, partly as we don’t have to groom that muddy monster for parade.</p> 
<p><em>“</em>He’s had a lovely time, and we are extremely proud of him as he sets off back to his role in the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.”</p>
