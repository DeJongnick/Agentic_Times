Yet “this is not the end of our fight for a cleaner, safer planet,” Podesta said.</p> <p>Under President Biden, the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest downpayment on the green transition seen in US history. “The fight is bigger than one election, one political cycle in one country,” said Podesta. The UN climate conference in Baku represents a “critical opportunity to cement our progress.”</p> <p>Among the United States’ top goals for the climate talks will be securing mitigation plans for greenhouse gases other than CO2, such as methane. On Tuesday, the nation will co-host a summit on the issue with China and Cop29 host Azerbaijan.</p> <p>Other major priorities, Podesta said, will be reaching an agreement on the use of carbon trading and increasing ambition on clean energy deployment,</p> <p>Another crucial component of the climate talks, Podesta said, will be ensuring small economies have access to climate finance from rich nations — “very important work”.</p> <p>“COP29 is a crucial opportunity to solidify our progress and keep 1.5 degrees alive, accelerate progress in reducing all greenhouse gases, and perhaps most importantly, strengthen global cooperation in adaptation and climate finance.

Real time data indicate that they continued to rise in 2024. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) has increased from around 278 ppm in 1750 to 420 ppm in 2023, an increase of 51%. This traps heat and causes temperatures to rise.</p> <p><strong>Ocean heat content</strong> in 2023 was the highest on record and preliminary data show 2024 has continued at comparable levels. Ocean warming rates show a particularly strong increase in the past two decades. From 2005 to 2023, the ocean absorbed on average approximately 3.1 million terawatt-hours (TWh) of heat each year. This is more than 18 times the world’s energy consumption in 2023.</p> <p><strong>Sea level rise </strong>is accelerating because of thermal expansion of warmer waters and melting glaciers and ice sheets. From 2014-2023, global mean sea level rose at a rate of 4.77 mm per year, more than double the rate between 1993 and 2002. The El Niño effect meant it grew even more rapidly in 2023. Preliminary 2024 data shows that, with the decline of El Niño, it has fallen back to levels consistent with the rising trend from 2014 to 2022.</p> <p><strong>Glacier loss </strong>is worsening. In 2023, glaciers lost a record 1.2-meter water equivalent of ice – about five times the amount of water in the Dead Sea. It was the largest loss since measurements began in 1953 and was due to extreme melting in North America and Europe. In Switzerland, glaciers lost about 10% of their remaining volume in 2021/2022 and 2022/2023.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id="block-67320e878f083e13c04fdea2" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-11T14:05:44.627Z">2.05pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Ben Spencer, science editor at the Sunday Times, is also at the press conference.

The researchers say it shows that there is “plenty of potential funding out there in the hands of the fossil fuel companies that helped create” the climate crisis.</p> <p>The central task of Cop29 is to agree on delivering at least $1tn a year to developing nations so they can cut emissions, build protection against extreme weather for their citizens and recover from disasters. </p>    <p>The researchers examined the earnings of 93 of big fossil fuel companies in 2022 comparing their expected profits to their actual profits after Russia’s war in Ukraine spiked oil prices. They found $490bn in unearned superprofits, above and beyond usual high profits. It is also a minimum estimate, as big oil and gas producers in Russia, Iran and Venezuela keep their earnings secret.</p> <p>“We urge governments around the world to use their power to use such superprofits for the benefit of those most affected by climate change at Cop29 in Baku,” said Prof Florian Egli, at the Technical University of Munich, Germany, who led the research. UN secretary general <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/20/un-secretary-general-tax-fossil-fuel-companies-climate-crisis">António Guterres has called for windfall tax</a>. </p> <p>US companies, such as ExxonMobil, gained $143bn, while $103bn went to companies headquartered in the UK, France and Canada, such as BP and TotalEnergies, the researchers found. Some countries did introduce windfall taxes but these covered only a fraction of the superprofits and were not used for climate action.</p> <p>Colossal profits are nothing new in the oil and gas industry. It has made <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jul/21/revealed-oil-sectors-staggering-profits-last-50-years">$1tn a year in pure profit every year for the last 50 years</a>, with the recent energy price crisis only boosting profits higher. </p> <p>Furthermore, big oil is also the recipient of huge subsidies from governments - almost literally pouring petrol on the climate crisis fire. Another <a href="https://data.one.org/data-dives/climate-financing-hypocrisy/">report released at Cop29</a> by justice campaign group One found rich countries spent $2.7tn on domestic fossil fuel subsidies between 2010 and 2022, six times more than they committed for international climate finance.</p> <p>“This data shows the true scale of climate hypocrisy: instead of fulfilling their promises to support climate-vulnerable countries, wealthy countries are propping up a trillion-dollar industry with trillions in subsidies. World leaders at Cop29 have a clear choice: redirect resources for everyone’s benefit,” said Joseph Kraus at One. </p> <p>The world’s biggest oil and gas producer, the US, spent five times more on fossil fuel subsidies than climate finance over the period, while the UK both spent nine times more. </p> <p>Cop29 hosts Azerbaijan spent 1800 times more, while the host of last year’s Cop28, the United Arab Emirates, spent over 150 times more. The world’s second biggest oil producer, Saudi Arabia spent 1200 times more.</p> <p>The G20 agreed in 2009 to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, which largely benefit the well-off.

The groups are particularly important as many developing countries have small and overstretched delegations.</p> <p>“We know the debt is much larger, but $5tn is what we come here to demand,” Essop said, wearing a bright lanyard stating “Global North, pay up!! $5tn!”.</p> <p>“Governments out there are absolutely capable of finding the money that does wrong in the world,” she said. “They found the money for military spending. They found the money for the genocide in Gaza. They find the money to subsidise and support the fossil fuel industry. To come here and say that they do not have money is absolutely untruthful and unacceptable.”</p> <p>Delivering a finance deal for developing countries is the central task of Cop29. There is widespread agreement that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-baku-climate-talks-odour-of-oil-return-of-trump-finance">trillions are needed and available</a>, but who pays what and how is far strongly contested.</p> <p>Essop warned that failing to deliver a good finance deal will severely damage trust among the negotiating nations and therefore impact all other climate issues at Cop29, from carbon cutting plans to a fair transition for workers: “Developing countries will just put their foot down and say, if we’re not going to settle on finance, we’re not settling on anything else.”</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-11-11T11:07:44.539Z">at 11.07am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6731c9fc8f08a0d8bfbd3ce7" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/fiona-harvey"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-11T09:13:17.349Z">9.13am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Mukhtar Babayev</strong>, the president of Cop29, has used a Guardian op-ed to call on the private sector to stump up cash for the developing world to invest in a low-carbon economy, <em>writes Fiona Harvey, environment editor, who is in Baku.</em></p> <p>Babayev, the environment minister of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, the host of this year’s climate conference, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/11/cop-29-climate-crisis-covid-history-developing-nations-private-investors">wrote in Monday’s Guardian</a>: </p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>The onus cannot fall entirely on government purses.

Our ability to get knocked down and to get up again over and over again, until we accomplish our goals.”</p>    <p>Stiell hails from the Grenada island of Carriacou, which was pummelled by Hurricane Beryl in July. He showed a photograph of himself standing with an elderly neighbour, Florence, whose home was flattened by the storm.</p> <p>“At 85, Florence has become one of the millions of victims of runaway climate change this year alone,” he said. “There are people like Florence in every country on Earth. Knocked down, and getting back up again.”</p> <p>UN negotiations can feel “far away” from the environmental disasters harming people like Florence, said Stiell. Yet the climate crisis “is affecting every single individual in the world in one way or another,” pushing up energy bills, furthering global instability, and taking lives, he said.</p> <p>Among the top priorities at Cop29, he noted, will be setting a new global finance goal, finalising the rules for carbon markets, and making commitments to mitigate planet-warning pollution.</p> <p>“Now is the time to show that global cooperation is not down for the count.

She added:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Join us as we rally against the wave of authoritarianism and exploitation sweeping through the Caucasus. Azerbaijan, using COP29 as a façade, is ramping up control under a false “green” agenda, tightening its grip on power, and escalating regional tensions.</p> <p>For over 20 years, Azerbaijan’s regime led by Aliyev have kept people oppressed, fostering poverty, fear, and silence. This authoritarian trend isn’t isolated–across the region, people like Ivanishvili, Putin, Erdogan, theocratic regime in Iran are deepening control, stifling dissent, oppressing their own people and using war and ethnic cleansing against Armenians, Ukrainians, Kurds and other ethnic minorities to justify brutal policies. Those who speak out–journalists, activists, scholars–are often met with imprisonment and violence. Under this system, climate action is reduced to corporate profit schemes, leaving people’s needs ignored and communities devastated.</p> <p>The collective West’s role in this authoritarian drift is undeniable, as it continues to legitimise and finance oppressive regimes for the sake of energy and profit. By turning a blind eye to oppression in exchange for resources, Western powers are complicit in the repression and suffering faced by the people of the Caucasus.</p> <p>The Caucasus Feminist Anti-War movement demand a future free from the chokehold of authoritarianism, war, and capitalist greed. We stand for real freedom, equality, justice, and a region where people, not profits, come first.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-11-11T08:34:31.701Z">at 8.34am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6731b1228f08a0d8bfbd3bfe" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-11T07:27:59.324Z">7.27am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Like most international diplomatic jamborees, Cops take place in fairly lavish surroundings, and Cop29 is no different.

That is particularly true for the funding needed by vulnerable communities to build protection against climate impacts, such as flood defences, so-called adaptation.</p> <p>The world’s developing nations need about $1bn a day just to cope with the extreme weather impacts of today, with only 1.3C of global heating, according to a <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/adaptation-gap-report-2024">UN Environment Programme (Unep) report</a> published on Thursday. What they are actually receiving is less than a tenth of that, about $75m a day.</p> <p>What’s worse is that while adaptation funding is increasing – from $22bn in 2021 to $28bn in 2022 – the deadly impacts of the climate crisis are increasing far faster, said Henry Neufeldt, lead author of the Unep report.</p> <p>UN secretary general António Guterres put it in typically stark terms: “Climate calamity is the new reality and we’re not keeping up. The climate crisis is here. We can’t postpone protection. We must adapt – now.”</p> <p>He noted that while adaptation funding is falling far short of what is required, “the purveyors of all this destruction – particularly the fossil fuel industry – reap massive profits and subsidies”.</p>    <p>At Cop26 in 2021, the Glasgow Climate Pact set a goal of doubling adaptation finance to at least $38bn by 2025. That may be achieved, but will remain far below the $230bn – $415bn range estimated by the UN as necessary.</p> <p>“The gap is extremely large – we need a step change,” said Paul Watkiss, another author of the Unep report.</p> <p>There are three strands of climate finance: money for cutting emissions, also called mitigation, money for adaptation, and money for disaster recovery, also called loss and damage.</p> <p>Watkiss said all are interrelated: “If you don’t mitigate and you don’t adapt, you get really high loss and damage. So we’re starting to see these very large scale events [like the recent floods in Spain] coming through. The tragedy is terrible, but hopefully it starts to provide an impetus to say, if you don’t adapt, that will lead to much higher costs overall. It’s much more efficient and effective to finance adaptation than it is to do nothing.”</p> <p>The negotiators at Cop29 have been told what is at stake. Now the hard work of delivering a meaningful finance deal begins.</p> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2024-11-11T07:23:49.851Z">at 7.23am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6731a8ab8f08a089b90bc918" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/damiancarrington"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-11T06:54:10.332Z">6.54am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><em>As well as hard coverage of the talks, throughout the day our correspondents will be filing lines on some of the experiences that offer some sense of the vibe in Baku.

Thankfully, the Reuters news agency has provided a glossary of terms. Here are some you will see peppered throughout our coverage in the coming fortnight. </p> <p><strong>UNFCCC</strong>: This acronym stands for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is the name of both the 1992 treaty committing nearly 200 countries to fighting global warming and the secretariat set up to implement that treaty.</p> <p><strong>COP</strong>: This acronym stands for Conference of Parties, and describes the annual summit of countries that have signed the UNFCCC treaty. This year’s COP29 meeting in Baku marks the 29th such gathering since the UNFCCC took effect in 1994.</p> <p><strong>NCQG</strong>: This relatively new acronym will be focal at COP29. It stands for the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, an annual target for funding developing country climate efforts.</p> <p><strong>NDC</strong>: Most often, these NDCs or Nationally Determined Contributions are referred to simply as “country pledges” and describe national action plans for reducing its emissions and adapting to climate impacts. The next round of NDCs are due in February, though some countries plan to submit new plans in Baku.<br><br><strong>GLOBAL WARMING</strong>: The term describes the gradual increase in the global average temperature.</p> <p><strong>CLIMATE CHANGE</strong>: While this term is often used interchangeably with “global warming,” it means something different. Climate change describes global warming as well as its consequences, such as extreme weather events. (At the Guardian, we will often use the terms <strong>CLIMATE BREAKDOWN</strong> or <strong>CLIMATE CRISIS</strong> to better convey the gravity of the situation.)</p> <p><strong>GREENHOUSE GASES</strong>: These gases, sometimes referred to simply as GHGs, are able to trap solar heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming. The most powerful GHGs are methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), which are also referred to as “carbon emissions” because both molecules contain carbon. The world’s excess carbon emissions come mostly from the burning of fossil fuels and other industrial activities.</p> <p><strong>PARIS AGREEMENT</strong>: Under this 2015 treaty from the COP21 talks in Paris, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F) above the pre-industrial average, with a goal of holding it to 1.5C (2.7F). The Paris pact also calls for national emissions-cutting pledges to be updated every five years</p> <p><strong>NET ZERO</strong>: This term does not mean releasing zero emissions, but rather releasing no more than the amount being recaptured by CO2 abatement technologies, tree planting, or other means. Reaching “net zero” would mean atmospheric GHG concentrations stop increasing.</p> <p><strong>LOSS AND DAMAGE</strong>: Governments last year pledged $800 million toward a new ‘loss and damage’ fund to help poorer nations being hit by climate-fueled disasters. The fund, which now has a director and a host nation, will now be deciding how the funds should be dispersed and calling for more contributions at COP29.</p> <p><strong>CARBON OFFSET</strong>: Also known as a “carbon credit,” these instruments allow a country or company to compensate for some of their carbon emissions by investing in projects to bring emissions down elsewhere.</p> <p><strong>ARTICLE 6</strong>: This term refers to a provision in the Paris Agreement on carbon offsets, and is used as shorthand for UNFCCC efforts to regulate international trading in carbon credits. Governments are hoping to resolve rules for trading carbon offsets at COP29 to allow for these markets to become operational.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6731a24e8f08a0d8bfbd3b98" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-11T06:28:26.406Z">6.28am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Here are some pictures of how things are looking in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, which has been set up in full summit mode.</p>       </div>   </div> <div id="block-6730f52e8f08a0d8bfbd3784" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/ajit-niranjan"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-11T06:24:05.893Z">6.24am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>WHAT IS COP29 IN AZERBAIJAN AND DOES IT MATTER?</strong></p> <p>The 29th United Nations climate conference has begun, with diplomats descending on Baku, Azerbaijan, to thrash out arguments over planet-heating pollutants and the money needed to deal with them.</p> <p>Like the 28 “conferences of the parties” that came before, Cop29 is not expected to stop the climate from changing - but delegates say that’s no reason to dismiss it as hot air. Cops are the key diplomatic arenas in which poor countries that have done little to heat the planet can put pressure on rich countries that hooked the world on fossil fuels. In turn, rich countries with the resources to transition quickly can encourage poor countries to clean up faster and sooner.</p> <p><strong>WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME OF COP29?</strong></p> <p>This year’s meeting will revolve around efforts to stump up the funds needed to cut pollution and adapt to more violent weather. Rich countries missed a goal to get poor countries $100 billion a year in climate finance from 2020, a target set in a previous Cop that experts deemed weak and patchy. Poor countries are now pushing for $1tr a year by 2030 - including cash to fix the destruction caused by extreme weather - but rich countries are reluctant to go higher unless the pool of contributors grows larger.</p> <p>If diplomats reach a good deal on money this month, it could build trust and spark greater ambition when countries submit sorely-needed action plans to cut pollution at Cop30 in Brazil next year.</p> <p><strong>WILL COP29 SUCCEED?</strong></p> <p>More than 32,000 participants have registered for the conference but observers are not expecting them to deliver transformational change. Several prominent world leaders are skipping the summit and sending deputies instead - including the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, the US’s Joe Biden, China’s Xi Jinping and Germany’s Olaf Scholz. The US just elected Donald Trump as president, who took the country out of the Paris climate agreement when he last sat in the White House. Papua New Guinea has pulled its ministers out of this year’s Cop altogether in protest at the failure of rich countries to live up to their promises.</p> <p>And beneath the high-level geopolitics, observers have also questioned whether the host is up to the task of shepherding overworked diplomats to find common ground. Azerbaijan, a middle-income country in central Asia that is rich in oil but poor in water, is well-poised to bridge the divide between the different interest groups. But a secret recording last week appeared to show the Cop29 CEO <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/08/cop29-ceo-filmed-agreeing-to-facilitate-fossil-fuel-deals-at-climate-summit">agreeing to facilitate fossil fuel deals</a>.</p> <p>The hope is that the conference can really bring countries together, and continue to push progress on reducing the world’s CO2 emissions.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6730f5558f08a0d8bfbd3788" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2024-11-11T06:24:05.893Z">6.24am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>Good morning, this is Damien Gayle, your online guide to Cop29 …</p> <p>The 29th Conference of the Parties is beginning in Baku, Azerbaijan, this morning and, as we do every year, the Guardian environment desk will be blogging every cough and spit by the thousands of delegates, campaigners, lobbyists and others who have travelled to visit the climate talks.</p> <p>Our team of reporters has already travelled to Baku, and I will be anchoring coverage from London, weaving together their contributions while scanning social media and wires news feeds to achieve as close to total coverage as is possible for one man and a blog.</p> <p>If you have any comments or suggestions on things we could be covering, or news to share, please don’t hesitate to drop me a line via email.
