<h1>Moving pictures, robot actors and a presidential book – take the Thursday quiz</h1>
<div><strong>Date :</strong> 2024-09-05T10:00:36Z &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Auteur :</strong> Martin Belam &nbsp; | &nbsp; <strong>Journal :</strong> Life and style</div>
<p>Settle down for what should be the final pre-packaged and pre-shrunk summer edition of the Thursday quiz. This week the questions are loosely themed around the concept and the word “art”, but as usual you will find the connection to the theme gets more tenuous the further you progress in the quiz. Remember, it is just for fun, and since there are slightly fewer questions than usual, every answer carries a lot more pressure with it. Guess well! The usual topical format returns next week.</p> 
<p><strong>The Thursday quiz, No 176 – Art week!</strong></p>

    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:C - Of course it is kinetic art, from the Greek kinētikos, 2:D - The movement flourished at the turn of the century, 3:B - Baker played the role in the first six Star Wars films, 4:A - It was opened under that name in 1897, then from 1920 to 1932 was known as the National Gallery, Millbank, 5:D - Arthur Dent is the unfortunate man who finds his house and his planet are to be demolished in rapid succession. You get half a point if you said Doctor Who, as in one episode David Tennant's Doctor is wearing a dressing gown and says: "Very Arthur Dent. Now, there was a nice man", 6:A - At one point he had to issue a denial that he was Banksy. Simpler times, 7:B - He is credited with great technical ability and did not allow his limited vision to impede his career, 8:C - According to the parliament website, there were 25 articles of union that formed the basis of the two Acts of Union passed by the parliaments at Westminster and in Edinburgh. Those are pugs Minnie and Mia in the picture, standing in front of quite possibly the worst half-and-half football scarf ever conceived, 9:D - It is incredible how unimaginative people can be about place names when setting about colonial expansion. There is a Port Arthur in Tasmania, in Ontario, and in Texas and Wisconsin, 10:B - Angel Clare was his first solo effort in 1973, after Simon &amp; Garfunkel had become very successful and frequently very cross with each other it seems, 11:B - He is 36 now. Do not think too hard about the passage of time or you will have an existential crisis, 12:D - Most people credit Derrick May, Juan Atkins, and Kevin Saunderson in Detroit with inventing and popularising the sound in the US, 13:C - He was played by Roger Clark, and they should definitely make a gritty high-end western TV series out of the games, 14:B - Trump cited it as one of his proudest accomplishments and his second-favourite book after the Bible, which is maybe why he has been known to sign the latter</p>
