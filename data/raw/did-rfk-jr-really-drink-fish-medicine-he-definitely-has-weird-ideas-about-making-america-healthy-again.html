<h1>Did RFK Jr really drink fish medicine? He definitely has weird ideas about ‘making America healthy again’</h1>

<p>Robert F Kennedy Jr is many things, but he is not a tropical fish. Someone should probably tell him this because he appears to be guzzling fish medicine. <a href="https://x.com/iAnonPatriot/status/1887232439770087608">Last week, a video</a> of RFK sitting on a plane and putting a strange blue liquid into his glass of water went viral. It’s not clear what he was taking, but online sleuths are convinced it was methylene blue, which is used to treat parasites in fish as well as aquatic ailments such as swim bladder disease.</p> <p>To be fair, methylene blue does have human uses – in the US, it is FDA-approved to treat a rare blood disorder. Over the <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/life-style/health-and-families/fish-tank-cleaner-anti-aging-doctor-methylene-blue-b2038679.html">last few years</a>, however, it has been touted as a miracle drug in wellness circles and people have been using it off-label in the hopes of staving off everything from jet lag to ageing. “Looks like RFK Jr is in on one of the best-kept secrets in biohacking – methylene blue,” <a href="https://x.com/thegarybrecka/status/1887321674497892801?s=46&amp;t=vhAcrrF3stpMwmwjyQ3K1Q">wrote one</a> prominent wellness influencer after the viral video. “When used correctly, it’s a gamechanger for mental clarity and longevity.”</p> <p>That’s a stretch. While <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-leading-edge/202409/red-light-therapy-and-methylene-blue-may-promote-brain-health">some studies</a> show methylene blue <em>may </em>help with those things, self-medicating is a bad idea. Too much of the stuff can <a href="https://www.rsc.org/news-events/articles/2012/10-october/halloween-chemical-prank-condemned-by-royal-society-of-chemistry/">turn your urine blue</a>, for one thing. More importantly, it can interact with certain medications, which can have serious consequences.</p> <p>We don’t know for sure that it was methylene blue. But we do know that Kennedy, who is a prominent anti-vaxxer, has a lot of strange – and arguably very dangerous – ideas about medicine. These may stem from some of his own health problems, including one issue <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/08/robert-f-kennedy-jr-worm-brain">he memorably said</a> “was caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died”. According to the New York Times, the worm may have actually been a “pork tapeworm larva”. Tapeworms aside, Kennedy’s wellness opinions would be entirely his business were it not for the fact that he is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/09/rjk-jr-health-secretary-trump">closing in</a> on the role of secretary of health and human services and is poised to inflict his ideas on the rest of us, all in the name of a movement he has termed “Make America Healthy Again” (Maha). Like every Maga movement, this one is being aggressively monetised: Kennedy has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/30/rfk-maha-trademark">applied to trademark Maha</a> for use in marketing potential products including food supplements, vitamins and (oddly) vaccines.</p> <p>Some people are aghast at his ideas; others are ecstatic about the prospect of him upending the US’s approach to food and healthcare. There has been a <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/rfks-confirmation-hearing-and-maha-moms">lot</a> of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/us/rfk-jr-fans-christian-parents.html">coverage</a> about the “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-cabinet-confirmation-hearings/card/-crunchy-moms-found-a-hero-in-rfk-jr--1SISesByy6B1JEJdyHcY">crunchy moms</a>” who are quite justifiably horrified about all the rubbish that is in processed foods and are thrilled by the Maha agenda.</p> <p>It’s interesting, however, to see just how much of the discourse around Maha seems to focus on woo-woo-women and their silly little wellness ideas, because – as Kennedy demonstrates – it’s men who are increasingly dominating the alternative health (if you’re being diplomatic) or pseudoscientific quackery (if you’re not) space. That’s partly because Silicon Valley <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/21/extreme-fasting-how-silicon-valley-is-rebranding-eating-disorders">has rebranded</a> being obsessed with your health as “biohacking”. Men who are into biohacking and longevity don’t casually take vitamin pills like the rest of us. No, no, they build <em><a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/subtopics/how-to-build-a-supplementation-protocol">supplementation protocols</a></em><em> </em>and personalised “<a href="https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/UtLf1NSi">supplement stacks</a>”. Supplementing appears to have become an extreme sport among a certain type of wellness bro: the more pills you swallow, the more macho you are. Bahram Akradi, the 63-year-old CEO of a gym chain, for example, recently said he’s been taking <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/life-time-ceo-bahram-akradi-50-supplements-healthy-aging-2025-2">“about 45 to 50”</a> pills every morning for years. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/sep/14/my-ultimate-goal-dont-die-bryan-johnson-on-his-controversial-plan-to-live-for-ever">Bryan Johnson</a>, the 47-year-old tech entrepreneur who is spending millions of dollars trying to de-age himself, takes more than 100 pills a day. According to one interview, he wakes up at 4.30am and takes 57 pills, does some ab stimulation, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/03/nx-s1-5231754/tech-entrepreneur-bryan-johnson-discusses-his-quest-to-slow-aging#:~:text=The%20drug%20has%20been%20shown,and%20an%20increased%20heart%20rate.">then takes 34 more</a>.</p> <p>Spending a fortune on experimental pills, and not even the fun kind, is about as stupid as it sounds. I don’t know what Akradi has been taking, but for about five years Johnson was downing a pill called rapamycin that had been found to extend the lifespan of mice. But Johnson is not a mouse and he recently quit taking it because another study found it might <a href="https://gizmodo.com/longevity-obsessed-tech-millionaire-discontinues-de-aging-drug-out-of-concerns-that-it-aged-him-2000549377">increase ageing in humans</a>. I think Alanis Morissette would call this ironic, don’t you think?</p> <p>Anyway, the upshot of all this is that the takeover of the US government by weirdos with dangerous ideas continues apace. Meanwhile, remember that you are not a mouse or a fish, and design your “supplementation protocol” accordingly.</p> <p>• Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>
