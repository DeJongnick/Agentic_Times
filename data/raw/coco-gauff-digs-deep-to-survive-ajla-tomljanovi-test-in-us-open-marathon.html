<p>Coco Gauff survived a shaky serving performance to battle past Ajla Tomljanović in the first round of the US Open, winning 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 after 2hr 57min on Tuesday night.</p> <p>The No 3 seed finished with 10 double faults, was broken six times and squandered a string of opportunities to close the contest earlier, but conjured enough resilience to scrape into round two under the lights on Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p> <p>Gauff appeared in control after winning five of six games from a break down to take the opener and twice leading by a break in the second. Yet she faltered when serving for the match at 5-4 in the third, conceding two double faults and a pair of forehand errors as Tomljanović levelled at 5-5.</p> <p>The 21-year-old American responded instantly, breaking back before sealing victory at her second attempt with a crisp backhand winner down the line, lifting her arms to the crowd in relief as much as celebration. “It wasn’t the best, but I’m happy to get through,” Gauff said. “I had so many chances. I just kept telling myself eventually one of them would go my way.”</p> <p>Her serve remains a clear work in progress despite recent changes to her team, including the addition of biomechanics specialist Gavin MacMillan. Gauff admitted the past week of practice had been punishing: “I was spending a lot of time on court literally serving until my shoulder was hurting,” she said. “It’s like learning a new language … I know this is the part of my game that needs to improve if I want to get the results I want.”</p> <p>The tension was evident in the deciding set. “That game where I served at 5-4 was definitely like an old habit,” she said. “The next game was a lot better. At 6-5 I told myself, trust the work we did on court.”</p> <p>Tomljanović, ranked 79th, had her chances too. The Australian committed 56 unforced errors and eight service breaks of her own, her heavy forehand threatening at times but ultimately too erratic to deliver the upset. </p> <p>Gauff, who admitted she had reminded herself of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/sep/02/serena-williams-ajla-tomljanovi-us-open-tennis-third-round-retirement">Tomljanović’s career-best win</a> over Serena Williams at Flushing Meadows, felt the contest was the perfect early-round test. “First round is more stressful than the final, in my experience,” she said. “I don’t think it could get any more stressful than this.”</p> <p>Gauff will face Croatia’s Donna Vekić in the second round as she continues her campaign in New York, with the prospect of leapfrogging Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek for the world No 1 ranking for the first time still within reach if she can string together a deep run.</p>
