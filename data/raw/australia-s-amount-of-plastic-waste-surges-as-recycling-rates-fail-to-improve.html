<p>Plastics recycling rates in Australia have flatlined as the amount of waste continues to grow, the latest government data reveals.</p> <p>Australians produced 3.2m tonnes of plastic waste in 2023-24, up from 3m tonnes the previous year, according to <a href="https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/waste/plastics-and-packaging/australian-plastic-flows-fates-reporting#toc_9">Australian plastics flows and fates</a> data released on Friday.</p> <p>About 39% of the nation’s plastic waste was from packaging.</p> <p>The data, collected since 2000, showed the total amount of plastic waste had doubled since 2005 (from 1.57m tonnes) but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/23/recycling-alone-wont-limit-the-scourge-of-soft-plastics-in-our-everyday-lives">recycling rates had barely shifted</a> despite investments in increased capacity.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>In 2023-24 the plastics recovery rate was 14.1% compared with 14.7% in 2005, with the majority of material still being sent to landfill.</p> <p>“We can’t recycle our way out of this,” said Gayle Sloan, the chief executive of the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia. “It’s a supply chain challenge, not just a waste challenge.</p> <p>“If you don’t design well and you don’t buy back, we cannot solve this.”</p> <p>Despite promises from the government since 2023, Sloan said Australia had still not moved on mandatory design or recycled content standards.</p> <p>According to the data, of the 446,000 tonnes of plastics diverted from landfill in 2023-24, about two-thirds were recycled in Australia and a third (145,000t) exported for processing overseas.</p> <p>About 23,000 tonnes of the plastic recovered was sent to energy recovery (where waste was burned as a fuel substitute, or used to generate heat or electricity) in 2023-24, a figure that could increase in coming years as several states pursued <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/23/licence-to-burn-victoria-is-changing-the-way-it-deals-with-rubbish-is-it-moving-too-fast">waste-to-energy</a> projects.</p> <p>Plastic consumption was also increasing.</p> <p>Australians used 4m tonnes of plastic products and packaging in 2023-24 – equivalent to 146kg per person – up from 3.9m tonnes the previous year.</p> <p>The largest source was due to product packaging, responsible for about 1m tonnes of new plastic each year. Other large plastic users included the built environment (18%), electrical (9%) and clothing (8%).</p> <p>Almost all of the plastics used in Australia were imported in the form of products and packaging, or as new plastic resins.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/19/urgent-action-needed-plastic-additives-sperm-count-decline-experts-warn">Action needed on plastic additives linked to sperm decline, experts warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Monday, the environment minister, Murray Watt, reaffirmed Australia’s commitment to tackling plastic waste, after countries failed to reach agreement on a treaty to end plastic pollution in Geneva.</p> <p>“By boosting recycling capability with our state and territory partners through investments in new recycling infrastructure, we’re making real progress in recovering materials that would otherwise go to landfill,” Watt said.</p> <p>“On top of this, we’re continuing to work with states and territories to phase out problematic single-use plastics and transforming Australia’s packaging regulations.”</p> <p>The new data comes as <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666016424004304?via%3Dihub">a University of NSW study</a> reviewed the extent of microplastic pollution in Australia – in indoor air, road dust, and freshwater and marine ecosystems.</p> <p>While further research was needed, the study found microplastic posed a significant threat to human health, biodiversity and ecosystems, and recommended steps to limit plastic pollution.</p> <p>The report recommended laws to minimise the amount of plastics in products, a ban on the use of soft plastics in restaurants and home kitchens, restrictions on microbeads in personal care, cosmetics and cleaning products, and the introduction of an extended responsibility scheme.<br><br></p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Breaking News">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
