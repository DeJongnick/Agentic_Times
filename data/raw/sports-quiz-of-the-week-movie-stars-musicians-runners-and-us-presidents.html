    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:D - There is only one change in Donald’s team: Rasmus Højgaard is in and his twin brother Nicolai is out., 2:B - Europe pulled off one of the all-time great comebacks at Medinah in 2012. They went into the final day 10-6 down but absolutely hammered USA in the singles and won 14½-13½., 3:D - They are the only team Bayer Leverkusen beat during Erik Ten Hag’s short stint as manager. It was his first game in charge and Bayer won 4-0 – a pretty good start you’d have thought., 4:D - Ten Hag was sacked after three games – one win, one defeat and one draw – and was paid €6m for his troubles., 5:D - “We are delighted to welcome staunch supporter Terry Dunn to the Wanderers’ ranks,” said Dorking in a statement. Dunn has some experience of playing as a goalkeeper but he retired in 1997. “Playing in goal is like riding a bike – you never forget it,” he says. “I still regularly play walking football. As a Wanderers fan, no one will be trying harder than me to keep a clean sheet on Saturday.”, 6:B - Ramos has high hopes for his music career. “I’m an optimist,” he said. “I always tell people to dream. I see myself winning a Champions League as a coach, but I see myself winning a Grammy in the next few years before that.”, 7:A - Sheringham scored his last goal on Boxing Day in 2006 for West Ham against Portsmouth., 8:D - There have been a lot of one-sided games at the tournament so thank you United States and Australia for giving us some jeopardy., 9:B - Chelsea signed 10 players but they sold a lot more and ended up making a profit., 10:A - Bugner, who was born in Hungary, settled in Britain and died in Australia, went up against all the greats in his time: Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Henry Cooper and Jean-Claude Van Damme., 11:D - Park travelled 7,000 miles to give the medal to Jones. “I had the gold medal, but I want to give it back to you. It belongs to you,” he told Jones, who broke down in tears. Watch the video. It’s great. , 12:C - He leaves United after 96 games, 12 goals, five assists and 14 yellow cards. Given these stats, he may be overpriced at €25m, never mind €100m., 13:C - The clue is in the name! Walker was quite the character. As well as being a successful businessman, a very good boxer, and a horse racing enthusiast, he also helped establish the Walker Cup. , 14:C - Arsenal drew the largest attendances in the WSL last season (28,808 per home games), considerably higher than the league average of 6,662., 15:C - Mobile phones will receive an alert and siren at 3pm. It will last for 10 seconds. And then the game can begin., 16:C - It is the biggest half marathon in the world.</p>
