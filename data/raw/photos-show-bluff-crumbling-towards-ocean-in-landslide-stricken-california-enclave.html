<p>A wealthy enclave in southern California that has been threatened by worsening landslides for years saw more of its land crumble this week.</p> <p>Aerial photos showed parts of several backyards of large homes in Rancho Palos Verdes, a coastal community about 25 miles (40km) south of Los Angeles, had crumbled toward the ocean on Saturday evening.</p> <p>There was no structural damage to homes and no injuries were reported, according to the city. It’s unclear what triggered the land movement.</p>    <p>City officials said the event was unrelated to the continual land movement known as the Portuguese Bend Landslide Complex, about 4 miles (6km) south-east.</p> <p>The community sits atop an ancient landslide complex, which was activated in 1956, with the construction of a road. That landslide destroyed 140 homes.</p> <p>The land has moved ever since. Homes have collapsed or been torn apart. Many residents have seen their gas and electricity intermittently cut off.</p>    <p>The landslides were long and slow-moving, but began to accelerate after several years of torrential rains.</p> <p>Last year, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/07/flooding-southern-california-deaths-mudslides">historic storm</a> lead to shifts as great as 1ft a week. The community was left grappling with buckling streets, and sinking and cracking buildings. Hundreds of families were forced to leave their homes.</p>
