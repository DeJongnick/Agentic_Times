<p>The suspected Porepunkah gunman has a black belt in karate and is an expert bowhunter, according to a man who has known him since the 1990s.</p> <p>On the fifth day of the manhunt for Dezi Freeman, a former friend has questioned whether police were aware of his deteriorating mental health, suggesting that sending 10 officers to his door to execute a warrant would have been “the worst thing for him”.</p> <p>Freeman, 56, is alleged to have killed two police officers and injured a third on Tuesday in Porepunkah, north-east of Melbourne.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/28/who-is-dezi-freeman-porepunkah-victoria-police-shooting-suspect-sovereign-citizen-ntwnfb">Who is Dezi Freeman?

James Filby, a younger brother, who also lives in the state’s north-east, has posted “my prayers are with the fallen police and their grieving familes (sic)” on social media.</p> <p>Freeman’s former friend suggested he would feel safe around the hamlet of Nug Nug, on the Buffalo River, to the west of Mount Buffalo.</p> <p>Freeman lived with his family for several years at Nug Nug, before moving to Myrtleford, and then on to the property at Porepunkah, where the shooting happened. This property also backed on to the Mount Buffalo national park.</p> <p>The western side of Mount Buffalo was steeper, the man said, with caves and crevasses that Freeman would be familiar with.</p> <p>The Nug Nug property Freeman was said to live on is near the end of a long dirt road, which passes bushland and a camp ground on the river before winding through sweeping green land in the foothills of the mountain.</p> <p>On Saturday, a tattered piece of faded police tape was tied around the letterbox at the roadside, next to the entrance to a long driveway. The house at the end of it was not visible from the road.</p>    <p>The former friend hopes the bloodshed has finished, and that Freeman surrenders soon.</p> <p>“It’s just tragic … it’s sad it ended up like this.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
