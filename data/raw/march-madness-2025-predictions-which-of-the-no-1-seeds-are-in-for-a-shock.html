<h2>The most exciting player this year is ...</h2> <p><strong>PJ Haggerty</strong>, a 6ft 3in redshirt sophomore guard, is already on his third college team, Memphis, after brief stints at Tulsa and TCU. Haggerty was third in Division I in scoring this year, averaging 21.8 points per game, and he scored 83 points in three games to boost the No 5-seeded Tigers to the American Athletic Conference title. <strong>DC</strong></p> <p>This is like asking me to pick my favorite child, which is easy because I only have one. After having seen her play in person a few times, I have to go with Notre Dame’s <strong>Hannah Hidalgo</strong>. Her game is magnetic. She’s quick on her feet, aggressive and has no problem getting in anyone’s face – it’s fun, exciting, and the kind of basketball I love to see. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>We’ve already dicussed Cooper Flagg in detail elsewhere, so I’ll go with <strong>Jase Richardson</strong> from Michigan State. The 6ft 3in freshman point guard has an elite shooting touch and is incredibly efficient, with a 59% effective field goal percentage. Richardson embodies the toughness and grit that Tom Izzo values, and he has the potential to lead the Spartans on a deep run. <strong>NL</strong></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/20/march-madness-2025-predictions-which-of-the-no-1-seeds-are-in-for-a-shock">March Madness 2025 predictions: which of the No 1 seeds are in for a shock?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Paige Bueckers is excellent but she and her UConn teammates are complemented by the addition of <strong>Azzi Fudd</strong>. After missing pivotal moments through injury – like last year’s Final Four matchup, where her ample shooting range was needed most – Fudd has been one of the comeback players of the year. She was the key factor in UConn’s upset of South Carolina, breaking the Gamecocks’ 71-game home win streak. I’m excited to see how her confidence, quick release, and three-pointers will impact the Huskies. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>What are you most looking forward to, on or off the court?</h2> <p>The final <strong>television ratings</strong>. Fueled by that phenomenon named Caitlin Elizabeth Clark, the women’s final <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/apr/09/ncaa-basketball-womens-ratings-better-than-mens-tournament">outdrew the men’s final on TV</a> for the first time last year – and by more than 4m viewers. Can the women make it two in a row? Three of the last four men’s finals have been blowouts, decided by 15 points or more. <strong>DC</strong></p> <p>On the court: assuming they can take out South Florida and Ohio State (they can!), <strong>Tennessee v Texas</strong> will be one of the banner games to watch in the women’s tournament. When they last met in January, Texas eked out a win by only four points, and Tennessee will be hungry to make a major March impact this year. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>The potential Rick Pitino v John Calipari matchup</strong>. There is a lot of history here. They started as good friends, with Pitino helping Calipari land his first head coaching job at UMass in the early 90s. However, as their programs grew and they became competitors, their relationship soured. A second-round matchup of St John’s and Arkansas could bring plenty of drama. <strong>NL</strong></p> <p>I’m curious to <strong>see how LSU adjust</strong> after multiple late-season losses, with or without Flau’jae Johnson. She recently admitted that she’s been playing “the worst basketball” of her career, and it’s clearly hurt the team. Now, with news that she’s out indefinitely, the question is whether Kim Mulkey’s group has the IQ and chemistry to make a Final Four run. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>Dark horse team to watch …</h2> <p>Three teams have won back-to-back NCAA men’s titles in the last 50 years: Duke (1991-92), Florida (2006-07) and <strong>Connecticut </strong>(2023-24). The 1993 Duke team were dumped by California in the second round, and the 2008 Gators did not even make the NCAA Tournament. UConn (23-10) are a mere No 8 seed this year, but watch Dan Hurley drag the Huskies farther than either of the previous two-time champs. UCLA, by the way, were the last team to win at least three titles in a row, rolling to seven straight from 1967 to 1973. <strong>DC</strong></p> <p>On the women’s side, <strong>Ole Miss</strong>. They were already so much fun to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGeIhQ-ZqVQ">in their season opener in Paris</a> last year, but the team have grown steadily since then and it wouldn’t be a total surprise if they make a deep run. Assuming they beat No 4 Baylor in the first round, the Landsharks will likely face top overall seed UCLA … who they could <em>probably</em> beat. Maybe. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>You know your program is elite when a 25-8 season feels like a down year. That’s where <strong>Gonzaga</strong>’s<strong> </strong>men’s team are but Mark Few still has a group who rank ninth in the country in adjusted offense. There aren’t many coaches who know how to win in the tournament like Few and his team is coming off a WCC championship run where they avenged their two regular-season losses to Saint Mary’s. <strong>NL</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Tennessee Lady Vols</strong> weren’t on my radar as serious contenders until recently. Their wins over UConn and Iowa proved they’re a team to watch. Before those upsets, they weren’t part of the big-team conversation, and those victories felt more like surprising wins than expected outcomes. The No 5 seed in the Texas Longhorns’ quarter of the bracket, they’re easy to overlook, especially without a clear star player. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>The most vulnerable top seed is …</h2> <p>The women’s four top seeds appear to be stronger than the men’s four top seeds. Of the four men’s top seeds,<strong> Auburn </strong>(28-5), the No 1 seed overall, lost three of their last four games after winning 27 of their first 29 – although the Southeastern Conference, with an astonishing 14 tournament teams, is quite easily the best league in the nation. <strong>DC</strong></p> <p>In the women’s tournament it’s <strong>Southern California</strong>, but that’s just because head coach Lindsay Gottlieb seems pretty concerned about playing in the same regional as UConn (which is fair). If she’s scared, I’m scared, too! Among the men’s teams, it’s <strong>Florida</strong> because Duke have something special going, Houston’s size and ball pressure are insurmountable and Auburn are the top overall seed on merit. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Duke</strong> have an embarrassment of riches on their roster, but even so, having the best men’s player in the country dealing with injury is a tough blow. Will the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/19/cooper-flagg-looks-like-a-future-nba-superstar-he-may-choose-to-stay-in-college">likely No 1 overall pick</a> in this year’s NBA draft risk playing through injury? Time will tell. <strong>NL</strong></p> <p><strong>Southern California women</strong>. They rely too heavily on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/feb/13/juju-watkins-interview-usc-basketball">JuJu Watkins</a> and struggle with team basketball – it’s as simple as getting the ball to Watkins, even her teammate Kiki Iriafen has said as much. And it reminds me a lot of last year’s Iowa where their strategy was simply getting Caitlin Clark the ball. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>One bold prediction …</h2> <p>The energetic and entertaining <strong>Bill Raftery will once again stand alone</strong> among television commentators of either tournament, especially if he is egged on by play-by-play man Ian Eagle. Raftery, 81, is the enthusiastic ex-coach from New Jersey known for hollering “Onions!” when a player coolly hits a crucial big shot. Onions, in this case, represent testicles. <strong>DC</strong></p> <p><strong>NC State win the entire women’s tournament</strong>. There is something so special about the combination of Saniya Rivers, Aziaha James and Zamareya Jones and the way they absolutely hammer their opponents when the team is synchronized. I’d also love to see someone new in the championship game. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>The University of California San Diego men</strong> are in their first season of postseason eligibility. If you appreciate ball movement and connected defense, you’ll enjoy watching this Triton team. They lead the country in turnover margin, and their first-round opponent, Michigan, are prone to turnovers. The size difference is concerning but the Tritons have been elite at doubling the post all year. Let’s see if this is the upset we are all looking for. <strong>NL</strong></p> <p>Last year, $2.7bn was legally wagered on the tournament, and I believe this year will surpass that significantly. With the unpredictability of the season – including major losses from even some of the best teams – more people may be inclined to place bets. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/feb/15/draftkings-lawsuit-sports-betting-addiction">With gambling culture gripping the US</a>, <strong>total wagers could soar to as much as $7bn</strong>. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>Men’s final four</h2> <p>Michigan State, St John’s, Duke, Houston. <strong>DC</strong></p> <p>Michigan State, Tennessee, Duke, Houston. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>Auburn, Texas Tech, Alabama, Houston. <strong>NL</strong></p> <p>Auburn, Florida, Duke, Alabama. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>Women’s final four</h2> <p>UCLA, Southern California, South Carolina, Texas. <strong>DC</strong></p> <p>NC State, UConn, South Carolina, Notre Dame. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p>UCLA, Southern California, South Carolina, TCU. <strong>NL</strong></p> <p>UCLA, UConn, South Carolina, Notre Dame. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>The men’s champion will be ...</h2> <p>Seven of the last nine NCAA champions have as the top seeds in their regions, which does not appear to be good news for non-No 1 seeds. But <strong>St John’s</strong>, a No 2 seed, have so much going for them – the crafty and rejuvenated Rick Pitino, 19 victories in 20 games, the adoration of a city that loves basketball – that it seems silly to pick against the Red Storm. <strong>DC</strong></p> <p><strong>Duke</strong>. There’s a lot of chatter about the difficulty of building a championship team with freshmen, but one needs to look only at the not-so-distant past to see that it can be done. Carmelo Anthony, Gerry McNamara and Billy Edelin powered Syracuse to a natty in 2003, a feat replicated by Kentucky’s 2012 squad featuring Anthony Davis. And Duke’s own history backs up the possibility: in 2015 the men’s program pulled off the same feat. That’s as long as Flagg is playing. If not, then it’s anyone’s game. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Alabama</strong> are battled-tested playing in the rugged SEC. The Crimson Tide play at an uncomfortable pace for their opponents and they have veteran guard play. Mark Sears can be streaky but the kid has proven to be a gamer. Bama rank fourth in adjusted offense and 32nd in adjusted defense in the country. If they can tighten up on the defensive end I like them to cut down the nets in San Antonio. <strong>NL</strong></p> <p><strong>Duke</strong> have the star power of Flagg – if he’s healthy – but more importantly, they have a strong system and the depth to back it up. Meanwhile, I question the strength of their competition: No 1 overall seed Auburn have a lack of experience in winning a national championship and may struggle to perform under the tournament’s intense pressure, and Houston are missing key quality wins and depth due to injuries to some of their crucial players. <strong>TR</strong></p> <h2>The women’s champion will be ...</h2> <p><strong>South Carolina </strong>will win their third national title in four years – and fourth in eight – because coach Dawn Staley still patrols the sidelines. Although they are a No 1 seed, the Gamecocks have lost three games this year, or three more than in each of the last two years entering the tournament. But the Gamecocks are deep, tough and experienced, and Staley is the best, not to mention the most intense and audacious, coach in the women’s game. <strong>DC</strong></p> <p><strong>UConn</strong>. Despite other teams trying to paint themselves as the underdog, Connecticut truly fit the bill in a few key ways. Though the Huskies have reached at least the Final Four every year since, their last championship win came in the 2015-16 season. This year, however, everything seems to be aligning in their favor. Bueckers is headed to the WNBA, Fudd may join her, whil Aubrey Griffin could hear her name called in the second round. The team is healthier than they’ve been in years and has fought its way out of a midseason slump that once seemed endless. <strong>SK</strong></p> <p><strong>Southern California</strong>. Rarely does a freshman carry their team to a national championship (Carmelo Anthony being one notable exception). JuJu Watkins was close last year, and that experience seems to have fueled her, as she’s taken her game to another level. The Trojans enter the tournament with a 28-3 record, still feeling like they have something to prove. Watkins makes her case for the best player in the country as she leads USC to the school’s first national title since 1984. <strong>NL</strong></p> <p><strong>UConn</strong>. The storyline of Bueckers returning for her fifth year with a national championship in mind has been drilled into her teammates, coaches and the press for a while now – it would be foolish for them not to take it seriously. The Huskies’ three in-season losses were either close or were due to issues that have been addressed and ironed out. They play true team basketball, and while most teams are tightening their rotations at this stage, UConn are actually adding depth with previously injured players like Griffin, Fudd, Ice Brady and Caroline Ducharme now healthy and ready to contribute. If they can remain healthy and mentally strong, UConn should regain their status as the strongest women’s college program in the land. <strong>TR</strong></p> <p><br></p>
