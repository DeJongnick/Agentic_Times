<p>Delegates at the UN plastic pollution treaty talks in Geneva must secure an ambitious global agreement so they can look future generations in the eye, one of the world’s leading marine litter experts has said.</p> 
<p>Prof Richard Thompson, who was named <a href="https://time.com/collections/100-most-influential-people-2025/7273764/richard-thompson/">one of Time’s 100 most influential people this year</a> for his groundbreaking work on plastic pollution, said decisive action was needed to protect human health and the planet.</p> 
<p>He spoke as delegates from more than 170 countries prepared <a href="https://www.unep.org/inc-plastic-pollution/session-5.2">to meet in Geneva</a> to bridge what have become deep divisions over whether limits on plastic production are included in a final treaty.</p> 
<p>Last November, talks in Busan, South Korea, to secure a global treaty to end plastic pollution <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/dec/02/countries-call-for-binding-targets-to-cut-plastic-production-busan-talks">broke down without agreement.</a> More than <a href="https://www.bridgetobusan.com/ppp">100 countries</a> support legally binding global reductions in plastic production and the phasing out of certain chemicals and single-use plastic products.</p> 
<p>But nations with large fossil fuel industries such as Saudi Arabia, China, Russia and Iran oppose restrictions on plastic production, and are pushing for an agreement focused on better management and recycling of waste. The US under President Biden and now President Trump has <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/08/01/trump-admin-tight-lipped-ahead-of-plastic-treaty-talks-00488370">indicated it is</a> more supportive of a lower ambition treaty which does not include production cuts.</p> 
<p>The scale of plastic production and its threat to public health and the environment was underlined once more on Monday when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/03/world-in-15tn-plastics-crisis-hitting-health-from-infancy-to-old-age-report-warns">a new report </a>warned that the world is in a “plastics crisis” which is causing disease and death from infancy to old age and is responsible for at least $1.5tn (£1.1tn) a year in health-related damages.</p> 
<p>The huge acceleration of plastic production, which has increased by more than 200 times since 1950 and is expected to almost triple again to more than a billion tonnes a year by 2060, has been fuelled largely by surges in the production of single-use plastics, the majority of which are used <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266701002400218X">for packaging, drink and food containers.</a></p> 
<p>Thompson, head of the <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/marine-litter">international marine litter research unit </a>at Plymouth University, first identified and coined the phrase microplastics to describe how tiny bits of plastic accumulate in marine environments. Attending the Geneva talks <a href="https://ikhapp.org/scientistscoalition/">as coordinator of the scientists coalition</a> for an effective plastics treaty, he said an ambitious treaty would be a gamechanger for the planet and future generations.</p> 
<p>“It is now clear that plastic pollution contaminates our planet from the poles to the equator,” he said. “We find microplastics in our deepest oceans and our highest mountains. There is evidence of human exposure to them from the womb, throughout our entire lifetime.</p> 
<p>“It is really clear to protect future generations we need to take decisive action now on a treaty to address plastic pollution. So I really hope negotiators can look the next generation in the eye and say they acted decisively.”</p> 
<p>If agreed, a global plastics treaty would be an international, legally binding agreement designed to end plastic pollution by setting targets that nations would need to meet to try to end the 11m tonnes of plastic pollution that are dumped in the ocean every year.</p> 
<p>But since 2022, when the UN <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/02/world-leaders-agree-draw-up-historic-treaty-plastic-waste">first secured an agreement</a> from 173 countries to develop a legally binding treaty to cut plastic pollution, five separate negotiations have failed to secure a final text to sign.</p> 
<p>The initial agreement <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/apr/23/world-must-come-together-to-tackle-plastic-pollution-says-chair-of-un-talks">was for a treaty to address the whole life cycle of plastics.</a> But increasing numbers of plastics industry lobbyists have attended each round of talks to push back against production cuts.</p> 
<p>In Busan last year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/nov/27/plastic-lobbyists-biggest-group-un-treaty-talks-busan-korea">220 fossil fuel and chemical industry</a> representatives – more plastic producers than ever – were represented, including 16 lobbyists from the plastics industry attending as part of country delegations.</p>

<p>“There are those countries that consider the economic threat because their business-as-usual is threatened by this,” said Thompson. “But the mandate that brings negotiators from 170 countries to Geneva this week sets out that plastic pollution is harmful. It is really clear that business-as-usual is not sustainable.”</p> 
<p>Globally only 9% of plastic produced is recycled, and Thompson, whose work directly led to the ban on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-microbeads-ban-comes-into-force">microbeads in cosmetic products in the UK</a>, said the evidence showed that plastic production needed to be reduced to tackle plastic pollution.</p> 
<p>He said a treaty needed to ensure only plastic that was essential to society was produced, the thousands of chemicals used in plastic were reduced, and that all the plastic produced in future was sustainable, which involved moving to reuse and a circular economy in plastic.</p> 
<p>All of that, he said, would effectively reduce the amount of plastic produced globally.</p> 
<p>Graham Forbes, Greenpeace’s head of delegation to the treaty negotiations,<strong> </strong>said the science, the moral imperative and the economics were clear. “Uncontrolled plastic production is a death sentence. The only way to end plastic pollution is to stop making so much plastic.</p> 
<p>“World leaders must seize the opportunity in Geneva, stand up to the fossil fuel industry and take humanity’s first step towards ending the plastics crisis and create a healthier, safer future for all.”</p>
