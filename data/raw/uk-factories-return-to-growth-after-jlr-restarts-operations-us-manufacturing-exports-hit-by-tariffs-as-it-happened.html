It will be interesting to see if the BOE downgrades its CPI forecast due to this, since inflation never reached its peak of 4%.</p> <p>Will the Bank instead say that price growth will moderate from here and reach the target 2% rate before 2027? If yes, then this could give the green light for a rate cut in February. If the BOE does err on the dovish side without cutting rates this week, then the downside for the pound could be limited, due to recent weakness in sterling and the sharp decline in UK Gilt yields.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Simon French</strong>, chief economist at <strong>Panmure</strong> <strong>Gordon</strong>, says Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will want to see Rachel Reeves’s budget later this month, before deciding to ease monetary policy:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>Inflation expectations amongst businesses and households remain elevated. The price level outlook heading into next year will hinge, in large part, on Budget decisions on 26 November.</p> <p>The option cost for the MPC of waiting to their December meeting - and a degree of fiscal clarity that will then be available - is low. The prize for the UK government of translating its encouraging talk on controlling inflation into Budget action is a path to up to 100bp of UK interest rate cuts in 2026, and a potential cyclical upswing.</p> <p>We remain unconvinced - and we suspect so do most of the MPC - that this Cabinet will resist the temptation to take well-meaning tax and regulatory actions that fuel further UK price rises.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-11-03T09:01:46.091Z">at 9.01am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-69086a4d8f081a1dc7fc0876" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-03T08:47:45.544Z">8.47am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Shares in Italian drinks maker Campari have fallen almost 3% tthis morning after Italian tax police seized €1.29bn worth of shares in the company, held by its controlling shareholder, following a tax evasion investigation.</strong></p> <p>On Friday police said they were seizing Campari shares held by its controlling company <strong>Lagfin</strong> after a probe found €5.3bn of allegedly undeclared capital gains.</p> <p>Prosecutors claim <strong>Lagfin</strong> failed to pay a tax levied on firms that transfer their fiscal residence abroad, after it absorbed an Italian subsidiary that held Campari’s controlling stake. </p> <p>Prosecutors say the reorganization effectively shifted the group’s management and tax base overseas, triggering the disputed liability.</p> <p>Lagfin denied any wrongdoing.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-690866838f08e3e3851d278a" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-11-03T08:28:37.257Z">8.28am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Student accommodation provider Empiric has reported a drop in bookings from students from China.</strong></p> <p><strong>Empiric Student Property</strong>, which is currently being taken over by rival Unite Group, told shareholders this morning that its occupancy levels have dropped to 89% at the start of this academic year, compared with 95% in October 2024.</p> <p>Unless current conditions change, delivering the company’s occupancy target for this academic year will be “challenging”, it says.</p> <p><strong>Duncan Garrood, </strong>chief executive officer of <strong>Empiric, </strong>explains:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“The booking cycle for academic year 2025/26 has seen an increase in reservations from UK students and a reduction in the number of Chinese students staying with us, potentially the result of geopolitical events.</p> <p>Rental growth remains in line with guidance and we are well positioned for January sales activity.

class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.</strong></p> <p>The oil price is rising after the world’s biggest oil producers agreed to pause their planned oil production hikes in the first months of next year, to assuage fears that the global market may become oversupplied with crude.</p> <p>At a meeting of the <strong>Organization</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>Petroleum</strong> <strong>Exporting</strong> <strong>Countries</strong> <strong>(Opec)</strong> and its allies on Sunday, led by Saudi Arabia and <a href="https://www.ft.com/russia">Russia</a>, energy ministers agreed to nudge the cartel’s exports up by 137,000 barrels a day in December, before halting any further rises in January, February and March.</p> <p>The decision marks a change of policy from the eight-strong group which has increased its production quota by almost 3m barrels of crude a day over the past year. The group has opted to slow its growth in recent months to avoid a collapse in oil prices amid growing concerns of a market oversupply.</p> <p>“OPEC+ is blinking — but it’s a calculated blink,” said <strong>Jorge</strong> <strong>Leon</strong> from <strong>Rystad</strong>, adding:</p> <blockquote class="quoted"> <p>“Sanctions on Russian producers have injected a new layer of uncertainty into supply forecasts, and the group knows that overproducing now could backfire later.”</p> </blockquote> <p>This morning, Brent crude has gained 0.75% to $65.25 per barrel, with US crude up a similar amount to $61.44 per barrel.</p> <p>Oil prices fell to a five-month low of about $60 a barrel on 20 October on concerns that a glut was building in the market - but prices then recovered following a raft of sanctions against Russian oil barrels and a thawing of trade relations between the US and China.</p> <h2>The agenda</h2> <ul> <li><p>9am GMT: Eurozone manufacturing PMI for October</p></li> <li><p>9.30am GMT: UK manufacturing PMI for October</p></li> <li><p>9.30am GMT: UK public sector productivity statistics</p></li> <li><p>2.45pm GMT: US manufacturing PMI for October</p></li> </ul> </div>   </div>
