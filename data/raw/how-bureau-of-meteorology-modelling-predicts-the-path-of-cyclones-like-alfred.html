<p>As residents in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/04/tropical-cyclone-alfred-intensifies-as-latest-forecast-predicts-landfall-just-north-of-brisbane">wait for Tropical Cyclone Alfred’s next move</a>, the Bureau of Meteorology’s regular <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDQ65002.shtml">“track map”</a> will be a source of information for many.</p> <p>But behind the snaking track lines and coloured blobs on the map are more than a hundred scenarios from different computer models that are trying to work out how the system will react to what’s happening in the atmosphere and ocean.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>So how do cyclones move and how does all this complexity distill down into a map that can warn millions of people of what’s to come?</p>  <h2>How does the Bureau of Meteorology create the track maps for Cyclone Alfred?</h2>  <p>BoM senior meteorologist Dean Narramore has been part of a team working over the past 11 days to produce <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/index.shtml">updated maps of Cyclone Alfred</a>.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/04/tropical-cyclone-alfred-queensland-brisbane-update-landfall-direction-bom-weather-forecast">‘Be prepared’: Tropical Cyclone Alfred changes direction and heads towards Queensland coast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A new map is issued after the bureau’s cyclone team has looked at the output of models from Europe, the US, Japan and Australia’s model – the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator.</p> <p>“When you look at all the model runs there can be 100 to 150 different tracks. It looks a bit like spaghetti,” Narramore says.</p>    <p>Early in Alfred’s life, Narramore says the modelled tracks were “all over the place” but earlier in the week – even though the models are slightly different – they began to align.</p> <p>“When all the lines start to come together into a consistent pattern, that gives us more confidence. So then it’s still like spaghetti, but now you’re holding it in your hand.”</p> <p>The bureau starts issuing a track map every three hours once a tropical cyclone warning is issued – a warning triggered when gale-force winds above 63 km/h are expected within 24 hours. Now that the cyclone is closer to the coast and within reach of the bureau’s radars, the maps are being updated hourly.</p> <h2>What forces are trying to steer Cyclone Alfred?</h2>  <p>Before Tuesday, winds in the upper part of the atmosphere were pushing Tropical Cyclone Alfred south-east from where it formed in the Coral Sea at the end of February.</p> <p>Dr Hamish Ramsay, a cyclone expert at the CSIRO, says the direction a cyclone moves in is dictated by something called the “steering flow” – the prevailing winds between 2km and 10km up in the atmosphere.</p> <p>Ramsay says it is not unusual for cyclones to track so far south – but it is unusual for them to make landfall so far down.</p>    <p>That’s because a cyclone level with the south-east Queensland coast isinfluenced by mid-latitude weather systems that are usually blowing towards the east, taking most systems away from Australia.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Alfred moved into an area where the “steering flow” was going west – thanks to an area of high pressure over the Tasman Sea.</p> <h2>What intensity will Cyclone Alfred be when it hits?</h2>  <p>The track maps also include the expected intensity of the cyclone, which relates to the wind speeds they produce.</p> <p>But Ramsay says the category of a cyclone does not necessarily reflect how damaging it could be.</p> <p>Alfred was forecast to move over an area of unusually warm ocean surface, giving more energy to the system in terms of the rain it could produce.</p> <p>If the cyclone slows down as it approaches the coast, this would also mean higher rainfall.</p> <p>“The highest mortality from tropical cyclones is associated with the rainfall,” he said. “Wind speed in this instance might not be the most damaging.”</p> <h2>What should people be looking for?</h2>  <p>The bureau’s track maps show the likely route for the cyclone and the areas that will be hit by destructive winds.</p> <p>In the southern hemisphere when a cyclone is moving west, areas to the south of a cyclone’s centre experience the worst of the weather.</p> <p>Narramore says a very large area is likely to experience gale force winds hundreds of kilometres away from where the cyclone makes landfall, including the Sunshine Coast, Brisbane, Gold Coast and northern NSW.</p> <p>The timing of the landfall could also be critical to the coastal damage from waves and inundation.</p> <p>If the cyclone strikes at high tide, this could add a further metre to the expected tide, with the damaging waves adding even further height.</p> <p>“A few hours can make a big difference,” he said.</p>  <p><strong>Read more of Guardian Australia’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tropical-cyclone-alfred"> Tropical Cyclone Alfred</a> coverage:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2025/mar/07/tropical-cyclone-alfred-live-updates-wind-rain-category-2-storm-south-east-queensland-northern-nsw">Tropical Cyclone Alfred LIVE: latest news and updates</a></p></li> <li><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/07/tropical-cyclone-alfred-what-we-know-so-far-school-closures-landfall-bom-weather-forecast-path-tracker-qld-nsw">When and where will the cyclone hit?

An earlier version said that in the southern hemisphere, areas south of a cyclone’s centre experience the worst weather. This text was clarified to state that this is only the case if a cyclone is moving to the west.</p>
