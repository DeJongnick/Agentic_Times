<p>The Meta CEO, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, presented new augmented reality glasses at the company’s annual developer conference on Wednesday, debuting a prototype of the next phase in its expansion into smart eyewear. Zuckerberg also announced that Meta AI will be able to talk in the voice of Dame Judi Dench.</p> <p>The glasses, named Orion, have the ability to project digital representations of media, people, games and communications on to the real world. Meta and Zuckerberg have framed the product as a step away from desktop computers and smartphone into eyewear that can perform similar tasks.</p> <p>“A lot of people have said this is the craziest technology they’ve ever seen,” Zuckerberg boasted during his keynote speech, clad in a shirt that read “Aut Zuck aut nihil”, Latin for “Either Zuck or nothing”, substituting his own name into a motto associated with the Roman leader Julius Caesar. A pre-recorded demonstration showed some of the glasses’ capabilities, including two people playing a virtual Pong game and talking on a video chat through augmented reality.</p> <p>Meta also expanded its bet on artificial intelligence, announcing a raft of new product offerings for its ChatGPT-like chatbot and plans to start automatically injecting personalized images created by the bot into people’s Facebook and Instagram feeds, as it kicked off its annual Connect conference at its California headquarters on Wednesday.</p> <p>Among the AI updates announced was an audio upgrade to the digital assistant, called Meta AI, which will now respond to voice commands and offer users the option to make the assistant sound like celebrities including Judi Dench, John Cena, Keegan-Michael Key, Kristen Bell and Awkwafina.</p> <p>“I think that voice is going to be a way more natural way of interacting with AI than text,” Zuckerberg said.</p> <p>The company said more than 400 million people were using Meta AI monthly, including 185 million who were returning to it weekly.</p> <p>The Facebook owner also debuted an entry-level version of its Quest line of mixed-reality headsets, the Quest 3S, and is expected to preview its first augmented-reality glasses and announce updates to its existing virtual reality and AI products.</p> <p>In keeping with its strategy of sharing the AI models powering its digital agent for free use by others, Meta released three new versions of its Llama 3 models. Two of the models are multimodal, meaning they can understand both images and text, while the third is a basic text-only model capable of running entirely on a user’s device, a key privacy advantage.</p> <p>The augmented-reality reveal is a long time in the making for Zuckerberg, who positioned AR technology as a sort of magnum opus when he first pivoted the world’s biggest social media company toward building immersive “metaverse” systems in 2021. However, Meta has struggled to overcome technical challenges with its AR project since then, prompting the head of the company’s metaverse-oriented Reality Labs division to acknowledge last year that a product it could viably bring to market was “still a few years away – a few, to put it lightly”.</p> <p>The company has been plowing tens of billions of dollars into its investments in artificial intelligence, augmented reality and other metaverse technologies, driving up its capital expense forecast for 2024 to a record high of between $37bn and $40bn.</p> <p>The social media giant is planning for the first generation of the AR glasses this year to be distributed only internally and to a select group of developers, with each device costing tens of thousands of dollars to produce, according to a source familiar with the project.</p> <p>Meta aims to ship its first commercial AR glasses to consumers in 2027, by which point technical breakthroughs should bring down the cost of production, the source said. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss company plans. Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the plans.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jul/23/meta-launches-open-source-ai-app-competitive-with-closed-rivals">Meta launches open-source AI app ‘competitive’ with closed rivals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the meantime, Meta has leaned in to an unexpected interim success on the road to AR with its camera-equipped Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Riding a wave of excitement around emerging generative AI technology, the company announced at last year’s Connect conference that it was adding an AI-powered digital assistant to the glasses, turning a once-forgotten device into the most popular AI wearable on the market. Although Meta has not disclosed sales numbers for the smart glasses, the CEO of the Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica said this summer that more of the new generation sold in a few months than the old ones did in two years. The market research firm IDC estimates that more than 700,000 pairs of the glasses have shipped since the update last year. Meta recently extended its partnership with EssilorLuxottica and contemplated a possible investment in the eyewear company, prompting speculation that the AR glasses may also bear the Ray-Ban name. More immediately, Meta’s plan for the smart glasses includes plans for a next generation that will feature a viewfinder capable of displaying basic text and images through the lenses.</p> <p>It has been shipping software updates this year enhancing the AI assistant’s capabilities on the existing glasses, including an update in April that enabled the agent to identify and converse about objects seen by the wearer.</p> <p>Scheduled to hit shelves on 15 October, the Quest 3S headset will be offered in two storage capacity sizes, the smaller one priced at $299.99 and the other at $399.99.</p> <p>With the launch, the company is discontinuing its older Quest 2 and high-end Quest Pro devices, while also dropping the price of the more powerful Quest 3 it introduced last year from $649.99 to $499.99.</p>
