<p>Good morning.</p> <p>Elon Musk has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/trump-elon-musk-fallout">called for Donald Trump’s impeachment</a> and in effect claimed the president was part of Jeffrey Epstein’s alleged child sexual abuse ring in an extraordinary social media blow-up between the former allies on Thursday.</p> <p>Trump did not hold back either, threatening to end federal contracts and tax subsidies for the billionaire’s companies as the feud that had been brewing flared up on their respective social media platforms.</p> <p>In the saga’s most explosive movement, Musk tweeted: “Time to drop the really big bomb: Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!” The post followed Trump threatening to cut subsidies for Musk’s companies as it would save “billions”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>What is the origin of the feud?</strong> Tensions have been mounting for weeks over a Republican spending bill that Musk has criticised.</p></li> <li><p><strong>How is it affecting Musk’s bottom line?</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jun/05/tesla-share-drop-trump-musk-feud">Tesla’s shares plunged by about 14.2%</a><strong> </strong>on Thursday at market close after the pair traded barbs.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Rubio imposes sanctions on four ICC judges for ‘targeting’ US and Israel</strong></h2>    <p>The US is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/marco-rubio-sanctions-icc-judges-israel-gaza">imposing sanctions on four judges from the international criminal court (ICC)</a> for what it has termed its “illegitimate actions” against the US and Israel, the secretary of state has announced.</p> <p>Marco Rubio announced the sanctions against Solomy Balungi Bossa of Uganda, Luz del Carmen Ibáñez Carranza of Peru, Reine Adélaïde Sophie Alapini-Gansou of Benin and Beti Hohler of Slovenia on Thursday after Donald Trump instructed cabinet officials to devise sanctions against the court.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Why were these judges targeted?</strong> Two of the judges authorized the arrest warrants against the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the former defense minister Yoav Gallant, while the other two authorized an ICC investigation into abuses by US personnel in Afghanistan.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Has the US targeted others before?</strong> Yes – it passed sanctions on the ICC’s chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, after he pursued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant. As a result, Khan has lost access to his email and had his bank accounts frozen, the Associated Press reported.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Judge blocks Trump’s ban on Harvard’s international students from entering the US</strong></h2>    <p>A district judge in Boston has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2025/jun/05/harvard-trump-foreign-student-ban">blocked the Trump administration’s ban</a> on Harvard’s foreign students from entering the US after the university argued it had violated federal law.</p> <p>The Ivy League school argued that the administration failed to back up the president’s claims that the students posed a threat to national security and asked Judge Allison Burroughs to block the ban.</p> <p>The filing also argued that the administration’s national security argument was unsound as, under the ban, the same people were able to still enter the country – just not attend Harvard.</p> <p>The development came while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/chinese-students-visa-ban-trump-international-study">hundreds of thousands of Chinese students</a> in the US struggled with an uncertain future after the state department said last week that it would “aggressively” revoke visas for Chinese students.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Why did Trump ban Harvard from accepting international students?</strong> The White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson has called Harvard “a hotbed of anti-American, antisemitic, pro-terrorist agitators”, claims the school denies. Harvard argues Trump is angry because it has refused to give in to the administration’s demands to shape the school’s governance, curriculum and theideology of staff and students.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>In other news …</strong></h2>    <ul> <li><p><strong>Russia’s overnight missile and drone barrage on Kyiv overnight killed four people</strong> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/06/russia-mounts-deadly-barrage-of-kyiv-after-vowing-revenge-for-ukraine-attack-on-bomber-fleet">after Vladimir Putin vowed revenge</a> for Ukraine’s attack on its bomber fleet.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The IDF has recovered the bodies of two Israeli-American hostages in their 70s</strong> who were abducted during Hamas’s 7 October attack, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/05/israel-recovers-bodies-two-israeli-american-hostages-7-october-attack-judih-weinstein-gad-haggai">in an overnight operation in southern Gaza.</a></p></li> <li><p><strong>El Salvador is using emergency gang violence legislation to seize land </strong>that was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/jun/06/el-salvador-emergency-gang-violence-laws-seize-land-eviction">granted to people</a> after the country’s civil war.</p></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Stat of the day: University of Michigan paid undercover investigators at least $800,000 to surveil students involved in </strong><strong> </strong><strong> Gaza protests</strong></h2>    <p>The University of Michigan is <a href="https://www.theguardian.co.uk/us-news/2025/jun/06/michigan-university-gaza-surveillance">using private, undercover investigators to surveil pro-Palestinian campus</a> groups, the Guardian can reveal, with the records from the school’s governing body showing that the university paid at least $800,000 between June 2023 and September 2024 to Ameri-Shield, the parent company of the private security group City Shield. Five students who have been followed, recorded or eavesdropped on said it appeared largely to be an intimidation tactic.</p> <h2><strong>Don’t miss this: Death is not the end! – how posthumanism is having a movie moment</strong></h2>    <p>Disneyland recently announced an animatronic recreation of Walt Disney, intended to give visitors a sense of “what it would have been like to be in Walt’s presence”, earning a rebuke from his granddaughter Joanna Miller. Long a fascination for cinema, posthumanism is starting to feel worryingly current, <a href="https://www.theguardian.co.uk/film/2025/jun/06/death-is-not-the-end-from-the-new-robot-walt-disney-to-mountainhead-movies-are-fuelled-by-immortality">writes Stuart Heritage, after experts this year</a> voiced concerns about Neuralink, Elon Musk’s brain implant company.</p> <h2><strong>Climate check: The Swiss village buried by a glacier collapse</strong></h2>    <p>When a Swiss village was wiped out in seconds after a glacier collapsed above it on 28 May, attention turned to why it happened – and how global heating will make such events more common. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2025/jun/06/the-swiss-village-buried-by-a-glacier-collapse-podcast">This podcast tells the shocking story</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Last Thing: Spanish police’s plea for respect backfires over photo of older women alfresco</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/PoliciaLocalSF/status/1927364166630944813">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">Sabemos que sacar sillas o mesas a la puerta es tradición en muchos pueblos, pero la vía pública está regulada.

The move violated the silent Spanish injunction that forbids any attempts to alter the habits of the country’s cherished older people – particularly given the long tradition of the outdoor sit-down chat as the heat of the day gives way to the cool of the evening, known as <em>tomando el fresco</em>, or taking the cool air. The social media response was full of force and sarcasm. One typical example: “We need to put an end to this serious issue – no more impunity for grannies who sit out to enjoy the fresh air.”</p> <h2><strong>Sign up</strong></h2>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="Sign up for the US morning briefing">  <iframe src="https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4300" height="52px" data-form-title="A different kind of daily email" data-form-description="Sign up and get a daily US news briefing from the Guardian" scrolling="no" seamless frameborder="0" class="iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article" data-form-success-desc="Thanks, you'll start getting the US morning briefing soon."></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up for the US morning briefing</figcaption> </figure>  <p>First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.
