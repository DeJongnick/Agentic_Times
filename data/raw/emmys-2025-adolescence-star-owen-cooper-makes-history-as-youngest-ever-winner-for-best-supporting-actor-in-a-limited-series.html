<p>Fifteen-year-old Adolescence star Owen Cooper has made history as the youngest ever actor to win the Emmy for best supporting actor in a limited series.</p> <p>The actor was just 14 when Adolescence was filmed and the show is his first professional credit. Cooper played Jamie, a teenage boy arrested for the murder of a female classmate.</p> <p>The series earned a whopping 140m views in its first three months on Netflix, with each episode filmed in one continuous take. The show sparked a global conversation about the relationship between online “incel” culture and real-world harm.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/25/adolescence-the-backlash-the-nightmare-of-making-hit-tv-in-terrifying-times">Adolescence, the backlash: the nightmare of making hit TV in terrifying times</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Honestly, when I started these drama classes a couple years back, I didn’t expect to be even in the United States, never mind here,” Cooper said on stage.</p> <p>He thanked his family, as well as his co-star and the show’s co-creator, actor Stephen Graham: “It may have my name on this award, but it really belongs to the people behind the camera and Stephen and … all the cast.”</p> <p>Cooper is one of the youngest ever Emmy winners: the record is held by actor Roxana Zal, who was 14 years old in 1984 when she won for her role in the television movie Something About Amelia.</p> <p>Cooper was up against his Adolescence co-star Ashley Walters, Javier Bardem for Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, Bill Camp and Peter Sarsgaard for Presumed Innocent and Rob Delaney for Dying for Sex.</p> <p>Before the ceremony, Cooper had spoken about his wish to meet fellow Emmy nominee Jake Gyllenhaal. On the red carpet, the actor surprised Cooper with a gift – a “lucky duck”, to match one a friend of Gyllenhaal’s sent him when he was nominated for an Oscar for Brokeback Mountain.</p> <p>“It’s just a ‘lucky duck’ to keep in your pocket,” Gyllenhaal said. “To give you a little bit of luck.”</p> <p>At Sunday’s ceremony, Adolescence also won best limited series, best directing, best writing, best actor in a limited series for Graham, who plays Jamie’s father Eddie; and best supporting actress in a limited series for Erin Doherty, who plays the forensic psychologist who evaluates Jamie in a youth detention facility.</p> <p>“We never expected our little program to have such a big impact,” said Graham, while accepting the Emmy for writing with his co-creator and writer Jack Thorne.</p>
