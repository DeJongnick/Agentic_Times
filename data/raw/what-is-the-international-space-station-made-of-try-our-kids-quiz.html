    <h2 class="quiz__correct-answers-title">Solutions</h2>
    <p class="quiz__correct-answers">1:D - The ISS is made of lightweight metals including aluminium and stainless steel, and is wrapped in a blanket of Kevlar and other hi-tech fabric. Kevlar, also used to make bulletproof vests, shields the humans inside from things floating in space, like bits of satellite and tiny meteoroids. The blanket also stops the ISS getting super hot or super cold in space., 2:A - As far as we know, English kings don’t eat their dinner plates. Though Henry VIII did eat a lot – even peacocks and swans., 3:C - A dentist named William Morrison made the first cotton candy, or candy floss, in 1897 with the help of a sweet maker. It’s got lots of sugar, but eating it occasionally is OK. The dentist called it “fairy floss”., 4:B - Hummingbird beaks aren’t used like a straw; the birds lap up nectar with their tongues super quickly when they feed., 5:D - Marshmallows are mainly sugar, syrup, vanilla, air and a jelly-like substance called gelatin. You can make them with a grownup – you’ll need eggs, sugar and a few other things depending on the recipe you choose.</p>
