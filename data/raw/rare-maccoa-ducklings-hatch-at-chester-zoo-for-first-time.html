<p>Chester zoo has successfully hatched one of Africa’s rarest species of duck for the first time.</p> <p>It said the successful breeding of four maccoa ducklings formed part of growing efforts to safeguard Africa’s most threatened species.</p> <p>The maccoa population in the wild is estimated to be 5,000, and recent surveys found only 14 in Kenya and fewer than 100 in Tanzania.</p> <p>The ducklings are in Chester zoo’s Heart of Africa zone, a 22.5-acre habitat supporting endangered African species. The habitat is home to 57 species of animals including giraffes, zebras and ostriches.</p> <p>Andrew Owen, the head of birds at Chester zoo, said: “These ducklings are very special as they’re the first of their kind to ever hatch here at the zoo, making it a really historic moment for our team.</p> <p>“This success gives a real boost to the future of the species and these vital new additions will contribute to the safety-net population in zoos. These birds are facing rapid decline in the wild, so every hatchling really does count.”</p> <p>The zoo is one of only seven in Europe, and 12 globally, that care for the ducks and it hopes to play a vital role in their survival.</p> <p>Maccoa ducks are found in nutrient-rich freshwater wetland and lakes. They can be seen diving for food and are known for their stiff tails and deep-blue bills.</p> <p>They are listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list of threatened species. Water pollution and climate change has led to their habitats degrading and the species’ rapid decline.</p> <p>Bird conservationists at the zoo say their successful hatchings will help the long-term protection of the ducks.</p>
