<h2>England</h2> <p><strong>Hannah Hampton</strong> Made a good save to deny James in the first half. Good distribution out from the back but one pass straight to Fishlock. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Lucy Bronze</strong> Full of running and instrumental down the right. Quality delivery to Beever-Jones for England’s fifth. Caught high for Wales’s consolation. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Leah Williamson</strong> Led from the back. A few nerves early on but settled. Didn’t have to deal with much in the box. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Jess Carter</strong> Superb performance at the heart of defence. When England did get caught high, she was there to mop everything up. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Alex Greenwood</strong> Thriving back in the position where she started her career. Got caught high on occasion but supported attack with vigour. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Keira Walsh</strong> Controlled the central area brilliantly and pushed high, particularly in the first half. Given space to operate. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Georgia Stanway</strong> Tireless performance that set the tempo of England’s play. Won and scored the penalty. Influential on and off the ball throughout. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Ella Toone</strong> Back to her best for England – she was everywhere. A goal and two assists to her name. <strong>9</strong></p> <p><strong>Lauren James</strong> Played with freedom on the right. Trickery and patience on the ball undid Wales. Involvement in two goals. <strong>8</strong></p> <p><strong>Alessia Russo</strong> Opened her account with an instinctive close-range finish. Battled well to win the ball for Toone’s finish. Could have had more. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Lauren Hemp</strong> A constant outlet down England’s left. Pace troubled Esther Morgan. First goal in an England shirt since returning from injury. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Substitutes</strong></p> <p><strong>Jess Park</strong> First European Championship appearance, almost scored – couldn’t keep up with Cain for goal. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Beth Mead</strong> Superb cameo performance. Well-taken goal and brilliant assist in second-half showing. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Chloe Kelly</strong> Added energy to attack. Had a couple of good chances that couldn’t put them away. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Aggie Beever-Jones</strong> Special moment as she scored her first goal at a major tournament with a well-taken header. Assisted Mead. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Niamh Charles</strong> A 12-minute cameo. Clever ball into Mead to set up England’s sixth. <strong>6</strong></p>    <h2>Wales</h2> <p><strong>Olivia Clark</strong> Not really at fault for any of England’s goals but struggled to contain them aerially. Distribution solid. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Esther Morgan</strong> Struggled to handle Hemp. Failed to track her run for England’s third. Youngster a bit out of her depth. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Rhiannon Roberts</strong> Experienced player but could not handle England’s forwards. Missed tackles for Toone’s and Mead’s goals. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Gemma Evans</strong> Often Wales’s last line of defence. Solid in the first half but partially at fault for England’s fifth. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Lily Woodham</strong> Could not handle James and Toone who were running rings around her in the first half. Hooked at half-time. <strong>4</strong></p> <p><strong>Rachel Rowe</strong> Industrious, terrier-like performance at the heart of the midfield. Sweetly struck opportunity at a corner flew over. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Angharad James</strong> Captain worked diligently in midfield but couldn’t put her stamp on the game. Wales’s best chance before the break. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Carrie Jones</strong> Failed to influence the game down the right and provided little cover for Morgan in handling Hemp. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Jess Fishlock</strong> Led by example. Forced turnovers. Good chance before the break. Superb assist for Cain’s goal. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Ceri Holland</strong> A constant ball of energy. Chased down everything but was getting little support from those around her. <strong>5</strong></p> <p><strong>Ffion Morgan</strong> Never stopped running. Lack of service forced her to drop deeper. Showed her pace with a couple of breaks. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Substitutes</strong></p> <p><strong>Josie Green</strong> Came on at right-back to solidify defence. Added much-needed experience. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Hayley Ladd</strong> Replaced tiring legs in central midfield. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Hannah Cain</strong> Added directness. Well-struck finish for Wales’s goal – her first at a European Championship. <strong>7</strong></p> <p><strong>Elise Hughes</strong> Came on too late to have any real impact. <strong>6</strong></p> <p><strong>Kayleigh Barton</strong> Another late cameo. <strong>6</strong></p>
