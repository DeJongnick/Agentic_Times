<h2><strong>Liaqat on Karim</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>What were you hoping for?</strong><br>Good conversation and some honesty. I hadn’t been on a date for 10 years and&nbsp;felt I needed to break the mould. I’m glad I told Karim about that as I&nbsp;was nervous.</p> 
<p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br>So handsome! I couldn’t stop staring at&nbsp;his eyes (I was, of course, subtle).</p> 
<p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br>Being gay and coming out. Mental health. Gaza and the British press not&nbsp;reporting a live genocide.</p>

    <p>Blind date is Saturday’s dating column: every week, two strangers are paired up for dinner and drinks, and then spill the beans to us, answering a set of questions. This runs, with a photograph we take of each dater before the date, in Saturday magazine (in the UK) and online at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/blind-date">theguardian.com</a>&nbsp;every Saturday. It’s been running since 2009 – you can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/31/10-years-of-blind-date-weddings-babies-lost-knickers">read all about how we put it together here</a>.<br><br><b>What questions will I be asked?</b><br>We ask about age, location, occupation, hobbies, interests and the type of person you are looking to meet. If you do not think these questions cover everything you would like to know, tell us what’s on your mind.</p>
    <p><b>Can I choose who I match with?</b><br>No, it’s a blind date! But we do ask you a bit about your interests, preferences, etc – the more you tell us, the better the match is likely to be.</p>
    <p><b>Can I pick the photograph?</b><br>No, but don't worry: we'll choose the nicest ones.</p>
    <p><b>What personal details will appear?</b><br>Your first name, job and age.</p>
    <p><b>How should I answer?</b><br>Honestly but respectfully. Be mindful of how it will read to your date, and that Blind date reaches a large audience, in print and online.</p>
    <p><b>Will I see the other person’s answers?<br></b>No. We may edit yours and theirs for a range of reasons, including length, and we may ask you for more details.</p>
    <p><b>Will you find me The One?<br></b>We’ll try! Marriage! Babies!</p>
    <p><b>Can I do it in my home town?<br></b>Only if it’s in the UK. Many of our applicants live in London, but we would love to hear from people living elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Most awkward moment? </strong><br>I kept on insisting that Karim have a&nbsp;sizzling lamb chop to himself.</p> 
<p><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br>Lovely.</p> 
<p><strong>Best thing about Karim?</strong><br>He listened to everything I said and&nbsp;reciprocated. And that he’s an opera singer! </p>

<p><strong>Describe Karim in three words</strong><br>Kind, honest and intelligent.</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think Karim made of you?</strong><br>That I’m self-obsessed.</p> 
<p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong><br>There was good energy – but not romantic energy. </p> 
<p><strong>And … did you kiss?</strong><br>Drum roll … Nah. We did hug, though.</p> 
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</strong><br>It was all fab, although I may have talked about myself too much.</p> 
<p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong><br>8.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong><br>Probably as friends. I enjoyed his company.</p> 
<h2><strong>Karim on Liaqat</strong></h2> 
<p><strong>What were you hoping for?</strong><br>A good chat and a good laugh –anything more than that would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bonus. </p> 
<p><strong>First impressions?</strong><br>Affable and awkward – I noticed he&nbsp;wasn’t really looking at me.</p> 
<p><strong>What did you talk about?</strong><br>The geopolitics of India and Pakistan. Art exhibits and museums.</p> 
<p><strong>Most awkward moment? </strong><br>After I asked him what else he might want to know about me, he said, “I&nbsp;don’t really know,” and we had a&nbsp;long pause.</p> 
<p><strong>Good table manners?</strong><br>Yes.</p> 
<p><strong>Best thing about Liaqat?</strong><br>He’s open and self-aware.</p> 
<p><strong>Would you introduce Liaqat to your friends?</strong><br>Sure, why not?</p> 
<p><strong>Describe Liaqat in three words</strong><br>Searching, open and quirky (in a&nbsp;good&nbsp;way).</p> 
<p><strong>What do you think Liaqat made of you?</strong><br>No clue. He didn’t seem very curious.</p> 
<p><strong>Did you go on somewhere?</strong><br>We rode on the tube together for a&nbsp;few&nbsp;stops.</p> 
<p><strong>And … did you kiss?</strong><br>No.</p> 
<p><strong>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?</strong><br>We’re not a match, but he’s a lovely person and we had a good time, so I&nbsp;wouldn’t change anything.</p> 
<p><strong>Marks out of 10?</strong><br>I wanted a laugh and a good talk. Both&nbsp;were achieved. So, 10!</p> 
<p><strong>Would you meet again?</strong><br>As friends.</p>
