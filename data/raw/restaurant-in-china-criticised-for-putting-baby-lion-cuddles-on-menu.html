<p>A restaurant in northern China has been criticised by animal welfare groups for offering an unusual item on the menu: lion cub cuddles.</p> <p>According to a screenshot of a menu circulating on social media, Wanhui – a restaurant in Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi province – has a four-course set afternoon menu costing 1,192 yuan ($166/£124) that includes playtime with the in-house animals.</p> <p>The restaurant’s profile on Dazhong Dianping, a popular restaurant listings app, shows pictures of the lion cubs alongside other animals, such as deer and alligators.</p> <p>The menu on the Dianping page does not include lions in its list of animals but says customers can play with llamas, turtles and meerkats.</p> <p>Several photos show customers snuggling the baby lions.</p> <p>In one review posted this month, a customer sits with a lion cub on her lap, holding the its paw to wave to the camera.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/16/apple-us-mining-deal-magnets">Apple inks $500m deal for rare earth magnets with US mining firm </a> </p> </aside>  <p>The woman’s review reads: “I can pet a cute little lion in a small shop! 🦁 It’s called Simba, and looks so good. There are staff to guide you, so you don’t have to worry about safety issues!”</p> <p>While some influencers have jumped at the chance to post eye-catching photographs on social media, the reaction of Chinese people online has been mostly negative. “They’re putting profit above consumer safety – it’s way too dangerous,” wrote one Weibo user.</p> <p>Chinese media reported that the Shanxi forestry and grasslands bureau was investigating the matter, adding that this kind of human-animal contact was prohibited.</p> <p>Peter Li, a China policy expert for Humane World for Animals, told Reuters: “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it’s also potentially risky for customers.”</p> <p>It is not the first exotic animal welfare scandal in China. Last month, tourists visiting a zoo in Liaoning, in the north-east, were condemned for reaching through a metal grate to <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/environment/article/3313841/china-zoo-visitors-slammed-lucky-tiger-hair-pulling-warned-against-provoking-beast">pull tufts of hair off a tiger</a>.</p> <p>A hotel in Chongqing, a city in south-west China, recently attracted scorn for offering a “wake-up service” <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/environment/article/3315504/china-hotel-uses-red-panda-morning-calls-triggers-safety-concerns-service-suspension">delivered by red pandas</a>, which could climb into guests’ beds.</p> <p>Contact between humans and exotic animals has also been highlighted by experts as a potential risk for the spread of zoonotic diseases, such as Covid-19.</p> <p>Staff at Wanhui repeatedly hung up the phone when called by the Guardian.</p> <p>According to Reuters, the restaurant said the lion cubs were well cared for by specialist staff.</p> <p><em>Additional research by Lillian Yang</em></p>
