<p>Psychiatrists have a fundamental role to play in resolving the ongoing mental health crisis and it is disappointing to see that outdated and erroneous tropes about our work are still widely believed, even by other mental health professionals (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/10/we-need-person-centred-mental-health-care-not-more-psychiatrists">Letters, 10 October</a>).</p> <p>People who have a mental illness usually require a range of therapeutic approaches, including psychotherapy, social and occupational interventions, family work and medication. As doctors, psychiatrists take a holistic approach that recognises the complex interaction between psychological, social, cultural, environmental and biological factors, and the impact that these can have on mental health. This ensures that patients receive personalised care and treatment options as well as support from a variety of other services.</p> <p>Psychiatry has been at the forefront of developing the biopsychosocial model, which is routinely used in modern psychiatric practice to help people recover from all types of mental illness.</p> <p>It is vital now, more than ever before, that mental health professionals work together to build on this approach and address soaring demand so that we can deliver the best outcomes for our patients.<br><strong>Dr Lade Smith</strong><br><em>President, Royal College of Psychiatrists</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
