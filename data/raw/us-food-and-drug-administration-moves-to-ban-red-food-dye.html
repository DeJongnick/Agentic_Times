<p>A red <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food">food</a> dye that is ubiquitous in American drinks, snacks, candies and cereals may finally be banned by the federal government after years of concern that it has adverse health impacts, particularly upon children.</p> <p>The federal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/13/trump-fda-policy-robert-califf">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) has said that it could soon act to crack down upon the additive known as red 3, derived from petroleum and used to provide a cherry-red coloring to an array of foods.</p> <p>“With red 3, we have <a href="https://www.fda.gov/industry/color-additives/fdc-red-no-3">a petition in front of us</a> to revoke the authorization board, and we’re hopeful that in the next few weeks we’ll be acting on that petition,” Jim Jones, the FDA’s deputy commissioner for human foods, told a US Senate health committee on Thursday.</p> <p>Red 3 is used in nearly 3,000 food products, according to <a href="https://www.cspinet.org/press-release/red-3-fda-petition">a database by one environmental health group</a>, including Pez, Betty Crocker’s products and Dubble Bubble chewing gum. Like other food dyes, it adds nothing of nutritional value and is used instead to add color to foods for marketing purposes.</p> <p>While the FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/color-additives-information-consumers/color-additives-questions-and-answers-consumers">said</a> that this food dye, like other such approved additives, is safe to consume if done so correctly, red 3 has been found to be carcinogenic in animals and has been banned for use in cosmetics since 1990. Public health groups have also linked it to behavioral problems in children.</p> <p>Pressure is now building upon the FDA to ban the food dye, along with others that are routinely provided warning labels or are banned in the European Union – yet allowed freely in the US.</p> <p>Last year, California <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/10/1204839281/california-ban-food-additives-red-dye-3-propylparaben-candy">banned</a> four food dyes, including red 3. Robert F Kennedy Jr, Donald Trump’s pick to be the next health secretary during his second presidency, has linked such food dyes to cancer and has been critical of the FDA for allowing certain substances in foods.</p> <p>“There is simply no reason for this chemical to be in our food except to entice and mislead consumers by changing the color of their food so it looks more appealing,” Frank Pallone, a Democrat who is a ranking member on the US House energy committee, wrote to the FDA about red 3 recently.</p> <p>“With the holiday season in full swing where sweet treats are abundant, it is frightening that this chemical remains hidden in these foods that we and our children are eating.”</p>
