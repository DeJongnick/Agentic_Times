<h2><strong>White House Farm: Murder, Bloodline and Betrayal</strong></h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>In 1985, the Bamber family – Nevill and June, their daughter Sheila Caffell and her six-year-old twin sons – were found dead at their Essex home. At first, police believed Caffell was responsible for the murders before turning the gun on herself, but suspicion turned to her brother Jeremy Bamber. He was convicted in 1986 on five counts of murder and has been in prison ever since, but has always insisted he is innocent. The grisly, perplexing case of “the farmhouse of death” is scrutinised here by some of those who responded to and reported on the crime. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2><strong>The Great British Sewing Bee</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One<br></strong>Art week should be a breeze for this crafty bunch. But with a place in the quarter-final coming into view, the pressure is on. After making dolls’ dresses and painters’ overalls, the theme for the Made to Measure challenge is pop art – but who will confuse it with impressionism? Oops. <em>HR</em></p> <h2><strong>The Jury: Murder Trial</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4<br></strong>A second series of the social experiment that recreates a real trial for the benefit of a new batch of 12 laypeople. A Liverpool mother says she stabbed her boyfriend in self-defence; as arguments rage, it’s as much a reality show about individuals whose behaviour is altered by the knowledge that they are on camera as it is a comment on the judicial system. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2><strong>Tommy: The Good. The Bad. The Fury</strong></h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC Three<br></strong>It can’t be easy having Tyson Fury as a brother – particularly if you are also a boxer. In this glossy series, Tommy Fury looks to establish his own niche, opening the doors to the cameras and discussing doubts, ambitions and family. He also gets into the ring for some gentle sparring with his elder sibling. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2><strong>Resident Alien</strong></h2> <p><strong>10pm, Sky Max</strong></p>    <p>Season four of the daffy sci-fi comedy veers into Doctor Who territory as powerless Harry and D’Arcy don curly wigs and flares to zap back to the 1970s. Can they convince time-travelling frenemy General McCallister to give up an artefact that could restore Harry’s alien mojo? <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2><strong>Crime Scene Cleaners</strong></h2> <p><strong>11.05pm, Channel 4<br></strong>This week on true crime’s answer to Mrs Hinch, a Las Vegas team encounter a corpse so decomposed its outline is etched into the mattress. Meanwhile, in the UK, an evicted tenant in Newcastle has booby-trapped his former home with dirty needles suspended from the ceilings and doorframes. <em>Ellen E Jones</em></p> <h2><strong>Film choice</strong></h2>    <p><strong>Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy (Dir: Ryusuke Hamaguchi), Tuesday, 1.20am, Film4<br></strong>The director of 2021’s Drive My Car, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, released another, even more affecting film the same year. This one comprises three short stories in which encounters inadvertently lead to emotional revelations: a model realises her best friend has unknowingly fallen for her ex-lover; a former student is asked to “honeytrap” a professor and novelist she admires; two strangers mistake each other for old schoolmates. Bergmanesque dissections of relationships mingle with heartfelt, cathartic confessionals to profound effect. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <h2><strong>Live sport</strong></h2> <p><strong>The Hundred Cricket</strong><strong>: Northern Superchargers Women v Manchester Originals Women</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>2.45pm, BBC Two<br></strong>From Headingley, Leeds.
