<p>Southern Water has taken responsibility for the catastrophic spill of plastic biobeads that polluted the Sussex coastline.</p> <p>Local charities reported a huge spill of millions of biobeads over the weekend, washing up on beaches including Camber Sands. Andy Dinsdale, the founder of the plastic pollution campaign group Strandliners, said it was the worst pollution event he had seen.</p> <p>According to Southern Water, the spill was caused by a mechanical failure at its Eastbourne sewage works. The beads are used in the last step of the cleaning process before treated effluent water is released back into rivers or the sea.</p> <p>A spokesperson said: “After completing the initial stages of a thorough investigation, which is continuing, we believe it is highly likely that the beads have come from our Eastbourne wastewater treatment works.</p>    <p>“We’ve identified a failure of a screening filter, which has apparently led to beads used in the treatment process being released into the sea during heavy rainfall. The screen should have prevented this occurring.</p> <p>“We are very sorry this has happened and are doing everything possible to investigate and resolve the problem.”</p> <p>The company said it would provide further updates when more information became available.</p> <p>“Southern Water teams continue to work closely with Rother district council, which is leading the cleanup efforts, and we remain committed to supporting this work in every way we can,” it added.</p>    <p>“Southern Water volunteers will continue to assist. Our staff are there to help, and we ask that they are treated with respect as they help with the beach clean.”</p> <p>It is unclear whether the company will face punishment for the spill, such as a fine. </p> <p>Camber Sands in East Sussex is one of England’s most beloved beaches, with rare dune habitat and vast stretches of golden sand. It is home to dolphins, porpoises, seals and seabirds including terns and cormorants.</p> <p>These beads contain a high number of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have been linked to cancer. They often contain toxins including lead, antimony and bromine. Once in the sea, they attract algae, which makes them smell like food to sea creatures, which then eat them and can be poisoned.</p> <p>Helena Dollimore, the Labour and Co-operative MP for Hastings and Rye, said: “Southern Water now admits the toxic plastic beads on Camber Sands were released two weeks ago from their Eastbourne treatment plant during Storm Benjamin. It beggars belief that Southern Water failed to detect the loss of millions of biobeads for an entire fortnight, leaving them free to wash up on our East Sussex coastline and cause an environmental catastrophe.</p>    <p>“So why did it take our community to uncover the truth? When I inquired about these biobeads on Friday, Southern Water flatly denied involvement. There must be an independent investigation into how this spill went undetected for so long and why a company with such a long record of environmental negligence once again failed to act responsibly. Southern Water cannot be trusted to mark their own homework.”</p> <p>Dollimore said the company should urgently deploy every possible resource to clean the coastline. “Instead of paying dividends or bonuses, they must pay for a full programme of nature recovery to restore the fragile ecosystems at Camber Sands, Rye and Hastings, and along our coastline – ecosystems that their negligence has put at serious risk,” she added.</p> <p>The water minister, Emma Hardy, said she had spoken to the chief executive of Southern Water on Monday. “I am deeply disappointed about the plastic pollution incident affecting Camber Sands, East Sussex. It is right that Southern Water has taken responsibility,” Hardy said.</p> <p>“The immediate priority now needs to be addressing any environmental damage and minimising further impacts. I am in close touch with the Environment Agency, who are conducting a thorough investigation, looking at what regulatory action should be taken and working with Rother district council on the cleanup operation.”</p> <p>An Environment Agency spokesperson said:<strong> “</strong>We acknowledge that Southern Water has admitted responsibility for the pollution incident in a statement released this morning. This is an active investigation and we will not hesitate to take robust enforcement action where appropriate.</p> <p>“We continue to work closely with Rother district council and other responders on the clean-up operation of plastic pellets on Camber Sands, East Sussex. The lead for this activity continues to be the district council and we remain ready to help should they need it.” </p> <p>People in Sussex have reported a number of dead stranded seals and a porpoise in recent days, and fear the deaths could be linked to the beads.</p> <p>Volunteers have spent days trying in vain to rid the beach of the tiny beads, which, if left in the environment, will break down into microplastics that are almost impossible to extract from the sea and food chain.</p> <p>Locals have been using rakes and dustpans and brushes to remove the beads.</p>
