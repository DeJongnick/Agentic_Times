<h1>Ukraine, Gaza and Iran: can Witkoff secure any wins for Trump?</h1>

<p>Donald Trump’s version of Pax Americana, the idea that the US can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/17/from-london-to-lviv-how-trumps-new-world-order-has-shaken-europe">through coercion impose order</a> on the world, is facing its moment of truth in Ukraine, Gaza and Iran.</p> 
<p>In the words of the former CIA director William Burns, it is in “<a href="https://www.cia.gov/static/62739354dfed5cc1942997d3f1899d94/DCIA-Ditchley-Remarks-01-July-2023.pdf">one of those plastic moments</a>” in international relations that come along maybe twice a century where the future could take many possible forms.</p> 
<p>The US’s aim has been to keep the three era-defining simultaneous sets of negotiations entirely separate, and to – as much as possible – shape their outcome alone. The approach is similar to the trade talks, where the intention is for supplicant countries to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/22/reeves-flies-to-us-to-push-trump-to-sign-trade-agreement">come to Washington individually bearing gifts</a> in return for access to US markets.</p> 
<p>The administration may have felt it had little choice given the urgency, but whether it was wise to launch three such ambitious peace missions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/04/trump-tariffs-truth-social">and a global trade war</a>, at the same time is debatable.</p> 
<p>It is true each of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/apr/10/trump-war-israel-gaza-ukraine-yemen">three conflicts</a> are discrete in that they have distinctive causes, contexts and dynamics, but they are becoming more intertwined than seemed apparent at the outset, in part because there is so much resistance building in Europe and elsewhere about the world order Donald Trump envisages, and his chosen methods.</p> 
<p>In diplomacy nothing is hermetically sealed – everything is inter-connected, especially since there is a common thread between the three talks in the personality of the property developer Steven Witkoff, Trump’s great friend who is leading the US talks in each case, flitting from Moscow to Muscat.</p> 
<p>To solve these three conflicts simultaneously would be a daunting task for anyone, but it is especially for a man entirely new to diplomacy and, judging by some of his remarks, also equally new to history.</p> 
<p>Witkoff has strengths, not least that he is trusted by Trump. He also knows the president’s mind – and what should be taken at face value. He is loyal, so much so that he admits he worshipped Trump in New York so profoundly that he wanted to become him. He will not be pursuing any other agenda but the president’s.</p> 
<p>But he is also stretched, and there are basic issues of competence. Diplomats are reeling from big cuts to the state department budget and there is still an absence of experienced staffers. Witkoff simply does not have the institutional memory available to his opposite numbers in Iran, Israel and Russia. For instance, most of the Iranian negotiating team, led by the foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, are veterans of the 2013-15 talks that led to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-programme-world-powers-historic-deal-lift-sanctions">original Iran nuclear deal</a>.</p> 
<p>Yuri Ushakov, Vladimir Putin’s chief foreign policy adviser, who attended the first Russian-US talks this year in Saudi Arabia, spent 10 years in the US as Russian ambassador. He was accompanied by Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund who then visited the US on 2 April.</p> 
<p>In the follow-up talks in Istanbul on 10 April, Aleksandr Darchiev, who has spent 33 years in the Russian foreign ministry and is Russian ambassador to the US, was pitted against a team led by Sonata Coulter, the new deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, who does not share Trump’s benign view of Russia.</p> 
<p>As to the Gaza issue, Benjamin Netanyahu has lived the Palestinian conflict since he became Israel’s ambassador to the UN in 1984.</p> 
<p>Richard Nephew, a former US Iran negotiator, says the cuts to state department means the US “is at risk of losing a generation of expertise … It’s beyond tragedy. It’s an absolutely devastating national security blow with the evisceration of these folks. The damage could be permanent, we have to acknowledge this.”</p> 
<p>One withering European diplomat says: “It is as if Witkoff is trying to play three dimensional chess with chess grandmasters on three chessboards simultaneously, not having played the game before.”</p> 
<p>Bluntly, Witkoff knows he needs to secure a diplomatic win for his impatient boss. But the longer the three conflicts continue, the more entangled they become with one another, the more Trump’s credibility is questioned. Already, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/americans-sour-trumps-handling-economy-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-04-23/">according to a Reuters Ipsos poll published this month</a>, 59% of Americans think Trump is costing their country its credibility on the global stage.</p> 
<p>The risk for Trump is that the decision to address so much so quickly ends up not being a show of American strength but the opposite – the public erosion of a super power.</p> 
<p>In the hurry to seal a deal with Iran inside two months, Trump, unlike in all previous nuclear talks with Tehran, has barred complicating European interests from the negotiation room.</p>

<p>To Iran’s relief, Witkoff has not tabled an agenda that strays beyond stopping Iran acquiring a nuclear bomb. He has not raised Iran’s supply of drones to Russia for use in Ukraine. Nor has he tabled demands that Iran end arms supplies to its proxies fighting Israel.</p> 
<p>That has alarmed Israel, and to a lesser extent Europe, which sees Iran’s desire to have sanctions lifted as a rare opportunity to extract concessions from Tehran. Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, and Mossad’s head, David Barnea, met Witkoff last Friday in Paris to try to persuade him that when he met the Iran negotiating team the next day in Rome, he had to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/15/trump-envoy-steve-witkoff-demands-iran-eliminate-nuclear-programme">demand the dismantling of Tehran’s civil nuclear programme</a>.</p> 
<p>Witkoff refused, and amid many contradictory statements the administration has reverted to insisting that Iran import the necessary enriched uranium for its civil nuclear programme, rather than enrich it domestically.</p> 
<p>Russia, in a sign of Trump’s trust, might again become the repository of Iran’s stocks of highly enriched uranium, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/iran-ships-uranium-russia-nuclear-deal">as it was after the 2015 deal</a>.</p> 
<p>Israel is also wary of Trump’s aggrandisement of Russia. The Israeli thinktank INSS published a report this week detailing how Russia, in search of anti-western allies in the global south for its Ukraine war, has shown opportunistic political support not just to Iran but to Hamas. Israel will also be uneasy if Russia maintains its role in Syria.</p>

<p>But if Trump has upset Netanyahu over Iran, he is keeping him sweet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/feb/17/netanyahu-committed-to-trumps-plan-to-take-over-gaza">by giving him all he asks on Gaza</a>.</p> 
<p>Initially, Witkoff received glowing accolades about how tough he had been with Netanyahu in his initial meeting in January. It was claimed that Witkoff ordered the Israeli president to meet him on a Saturday breaking the Sabbath and directed him to agree a ceasefire that he had refused to give to Joe Biden’s team for months.</p> 
<p>As a result, as Trump entered the White House on 19 January, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/realdonaldtrump/p/DE2xWm0RsWv/?hl=en-gb">he hailed</a> the “EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signalled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies”.</p> 
<p>But Netanyahu, as was widely predicted in the region, found a reason not to open talks on the second phase of the ceasefire deal – the release of the remaining hostages held in Gaza in exchange for a permanent end to the fighting.</p> 
<p>Witkoff came up with compromises to extend the ceasefire but Netanyahu rejected them, resuming the assault on Hamas on 19 March. The US envoy merely described Israel’s decision as “unfortunate, in some respects, but also falls into the had-to-be bucket”.</p> 
<p>Now Trump’s refusal to put any pressure on Israel to lift its six-week-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/16/no-humanitarian-aid-gaza-israeli-minister-israel-katz-hamas">ban on aid entering Gaza</a> is informing Europe’s rift with Trump. Marking 50 days of the ban this week, France, Germany and the UK issued a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/germany-france-uk-demand-access-204357461.html">strongly worded statement</a> describing the denial of aid as intolerable.</p> 
<p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is calling for a coordinated European recognition of the state of Palestine, and Saudi Arabia is insisting the US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/31/trumps-bombing-threat-over-iran-nuclear-programme-prompts-backlash">does not attack Iran’s nuclear sites</a>.</p> 
<p>Witkoff, by contrast, has been silent about Gaza’s fate and the collapse of the “EPIC ceasefire”.</p> 
<p>But if European diplomats think Witkoff was naive in dealing with Netanyahu, it is nothing to the scorn they hold for his handling of Putin.</p> 
<p>The anger is partly because Europeans had thought that, after the Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s public row with Trump in the Oval Office, they had restored Ukraine’s standing in Washington by persuading Kyiv to back the full ceasefire that the US first proposed on 11 March.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/17/lammy-rubio-and-witkoff-to-discuss-ukraine-war-and-iran-with-europeans-in-paris-talks">talks in Paris last week between Marco Rubio</a>, the US secretary of state, and European leaders also gave Europe a chance to point out it was Putin that was stalling over a ceasefire.</p> 
<p>But instead of putting any countervailing pressure on Russia to accept a ceasefire, Witkoff switched strategy. In the words of Bruno Tertrais, a non-resident fellow at the Institut of Montaigne, Witkoff is “is now presenting a final peace plan, very favourable to the aggressor, even before the start of the negotiations, which had been due to take place after a ceasefire”.</p> 
<p>No European government has yet criticised Trump’s lopsided plan in public since, with few cards to play, the immediate necessity is to try to prevent Trump acting on his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/23/vance-says-us-will-walk-away-unless-ukraine-and-russia-accept-peace-deal">threat to walk away</a>. At the very least, Europe will argue that if Trump wants Ukraine’s resources, he has to back up a European force patrolling a ceasefire, an issue that receives only sketchy reference in the US peace plan.</p> 
<p>The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, addressing the country’s parliament on Wednesday, pointed to the necessity of these security guarantees. “Any arrangement with the Kremlin will only last so long as the Russian elite dreads the consequences of its breach,” he said.</p> 
<p>But in a sense, Trump and Putin, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/12/trump-russia-ukraine-book-comments">according to Fiona Hill</a> at the Brookings Institution, a Russia specialist in Trump’s first administration, may already have moved beyond the details of their Ukrainian settlement as they focus on their wider plan to restore the Russian-US relationship.</p> 
<p>It would be an era of great power collusion, not great power competition in which Gaza, Iran and Ukraine would be sites from which the US and Russia could profit.</p> 
<p>Writing on Truth Social about a phone call with Putin in February, Trump reported” “We both reflected on the Great History of our Nations, and the fact that we fought so successfully together in World War II … We each talked about the strengths of our respective Nations, and the great benefit that we will someday have in working together.”</p> 
<p>Witkoff has also mused about what form this cooperation might take. “Shared sea lanes, maybe send [liquefied natural] gas into Europe together, maybe collaborate on AI together,” he said, adding: “Who doesn’t want to see a world like that?”</p>
