<p>The federal government signed contracts worth almost $1bn with consultants last financial year – a 48% increase on the previous one – despite committing to slash their use, according to research conducted by the parliamentary library.</p> <p>The analysis, commissioned by the Greens, shows that while the value of contracts with the big four consultancy firms fell from $138m to $114m, contracts with all firms increased from $653m to $968m.</p> <p>The increase comes months after the Albanese government outlined $6.4bn in future savings by cutting the use of consultants along with labour hire firms and “non-wage expenses”, including travel, property and hospitality.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>“While there has been a notable decrease in contracts awarded to the largest consulting firms, federal expenditure for private consulting services has in fact only been redistributed to other Australian firms,” the parliamentary library analysis said.</p> <p>According to the analysis, the value of contracts signed with the big four firms – PwC Australia, KPMG, EY and Deloitte – has fallen by 47% from the 2021-22 financial year, from $218m to $114m.</p> <p>Part of this decline was influenced by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/12/disgraceful-breach-of-trust-how-pwc-one-of-the-worlds-biggest-accountancy-firms-became-mired-in-a-tax-scandal">tax leaks scandal involving PwC Australia</a>, which led to its entire government advisory unit being divested for just $1. This month the finance department <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/aug/07/labor-lift-ban-on-australia-pwc-after-treasury-scandal">lifted a ban on the firm competing for new government work</a>.</p> <p>The parliamentary library found the value of contracts signed beyond the seven largest firms, which also include Accenture, Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey, increased from $496m to $803m last financial year, a 61% jump.</p> <p>The library assessed the value of contracts signed by departments, rather than the amount of money paid in a single year.
