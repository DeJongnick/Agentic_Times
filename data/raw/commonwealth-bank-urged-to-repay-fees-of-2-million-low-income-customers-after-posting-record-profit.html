<p>The Commonwealth bank has posted a record cash profit, sparking renewed calls for Australia’s biggest bank to repay more than 2 million low-income customers $270m in fees – something it has refused to do.</p> <p>CBA recorded $10.25bn in annual cash profits for the year to June – a 4% lift on the previous year – and gave a bumper $2.60 payout per share to shareholders.</p> <p>The bank announced the results in its 2025 annual report on Wednesday alongside its updated environment and social policies, where it also revealed it would impose further climate requirements on coal mining clients.</p> <p>Thermal coalminers will not be permitted to borrow from the bank unless they are aiming to reach net zero emissions by 2050, with CBA imposing further decarbonisation and transparency requirements.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>About $1.2bn of CBA finance was exposed to the thermal coal industry at the end of June.</p> <p>CBA has imposed energy transition plan requirements on oil and gas companies and producers of the other main black coal product, metallurgical coal, since 2023.</p> <p>Heightened requirements for lending would make it much harder for coal companies to borrow from the bank, according to Morgan Pickett, an analyst at climate advocacy group Market Forces.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/aug/13/rba-interest-rate-cuts-michele-bullock-inflation-economy">Three more interest rate cuts may be on the way. But when is increasingly looking like anyone’s guess</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Australia’s biggest bank has officially ended any new finance for coal, whether for power or making steel, unless it’s proven to be compatible with a safe and livable climate,” Pickett said.</p> <p>The profit announcement also amplified calls for CBA to repay more than 2 million low-income customers after charging them fees, something it declined to do in July.</p> <p>A petition from consumer advocacy group Choice demanding repayment has attracted over 20,000 signatures.</p> <p>“These are some of the most financially vulnerable people and the least able to afford to line the bank’s pockets,” Choice’s Andy Kelly said.</p> <p>The Australian Securities and Investments Commission in 2024 found four banks had charged high fees to people entitled to low-fee accounts.</p> <p>Commonwealth Bank made goodwill payments of $25m to nearly 90,000 customers, while ANZ, Bendigo Bank and Westpac also paid $8m to over 55,000 customers.</p> <p>In July, ASIC announced those three banks would make additional refunds. However, CBA told the corporate regulator it would not, despite charging $270m in fees to a further 2.2 million low-income customers from 2019 to 2024.</p> <p>A CBA spokesperson said at the time the fees had been disclosed to the customers, who benefited from the flexibility of high-fee accounts and had a range of income and wealth levels.</p> <p>The report also showed Australian households took out an additional $34bn in home loans, up 7% from June 2024 to June 2025. Personal loans also picked up by $400m and business lending rose $16bn over the year.</p> <p>The share of customers who were 90 or more days behind on home loan payments steadied at 0.7% in June, which helped cut CBA’s losses on impaired or unpaid loans by a tenth, to $726m annually.</p> <p>More customers are ahead on their minimum monthly loan repayments, with the share rising to 85% in June compared with just under 80% the previous year.</p> <p>“Pleasingly, many households have seen a rise in disposable incomes due to the recent relief from reduced interest rates, lower inflation and tax cuts,” CBA’s chief executive, Matt Comyn, said.</p> <p>Households deposited an additional $34bn in CBA accounts over the year to June.Household and business customers saw the gap between loans and deposits narrow over the year, by 0.03 and 0.04 percentage points respectively, even though CBA’s overall net interest margin widened, helping it achieve record profit.</p> <p>Alan Docherty, CBA’s chief financial officer, said increased competition from other banks had forced CBA to offer lower mortgage interest rates and higher savings rates.</p> <p>The bank gave shareholders a dividend payout of $2.60 a share, to a total of $4.85 over the last 12 months, up from the $4.65 it paid in 2024, which will be paid to more than 800,000 direct shareholders.</p> <p>Investors sold out of the bank after results were published, sending the price falling from nearly $178 to $169 by Wednesday afternoon, the stock’s biggest one-day fall since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/aug/05/asx-loses-160bn-in-two-days-as-us-recession-fears-prompt-sell-off">markets panicked in August 2024</a>.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="embed">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
