<p>A cancer survivor with chronic health problems is suing one of the UK’s most prestigious museums for discrimination for allegedly denying her a suitable chair to sit on when she is at work.</p> <p>Malina Nowicka, 34, works as a security guard at the Science Museum in South Kensington, London, and has assisted thousands of visitors in the five years she has worked there.</p> <p>She is a survivor of kidney cancer and requires regular monitoring, has chronic lower back pain and struggles to stand for long periods. She also suffers from vasovagal syncope, a fainting condition.</p> <p>Although the museum provides stools in the rooms where exhibits are displayed, where staff can perch for short periods, Nowicka claims she needs access to a proper chair during her shifts, especially if she starts to feel faint.</p> <p>An occupational health assessment concluded that Nowicka was fit to work but it found that she required a more comfortable chair with arm and back rests, rather than making do with the stools provided. She claims her employers have not provided this for her.</p> <p>She says she decided to take legal action after her request for a chair went unanswered for more than three years. She had asked Wilson James, the company that employs security guards that work at the Science Museum, and the museum itself for a chair but was allegedly rejected.</p> <p>“I have never brought a legal action before. I’m not just doing this for myself but for all people with disabilities,” said Nowicka. “I’ve decided to go public to encourage others with disabilities to fight for their rights. I love my job but I don’t want others to go through what I’ve been through in the last few years.</p> <p>“I’ve really struggled and my treatment by the employers has made me badly depressed and has affected my mental health. Whatever race or religion you are or whatever disability you have, nobody should be discriminated against at work.”</p> <p>Nowicka is taking both to the London Central employment tribunal and is suing them for disability discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act.</p> <p>The preliminary hearing has taken place and the full case is due to be heard in June 2025. She is being supported by her union, United Voices of the World, which represents security guards at the museum and in other workplaces. The security guards are staging strikes over pay and working conditions with the next strike scheduled for 15 days over the next month.</p> <p>Petros Elia, the general secretary of the UVW, said: “Malina’s case highlights the injustice and harm caused when employers ignore the wellbeing of disabled workers. UVW remains committed to supporting her and ensuring that no disabled worker has to endure the same mistreatment in the future.”</p> <p>A Wilson James spokesperson said: “We are aware of the circumstances related to this individual, and remain committed to working with all parties to achieve a positive resolution.”</p>
