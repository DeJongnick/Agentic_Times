<p>Among his multiple accomplishments and achievements, the commitment of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/jul/06/lord-lipsey-obituary">David Lipsey</a> to classical music education stood out. Unlike too many politicians, who merely talk the talk about the arts, David walked the walk. </p> <p>He was chair of governors at Trinity Laban Conservatoire, 2012-17, leading its transformation into Britain’s first university level college of both music and dance, and establishing Trinity Laban as the inclusive and innovative creative institution it is today. </p> <p>He often spoke up for the arts, and for music education in particular, in the House of Lords, where he chaired the all-party classical music group. He also put his money where his mouth was, supporting young pianists and other artists with generous endowments.</p>
