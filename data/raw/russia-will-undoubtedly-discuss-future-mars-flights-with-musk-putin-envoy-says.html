<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russian</a> officials expect to hold talks with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> soon about space travel to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/mars">Mars</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a>’s international cooperation envoy said on Tuesday. The envoy’s comments, which Musk has not confirmed, also stated that Russia wanted to expand its cooperation with the US on space projects.</p> <p>“I think that there will undoubtedly be a discussion with Musk [about Mars flights] in the near future,” Kirill Dmitriev said at a business forum in Moscow, going on to praise Musk’s efforts to push the boundaries of human achievement.</p> <p>The proposed talks would once again put Musk, the world’s richest man and a senior adviser to Trump, in an outsized and largely unaccountable role in international politics. Musk has joined in on White House calls with international leaders since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump’s</a> re-election, and prior to his new role in the administration <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187">reportedly was in regular contact</a> with Putin.</p> <p>Musk’s ownership of SpaceX and control of the Starlink satellite communications system have increasingly allowed him to take on the role of power broker in space travel and international telecommunications. In the US, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/nasa">Nasa</a> has come to rely on SpaceX for the majority of its launches, and recently fired workers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/18/nasa-cuts-elon-musk-spacex">have raised alarms</a> about his growing sway over the agency. Musk has also used his leverage over international telecoms to assert his political influence, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/09/zelenskiy-aide-takes-aim-at-curbs-on-ukraine-use-of-starlink-to-pilot-drones-elon-musk">limiting Ukraine’s military use of Starlink</a> during the Russia-Ukraine war and recently <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy87vg38dnpo">clashing with Poland’s foreign minister</a> over the technology.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/18/elon-musk-tesla">Tesla stake is no longer Elon Musk’s most valuable asset amid stock market sell-off</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dmitriev, who was named by Putin last month as his special envoy on international economic and investment cooperation, also claimed on Tuesday that Russia’s “enemies” were trying to derail Trump’s efforts to restore a dialogue with Russia. His remarks came as Trump held a call with Putin on Tuesday to discuss a potential ceasefire in Ukraine and eventual end to hostilities after Russia invaded the country in 2022.</p> <p>Dmitriev said Russia wanted to work with Musk as part of Moscow’s efforts to strengthen and develop Russia’s space agency, Roscosmos, and state nuclear corporation Rosatom. Dmitriev stated he was in touch with Roscosmos, Russian businesses and the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia.</p> <p>Russia said in 2022 it would start work on its own Mars mission after the European Space Agency (ESA) suspended a joint project in the wake of Putin’s decision to send tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.</p>
