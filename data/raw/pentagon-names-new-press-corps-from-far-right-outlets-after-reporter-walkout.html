<p>After the recent departure of Pentagon reporters due to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/pentagon-press-reporting-policy">their refusal</a> to agree to a new set of restrictive policies, the defense department has announced a “next generation of the Pentagon press corps” featuring 60 journalists from far-right outlets, many of which have promoted conspiracy theories.</p> <p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell posted the <a href="https://x.com/SeanParnellASW/status/1981048206923329719">news on X</a> but did not provide any names.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/10/22/pentagon-press-corps-right-wing-media/">Washington Post</a>, however, obtained a draft of the announcement, which stated that the new reporters, who agreed to the department’s new policies, were from outlets such as Lindell TV, started by Trump ally Mike Lindell; the Gateway Pundit; the Post Millennial; Human Events; and the National Pulse.</p> <p>The list also includes Turning Point USA’s media brand Frontlines, influencer Tim Pool’s Timcast and a Substack-based newsletter called Washington Reporter, the Post reported.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/15/pentagon-press-reporting-policy">Pentagon reporters have now turned in their badges – but plan to keep reporting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Pentagon did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s request for the list of journalists.</p> <p>Parnell described the group as a “broad spectrum of new media outlets and independent journalists”.</p> <p>“New media outlets and independent journalists have created the formula to circumvent the lies of the mainstream media and get real news directly to the American people,” Parnell wrote. “Their reach and impact collectively are far more effective and balanced than the self-righteous media who chose to self-deport from the Pentagon.”</p> <p>The new press corps includes rightwing outlets that have promoted conspiracy theories. For example, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/10/gateway-pundit-defamation-lawsuit-election-workers">Gateway Pundit</a> spread false information about the 2020 election and then settled a defamation lawsuit with two Georgia election workers it falsely accused of wrongdoing and admitted that there was no fraud in the election.</p> <p>Similarly, Lindell denied the results of the election and was ordered to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/16/mypillow-mike-lindell-defamation-trial">pay $2.3m</a> to an employee of a voting machine company who sued him for defamation.</p> <p>Pool, a conservative podcast host, was among <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/sep/05/tim-pool-benny-johnson-influencers-russia-disinformation">the influencers</a> who allegedly were associated with a US content creation company that was provided with nearly $10m from Russian state media employees to publish videos with messages in favor of Moscow’s interests and agenda.</p> <p>Pool said they were “deceived and are victims”.</p> <p>The journalists who turned in their press credentials earlier this month did so after the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, introduced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/13/defense-department-media-news-rules">a policy</a> that required that they agree not to obtain unauthorized material and restricted access to certain areas unless accompanied by an official.</p> <p>Outlets including the Washington Post, the New York Times and the Atlantic, as well as reporters from rightwing outlets such as <a href="http://fox">Fox News and Newsmax</a>, all refused to sign on to the new rules.</p> <p>“We believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further,” Newsmax <a href="https://x.com/erikwemple/status/1977813801513992199?s=12">told Times</a> journalist Erik Wemple.</p> <p>The Guardian also declined to sign the revised Pentagon press pass policy because it placed unacceptable restrictions on activities protected by the first amendment.</p> <p>During a White House press briefing, Pool, a member of the new Pentagon press corps, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/05/white-house-briefing-rightwing-media">asked</a> Karoline Leavitt to comment on the mainstream media and “their unprofessional behavior as well as elaborate [on] if there’s any plans to expand access to new companies?”</p> <p>In a segment on Wednesday on the rightwing television network Real America’s Voice, defense department spokesperson <a href="https://x.com/DOWResponse/status/1981073144598192470">Kingsley Wilson thanked</a> the show’s host, Jack Posobiec, for joining the press corps.</p> <p>Wilson misstated the policies that caused journalists to leave the Pentagon. She did not mention that it included a requirement that they not obtain unauthorized material.</p> <p>“They walked out because they refused to sign an agreement that was simple. It was common sense. It said, wear a visible press badge. Don’t go in classified spaces, stay in the correspondence corridor and follow the building’s rules,” Wilson said.</p> <p>“That was their right, but also their loss, because now we get to have incredible journalists like yourself who are going to be here in the Pentagon reporting on what the Department of War is doing every single day,” Wilson said. “It’s really the next generation of journalism at the Pentagon.”</p>
