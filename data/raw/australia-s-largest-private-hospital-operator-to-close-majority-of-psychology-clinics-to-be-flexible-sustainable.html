<p>Ramsay Health Care, Australia’s largest private hospital operator, has announced it will be closing the majority of its psychology clinics, described by the peak body as “very sad news” for those needing mental health care.</p> <p>The hospital network said it would progressively close 17 out of its 20 clinics by the end of August, in order to transition Ramsay Psychology to a “more flexible and sustainable model”.</p> <p>Three clinics in Cairns, Charlestown and Joondalup will remain open to “support local needs, maintain key partnerships and pilot more integrated models of care”, Ramsay Health Care said in a statement.</p> <p>“We understand this change might be unsettling and we are working closely with our psychologists to ensure every client is supported and has continuity of care, whether through our existing and expanded Telehealth service or with another trusted provider, depending on what is clinically appropriate,” the statement said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Ramsay’s website states it is “Australia’s largest private provider of psychology services”.</p> <p>It has not yet become clear if the closures amount to significant job losses. The network lists 141 psychologists on the website’s “find a practitioner tool”.</p> <p>The company also provides psychology services through mental health clinics offering inpatient treatment and outpatient sessions and day programs, which Guardian Australia understands will not be affected.</p> <p>In November an Australia government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/01/australian-private-hospitals-say-government-review-shows-sector-isnt-profitable-as-it-struggles-to-keep-surgery-doors-open">review of the private hospital sector’s financial viability</a> highlighted that obstetrics and mental health were “two particular services of concern” becoming “increasingly difficult to offer”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/21/nsw-court-hears-closing-arguments-in-landmark-psychiatrists-dispute-ntwnfb">Psychiatrist body holds firm on 25% pay bid but NSW Health says shortages are ‘more nuanced’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The president of the Australian Association of Psychologists, Sahra O’Doherty, said “the closure of these clinics is very sad news for anyone needing professional mental health care”.</p> <p>“Given we learned today the National Mental Health Commission Report Card showed that 20% delay seeking mental health help because of cost, these closures mean accessing psychological care will be more challenging,” Doherty said.</p> <p>The report for 2024, <a href="https://www.mentalhealthcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-07/national-report-card-2024_0.pdf">released on Thursday</a>, also found less than half (45.1%) of people who had a mental disorder in the last 12 months had seen a health professional for their mental health in the past year.</p> <p>The diminishing access to mental health services comes against the backdrop of shortages of psychiatrists in both the public and private sectors, with the high-profile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/jun/21/nsw-court-hears-closing-arguments-in-landmark-psychiatrists-dispute-ntwnfb">dispute between NSW Health and the state’s public psychiatrists</a> highlighting the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/17/nsw-psychiatrists-arbitration-hearing-pay-conditions">constraints on mental health care in public hospital settings</a>.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
