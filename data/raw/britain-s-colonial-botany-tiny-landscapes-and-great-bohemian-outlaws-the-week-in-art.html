Time of falling leaves and Mike Oldfield chimes presaging Halloween? For David Teniers the Younger, the arrival of autumn doesn’t mean any of these. It means time for a drink, because the wine harvest is here. Other artists too have celebrated this time as the season of the vintage, from Poussin to Cy Twombly, but Teniers doesn’t even bother with scenes of the grape harvest. He cuts to the chase and portrays a plump tipsy bloke holding up a glass. His shiny face looks vaguely at us but he balances the glass perfectly, as he dangles the flagon he’s emptied in his other hand. Once Teniers, from Antwerp, was the most famous of 17th-century north European artists of everyday life: his ruddy realism was seen as the essence of this so-called “genre” tradition. As such he influenced British artists such as Hogarth and David Wilkie to paint ordinary, unprettified human existence.<br>• <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/david-teniers-the-younger-autumn">National Gallery, London</a></p> <h2><strong>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</strong></h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Get in </strong><strong>touch</strong></h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
