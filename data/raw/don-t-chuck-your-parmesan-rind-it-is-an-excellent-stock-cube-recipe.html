<p>Parmesan rinds are the ultimate zero-waste hack – like a cheesy stock cube, they enrich stews, sauces and all sorts, and add pure deliciousness in the form of umami depth and creamy texture. Stored in the fridge or freezer, they keep almost indefinitely. This week’s recipe uses them in a thrifty, creamy corn orzo that transforms a few simple ingredients into comforting autumn fare.</p> <h2>Creamed corn orzo</h2> <p>This dish was a happy accident, and left me and my family drooling for more. I was planning a classic tomato orzo to use up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2025/sep/03/turn-leftover-orzo-into-summer-salad-recipe-zero-waste-cooking">that half-bag </a>in the cupboard left over from making a pasta salad, but wanted something more seasonal. Fresh corn cobs are one of autumn’s fleeting treats, as short-lived as asparagus, and during their brief season I eat them weekly. In the spirit of this column, I thought it would be good to use the whole cob – not just the sweet kernels, but also the starchy, flavourful pulp and the spent cobs. That extra flavour, combined with a parmesan rind, onion, butter and a splash of cream or water, turns a single cob into a generous and deeply satisfying dish for two.</p> <p>Serves <strong>2 generously</strong></p> <p><strong>1 fresh corn cob<br>50g butter<br>1 medium onion</strong>, peeled and finely chopped<br><strong>2 garlic cloves</strong>, peeled and roughly chopped<br><strong>250g orzo<br>40-50g parmesan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/01/why-parmesan-rinds-are-cook-secret-ingredient-kitchen-aide">rind</a></strong> – grate off and reserve any remaining cheese<br><strong>100ml double cream</strong>, optional <br><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong><br><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong>, to finish</p> <p>To get the most flavour from your corn cob, stand it on one end, cut off the kernels in long strips, then break up the cobs by hand. Next, using a spoon, quickly scrape the starchy, milky pulp from the cobs into a bowl. Put the spent cobs in a pan with 750ml water, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer, cover and leave to cook on a low heat.</p> <p>Melt the butter in a second large pan on a medium-low heat. Add the onion and garlic, cook gently, stirring, for about five minutes, until soft, then add the corn kernels and orzo, and saute for three minutes. Add the parmesan rind, double cream, if using, and the reserved corn pulp, bring to a simmer and cook for two minutes, stirring to make sure the mix doesn’t catch and burn.</p>  <!-- Recipe element -->  <p>Strain the hot corn stock into the orzo pan, bring to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, for about seven minutes, until the orzo is al dente and the mixture is loose and creamy; add a little extra water to loosen, if need be. Season to taste, and serve topped with extra butter and a sprinkling of the reserved grated parmesan.</p> <p><br></p>
