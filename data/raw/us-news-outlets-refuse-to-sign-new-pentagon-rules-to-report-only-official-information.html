<p>Several leading news organizations with access to Pentagon briefings have formally said they will not agree to a new defense department policy that requires them to pledge they will not obtain unauthorized material and restricts access to certain areas unless accompanied by an official.</p> <p>The policy, presented last month by the defense secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-hegseth">Pete Hegseth</a>, has been widely criticized by media organizations asked to sign the pledge by Tuesday at 5pm or have 24 hours to turn in their press credentials.</p> <p>The move follows a shake-up in February in which long-credentialed media outlets were required to vacate assigned workspaces which was cast as an “annual media rotation program”. A similar plan was presented at the White House where some briefing room spots were given to podcasters and other representatives of non-traditional media.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/pentagon-journalists-restrictions-pledge">Pentagon demands journalists sign pledge not to gather certain information</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Monday, the Washington Post joined the New York Times, CNN, the Atlantic, the Guardian, Reuters, the Associated Press, NPR, HuffPost and trade publication Breaking Defense in saying it would not sign on to the agreement.</p> <p>Matt Murray, the Post’s executive editor, said the policy runs counter to constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press.</p> <p>“The proposed restrictions undercut First Amendment protections by placing unnecessary constraints on gathering and publishing information,” <a href="https://x.com/WashPostComms/status/1977795164140880356/photo/1">Murray wrote</a> in a statement published on X. “We will continue to vigorously and fairly report on the policies and positions of the Pentagon and officials across the government.”</p> <p>The Atlantic, which became embroiled in a dispute with Pentagon and White House officials earlier this year after editor Jeffrey Goldberg was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/signal-group-chat-leak-how-it-happened">accidentally added</a> to a group chat on Signal, <a href="https://x.com/TheAtlanticPR/status/1977775496168452238">said</a> it “fundamentally” opposes the new restrictions.</p> <p>The new policy “constrains how journalists can report on the US military, which is funded by nearly $1tn in taxpayer dollars annually,” <a href="https://x.com/NYTimesPR/status/1976711113988272152">a New York Times statement</a> said. “The public has a right to know how the government and military are operating,” wrote the Times Washington bureau chief, Richard Stevenson.</p> <p>Hegseth responded on social media to statements from the Atlantic, the Post and the Times by posting a single emoji of a hand waving goodbye. Later, the defense secretary, a former Fox weekend anchor, <a href="https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1977828217315549301">posted a list</a> on X of what he called “press credentialing FOR DUMMIES: Press no longer roams free Press must wear visible badge Credentialed press no longer permitted to solicit criminal acts”. He also reposted a cartoon that depicted the Atlantic as a crying baby.</p> <p>Reuters also <a href="https://x.com/phildstewart/status/1977879030046089406">announced</a> on Monday that “our journalists will not sign the revised press pass policy”, calling the Pentagon’s new restrictions an affront to “the press protections afforded by the US constitution, the unrestricted flow of information and journalism that serves the public interest without fear or favour”.</p> <p>National Public Radio’s editor-in-chief, Thomas Evans, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/13/g-s1-93291/a-statement-from-npr-on-the-pentagons-press-policy">said</a>: “We will not sign the administration’s restrictive policy that asks reporters to undermine their commitment of providing trustworthy, independent journalism to the American public.”</p> <p>“The restrictions secretary Hegseth is attempting to place on the press are flatly unconstitutional,” Whitney Snyder, HuffPost’s editor-in-chief, said in <a href="https://x.com/HuffPost/status/1977884911714611692">a statement</a>. “HuffPost will not agree to a document clearly aimed at snuffing out actual news-gathering at the nation’s largest and best-funded federal department.”</p> <p>Some right-leaning outlets have also declined to sign the document. “Newsmax has no plans to sign the letter,” the network told <a href="https://x.com/erikwemple/status/1977813801513992199?s=12">the New York Times reporter Erik Wemple</a>. “We are working in conjunction with other media outlets to resolve the situation. We believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further.”</p> <p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell <a href="https://x.com/ScottNover/status/1976749494189654124">told the Washington Post</a> that media outlets had “decided to move the goal post”, saying that the policy doesn’t require reporters to agree, but just acknowledge they understand it.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/21/trump-pentagon-journalists">‘Nothing stops reporters’: Trump talks down Pentagon restrictions on journalists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Parnell said that request had “caused reporters to have a full-blown meltdown, crying victim online.” He added: “We stand by our policy because it’s what’s best for our troops and the national security of this country.”</p> <p>The Pentagon Press Association, which represents the press corps covering the defense department, <a href="https://x.com/JM_Szuba/status/1975967550795395155/photo/1">said last week</a> that a revised policy that seeks to prohibit journalists from soliciting unauthorized information in addition to accessing it, appeared to be “designed to stifle a free press and potentially expose us to prosecution for simply doing our jobs”.</p> <p>The PPA noted that the revised policy “conveys an unprecedented message of intimidation to everyone within the DoD, warning against any unapproved interactions with the press and even suggesting it’s criminal to speak without express permission – which plainly, it is not”.</p> <p>The new rules were accepted by the far-right cable channel One America News, whose White House correspondent is frequently invited by the president to ask him questions. One of the channel’s hosts, former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz, <a href="https://x.com/mattgaetz/status/1977830571901690206">said</a> the pro-Trump outlet “is happy to follow these reasonable conditions”.</p> <p>The Guardian will decline to sign the revised Pentagon press pass policy because it places unacceptable restrictions on activities protected by the first amendment.</p>
