<p>Being overweight as a young child could double the risk of being obese in adulthood, according to research.</p> <p>Academics from the Netherlands said the body mass index (BMI) of six-year-olds is the most reliable predictor of obesity in adulthood and the first five years are critical in preventing weight gain.</p> <p>The study tracked the BMI of thousands of children in the Netherlands at age two, six, 10, 14 and 18, and found that every one-unit increase in BMI at age six more than doubled a child’s odds of being overweight or obese at 18.</p> <p>The research, presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Málaga, also found overweight children who reached a healthier weight before they turned six were no longer at higher risk of being overweight or obese in their late teens. But if they lost weight after that age, they still had an elevated chance.</p> <p>Of the 3,528 young people, 32.3% were considered overweight or obese at age two, with 22.3% at age six, 24.7% at age 10 and 20.6% at age 14.</p> <p>Many of these children were still classed as overweight or obese at 18.</p> <p>Jasmin de Groot, of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, said: “We need to understand how children grow and develop if we are to help future generations grow up healthier and give every child a chance at a happy, healthy life.”</p> <p>She added: “The first five years of a child’s life provide a fantastic opportunity to intervene and prevent them experiencing overweight and obesity in the years to come.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/nov/05/children-as-young-as-two-obesity-illness-in-england">Children as young as two treated for obesity-related illness in England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Separate research by the University of Bristol presented at the congress found the number of overweight teenagers in England has increased by 50%, from 22% in 2008-2010 to 33% in 2021-2023.</p> <p>Lead researcher Dr Dinesh Giri, consultant paediatric endocrinologist at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, said: “Over the past 15 years, obesity in adolescents has risen significantly due to a combination of increased consumption of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/mar/15/ultra-processed-babies-are-toddler-snacks-one-of-the-great-food-scandals-of-our-time">ultra-processed foods</a>, sedentary lifestyles driven by excessive screen time, inadequate sleep, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jan/02/urgent-referrals-of-children-in-mental-health-crisis-in-england-rise">rising mental health challenges</a>.</p> <p>“Additionally, reduced opportunities for physical activity and socioeconomic disparities have further contributed to an environment that promotes unhealthy lifestyles.”</p>
