<p>Chen Ning Yang, one of the world’s most renowned physicists and a Nobel prize winner, died on Saturday in Beijing at the age of 103 after an illness, state media outlet Xinhua has reported. </p> <p>Born in eastern China’s Hefei in Anhui province in 1922, Yang was a Chinese-American physicist who worked on statistical mechanics and symmetry principles in elementary particle physics.</p> <p>Yang shared the 1957 Nobel prize for physics with Tsung-Dao Lee, who died in 2024. </p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/aug/15/tsung-dao-lee-obituary">Tsung-Dao Lee obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They were awarded the prize for work that overthrew the widely accepted “parity laws” – that the forces acting on the fundamental subatomic particles are symmetric between left and right. In the popular description, they overthrew the concept of “mirror symmetry”.</p> <p>Before Lee and Yang questioned this fundamental principle, it was believed that the mirror image of any process displays a sequence of events that could equally well occur in the real world. In effect, there is no way to tell whether you are viewing a real event or its mirror image.</p>    <p>Yang was brought up in the atmosphere of the campus of Tsinghua University, outside Beijing, where his father was a professor of mathematics, according to biographical detail on the Nobel prize website.</p> <p>After completing his undergraduate and a master of science at Chinese universities, he moved to the US at the end of the second world war on a fellowship at the University of Chicago.</p> <p>There, he came under the influence of Prof Enrico Fermi, the Italian and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalized" title="Naturalized">naturalised</a> American physicist renowned for being the creator of the world’s first artificial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor" title="Nuclear reactor">nuclear reactor</a>.</p> <p>Since 1949, Yang was associated with the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, where he became a professor in 1955. In 2015 the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced that he had renounced US citizenship.</p> <p><em>With Reuters</em></p>
