<p>The boss of upmarket retailer Fortnum &amp; Mason has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-tariffs">Donald Trump’s trade war</a> has hit sales of its luxury tea exports to the US and forced up prices.</p> <p>Tom Athron, the London-based retailer’s chief executive, said Trump’s stricter country of origin rules and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/29/trump-tariffs-global-parcel-shipments-to-us-lose-exemption">end of the “de minimis” cost exemption</a> for parcels worth less than $800 (£587) had hit customers across the Atlantic.</p> <p>“The American authorities have told us – this is the tea industry in its entirety – that if you’ve got tea from China and India in your tea, then its country of origin [is] China or India, and therefore those enormous tariffs apply,” he <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1479686c-7aa5-466b-90b5-47dcefcb4136">told the Financial Times</a>.</p> <p>Trump, who landed in the UK on Tuesday for an unprecedented second state visit for a US president, last month <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/trump-tariff-india-russian-oil-purchase">imposed a 50% tariff on imports from India</a> as a punishment for buying Russian oil.</p> <p>And earlier this year, the US administration raised tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods as the trade war intensified, before dropping them to 30% in May to facilitate talks between the two trading giants. The world’s two largest economies held talks in Madrid this week to try to reach a potential deal.</p> <p>For a 250g canister of loose leaf Royal Blend tea, which retails to US consumers at $27.85, Fortnum’s has now been forced to charge delivery fees starting at $25.41 owing to the changes to US taxes and duties.</p> <p>The 318-year-old retailer, which holds two royal warrants, was not previously liable for any tariffs on the majority of its deliveries to US customers.</p> <p>US custom agents assess whether a “substantive transformation” has been made to a product to decide whether its country of origin is different from where the product has been sourced.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/16/donald-trump-state-visit-uk-agenda-key-takeaways">Donald Trump’s state visit to the UK: what’s on the agenda?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This process can be unclear to retailers, while the scrapping of “de miminis” rules has led to customers being wary of buying Fortnum &amp; Mason’s products, which are popular with expats and international buyers.</p> <p>“A lot of our things are sent as gifts [so] if you’re living in New York and I’m sending a present to you, I want to be sure that you’re not going to be landed with a $200 bill on receipt of your parcel,” said Athron. “It’s all in hand, logistically we’re immaculate, it just means prices will go up for US consumers.”</p> <p>Overseas sales of Fortnum &amp; Mason’s goods, including its famous hampers, were £12.5m in the year to July 2024, accounting for about 5.5% of total revenues.</p> <p>Wider inflationary pressure has led the retailer to raise the UK price of a 250g canister of loose leaf Breakfast Blend tea by almost 40% over the last five years.</p>
