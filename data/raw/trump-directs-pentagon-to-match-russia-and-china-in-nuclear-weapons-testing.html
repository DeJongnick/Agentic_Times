<p>Donald Trump has instructed the Pentagon to immediately start matching other nuclear powers in their testing of nuclear weapons, specifically citing Russia and China.</p> <p>In a <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115460423936412555">post to Truth Social</a>, Trump said “because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis. That process will begin immediately.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/oct/30/donald-trump-xi-jinping-meeting-live-updates">Donald Trump and Xi Jinping hold meeting in South Korea amid hopes for trade deal – live updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The post came less than an hour before Trump met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, in South Korea on Thursday morning in an effort to come to a trade war truce. The meeting was the first between the two since 2019.</p> <p>The United States last held a full nuclear weapons test in 1992, and China and Russia are not known to have held any such tests since the same era. Trump’s reference to “on an equal basis” left it unclear what weapons testing could take place, or whether he was referring to displays of power similar to those recently conducted by Russia.</p> <p>Since 1998, no country other than North Korea is confirmed to have conducted a full explosive nuclear test. But nuclear-armed countries such as the US have subsequently carried out simulated nuclear explosions using high-powered computers, as well as related nuclear physics experiments, tests of nuclear-capable missiles, warhead mechanisms and “subcritical” tests of nuclear materials to ensure their arsenals remain viable.</p> <p>Pentagon officials did not immediately respond to questions about the announcement from Trump.</p> <p>Speaking on Air Force One after his meeting with Xi, Trump said he would “like to see” denuclearisation, adding that the US was “talking to Russia about that”.</p> <p>“And China would be added to that if we do something,” he said, without elaborating.</p> <p>On Thursday China’s foreign ministry told a regular press conference that Beijing hoped the US would honour the non-proliferation treaty “and take actions that contribute to regional peace, rather than the opposite”.</p> <p>“We would like to emphasise that China remains committed to the path of peaceful development, pursuing defensive national security policies and friendly diplomatic policies,” said a spokesperson, Guo Jiakun.<strong> </strong></p> <p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said on Sunday that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia">Russia</a> had successfully tested its “unique” nuclear-propelled Burevestnik cruise missile, which can carry a nuclear warhead. The Kremlin described it as part of efforts to “ensure the country’s national security”. Trump later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/27/russia-cruise-missile-test-trump-putin">described Putin’s</a> announcement as “not appropriate”. Sergei Ryabkov, a close aide to Putin, told Russian media that Moscow had notified the US in advance about the test.</p> <p>The timing of Russia’s Burevestnik testing is notable, coming amid the Kremlin’s intensified nuclear posturing and a break in US-Russia talks over the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Putin said Russia had also tested a Poseidon nuclear-powered super torpedo that military analysts say is capable of devastating coastal regions by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/30/ukraine-war-briefing-putin-boasts-of-nuclear-driven-torpedo-that-would-swamp-cities-with-radioactive-tsunami">exploding a nuclear warhead and triggering vast radioactive ocean swells</a> that would swamp and contaminate cities.</p> <p>Trump also falsely noted in his Truth Social post that the US had more nuclear weapons than any other country, a claim he repeated during his Air Force One press conference. <strong> </strong>Russia currently has the most confirmed nuclear weapons, with more than 5,500 nuclear warheads, while the US has 5,044 nuclear weapons, according to the <a href="https://www.icanw.org/nuclear_arsenals">International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons</a>.</p> <p>The last full nuclear test by the US, codenamed “Divider,” was carried out on 23 September 1992 at what is now called the Nevada National Security Site. The president at the time, George HW Bush, announced a moratorium on underground nuclear testing that same year. The US still, however, has the ability to resume tests at the Nevada National Security Site.</p> <p>In response to Trump’s post, the Nevada congresswoman Dina Titus <a href="https://x.com/repdinatitus/status/1983709442609967410">posted</a> on X: “Absolutely not. I’ll be introducing legislation to put a stop to this.”</p> <p>Despite repeated statements from both Moscow and Washington about wanting to halt the arms race, little progress has been made. The Kremlin has recently criticised Trump’s push to develop a missile shield – known as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/30/trump-golden-dome-missile-defense">the Golden Dome</a> – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/20/trump-appoints-michael-guetlin-golden-dome">which he claims</a> would make the US impervious to attack.</p> <p>During his first term, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/trump-wanted-dramatic-increase-nuclear-arsenal-meeting-military-leaders-n809701">Trump reportedly sought to increase the US nuclear arsenal “tenfold”</a>. </p> <p>In December 2016, he tweeted: “The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Helen Davidson in Taipei and Jason Tzu Kuan Lu</em></p>
