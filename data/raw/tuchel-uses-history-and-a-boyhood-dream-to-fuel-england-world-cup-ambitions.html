<p>Thomas Tuchel has not been short of recommended reading material since his appointment as England’s head coach.&nbsp;Or documentaries to watch. The suggestions have come from&nbsp;everywhere, but especially the media, who are eager to help&nbsp;out with presumed gaps in his&nbsp;knowledge of the nation’s football history. This is the real cost&nbsp;of turning to a guy from&nbsp;overseas.</p> <p>Has Tuchel seen the fly-on-the-wall programme with Graham Taylor from 1994: An Impossible Job? No? He has to put that right. In fact, wouldn’t it be great if Tuchel could allow the cameras in for a sequel as he targets glory at the 2026 World Cup? It was put to him a few months back. Strangely, he did not seem keen.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/10/marc-guehi-england-serbia-world-cup-qualifer-crystal-palace-liverpool">Marc Guéhi turns frustration into triumph to boost England claims | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for the books, he has been given plenty, the latest handed over on Tuesday night after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/09/serbia-england-world-cup-2026-qualifier-match-report">the 5-0 win against Serbia </a>enabled his team to take a grip on the automatic qualifying spot from Group K. It was a copy of All Played Out by Pete Davies – the behind-the-scenes takedown of the England circus at the 1990 World Cup.</p> <p>Tuchel, though, knows his stuff. Especially on Italia 90, which he followed as an obsessive 16-year-old fan. “I was watching like crazy&nbsp;… I was Chris Waddle with the collar up in my garden,” he said, gesturing as to how the England winger wore his shirt. “I was Paul Gascoigne. I was all these kinds of&nbsp;guys.”</p> <p>There was a tenderness to the reflections, born perhaps out of the realisation that he was primed to fulfil a boyhood dream and compete at a World Cup, although he knows qualification is not yet&nbsp;assured.</p> <p>“There was no internet back then, no online focusing … there was just this book you got from the Euros and from the World Cup,” he said. “I always got it as a present, either for my birthday or for Christmas, so we had these books and all the photos from every match of a World Cup.</p> <p>“I looked at these things for four years. I knew every player. I looked at their shoes and their style and this was something magical. That’s why, if you know me, you know what it means to me to hopefully go to a World Cup, what it means to me to qualify and go with England&nbsp;… just a brilliant moment in my journey. I enjoy it a lot and I will give my very best.”</p>    <p>It was good to see him so relaxed, the mood around the England camp utterly transformed by the swatting aside of Serbia. Previously, there had been a flatness, the performances underwhelming. Tuchel’s England made a statement and the sense of possibility has&nbsp;returned.</p> <p>He had a jokey “no comment” when asked whether his native West Germany deserved to beat England in the semi-finals at Italia&nbsp;90, the night of Gazza’s tears and Waddle’s penalty shootout miss. And there was a sparkle about him as he talked up the aspect of the Serbia game that most pleased him – the teamwork. “It was the effort we put in to help each other out, the intensity. We never stopped running.</p> <p>“There was no attitude after a mistake, no frustration, no waving, no eyeballing, no bad words. It was just a team ready to work and put 90 minutes’ effort in.”</p> <p>It was easy to feel another echo of England’s past and, again, it is one with which Tuchel suggested he was familiar. For years, there has been a tendency among England managers to pick the best 11 players and try to squeeze them into a team, regardless of whether the component parts fit. Call it the Lampard-Gerrard principle.</p> <p>At Euro 2024, Gareth Southgate was left to conclude that “your best players are your best players” as he tried to accommodate Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden. Lee Carsley would go a step further last October when he started Bellingham, Foden, Cole Palmer, Bukayo Saka and Anthony Gordon against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/10/england-greece-nations-league-match-report">Greece in the Nations League</a> and lost 2-1.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/sep/09/fearless-rogers-leads-england-to-double-act-of-silencing-locals-and-their-doubters">Fearless Rogers leads England to double act of silencing locals and their doubters | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A major takeaway from this international window has been Tuchel’s quest for clarity and it has been most evident in how he has sorted his players into very specific positions – right and left centre-halves, for example; 6s, 8s and 10s in midfield. There is room for flexibility, but not too much.</p> <p>He wants the framework of the team first and it feels as if he will then make either/or choices for the starting roles. What that means in the No 10 position will be particularly interesting because the choices are extensive – Bellingham, Foden, Palmer, Morgan Rogers, Eberechi Eze, Morgan Gibbs-White. Can Tuchel be the one to get the tough selection decisions right for the overall good?</p> <p>“We try to be very clear to the players and have a new start,” he said. “One of the learnings from the previous camp in June was: ‘The players need clarity. What do we play in this camp, how do we play, what is the structure and where do I compete?’</p> <p>“So we told them and trained them very, very clearly because everyone comes from a different club and a different style. From there, step by step, the intensity increased, the accuracy came and I’m happy it all clicked against&nbsp;Serbia.”</p>
