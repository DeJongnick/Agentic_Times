<p>The problem with a successful playbook is that you eventually keep doing the same thing mechanically. Fresh from intimidating ABC and CBS with <a href="https://theconversation.com/abcs-and-cbss-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief-261006">meritless lawsuits</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/18/trump-libel-lawsuit-wsj-dow-jones-rupert-murdoch">suing</a> Rupert Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal reporters who broke the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/trump-jeffrey-epstein-birthday-letter-we-have-certain-things-in-common-f918d796">story</a> of a lewd birthday message for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. But, unlike with the frivolous allegations against the big broadcasters, there’s clearly a fact of the matter here: an authentic letter either exists or it does not; and there is plenty to be revealed in the process of finding out. Trump’s time-proven move – whatever happens, just counter-attack – is likely to keep the very story he wants to kill alive. Meanwhile, the other elements of his playbook – deny, deflect, distract – only work if journalists and Democrats play along. They, not the seemingly all-important Trump base, are the actors to watch.</p> <p>We still debate whether Trumpism is a substantial ideology or not; what we are missing is that Trumpism, for sure, is a set of tactics for exploiting weaknesses in the US political, legal and media systems. Some of these tactics were inherited <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bkkTQZW5Uc">from his mentor Roy Cohn</a> and many are now being adopted by Trump’s followers – one must never admit guilt; one must always swing back; and one must reject, or ideally entirely bury, defeats (such as Trump’s case against Bob Woodward and Woodward’s publisher being <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/07/18/media/trump-bob-woodward-simon-schuster-lawsuit-dismissed">dismissed</a> recently).</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/18/wall-street-journal-trump-epstein">Trump worked to kill a story about his friendship with Epstein. Now we know why | Margaret Sullivan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But there is also a less obvious element, and it has to do with managing political time (a <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/P/bo3640130.html">challenge</a> for all politicians, come to think of it). The point is not just seizing opportunities or exploiting opponents’ weaknesses in a timely manner; rather, it is about the art of speeding things up or slowing them down to one’s advantage. Think of how we appear to have become inured to Trump doing and saying things that would have ended previous presidencies (OK, previous presidents did not have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/10/trump-media-white-house-communications">AI-generated images</a> of themselves as kings or popes available, but still).</p> <p>One reason is this: an administration that faces one or two big scandals in a four-year period may well be damaged beyond repair; one that produces three very big scandals a day seems to have nothing to worry about since no one can keep up. It is difficult to stick with one story, as the newest outrage already appears so much bigger (the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/trump-qatar-plane">Qatar plane scandal</a> can feel like it happened years ago). To be sure, not all scandals are consciously produced, but there is little doubt that Trump’s posting an AI-generated clip of Barack Obama being arrested in the White House and identifying Obama as a “ringleader” of election fraud are meant to distract – which is not to deny that they would justify impeachment.</p> <p>While the frequency of scandals is maximized to game the news cycle, the legal system is used to slow things down. Releasing the grand jury testimonies in the Epstein case will take time, if the request is not rejected altogether by courts (as has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/23/us/politics/florida-epstein-transcripts-unsealed-denied.html">already happened in Florida</a>). Even if they are released, they are unlikely to contain anything relevant about Trump. The calculation is that, a few weeks from now, the files will be forgotten.</p> <p>None of this is to suggest Trump is a master Machiavellian who can manipulate Americans (or even just his base) at will. His approach partly works because institutional and cultural contexts have changed: news cycles are shorter, as are attention spans. His behavior has become progressively normalized – and generalized: shamelessness once unique to him is now in the manual of required GOP conduct (just think of blatant lies about Medicaid). Most important, a free press sticking relentlessly with scandals and ignoring intimidation can no longer be taken for granted; broadcasters in particular have become vulnerable to parent companies putting profits before everything else. Democrats, understandably not wanting to look like they mainly focus on the sordid details of the Epstein story, are tempted to move on and deal with the vaunted “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5408200-pelosi-epstein-files-distraction/">kitchen-table issues</a>”. But it should give them pause that the story is apparently so scary for the other side that Republicans would rather <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/22/house-recess-jeffrey-epstein-files">shut down the House</a> than deal with it in any shape or form.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/19/trump-ghost-jeffrey-epstein">Trump cannot dispel the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein | Sidney Blumenthal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Are they right to panic? For sure, Trump made a mistake with his <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114842356238631061">social media post</a> urging followers to move on, which was the equivalent of “don’t think of an elephant” (while also providing further evidence for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/20/streisand-effect-internet-law">Streisand effect</a>: censorship generates the very attention meant to be avoided). Trump lobbying Murdoch to kill the story will give pause to all still naive enough to think of Republicans as free speech defenders. By now, the fact that releasing only the grand jury testimony is relatively meaningless has sunk in and – never mind the base – what political scientists call “low-information voters” will be left with a lasting impression of a Trump-Epstein connection or at least a chaotic administration. In the lawsuit, Trump has to prove “<a href="https://www.pbs.org/standards/media-law-101/defamation/">actual malice</a>” on the part of the newspaper – a difficult hurdle to jump. Unlike with the Russia investigation, Trump himself is the instigator of a lengthy process overshadowing his presidency; unlike with the many investigations between his presidential terms, when his lawyers outran the clock, time is not really on his side. In fact, he might be lucky if the case is dismissed on a technicality – <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/trumps-wall-street-journal-suit-over-epstein-story-faces-timing-hurdle-2025-07-22/">he apparently failed to comply with a Florida law</a> that requires giving defendants five days’ notice.</p> <ul> <li><p>Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton University</p></li> </ul>
