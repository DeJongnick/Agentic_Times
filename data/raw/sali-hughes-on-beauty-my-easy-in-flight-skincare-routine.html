<p>As I write this, I am about to embark on a&nbsp;long-haul flight for which I packed my carry-on with newfound abandon. Travellers to many airports are now free from the confines of post‑9/11 liquids restrictions and the&nbsp;dreaded plastic ziplock bag, so the&nbsp;opportunities for an in-flight skincare moment are greater.</p> <p>I try to embark with a clean face, but&nbsp;if that isn’t possible I freshen up&nbsp;first with Simple’s <strong><a href="https://www.boots.com/simple-kind-to-skin-cleansing-facial-wipes-7-wipes-10132742">Kind to Skin Cleansing Facial Wipes</a></strong> (£2 for seven), before layering on a series of humectant skincare products to counterbalance horribly dry cabin air.</p> <p>I was sceptical about Summer Fridays’ <strong><a href="https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/p/summer-fridays-jet-lag-deep-hydration-serum-30ml/15433829/">Jet Lag Deep Hydration Serum</a></strong> (£44 for 30ml) since I couldn’t see what was flight-specific about it beyond the cleverly marketed name. But actually it’s very good and needn’t be confined to travel, especially if you’re prone to very dehydrated skin year-round. The ingredients list is essentially a hydration supergroup: glycerin, squalane, hyaluronic acid, propanediol and ceramides, and the effects can be seen and felt for many hours. Ungreasy but rich and cosseting, it adds temporary bounce and smoothness to the face, restoring a look of good health.</p>  <aside class="element element-pullquote element--inline"> <blockquote> <p>This facial mist propels a fine vapour so you needn’t worry about splattering travellers in neighbouring seats</p> </blockquote> </aside> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/jul/23/sali-hughes-on-beauty-teenagers-sunscreens-spf">Sali Hughes on beauty: if your teen won’t wear sunscreen, try tempting them with these products</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For in-flight refreshment – aside from a cold wine – I always have a&nbsp;facial mist on standby. They’re a&nbsp;great way to top up on moisture and&nbsp;to punctuate waking and dining moments, where you have to stop vegetating and look livelier. My newest acquisition is <strong><a href="https://www.rhodeskin.com/en-gb/products/glazing-mist">Glazing Mist</a></strong> (£30 for 80ml) from the consistently good Rhode. It propels a fine, almost vapour-like mist, so you needn’t worry&nbsp;about splattering travellers in neighbouring seats. The thin, milky liquid gives a pretty, glowy finish and has an extremely gentle, soothing feel – moisturising without stickiness. When home, it can be stored in the fridge for instant relief in hot weather.</p> <p>I stick on hydrating under-eye gel patches an hour or so before landing, and while they certainly help me look less knackered, they are there as much for something to do on a long and boring flight (the in-sky equivalent of necking a whole bag of wine gums while driving on the motorway). I&nbsp;typically reach for any I have at the time, but if I&nbsp;were shopping for some, I’d generally opt for Patchology’s<strong> </strong><strong><a href="https://www.spacenk.com/uk/brands/p/patchology">Eye&nbsp;</a></strong><strong><a href="https://www.spacenk.com/uk/brands/p/patchology">Gels</a></strong> (from £4 a&nbsp;pair), since they’re inexpensive and do the job well.</p> <p>Before landing, I add much-needed colour and SPF, such as Merit’s silky, pared-back <strong><a href="https://www.sephora.co.uk/p/merit-beauty-the-uniform-tinted-mineral-sunscreen-spf50-50ml">The Uniform</a></strong> (£34), a tinted mineral sunscreen with added perk. </p> <p><em>Searching for more inspiration?
