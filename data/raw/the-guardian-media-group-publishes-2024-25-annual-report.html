That’s why it is fundamental that we are in a strong financial position and continue to make progress with our strategy to be more global, more digital and more reader-funded. A well defined growth strategy and careful cost control meant we closed the year ahead of expectations on both revenue and cost, which is a significant achievement in a turbulent market.”</p> <p><strong>Guardian editor-in-chief Katharine Viner said:</strong></p> <p>“At a time when media freedom is under threat, we’re growing our global operation with rigorous, independent journalism that is freely available to all.

It’s a remarkable number and testament to our powerful relationship with our audience, our strategy of continuous innovation and how much our readers care about Guardian journalism.”</p> <p><strong>Guardian Media Group chair Charles Gurassa said:</strong></p> <p>“The news media sector continues to experience rapid transformation. The Guardian has responded by embracing the challenges and setting out on an ambitious long-term investment plan to become more accessible to global audiences.
