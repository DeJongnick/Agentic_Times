<h1>The Guardian view on modern masculinity: boys need mentors, not marketers </h1>

<p>Boys used to be raised by their parents. Now, as they grow up, an increasing number are coming under the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gdqzxypdzo">influence</a> of toxic online figures who push a hollow, misogynistic version of masculinity. This isn’t&nbsp;helping&nbsp;their character or their relationships. But it does work for a digital world where worth is measured in money, status and appearance. Girls have&nbsp;long seen their mental health <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/10/by-mollycoddling-our-children-were-fuelling-mental-illness-in-teenagers">suffer</a> from social media comparisons and phone addiction. But that doesn’t make it any less troubling now that boys are being similarly affected.</p> <p>In his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/mar/19/gareth-southgate-rails-against-callous-toxic-influencers-in-dimbleby-lecture">Richard Dimbleby lecture</a> for the BBC, Sir&nbsp;Gareth Southgate made a cogent case that young men are being failed by modern society – not just by absent role models, but by a culture that doesn’t acknowledge failure and vulnerability while exposing&nbsp;them to damaging digital influences. Without&nbsp;real-life guidance, they can withdraw, becoming reluctant to talk or unable to express their emotions. Boys can fall into an unhealthy world of gaming, gambling and pornography.</p> <p>This void, the former England football manager warned, is also being filled by “callous, manipulative and toxic influencers whose sole drive is for their own gain”. They trick <a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/what-is-manosphere-incel-culture-170530500.html">young men</a> into believing that success&nbsp;is measured by money or emotionless dominance. That seems hard to refute – and is affecting&nbsp;society for the worse. Polls suggest men and women belonging to gen Z are more <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/gen-z-men-and-women-most-divided-on-gender-equality-global-study-shows#:~:text=Around%20six%20in%2010%20(57,women%20who%20hold%20this%20opinion.">polarised</a> than any&nbsp;other generation on questions about feminism, gender roles and women’s rights – with a clear increase in sexist attitudes. There must be a concerted effort to&nbsp;reverse such trends.</p> <p>That boys are now more likely to own a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceqjpzg0qwno#:~:text=The%20Centre%20for%20Social%20Justice%20report%20highlights%20how%202.5%20million,to%20live%20with%20their%20dad.">smartphone</a> than to live with their dad is striking. Politicians, enamoured with hi-tech progress, must&nbsp;reckon with the impact: it’s now easier to connect to a global network than to build a local community, easier to consume endless content than&nbsp;to find real-world mentors.</p> <p> Encouraging boys to be resilient, empathetic and capable of real relationships requires investment in families, schools and youth clubs that foster connection. They need space to be themselves – and the confidence to reject the empty validation of a social media feed. Resilience isn’t innate; it’s built through experience, effort and good example.</p> <p>If <a href="https://publishingperspectives.com/.well-known/sgcaptcha/?r=%2F2025%2F03%2Fcarnegie-medals-masculinity-themed-titles-through-to-shortlists%2F&amp;amp;y=ipr:104.28.224.66:1742406076.614">literature</a> – as evidenced by the young adult novels on the Carnegie medal shortlist – is beginning to explore the struggles of young boys, mainstream entertainment is exploring a darker narrative. The Netflix drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/mar/13/adolescence-review-the-closest-thing-to-tv-perfection-in-decades">Adolescence</a>, about a teenage boy accused of murder, has had the country – from the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/starmer-backs-campaign-to-show-adolescence-in-schools-13331968">prime minister</a> down – glued to their screens. While the show has rightfully garnered rave reviews, boys should not be seen as dangerous or inherently suspect – they are children who need care and support just as much as girls do.</p> <p>Apple’s iPhone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/jan/10/news.business">arrived</a> in 2007. Mobile social media apps followed, offering access and unimaginable connections to a new generation. But they didn’t just change masculinity – they monetised it. Instead of mentors, boys get marketers; instead of guidance, they get grifters; instead of role models, they get algorithms. Sir&nbsp;Gareth stressed the need to create a world where&nbsp;young people feel valued beyond just success. Because when society worships wealth and power, it is the young who suffer most from knowing they have neither.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
