<p>A flotilla seeking to break Israel’s aid blockade of Gaza has said it was attacked by a drone for the second time in less than 24 hours.</p> 
<p>The Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which is carrying pro-Palestinian activists, including Greta Thunberg, said in a statement early on Wednesday that it had been attacked by another drone, which dropped an incendiary device on one of its boats, the Alma, as it was moored in the port of Sidi Bou Said in Tunisia. None of the passengers or crew were harmed and no structural damage was caused, it said</p> 
<p>The flotilla posted a video on Instagram of Wednesday’s attack that shows a luminous object hitting the boat and fire erupting on board. It was not possible to immediately verify the video.</p> 
<p>The group said the British-flagged Alma had sustained fire damage to its top deck and that an investigation was under way.</p> 
<p>The reported attack came a day after GSF said that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/09/flotilla-carrying-aid-to-gaza-struck-by-flaming-object-video-shows-sidi-bou-said-port-tunisia">another one of its vessels had been struck by a drone</a> in Tunisian waters. Tunisia’s interior ministry said reports of a drone hitting the boat on Tuesday had “no basis in truth”, and that a fire broke out on the vessel itself.</p> 
<p>A Tunisian coastguard spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>GSF later <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DOZuNFhiI_L/?short_redirect=1">posted an image</a> of what it said was a “charred electronic device” recovered from the deck. “While a full investigation is ongoing, the presence of such a device provides further indication that the boat was deliberately targeted,” it said.</p>

<p>Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, posted video of the burning Alma and said it indicated a drone attack.</p> 
<p>“Video evidence suggests a drone – with no light so it could not be seen – dropped a device that set the deck of the Alma boat on fire,” she wrote on social media. ‘‘Authoritative sources suggest the attack involved an incendiary grenade, wrapped in plastic materials soaked in fuel, which may have ignited before even hitting the vessel.”</p> 
<p>Speaking from onboard the Alma, the activist Thiago Ávila said: “We know what’s happening is outrageous, but it’s nothing compared to what Palestinians have endured for the past 22 months. “That’s why we keep going, why we set sail for Gaza. It’s what most people on this planet want and hope for. They’re tired of seeing children starve, hospitals bombed, schools reduced to rubble.”</p> 
<p>At 33 metres, the Alma is one of the largest vessels in the Spanish delegation, one of the so-called mother ships. Like the flagship Family, it had been anchored off Sidi Bou Said when the reported attack occurred, waiting for the right weather and logistical conditions to meet up with the Italian delegation, which remains in Sicily awaiting the green light to set sail, converge with the Spanish and Tunisian crews, and head together towards Gaza.</p> 
<p>The activists said they would continue their “peaceful voyage” on Wednesday as planned, as the flotilla “presses forward with determination and resolve”.</p> 
<p>The flotilla is supported by delegations from 44 countries, including Thunberg and the leftwing Portuguese politician Mariana Mortágua. Four Italian politicians– an MP, a senator and two MEPs – are expected to join the flotilla.</p> 
<p>Italy’s foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said he would call his Israeli counterpart, Gideon Sa’ar, in the coming days to discuss the flotilla’s operation. “We can’t do anything other than guarantee full consular support to the Italians [involved] who may encounter problems, if and when they arrive on Israeli soil,’’ he said.</p> 
<p>Israel has maintained the blockade on the coastal territory since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007, saying it is needed to prevent weapons smuggling.</p> 
<p>The blockade on food and other aid has been tightened throughout the current war. A global hunger monitor said in July <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/31/the-mathematics-of-starvation-how-israel-caused-a-famine-in-gaza">part of the enclave was suffering from famine</a>.</p> 
<p>In June, Israeli naval forces boarded and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/10/greta-thunberg-accuses-israel-of-kidnapping-yacht-crew-gaza">seized a British-flagged yacht carrying Thunberg</a>, among others. In 2010 Israel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/31/israeli-attacks-gaza-flotilla-activists">killed nine Turkish activists</a> when it raided the Mavi Marmara, which was also trying to break the blockade.</p> 
<p>The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
