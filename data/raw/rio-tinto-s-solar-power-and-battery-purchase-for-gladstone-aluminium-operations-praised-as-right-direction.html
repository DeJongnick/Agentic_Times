<p>Mining company Rio Tinto will buy solar power and battery storage capacity for its Gladstone aluminium operations in a deal environmentalists have hailed as a “major step” forward. </p> <p>The company has signed 20-year agreements with Edify Energy to buy 90% of the power and battery storage capacity generated by the Smoky Creek and Guthrie’s Gap solar stations, located in central Queensland, Rio Tinto said.</p> <p>Kellie Parker, chief executive of Rio Tinto, said the agreements would provide “affordable, reliable and low carbon energy for decades to come”, as traditional energy sources became more expensive.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Together with existing wind and solar agreements, renewable energy was now expected to meet 80% of the Boyne smelter’s electricity needs, the company said, reducing the facility’s direct emissions by 70%, equivalent to 5.6m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.</p> <p>Construction on the projects, located 75km south of Rockhampton, was expected to begin in late 2025 and completed in 2028, delivering 600MW of solar power and 600MW/2,400MWh of battery storage.</p> <p>Rio Tinto said it would continue to investigate further renewable energy investments to support its Gladstone operations, which employs more than 3,000 workers, a third of which were based at the Boyne aluminium smelter.</p> <p>The Edify Energy chief executive, John Cole, said the collaboration was an important commitment towards a sustainable future for the country’s industrial sector.</p> <h2>‘Right direction’</h2> <p>Dr Tessa Leach, a senior industry project manager at Climateworks Centre and lead author of a report on <a href="https://www.climateworkscentre.org/resource/seizing-gladstones-low-carbon-opportunity/">decarbonising Gladstone’s heavy industry</a>, described the announcement as a “major step in the right direction”.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/mar/03/premier-claims-wa-a-renewable-energy-powerhouse-but-leaked-document-shows-wind-and-solar-projects-have-stalled">Premier claims WA a ‘renewable energy powerhouse’ but leaked document shows wind and solar projects have ‘stalled’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Low-cost renewable energy would enable the region’s energy-intensive industries to remain competitive, by making the most of its natural renewable energy advantages, she said.</p> <p>To reach its potential as a hub for clean industry, Gladstone would need access to new wind, solar and energy storage projects at the scale required to provide for electricity, heat and alternative feedstock, she said.</p> <p>John Grimes, the Smart Energy Council chief executive, said Rio Tinto’s decision showed how quickly the world’s biggest mining companies were moving towards renewable energy.</p> <p>It also reflected increasing global demand for decarbonised aluminium, iron and other metals, he said.</p> <p>“Australia’s most energy intensive sectors are backing renewables because they are more reliable, cheaper and cleaner than fossil fuel alternatives,” he said.</p>
