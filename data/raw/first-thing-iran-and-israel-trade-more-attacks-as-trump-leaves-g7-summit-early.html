<p>Good morning.</p> 
<p>Donald Trump dramatically <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/donald-trump-g7-summit-iran-israel-ceasefire-offer">left the G7 summit in Canada a day early</a> to rush back to Washington, with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, claiming the US leader was considering the prospect of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.</p> 
<p>“There is indeed an offer to meet and exchange. An offer was made especially to get a ceasefire and to then kickstart broader discussions,” Macron told reporters at the G7. “We have to see now whether the sides will follow.”</p> 
<p>Trump told reporters he had to leave early for “obvious reasons”, but later posted that his early exit had “nothing to do with” working on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Trump described his reasons as “much bigger than that” in a post on his Truth Social platform.</p>

 <li><p><strong>What is the latest in the Israel-Iran conflict?</strong> Attacks continued on both sides. On Tuesday, the Israeli military claimed to have assassinated Ali Shadmani, who it identified as Iran’s wartime chief of staff, Reuters reported. On Monday, Trump told Iranians to “immediately evacuate” Tehran, not long after Israel told people to evacuate a large part of the city ahead of a bombing campaign. One airstrike hit the building of Iran’s state-run television while on air.</p></li>

<h2><strong>At least 51 Palestinians killed in Gaza waiting for food trucks, says health ministry</strong></h2> 
<p>At least <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/dozens-killed-in-gaza-waiting-for-food-trucks-says-health-ministry">51 Palestinians were killed</a> in Gaza on Tuesday morning while waiting for UN and commercial trucks to enter the territory with desperately needed food, according to Gaza’s health ministry and a local hospital.</p> 
<p>Palestinian witnesses said Israeli forces carried out an airstrike on a nearby home before opening fire toward the crowd in the southern city of Khan Younis. The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>Did this involve the new Israel- and US-supported aid delivery network?</strong> The killings did not appear to be related to the program, which was introduced last month and has been marred by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/11/israeli-forces-kill-at-least-60-palestinians-seeking-food-aid-in-gaza-health-officials-say">controversy and violence</a>.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>What is happening with that network?</strong> Israeli forces have repeatedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/16/gaza-food-centre-shooting-israel-ghf">opened fire on crowds</a> trying to reach food distribution points run by the US- and Israel-backed aid group, local health officials say, with scores killed and hundreds wounded.</p></li>

<p>Russia launched a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/17/russia-drone-missile-strikes-kyiv-ukraine">sustained missile and drone attack on Kyiv</a> in the early hours of Tuesday, killing at least 14 people and wounding 55, in what was one of the deadliest nights in the Ukrainian capital since the full-scale war began in spring 2022.</p> 
<p>The toll seemed likely to rise as several sites across the capital were hit. At a nine-story Soviet-era apartment block in the west of Kyiv, an apparent direct missile hit led to part of the building collapsing, leaving a gaping hole and a pile of rubble in the middle of the block.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What damage have the attacks inflicted?</strong> Thirty apartments were destroyed in the strike, said the Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko. “There could be people under the rubble, and we can’t exclude that the number of dead may rise,” he said.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>What’s the latest on peace deal negotiations?</strong> US-led attempts to start a peace process have largely failed, with Russia ignoring Donald Trump’s demands to agree to a full ceasefire before talks begin. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had been due to meet Trump at the G7 summit in Canada on Tuesday.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Stat of the day: The $9 congestion toll has transformed New York City streets – but can it survive Trump?</strong></h2> 
<p>From 5 January, drivers entering lower Manhattan began paying a $9 congestion toll, which it is hoped will raise $500m annually for infrastructure upgrades. The policy has produced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/jun/16/new-york-congestion-pricing">impressive early results</a>: buses are moving up to 20% faster, 70,000 fewer vehicles are entering the area each day, and noise complaints on busy streets dropped 70%. Donald Trump, however, has pushed to revoke its federal approval (granted in 2023 under Joe Biden). “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD,” he wrote in February. “Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!” The reports of its death may have been greatly exaggerated, but can congestion pricing survive the president?</p>
