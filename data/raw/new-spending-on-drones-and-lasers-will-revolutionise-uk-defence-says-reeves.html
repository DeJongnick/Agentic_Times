<p>New money for drones and laser weapons to “revolutionise” Britain’s armed forces has been announced by Rachel Reeves as part of a £2.2bn rise in defence spending.</p> <p>Vowing to turn the UK into “a defence industrial superpower”, the chancellor used <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/26/spring-statement-rachel-reeves-unveils-even-deeper-cuts-to-welfare-and-public-services">her spring statement</a> to unveil plans aimed at boosting arms exports and reaching a target of spending 2.7% of GDP on the sector by 2027.</p> <p>Four Royal Navy warships are to get DragonFire laser weaponry that use intense light beams to cut through targets as part of a technological boost. A minimum 10% of the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) equipment budget will go on novel technologies that include drones and AI-enabled kit.</p> <p>The boost comes on top of £6.4bn that Keir Starmer had pledged in February would go towards the defence budget by 2027.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/mar/26/spring-statement-2025-key-points-rachel-reeves">Spring statement 2025: key points at a glance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other announcements include plans to create a new quango, the Defence Growth Board, in a move that Reeves said would “maximise the benefits from every pound of taxpayers’ money that we spend” and put defence at the heart of industrial strategy.</p> <p>UK Export Finance (UKEF), a government agency that is supporting UK businesses with export finance, will also get £2bn to provide loans for overseas buyers of UK defence products.</p> <p>Arms companies welcoming the statement included the UK subsidiary of Anduril, the US military drone manufacturer backed by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel. The company – which has said it is considering opening a factory in Britain – said in a statement released through the Treasury that the spring statement’s defence plan “echoes our thoughts and our values as we work hand in glove with the government”.</p> <p>However, the extra defence funding will come at the cost of cuts to the aid budget, and Reeves was accused of “rushing through the cuts” by Bond: the membership body for NGOs. They were surprised the cuts were confirmed to start immediately from the new financial year (2025-26).</p> <p>Tobias Ellwood, a former minister at the MoD, also said he was concerned that the money was coming at the cost of Britain’s “soft power” capability, adding: “You can’t tackle Ebola with more tanks.” But he gave credit to Reeves, describing the 10% for technology as a “positive start”.</p> <p>“A defence growth board is a good idea. It’s not in the mindset of military personnel.”</p> <p>Dr David Blagden, an associate professor of international security and strategy at the University of Exeter, said confirmation that the extra defence funding will also be used to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/apr/25/mod-privatise-military-housing-disaster-guy-hands">refurbish housing stock used by armed forces and their families</a> was particularly welcome as accommodation problems had become a drag on personnel retention.</p> <p>Speeding up the introduction of energy weapons into the navy was also promising, he said, as there had often been a “glacial lead time” between the development of new kit and its arrival in the hands of Britain’s post-cold war armed forces.</p> <p>“But of course, we still need to be realistic that this is a useful bit of extra money that will help to sustain the current programme; it’s not a massive splurge that will allow the services to meaningfully increase their numbers of soldiers, ships or aircraft,” he added.</p> <p>“I am not going to make any apologies for putting more money in defence,” Reeves told the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn after he challenged her to end the two-child benefit cap.</p>
