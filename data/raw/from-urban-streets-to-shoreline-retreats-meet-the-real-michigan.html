<p>Here’s a secret: Michigan’s Great Lakes offer sandy retreats and sunset views that give any tropical paradise a run for its money – minus the palm trees. Instead, you get views dotted with pines, coastal wetland, sculpted dunes, bluffs from melting glaciers, bedrock shorelines, some dating to 2 billion years old, and lighthouses standing sentinel. It has more character than a Hemingway novel.</p> <p>The Upper Peninsula, or “the U.P.”, as it’s affectionately known, serves rugged beauty with a side of cheek. It’s the kind of place where the deer and the moose play chicken, and the locals, known as Yoopers, are as famous for their dry wit as they are for their pasties.</p> <h2>A four-season playground</h2> <p>Autumn (or fall in the US) paints the landscape in vivid hues that seem like an Instagram filter, while winter transforms the state into a snowy wonderland. Spring and summer? That’s when Michigan really shows off, with innumerable nature trails, wild watersports, and camping spots that are like starlit sanctuaries, proving you don’t need saltwater to have a good time.</p> <h2>Tread mindfully</h2> <p>As you find yourself enjoying the outdoor wonder, keep in mind these pristine places deserve a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Around Michigan, there is a growing awareness of the benefits of responsible, or regenerative travel. It’s a philosophical promise to the locals who live here and travellers yet to arrive that while you’re enjoying the pristine lakes, national parks and local cuisine you’re not affecting the landscape in a way that might prevent others from enjoying the same experiences in the future. There are some easy ways to enjoy Michigan with a light footprint.</p> <p>Kayaking is a popular watersport here, and some of the best paddling opportunities can be had through <a href="https://www.michiganwatertrails.org/mipaddlestewards.asp" rel="nofollow">Michigan’s Water Trails</a>. Sign up to become a paddle steward; the funds are used to protect the waterways from invasive species.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Isle Royale, Michigan</p></li> </ul> <p>Or how about a driving-walking tour? Map your holiday via Michigan’s renowned <a href="https://www.michigan.org/article/trip-idea/most-scenic-hiking-trails-michigan" rel="nofollow">walking trails</a>, and rent an electric vehicle to drive the Michigan leg of the 1,770km <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/egle/about/organization/materials-management/energy/rfps-loans/lake-michigan-circuit#:~:text=The%20Lake%20Michigan%20Circuit%20is,Michigan's%201%2C100%20mile%20drivable%20coastline." rel="nofollow">Lake Michigan EV Circuit Tour</a>. The full circuit, which is still in development, also takes you through Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin. Check which EV charging stations are operational before you plot your journey.</p> <p>The key to responsible travel is to think local when preparing for the trip: shop for seasonal items and try to buy from locally owned businesses.</p> <h2>Traverse City and beyond</h2> <p>If you’re driving north up to the Leelanau Peninsula along the Lake Michigan coastline you’ll arrive in Traverse City, the self-proclaimed cherry capital of the US.</p>    <ul> <li><p>Farm Club. Photograph: Mike Gilger.</p></li> </ul> <p>Stop at Third Coast Fruit Co, just north of Traverse City, to pick your own cherries during the summer months. The Wunsch family has been growing berries here for more than 100 years. For a less arduous food gathering activity head to <a href="https://www.farmclubtc.com/market" rel="nofollow">Farm Club</a>, just over 10km from downtown Traverse City, where you can access the market, restaurant and brewery, and stock up on locally grown and made supplies.</p> <p>If you park the EV and hire bikes for the day, you can hit the 17km Traverse Area Recreation Trail (TART). After the ride, head to Little Fleet food trucks in downtown Traverse City and let the region’s best cooks take you on a farm-to-table culinary journey (the <a href="http://www.thelittlefleet.com/food-truck-application" rel="nofollow">food trucks are open</a> from late April until mid October).</p> <p>Once you arrive at Mackinaw City, in the north of the state, you might need yet more local delicacies to snack on. Head to Minogin Market – a tribal owned food store – to sample the local and Native American vegetables and food products on offer. If you’re lucky you’ll be able to buy a bottle of<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_Q6hRMFbZN/" rel="nofollow"> Ziibimijwang Farm’</a>s in-demand maple syrup. This is the real stuff, and you won’t taste better.</p> <p>From Mackinaw City, visitors can access one of the state’s most prized national parks. Put your hiking boots on before you take the 20-minute ferry ride to quaint <a href="https://www.mackinacisland.org/" rel="nofollow">Mackinac Island</a>. The island has prohibited motor vehicles since 1898, so you’ll get around in a horse-drawn taxi or on foot; there are more than 100km of walking trails.</p> <p>From Mackinaw you can leave the EV trail and head downstate, where Michigan’s cultural scene struts its stuff with the swagger of Motown legends.</p> <h2>A cultural renaissance</h2>    <ul> <li><p>Jamel Randall, owner of The TRAP Yoga Studio. Photograph: Kyra Head.</p></li> </ul> <p>The city of Detroit is undergoing a renaissance that’s part urban chic, part art revolution, with a sprinkle of culinary genius. We spoke with a true local to find out how the motor city is changing gears.</p> <p>“Detroit stays committed to the grind,” says Jamel Randall. “I used to venture to Chicago or Miami, but now I relish staying closer to home.”</p> <p>Randall is the owner of <a href="https://www.thetrapstudio.com/" rel="nofollow">The TRAP</a> Yoga Studio, which is central to the city. He’s a true local who’s smitten with the scene. “My mornings kick off with meditation and yoga, followed by a run on the <a href="https://detroitriverfront.org/news/detroit-riverwalk-named-best-riverwalk-america-three-years-row" rel="nofollow">Riverwalk</a> [along the Detroit River] and a session of HIIT conditioning.” Just so you know, that riverfront walking trail was named by USA Today the best in America for three consecutive years – from 2021 to 2023. It’s the artery that keeps the blood pumping in more ways than one.</p> <p>Randall trains hard so he can play hard. He and his partner have a list of their favourite places to go, but he says: “There are so many new spots popping up in Detroit that make it super fun to explore.” Their go-to brekkie spot? <a href="https://detroitfoundationhotel.com/apparatus-room/" rel="nofollow">The Apparatus Room</a> at the Foundation Hotel, followed by a pit stop at <a href="https://www.centraldetroit.com/" rel="nofollow">Central Kitchen</a> for a brunch drink and then to <a href="https://parcdetroit.com/" rel="nofollow">Parc</a> for some people watching. Later on, he likes the hangout vibe at <a href="https://www.godfreyhoteldetroit.com/" rel="nofollow">The Godfrey</a> with its rooftop ambience, and in the evening, “we may indulge in more culinary delights at either <a href="https://empirekitchendetroit.com/" rel="nofollow">Empire</a> or <a href="https://shewolfdetroit.com/" rel="nofollow">SheWolf</a>.”</p>    <ul> <li><p>SheWolf Detroit</p></li> </ul> <p>In Detroit, the comeback is king, and the city’s resurgence is a patchwork of innovation, creativity and a big dash of grit. It’s a place where every corner has a story, every meal is a conversation, and every mural is an invitation to look a little closer.</p> <p><em><strong><a href="https://www.visittheusa.com.au/" rel="nofollow">Come see for yourself.
