<h2>Fun, games and unique</h2> <p>For the football fan of any age, a new ball always goes down well with the obvious choice a well-priced <a href="https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/champions-league-football-2025-size-5/_/R-p-X8897436?mc=8897436">Champion League 2025 replica</a> from Decathlon.co.uk. However, for a more rewarding alternative try one of the colourful and striking options from the <a href="https://thedifferentkind.com/collections/alive-kicking">Alive &amp; Kicking range</a> at Thedifferentkind.com. A not-for-profit organisation producing handmade balls with unique designs in sub-Saharan Africa, creating jobs and contributing to the economy, they also donate balls – football and rugby, beautifully made from locally sourced leather – to local children.</p> <p>For doing the actual kicking, there is excellent value in the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BLJ47NQW?tag=georiot-trd-21&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=fourfourtwo-gb-4560368697117225428-21&amp;amp;geniuslink=true&amp;amp;psc=1">Puma Kids Ultra Match boot</a> from Amazon.co.uk. An excellent boot more reasonably priced than the top-end versions in the kid’s market. Lightweight, made from stretchy, woven fabric and laceless, it’s a solid, all-round unisex shoe in a range of bright colours.</p> <p>Once they come back grubby from the match, younger children might be encouraged to scrub up with one of the delightful <a href="https://www.chucklesoaps.com/main-store">range of sporty soaps</a> from Chucklesoaps.com. Each one has a sporting-themed item embedded within, such as a football, racing car, rugby player or cricketer, which is eventually freed as the soap is used. They’re hand-poured in Hampshire with a soothing, moisturising lather, too.</p>    <p>Away from the pitch, with a decent floor space there is fun to be had with the <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/outdoor/sports-and-equipment/football/smart-ball-indoor-soccer-bot-size-1/p/226557">Smart Ball Indoor Soccer Bot</a> from smythstoys.com. A small disc shaped robot and the special ball it tracks combine to test your touch. It is no Virgil Van Dijk but younger kids will have terrific fun going up against the mechanical opposition to develop their ball control.</p> <p>Mark a sporting moment in elegant style with one of the prints from <a href="https://www.thegoalhanger.co.uk/">thegoalhanger.co.uk</a>. The beautiful artwork is created by designer Richard Horsted, using data from live sport – a goal or match, or season – and inspired by artists or art movements such as Jackson Pollock or Constructivism. They are eye-catching, visually inventive and beautifully executed. Better still, choose a personal favourite and Richard will design a bespoke piece of art around it.</p> <h2>Style and Substance</h2> <p>With Euro 2025 coming up, step up with the Lionesses. Bootandballprints.com have a <a href="https://bootandballprints.com/products/alessia-russo-england-t-shirt?_pos=2&amp;amp;_sid=3daaf3ac9&amp;amp;_ss=r">fine T-shirt and print</a> of England’s player of the year Alessia Russo, rendered in a distinct but understated design. Equally inventive is the<a href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/1210432377/england-lionesses-football-legends"> Lionesses Subbuteo print T-shirt</a> from etsy.com, with players depicted on plastic bases. Toffs.com also do a nice retro-style <a href="https://www.toffs.com/england-subbuteo-t-shirt-red">Subbuteo-themed England shirt</a> in red and white, which is cheaper and more fun than the real strips.</p>    <p>The women’s ODI Cricket World Cup also takes place in India next year and fans would appreciate the <a href="https://shop.ecb.co.uk/products/24-25-odi-wide-brim-hat">lovely wide-brim hat</a> from shop.ecb.co.uk.

Pair it with the marvellous socks from new British company <a href="https://koigolfclub.com/">Koigolfclub.com</a>. They have put a superb spin on the humble sock with an innovative anti-slip design. The sole and heel of the<a href="https://koigolfclub.com/products/anti-slip-crew-golf-grip-sock-black"> socks are lined with small rubber grips</a> and while the feeling on first wearing is a little disconcerting by mid-round their purpose, to maintain a solid footing within the shoe more than pays off.
