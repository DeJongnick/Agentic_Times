<p>Good afternoon.</p> 
<p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/24/source-of-fatbergs-closed-sydney-beaches-revealed-report">an exclusive from NSW state correspondent Anne Davies</a>, a secret report has revealed the likely source of the fatberg balls that closed a raft of Sydney beaches last summer – with most coming from the deepwater ocean outfall at Malabar.</p> 
<p>The partly redacted scientific report, obtained under freedom of information laws, points to a combination of heavy rains and a buildup of fats, oils and greases as the likely cause of the “poo balls”.</p> 
<p>Authorities are unable to say when balls could wash up again – but are urgently working on solutions.</p> 
<p><strong>“</strong>What we’re currently doing now is not sustainable,” the chair of the EPA’s advisory panel and independent expert Prof Stuart Khan says of Sydney’s sewage system, “discharging 80% of the sewage produced by 5 million people into the ocean after only primary treatment.”</p>
