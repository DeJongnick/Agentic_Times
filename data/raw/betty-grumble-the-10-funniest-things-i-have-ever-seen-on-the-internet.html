<p>I am a person who believes in laughter. I work in live art. My main medium is performance. In art-making I revere legacies of border-riders, defiant sexualities, witches and rascals. I have been known as a sex clown and I am proud to invoke laughter.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/jul/18/jordan-prosser-big-time-book-interview">Jordan Prosser: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Some of the best laughing is out of absurdity. Laughter erupts and massages. Purrs and murmurs. It erodes calcified, rational, top-down thinking. It appears mysteriously, sometimes even when we think we should not laugh. My grandmother Betty used to say to my brother and I: “You’re laughing now, you’ll be crying in a minute!” We need our tears and hope; I wouldn’t be laughing so hard if it wasn’t so deeply serious.</p> <h2>1. Solid Gold Dancer workout</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnOyf_j6QZA"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qnOyf_j6QZA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I grew up watching my mother instruct aerobics classes. It’s in the blood. As part of my art practice, I lead “Grumble boogies”. These are psychically charged dance classes with deeply daggy spirit. We have even conducted 24-hour boogies.</p> <p>I love this Solid Gold Dancer workout. I encourage you to do it, adapt it to your body, move it around. Look at those outfits, those faces! (I have a crush on Darcel.) Dancing and laughing, laughing and dancing. This is a healthy day. Thank you body.</p> <h2>2. Lynda Gibson, Judith Lucy and Denise Scott</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq8kXC9gF40"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Fq8kXC9gF40?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Three legendary women of comedy show us how they prepare to go onstage in this flashback to the 2000 Melbourne International comedy festival. Judith Lucy, Denise Scott and the late Lynda Gibson – who is my beloved auntie.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2019/oct/18/saved-for-later-sign-up-for-guardian-australias-culture-and-lifestyle-email?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>When I was about 15, she asked me what I wanted to do when I grew up.

A Golden Gibbo.</p> <h2>3. Flutterbye goes into fire</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba25S_AqGRo"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ba25S_AqGRo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>A classic. I had one of these contraptions when I was little. There is something so pure in how the parent exclaims “ohhh noooo” at the end. We must all return to the fire of purification sometime. Faeries are real.</p> <h2>4. Being In Total Control Honey</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Laci09iuY"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z_Laci09iuY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The lockdowns had their way with us. During the pandemic I found myself living at a legendary queer house, in a static caravan in the back yard. During one of the windows where we could gather, a collective I was in titled Working Bitches<em> </em>created a track with our gay uncles Paul Mac &amp; Jonny Seymour (AKA Stereogamous). It brings me so much joy to see the music video scene with our friends, mentors and fellow artists dancing in the back yard. </p> <h2>5. Divine David</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c45yTEcfb0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4c45yTEcfb0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>This is a go-to refresh for the mind. I’ve been lucky to witness David Hoyle a few times live onstage in London. I love their streams of consciousness. Their glamour. Their simmering, raging and welcoming intelligence. You can go on a real spree diving into their other videos. Do so! Divine indeed.</p> <h2>6. Recess Therapy</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLck2wIVa70"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QLck2wIVa70?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I know social media can feel like gambling and I have tried to be very careful with my usage. I feel how it changes my brain. But some things bring real hope – like Recess Therapy. Kids get it. These kids do great things to my brain.</p> <h2>7. Dogs underwater</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB0gX9NCXpc"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PB0gX9NCXpc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>You know who else gets it? Dogs. It was hard to choose one dog video: dogs in wigs, dogs dancing, dogs being naughty, dogs smiling. I am not anthropomorphising them. Rather, they bring me back into my dog nature and for this I am grateful. I do have a constant stream of dog memes going back and forth between my closest friends. Dog is God.</p> <h2>8. Young person dancing to Vogue</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7weYZUUv90"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f7weYZUUv90?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Much like the aerobic offering before, I encourage you to copy their moves, invent your own, yield to the drama. Ecstatic dancing helps us. The gaze in this child’s eye gives me energy. </p> <h2>9. Sammy Obeid</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy_fJo98JGw"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iy_fJo98JGw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Some of the greatest laughter I have experienced has been created by people who have come through life’s most jagged edges. Joy in the face of oppression is a powerful tool for unpicking the throes of dominance. Laughter can be a weapon too. It can unionise and dismantle power. </p> <h2>10. The Spark</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p6_VL00Vqk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8p6_VL00Vqk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>My body was shimmering and giggling when I saw this video for the first time. It’s swept across platforms and rightly so. It’s just so good. We love Celtic joy!
