<p>After a long career which has established her as one of the most significant folk singers on both sides of the Atlantic, Peggy Seeger is about to celebrate her 90th birthday with a final tour and album – and will answer your questions.</p> <p>Born in New York to a musicologist father and a modernist composer, and with siblings including future folk legend Pete Seeger, she started out on piano at seven years old, eventually adding guitar, banjo, autoharp, dulcimer and concertina to her skillset.</p> <p>She has lived in the UK for more than 60 years after travelling to London in 1956 for a job offer to be a singer and banjoist with folk group the Ramblers, where she met her future husband and folk singer Ewan MacColl. The two started an affair and in 1957 MacColl wrote the song The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face for Seeger, performing it for her over a long distance phone call (it was later a No 1 hit in the US for Roberta Flack). Seeger often performed with MacColl by her side until his death in 1989. She then married singer Irene Pyper-Scott, after forming an intense connection – she later described herself as “uncontrollably in love”.</p> <p>Seeger is also widely recognised as a feminist icon and an activist on issues from the environment to war and workers’ rights. Her song I’m Gonna Be an Engineer became a feminist anthem thanks to scathing lyrics such as: “She’s smart – for a woman, I wonder how she got that way / You get no choice, you get no voice / Just stay mum, pretend you’re dumb.”</p> <p>It’s a remarkable career, and one that’s coming to an end: her latest album Teleology, out now, is being billed as her last, and she is doing a 25-date farewell tour of the UK and Ireland from 14 May. Before she brings the curtain down, what would you like to know about her songwriting, her activism, her loves and losses, and the rest of her richly lived life? Post your questions in the comments before Wednesday 7 May, and her answers will be published on Friday 16 May.</p>
