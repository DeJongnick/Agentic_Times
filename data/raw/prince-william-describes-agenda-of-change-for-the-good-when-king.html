<p>Prince William has said “change is on my agenda – change for the good” when he becomes king.</p> <p>In one of his most personal interviews yet, the Prince of Wales set out his approach to the monarchy. </p> <p>“I want to question things more,” he told Eugene Levy at Windsor Castle in an interview for the actor’s Apple TV+ series, The Reluctant Traveler.</p> <p>William said: “I want to create a world in which my son is proud of what we do, a world and a job that actually does impact people’s lives for the better.”</p> <p>His eldest son, Prince George, who celebrated his 12th birthday in July, will one day succeed him as king.</p> <p>His other son, Prince Louis, is seven and his daughter, Princess Charlotte, is 10.</p> <p>William said his children did not have mobile phones. And he appeared to suggest that he wanted to ensure they did not face a repeat of “practices” he and his brother, the Duke of Sussex, had faced when younger – a possible reference to intrusive press scrutiny that also plagued their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.</p> <p>William said of the “insatiable” media he experienced growing up: “They wanted every bit of detail they could absorb, and they were in everything, literally everywhere. They would know things, they’d be everywhere.</p> <p>“And if you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family.”</p> <p>With regard to his change agenda, William said: “I embrace that and I enjoy that change – I don’t fear it. That’s the bit that excites me, is the idea of being able to bring some change. Not overly radical change, but changes that I think that need to happen.”</p> <p>He added: “I think it’s very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this. But, there’s also points where you look at tradition and go: ‘Is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?’”</p> <p>Asked by Levy, star of the hit TV series Schitt’s Creek, if he thought about being king, William replied: “It’s not something I wake up in the morning and think about, because to me, being authentic and being myself and being genuine is what drives me.</p> <p>“And then you can attach whatever labels and kind of roles that come on top of that, but if I’m not true to myself, and I’m not true to what I stand for and believe in – then it doesn’t really matter who you are, it gets lost.</p> <p>“I take my roles and my responsibilities seriously but it’s important, like I said to you earlier, you don’t feel they own you – you have to own them.”</p>
