<p>Choosing a new TV typically means weighing up screen size, brightness, and how you plan to use it. QLED, mini-LED, and OLED technologies each has benefits and drawbacks, but a newcomer might be about to edge them all out of the competition.</p> <p>RGB-MiniLED is striking a balance between the picture quality of OLED and the brightness and burn-in avoidance of mini-LED. The right TV for you? Maybe this is it.</p> <h2>The trouble with OLED</h2> <p>OLED has dominated over the past decade but its performance has always come with caveats. While it has incredible capacity for the blackest blacks and precision contrast, to perform at its best OLED needs dark rooms and minimal glare. OLED technology can also suffer from logos and screen graphics leaving permanent “burn-in” marks on the screen. It’s a risky choice for fans of sports and video games, where standardised graphics remain on fixed screen positions for extended periods.</p> <p>The LED TV category has evolved significantly in recent years, consistently finding ways to improve backlighting systems to maintain its brightness advantage while improving its local area dimming systems and colour accuracy. Previous updates across mini-LED and quantum dot (QLED) technologies introduced thousands of individual backlights. Now, RGB-MiniLED is a breakthrough that achieves the best of OLED without the drawbacks.</p> <h2>Is RGB-MiniLED better than OLED?</h2> <p>Standard mini-LED uses blue backlights that are adjusted to become red or green as required, but RGB-MiniLED has pure red, green and blue LEDs for richer colours, higher brightness and better contrast.</p> <p>Hisense’s flagship, 116-inch TV model, the RGB-MiniLED 116UX, is Australia’s largest RGB-MiniLED TV for domestic consumers (as of July 2025). The massive screen achieves up to 8,000 nits peak brightness while delivering 95% coverage of the expansive BT.2020 colour gamut, a benchmark designed for high dynamic range content experiences.</p> <p>This combination of colour and brightness means picture quality is never compromised. Whether you’re watching movies at night or the cricket on a bright summer afternoon, your TV will always look its best, which can’t always be said for OLED. Add the Anti-Reflection PRO surface design on the Hisense screen and its AI Chroma Light Sensor for monitoring and responding to ambient light to maintain image accuracy, and you have the ideal TV for every living room, no matter the time of day.</p> <p>Burn-in risk is not a problem for RGB-MiniLED, and the Hisense 116-inch screen features native 165Hz variable refresh rate, so video games can sync with the screen for ultra-smooth gameplay in Game Mode Ultra. Sport is also delivered with super-clean image quality; AI Sports Mode manages motion estimation and compensation systems to reduce blur and noise so you never lose sight of the ball in the midst of fast-paced action.</p> <p>Hisense claims its 116UX RGB-MiniLED will be the biggest TV panel on the market this year. An RGB-MiniLED screen at this scale provides an immersive home entertainment experience that other models will find hard to match.</p> <p><em><strong><a href="https://hisense.com.au/product/116UXAU/?utm_source=Guardian&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=116UXAU" rel="nofollow">Discover colours as they were meant to be with Hisense RGB-MiniLED 116UX.</a></strong></em></p>
