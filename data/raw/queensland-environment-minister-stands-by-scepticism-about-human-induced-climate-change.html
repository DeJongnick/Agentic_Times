<p>Queensland’s environment minister has told parliament he stands by his comments more than a decade ago that he was “a bit sceptical” about human involvement in climate change.</p> <p>Andrew Powell returned to the environment, tourism, science and innovation portfolio last month, having held it under the former premier Campbell Newman in 2012.</p> <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/worldtoday/qld-environment-minister-not-convinced-on-man-made/4051066">ABC radio</a> in June of that year, he acknowledged climate was changing, but said that he “was still to be convinced of the degree to which we are influencing that”.</p> <p>At a media conference the following day, Powell doubled down, saying he was not “100% convinced of the human population’s role” in climate change.</p> <p>“Are we polluting the environment? Yes we are. Are we using a non-renewable energy source? Yes we are. Do we need to address both of those factors? Yes we do.”</p> <p>During Wednesday’s question time, Greens MP Michael Berkman asked Powell if he <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/environment-ministers-climate-science-doubts-refreshing-20120605-1zthu.html">“was still a bit sceptical</a> of anthropogenic climate change” 12 years after the comments.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/dec/11/peter-duttons-bid-to-politicise-top-science-agency-is-absurd-former-csiro-energy-director-says">Peter Dutton’s bid to politicise top science agency is ‘absurd’, former CSIRO energy director says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Powell initially responded by pointing out that one of the staff at the office of climate change made redundant during the Newman era was Berkman himself.</p> <p>The environment minister then said “I stand by those comments”.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed">Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email</a></strong></p></li> </ul> <p>“I said when I was the environment [minister] previously I believed in climate change. I stand by those comments. How the likes of the news – a number of news outlets – chose to report that is up to them, not on me,” Powell responded.</p> <p>The LNP <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/apr/17/queensland-state-liberal-national-party-backs-labor-climate-emission-reduction-targets">supported the previous Labor government’s 75% by 2035 carbon emissions target</a> and promised not to amend or repeal the legislation in government.</p> <p>But it did vow to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/01/queensland-state-election-lnp-coal-power-extension-steven-miles-david-crisafulli">repeal the state renewable energy target</a> and extend the life of coal plants and has not detailed how it would achieve its emissions reduction goal.</p> <p>Powell told parliament he was committed to achieving the target in a “responsible way”.</p> <p>“We’ll do it by respecting our taxpayers’ dollars. We’ll do it by working with the private sector to deliver on those,” he said.</p> <p>Berkman accused Powell of having undone “years of work on reducing Queensland’s carbon emissions”, noting that because “he’s at the helm of the environment department again [and] he says his views haven’t changed”.</p> <p>“These are deeply concerning and dangerous, anti-science views, especially for an environment minister,” Berkman said.</p> <p>“I recognise this government from personal experience of the cuts and the climate denialism – this is Newman reincarnate.”</p> <p>Griffith University emeritus professor Ian Lowe said “there’s no room for not accepting the science, that’s going back to the dark ages”.</p> <p>“It’s difficult to see how he can do a decent job as minister for the environment if he doesn’t accept the science.</p> <p>“It’s like having a health minister who doesn’t accept that there are bacteria and viruses”.</p> <p>The Queensland Conservation Council deputy director Anthony Gough said the LNP had made a promise to Queenslanders to support climate action by backing the emissions target.</p> <p>“We’re taking them on their word that they’ll keep that commitment to Queenslanders,” he said.</p> <p>“We all want to make sure our kids can enjoy the same places and wildlife we love. We know, and we think the minister knows, that Australia’s reliance on polluting fossil fuels is causing irreparable damage to our planet and way of life.”</p> <p>The minister for energy, David Janetzki, holds the responsibility for the emissions reduction target in Queensland.</p> <p>On Tuesday Powell was the only environment minister in the country to oppose the federal government’s plan for recycling and its joint national action plan for feral cats, among others.</p> <p>“The Crisafulli government has today saved Queenslanders from another hit to the hip pocket from federal government environmental targets that will cost them more,” Powell said.</p>
