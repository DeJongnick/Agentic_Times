<p>John Bolton, a former national security adviser in Donald Trump’s first administration, has vowed to defend his “lawful conduct” after a federal grand jury indicted him on charges of mishandling and transmitting classified information.</p> <p>The indictment, filed in Maryland, appears to ultimately have been signed off on from prosecutors in the US attorney’s office despite initial reluctance to bring a case before the end of the year.</p> <p>The 18-count indictment against Bolton involves eight counts of unlawfully transmitting national defense information and 10 counts of retaining classified information under the Espionage Act, according to the 26-page indictment.</p> <p>The indictment marked the third time in recent weeks the justice department has secured criminal charges against one of the president’s critics and Bolton has accused Trump of abuse of power.</p>  <h2>Former Trump adviser John Bolton indicted by justice department</h2>  <p>The charges come at a fraught moment for the justice department, which has been rocked by extraordinary pressure from Trump to expand a vendetta campaign to pursue criminal cases against his political enemies.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s handpicked US attorney in Virginia, obtained indictments against James Comey, the former <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi">FBI</a> director, and the New York state attorney general, Letitia James, over the objections of career prosecutors.</p> <p>Bolton has been a thorn in Trump’s side since he departed the president’s first administration, criticizing him on cable news and assailing him for his own mishandling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/john-bolton-indictment-trump"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Zelenskyy to make missiles case in US as Trump plans to meet Putin in Budapest</h2>  <p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy will head to the White House on Friday for a crucial meeting with Donald Trump, hours after the US president said he had agreed to another summit with Vladimir Putin in Budapest after a “very productive” call.</p> <p>The possible supply of US Tomahawk cruise missiles to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> is expected to top the agenda during the Ukrainian president’s visit. However, Trump’s conciliatory tone after the call with Putin left in question the likelihood of immediate assistance to Ukraine and reignited European fears of US capitulation to Moscow.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/16/zelenskyy-tomahawk-missiles-trump-putin-budapest"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>US Senate vote to end government shutdown fails for 10th time</h2>  <p>The US Senate failed on Thursday to reopen the government and to vote to fund the military during the federal government shutdown, ensuring that the standoff will stretch into next week.</p> <p>The Senate vote on a short-term Republican funding bill failed for the 10th time with just 51 votes. A second vote on Pentagon funding in the afternoon similarly failed in a floor vote, meaning the process to begin fully funding military operations also becomes a non-starter. After the votes, senators are expected to leave Washington for the weekend, almost guaranteeing the shutdown lasts until at least Monday.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/16/government-shutdown-aoc-bernie-sanders-republicans"><sub>Read the full story</sub></a></p> <h2>Trump adds ‘Arc de Trump’ to presidential renovations</h2>  <p>More than two centuries have passed since France celebrated the emperor Napoleon’s birthday by laying the foundation stone of the Arc de Triomphe.
