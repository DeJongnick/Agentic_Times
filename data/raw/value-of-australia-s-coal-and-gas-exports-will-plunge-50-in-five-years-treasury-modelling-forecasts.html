<p> The value of Australia’s coal and gas exports is predicted to plummet by 50% over the next five years as global demand for fossil fuel falls, according to Treasury modelling.</p> <p>The modelling, released on Thursday as the government announced its emissions reduction target for 2035, found the annual value of fossil fuel exports is predicted to fall by more than $60bn by 2030 under any future scenario of emissions reduction within Australia.</p> <p>Energy experts said the modelling suggested the long forecast drop in fossil fuel production and export in Australia could come sooner than some realised. </p> <p>“This is dropping the truth bomb again,” said Alison Reeve, the energy and climate change program director at the Grattan Institute.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/18/expert-panel-australias-2035-emissions-target">‘A slap in the face’: our expert panel on Australia’s 2035 emissions target</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“We have been saying for a long time that if the rest of the world goes for net zero, then it will stop buying our coal and gas.”</p> <p>The <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/p2025-700922">Treasury modelling</a> was released as part of a slew of climate reports<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/sep/18/labors-2035-emissions-target-a-sliding-doors-moment-as-global-heating-goal-hangs-by-a-thread"> this week </a>that included the first detailed climate risk assessment and the government’s plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Treasury modelled three different scenarios: a “baseline” under which existing policies, targets and agendas were followed; a “renewable exports” scenario that includes growth in green hydrogen and other green exports; and a “disorderly” scenario under which the government set weak or no targets for 2035.</p> <p>The expected combined value of coal and liquified natural gas exports crashed across all scenarios from about $130bn in 2025 to less than $70bn in 2030. Fossil fuel exports would continue, but be worth less than $30bn by 2050, according to the modelling.</p>  <figure class="element element-interactive interactive" data-interactive="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js" data-canonical-url="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/fk7jV/7/" data-alt="A chart of Treasury modelling showing that as Australia heads to net zero the value of fossil fuel exports plummets"> <a href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/datawrapper/embed/fk7jV/7/">Interactive</a> <figcaption>A chart of Treasury modelling showing that as Australia heads to net zero, the value of fossil fuel exports plummets.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The amount of gas and LNG produced in Australia would fall between 24% and 27% by 2035, and between 66% and 68% by 2050. Coal output would drop between 42% and 51% between now and 2035, and between 71% and 74% by 2050 – a slower reduction than is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the pace climate scientists say is required.</p> <p>Tim Buckley, the director of thinktank Climate Energy Finance, said it showed Australia’s “gift horse” of fossil fuel revenue could turn into a “resources curse”. “Treasury here is talking about fossil fuel exports reaching as low as $35bn in 2040,” he said.</p> <p>While the value of fossil fuel exports is predicted to crash, export values for commodities needed as the world decarbonises – including green ammonia, green iron, alumina, aluminium and critical minerals like lithium, nickel and cobalt – are expected to boom.</p> <p>The export value of these “green commodities” in the modelling climbed from about $30bn today to at least $80bn in 2035 and between $109bn and $178bn in 2050.</p> <p>“Part of the story of Australia becoming a renewable energy superpower is that we are still a resource extraction-based country, but it becomes a different set of resources,” Reeve said.</p> <p>But Buckley said while he believed green commodities “will boom”, it was not assured that Australia would share the benefits of the boom.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/sep/18/what-is-a-climate-target-australia-2035-global-comparison">What is a climate target, and how does Australia’s new one for 2035 stack up against other countries?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Climate Change Authority said this week that CSIRO modelling it had commissioned suggested “Australia’s fossil fuel sector outputs will reduce 30% by 2035 if trade partners take action consistent with limiting warming to 1.5C, or 13% if the pace of global action aligns with 2C of warming”.</p> <p>“The magnitude of these long-term projected shifts underscores the need for early, strategic planning to safeguard Australia’s economic resilience,” the authority said.</p> <p>Samantha McCulloch, the chief executive of gas industry group Australian Energy Producers, said gas would “remain essential for Australia’s energy security and transition to net zero by 2050”.</p> <p>She said the authority had “recognised that Australia’s LNG exports will continue to underpin energy security and decarbonisation in our region”.</p> <p>She pointed to forecasts her organisation had <a href="https://energyproducers.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AEP-Australias-Natural-Gas-Investment-Competitiveness-Final.pdf">commissioned from consultants Wood Mackenzie</a> that suggested global LNG demand would “remain strong”, and said the International Energy Agency had suggested “south-east Asia’s LNG imports will increase eight-fold by 2050 under current policies”.</p> <p>“The growing LNG demand in our region presents a major economic and strategic opportunity for Australia while supporting our region’s transition to cleaner energy,” McCulloch said.</p> <p>The Minerals Council of Australia did respond to a request for comment on the modelling.</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>  <p>• This article was amended on 20 September 2025. An earlier version stated that Australia’s earnings from coal and gas exports were forecast to fall by $50bn by 2035; in fact, they are set to fall by $60bn by 2030.</p>
