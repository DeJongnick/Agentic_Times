<p>The recent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/16/robert-redford-obituary">death</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/robertredford">Robert Redford</a> brought renewed interest to an unresolved search for a murder suspect – the one accused of killing the boyfriend of the acclaimed actor’s daughter in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/colorado">Colorado</a> decades earlier.</p> <p>As local outlets recounted in the aftermath of Redford’s death, his daughter Shauna was attending the University of Colorado Boulder when her boyfriend and fellow student, Sid Wells, was fatally shot in his apartment. Redford was gearing up to film his classic The Natural at the time of the 1 August 1983 murder, yet he was at his daughter’s side in the wake of Wells’ death and was present for his funeral.</p> <p>Wells’ roommate, Thayne Alan Smika, was ultimately arrested in connection with the slaying. But the district attorney of Boulder county, Colorado, later declined to file formal charges against Smika, citing insufficient evidence. And Smika then disappeared in 1986, as the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2025/09/17/cold-case-murder-boulder-sid-wells/">Denver Post</a> noted.</p> <p>In 2009, a successive Boulder district attorney, Stan Garnett, began weighing whether to process certain cold murder cases through new DNA tests, including that of Wells. That effort led to authorities obtaining a warrant in 2010 to arrest Smika again for the murder of Wells.</p> <p>Redford received word that Smika was wanted again in Wells’ killing and made sure to call the district attorney, Garnett told the Colorado news station <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/robert-redford-affected-by-daughters-boyfriend-murder/73-1020dd68-28f4-4f59-9659-fe5ee014115f">KUSA</a>.</p> <p>“I was in my office and my secretary said: ‘Robert Redford’s on the phone – do you want to talk to him?’” Garnett recalled to KUSA. “I said: ‘Sure.’”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/19/robert-redford-ralph-fiennes-judd-hirsch-norman-reedus">‘Always the coolest, calmest man in the room’: friends and film-makers remember Robert Redford</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Garnett told KUSA that during the ensuing “brief but very cordial conversation”, Redford thanked him and police “for continuing to pay attention to the case”.</p> <p>The day after Redford died, the FBI announced in a social media post that it was offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to Smika’s arrest. Bail for Smika – a native of North Dakota whose nicknames include Jungle Mike – has been preset at $5m if he is ever captured.</p>  <figure class="element element-tweet" data-canonical-url="https://twitter.com/FBIDenver/status/1968388361845932049">  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In 1983, CU student Sid Wells was murdered. <a href="https://twitter.com/boulderpolice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BoulderPolice</a> have a warrant for his roommate, Thayne Smika, and the FBI is offering a $10,000 reward.

Two of Redford’s sons preceded him in death.</p>
