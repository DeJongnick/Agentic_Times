<p>A British Airways flight attendant was found high on drugs and completely naked in an onboard toilet during a flight from California to London, a court heard.</p> <p>Haden Pentecost, who was described as agitated, sweating and babbling, had to be stood down by the flight’s manager when he failed to help with any pre-flight safety checks.</p> <p>After complaining of stomach cramps and saying he needed to change his clothes, the attendant locked himself in one of the plane’s toilets.</p> <p>A colleague found him there naked and oblivious to the fact he had no clothes on. She had to dress him before moving him into a free seat, the court was told.</p> <p>The flight attendant was spoken to by the captain before a health professional was called, the magistrate was told.</p> <p>The court heard Pentecost had dilated pupils, a high heart rate, and had to be checked every 20 minutes until the plane arrived at Heathrow, where paramedics took him to hospital. A blood test later revealed he had methamphetamine and amphetamine in his system.</p> <p>He has since been sacked by British Airways, the court was told.</p> <p>Pentecost appeared at Uxbridge magistrates court on Friday, where he pleaded guilty to performing an aviation function while impaired by drugs. The 41-year-old from Basingstoke was granted bail to be sentenced at Isleworth crown court at a later date.</p> <p>British Airways has been approached for comment.</p>
