<p>Pills that prevent Alzheimer’s disease or blunt its effects are on the horizon, as the fight against dementia enters a “new era”, experts have said.</p> <p>Scientific advances were on the cusp of producing medicines that could be used even in the most remote and under-resourced parts of the world, thereby “democratising” care, said Jeff Cummings, professor of brain science and health at the University of Nevada.</p> <p>An estimated 50 million people live with dementia globally, <a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/7/4/e007409">more than two-thirds</a> of them in low- and middle-income countries.</p> <p>In 2024, the first drugs that can change the course of Alzheimer’s disease entered the market. Eisai and Biogen’s lecanemab and Eli Lilly’s donanemab were approved by medicine watchdogs in many western countries, <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog/three-promising-drugs-for-treating-alzheimers-disease-bring-fresh-hope">including the UK</a> and US.</p> <p>“I’m just so excited about this,” said Cummings. “We are truly in a new era. We have opened the door to understanding and manipulating the biology of Alzheimer’s disease for the benefit of our patients.”</p> <p>Cummings conceded that high prices, complicated administration techniques and requirements for advanced technology to monitor patients meant that those newly approved drugs were “not going to be made widely available in the world”.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/oct/23/alzheimers-drug-donanemab-rejected-widespread-nhs-use-england">Neither is yet available on the NHS</a> in the UK because of the high cost – about £20,000 to £25,000 a year for each patient. They require additional tests and scans that would probably double that figure.</p> <p>But Cummings said they offered evidence of how to target dementia and “this learning is going to open the door to new therapies of many types, and those drugs can be exported around the world”. There are currently 127 drugs in trials for Alzheimer’s disease.</p> <p>Lecanemab and donanemab – which prompt the body to remove amyloid plaque in the brain – slow decline by about 30%, said Cummings, who works with a number of pharmaceutical companies on trials and drug development.</p> <p>Before treatment, patients need a diagnosis confirmed by a hi-tech PET scan or a lumbar puncture. Follow-up monitoring requires brain scans. The equipment and expertise necessary are in short supply in many countries, and the drugs are given intravenously – a further constraint.</p>    <p>However, Cummings highlighted recent decisions by the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, that have allowed Alzheimer’s diagnosis based on a blood test as the enrolment criterion for dementia drug trials.</p> <p>That could pave the way for those blood tests, which look for “biomarkers” of dementia, to be used for diagnosis in clinics in place of expensive scans.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.082852">trial results</a> suggest the new drugs could instead be delivered by injection beneath the skin, opening the door for at-home administration by a nurse or caregiver.</p> <p>“Ultimately, we want oral medications, some pills that can be taken once a day,” said Cummings, speaking alongside Paola Barbarino, chief executive of Alzheimer’s Disease International (ADI) after the organisation’s end-of-year forecast event.</p> <p>Tablet forms of semaglutide – better known as Ozempic, an injectable drug for diabetes that is used off-label for weight-loss – are already in trials for Alzheimer’s and results are expected in late 2025. Cummings, who is chairing those trials, said there was plausible reason to think the drug would be effective by reducing inflammation, which was “a fundamental part of the illness”.</p> <p>He called for more involvement of low- and middle-income countries in clinical trials, in order to boost knowledge of how the drugs work among different populations and to increase scientific capacity and knowledge of dementia in those places.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/jul/31/almost-half-of-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-study-finds">Almost half of dementia cases could be prevented or delayed, study finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Could there be a cure for Alzheimer’s? That was “difficult”, Cummings said. But , he added.</p> <p>“We know enough about manipulating the biology and how it starts that we can, I think, within my lifetime – maybe a little bit longer, because I’m not young – we can control the processes that start the illness, and therefore it simply wouldn’t develop in the brain.”</p> <p>Experts believe <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/news/2024-11-22/lancet-40-dementia-cases-could-be-prevented-or-delayed-targeting-12-risk-factors">40% of Alzheimer’s cases</a> could already be prevented by targeting key risk factors, such as smoking, drinking alcohol and air pollution.</p> <p>Prices would need to come down for low- and middle-income countries to “even think” of affording drugs that can change the course of Alzheimer’s disease, Barbarino said.</p> <p>Attitudes would also need to change, she said, adding: “When I speak to health ministries in some poorer countries, they tell me they don’t have dementia in their country, which of course, is not true.”</p>
