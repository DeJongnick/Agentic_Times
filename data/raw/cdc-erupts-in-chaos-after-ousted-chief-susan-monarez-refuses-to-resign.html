<p>The US’s top public health agency was plunged into chaos on Wednesday after the Trump administration moved to oust its leader Susan Monarez, sworn in less than a month ago, as her lawyers said she would not resign and that she was being “targeted” for her pro-science stance.</p> <p>Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was ousted on Wednesday evening, according to a statement from Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that offered no explanation for its decision.</p> <p>“Susan Monarez is no longer director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We thank her for her dedicated service to the American people,” HHS said in an unsigned statement posted to social media. Her lawyers pushed back in a statement, saying she had “neither resigned nor received notification” from the White House of her termination.</p> <p>Shortly thereafter, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said Monarez had been dismissed, claiming she was “not aligned” with the president’s agenda.</p> <p>“Since Susan Monarez refused to resign despite informing HHS leadership of her intent to do so,” he said, “the White House has terminated Monarez from her position with the CDC.”</p> <p>Hours later, her lawyers, Mark Zaid and Abbe David Lowell, <a href="https://x.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/1960914637219893636?s=19">wrote</a> on X that she had received formal notice of her removal. But they argued the action was legally invalid and that “only the president himself can fire her” as a Senate-confirmed appointee.</p> <p>“For this reason,” they wrote, “we reject [the] notification Dr Monarez has received as legally deficient and she remains as CDC Director.” They added that the legal team had informed the White House counsel of their position.</p> <p>Monarez, who was confirmed by the Senate just last month, appeared to have run afoul of Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, after she declined to support sweeping changes to US vaccine policies, according to reporting from the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/27/susan-monarez-cdc-director-ousted/">Washington Post</a> and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/27/health/cdc-monarez-kennedy-vaccines.html">New York Times</a>.</p> <p>In an earlier statement, Zaid and Lowell asserted that the department’s attempt to fire Monarez was part of a broader effort to dismantle US public health institutions.</p> <p>“First it was independent advisory committees and career experts. Then it was the dismissal of seasoned scientists. Now, Secretary Kennedy and HHS have set their sights on weaponizing public health for political gain and putting millions of American lives at risk,” her lawyers, Mark Zaid and Abbe David Lowell, <a href="https://x.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/1960914637219893636?s=19">said</a> in a statement. “When CDC Director Susan Monarez refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts, she chose protecting the public over serving a political agenda. For that, she has been targeted.”</p> <p>The ousting has set off a wave of departures within the agency, with at least three other CDC leaders publicly resigning after the HHS announcement. </p> <p>The most explosive resignation letter came from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/ncird.html">Dr Demetre Daskalakis</a>, who stepped down as the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/aug/27/cdc-resignation-susan-monarez-trump-administration-us-politics-updates-rfk-jr?page=with%3Ablock-68af8b978f080ebbe15bd59b#block-68af8b978f080ebbe15bd59b">according to Inside Medicine</a>, an industry newsletter that obtained the full statements.</p> <p>“I am not able to serve in this role any longer because of the ongoing weaponizing of public health. You are the best team I have ever worked with, and you continue to shine despite this dark cloud over the agency and our profession,” Daskalakis wrote. “Please take care of yourself and your teams and make the right decisions for yourselves.”</p> <p>Those concerns were echoed by another departing CDC leader, Dr Deb Houry, the chief medical officer, who wrote that “For the good of the nation and the world, the science at CDC should never be censored or subject to political pauses or interpretations.”</p> <p>Daniel Jernigan, who ran the Center for Emerging Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, has also quit the agency.</p> <p>Hours before Monarez was removed, Kennedy <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1960742897201872969">hailed</a> decisions by the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/news-events-biologics/whats-new-biologics">revoking</a> the emergency use authorization for the Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax that CDC experts estimate saved 3.2 million lives in the United States.</p> <p>Vaccines from the three manufacturers are now authorized by the FDA <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/27/fda-new-covid-19-vaccines-restrictions">only for</a> people who are 65 and older, or younger people with an underlying medical condition that puts them at risk for severe disease. Even those that qualify for the vaccines will only be able to get them in the US if the advisory panel, reshaped by Kennedy to include Covid vaccine opponents, votes to approve them.</p> <p>Monarez, 50, was the agency’s 21st director and the first to pass through Senate confirmation following a 2023 law. She was named acting director in January and then tapped as the nominee in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. She was sworn in on 31 July – less than a month ago – making her the shortest-serving CDC director in the history of the 79-year-old agency.</p> <p>Public health experts, meanwhile, are sounding the alarm about the chaos.</p> <p>“What’s happening at the CDC should frighten every American Regardless of whether you are MAGA, MAHA, neither, or don’t give a damn about labels or politics. It’s unclear whether the CDC director—confirmed just weeks ago—has been fired or not. Absolute shitshow,” Dr Craig Spencer, an emergency medicine doctor and professor at Brown University School of Public Health, <a href="https://x.com/Craig_A_Spencer/status/1960858175462121698">posted</a>. “And incredible career professionals resigned tonight, sounding a massive alarm,” he added. “This is pure chaos that leaves the country unprepared.”</p> <p>“RFK, Jr is increasingly becoming a liability for the White House,” Dr Jonathan Reiner, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at George Washington University, <a href="https://x.com/JReinerMD/status/1960875744436834660">observed</a>.</p> <p>“There is a wholesale destruction of leadership at the CDC. The newly confirmed Director is out,” Dr Ashish Jha, the Biden administration’s coronavirus response coordinator, <a href="https://x.com/ashishkjha/status/1960837829136933136">wrote</a>. “Most of the top leaders who run key centers have resigned en masse. Total implosion. All because of [Secretary Kennedy’s] leadership. What a complete disaster.”</p> <p><em>Maanvi Singh and agencies contributed reporting</em></p>
