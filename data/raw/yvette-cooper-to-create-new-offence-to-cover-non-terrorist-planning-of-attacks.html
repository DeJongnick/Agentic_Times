<p>A new criminal offence is to be introduced to “close the gap” between lone, violence-obsessed individuals with no particular ideology and terrorism suspects, the home secretary has said.</p> <p>Yvette Cooper said an offence that would give police the power to apprehend the former long before they acted was needed in the wake of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/southport-attack">Southport attack</a> last year. Terrorism suspects can be jailed for life even if their plans are not fully formed.</p> <p>Axel Rudakubana, then 17, stabbed three young girls to death at a summer holiday dance class in July last year and attempted to murder eight other children and two adults who tried to protect them.</p> <p>Cooper told BBC Radio 4’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/m002fkzq">State of Terror</a> series: “There is a gap in the law around the planning of mass attacks that can be just as serious [as terrorism] in their implications for communities, their impact, the devastation that they can cause and the seriousness of the crime.</p> <p>“We will tighten legislation so that that is taken as seriously as terrorism.”</p> <p>She said police would get the power to prevent such individuals who did not have a clear ideology, in the same way they can with terrorism suspects.</p> <p>Under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/part/1/crossheading/preparation-of-terrorist-acts-and-terrorist-training">section 5 of the Terrorism Act</a>, a person who engages in any conduct in preparation of a terrorist act is guilty of the offence, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p> <p>At the bottom end of the scale, the offence includes engaging in very limited preparation for terrorist activity but there must be a link to an ideological cause.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9w14yjw8x0o">Cooper said</a>: “We’ve seen cases of growing numbers of teenagers potentially radicalising themselves online and seeing all kinds of extremist material online in their bedrooms.</p> <p>“They’re seeing a really distorted and warped online world.</p> <p>“We have to make sure that that the systems can respond while not taking our eye off the ball of the more longstanding ideological threats.”</p> <p>The Prevent anti-terrorism scheme <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jan/20/axel-rudakubana-was-referred-to-counter-extremism-scheme-three-times">declined to take on Rudakubana’s case</a> three times, after teachers raised concerns about him from 2019 to 2021, three years before he committed the atrocity.</p> <p>His first referral was from his teachers after he admitted bringing a knife into school on 10 occasions to “stab someone”, researched massacres of children at US schools and made “graphic” comments about violence. He later said “the [2017] terrorist attack on the MEN [Manchester Arena] was a good thing”.</p> <p>While there was concern about his interest in violence, Prevent concluded there was no sign it was driven by a terrorist ideology.</p> <p>A public inquiry into the Southport killings <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/08/southport-inquiry-to-examine-wholesale-failure-to-prevent-attack">began this month</a>. Its chair, Sir Adrian Fulford, said it would examine the “wholesale failure” of institutions to prevent “one of the most egregious crimes in our country’s history”.</p> <p>He said he would consider whether courts should be given powers to impose restrictions on individuals known to pose a risk but when there was insufficient evidence to justify an arrest.</p> <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/independent-sentencing-review-final-report">David Gauke’s independent sentencing review</a> said the introduction of new offences and longer sentences was one of the factors behind the prison overcrowding crisis.</p>
