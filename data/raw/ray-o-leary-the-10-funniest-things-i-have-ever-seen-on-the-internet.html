<p>Can you believe that before I was asked to write this article, I had not once been on the internet? I am fascinated by this new technology and can’t wait to see the impact it has on elevating public discourse around the world.</p> <p>Here are the first 10 things I found when I went on the internet. I really hope they’re funny.</p> <h2>1. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrare">Tarrare’s Wikipedia entry</a></h2> <p>The only encyclopedia entry I have ever read where every single line made me laugh is this article about an 18th-century French man with an insatiable appetite. He once ate a meal for 15 people in one sitting, smelled so bad he had a visible odour, and was suspected of eating a baby, and that doesn’t even cover the time he was trained by the French army to smuggle documents by eating them. I am shocked that I have not seen a film about this man but I can only assume he is a French national hero.</p> <h2>2. New Zealand prime minister Robert Muldoon announces the ‘schnapps’ election</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRRwYuYnMbk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CRRwYuYnMbk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The year is 1984. The New Zealand government is incredibly unpopular, mishandling the economy and internally divided over its stance on nuclear energy. The prime minister does what any sane man would do in these conditions: he calls a snap election while absolutely steamed.</p> <p>The funniest part of this video is that if you look at his eyes and smile, he thinks he’s absolutely gotten away with it. He genuinely believes no one can tell he’s wasted. Despite his inebriation, he’s incredibly quick on his feet. When told by a journalist that an election a month away won’t give him much time “in a run-up to an election”, he slurs, “It doesn’t give my opponents much time in a run-up to an election, does it?” If that exchange had happened inside a modern comedy club, it would have been uploaded to YouTube with the caption “Comedian DESTROYS heckler”.</p> <p>There’s not a bouncer alive that would let him into a bar in that state, yet somehow he is allowed to make one of the most impactful political decisions in New Zealand history, which resulted in our economy being fundamentally reshaped for the next 40 years.</p> <h2>3. 30 Rock: Best of Colleen</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9oHH0mUV7U"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M9oHH0mUV7U?start=917&wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=917" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>When I was at university, all I wanted was to be Liz Lemon from 30 Rock, so I decided to study philosophy, which somehow got me no closer to working in comedy. 30 Rock is perhaps the greatest show ever made if you judge it by the only metric that matters – the number of jokes it has per minute. This is a highlight reel of my favourite character on the show<strong>,</strong> Colleen Donaghy, as played by the great Elaine Stritch. Is there a better line reading in history than when Colleen yells at her own son <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9oHH0mUV7U&amp;t=466s">“It should have gone to the other boy!”</a>?</p> <h2>4. Arrested Development: Best of Franklin</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q362S62RS4"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Q362S62RS4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Maybe it is cheating to include multiple television shows but I am trying to show my comedic influences here, and Arrested Development remains the greatest television show ever made. With as many layers and callbacks as it had, it is a shock it survived on broadcast television for as long as it did. I have chosen the Best of Franklin because I believe the scene where Gob talks to a puppet that can only say the pre-recorded line <a href="https://youtu.be/7Q362S62RS4?feature=shared&amp;t=322">“My name is Judge”</a> is perhaps the greatest television writing ever produced.</p> <h2>5. Stewart Lee: Don’t Be Late</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RINWy851olg"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="640" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RINWy851olg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>When people ask me to name my favourite comedian, I immediately say Stewart Lee, and I have yet to meet another person who knows who I’m talking about. I think this one-minute clip demonstrates the essence of his work while being one of the few bits of his comedy that has been put online legally. Here he is placing himself as the underdog (his audience are arriving late), while antagonising his own audience and acting superior to them, and deconstructing his show. His best work, in my opinion, is the special <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/nov/27/stewart-lee-carpet-remnant-world">Carpet Remnant World</a>, so please check that out.</p> <h2>6. Norm Macdonald’s final standup on Letterman</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwlxYYtqHfc"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OwlxYYtqHfc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I do not know if there is a comedy fan alive who does not love Norm Macdonald, and it would be remiss of me not to include him. This final set on Letterman contains many outstanding jokes that showcase Norm’s brilliance. He somehow manages to mine exceptional jokes out of IDs and the second world war that no one else has thought of. Even though we all carry IDs and the joke was staring us in the face, only he thought of it, and even though countless jokes about the second world war have been told, he is able to find a fresh angle. Observational comedy at its best.</p> <h2>7. Nate Bargatze ordering coffee</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOm7Gr-1BUc"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MOm7Gr-1BUc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>I am running out of unique ways to say, “I like this comedy set”. But Nate Bargatze’s ability to turn something as mundane as ordering a coffee into a personal crisis is why he’s one of the best working today.</p> <h2>8. Bob Mortimer takes in a pet owl</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thenUjFv0vk"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/thenUjFv0vk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>Bob Mortimer lives such a strange life any story he tells could be true or a lie, which is why it’s such a joy to watch him bluff his way through a story on Would I Lie To You whilst being interrogated. His way with words on his feet is incredible, as demonstrated here when he describes an owl as “a lump of meat and feathers”.</p> <h2>9. Reuben Solo: I got booed on America’s Got Talent</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpPNsJqPyj0"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OpPNsJqPyj0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>The media often paints America as a divided nation, an image I have long believed is incorrect ‘cause at the heart of it, when it counts, Americans can put aside their differences and agree that they hate Reuben Solo. In this postmortem of his first and hopefully last reality television appearance, Solo explains how he achieved the dubious honour of being the first person in America’s Got Talent to receive all four red eliminating buzzers whilst getting the golden buzzer. Reuben is no stranger to failure (as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C3KJqkWPcXB/?img_index=1">repeatedly documented on this website</a>) and uses this video to explain where it all went wrong (when he was born). One of the great joys in life is seeing a friend succeed but one of the greater joys in life is seeing a friend fail abysmally on an international scale.</p> <h2>10. Tig Notaro: Taylor Dayne story</h2>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSwzYB545hY"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jSwzYB545hY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> </figure>   <p>One of the greatest examples of repetition used in comedy.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Ray O’Leary is <a href="https://www.livenation.com.au/ray-o-leary-tickets-adp1406844">touring nationally</a> with his show ‘Laughter?’ I Hardly Know Her: Perth (17-26 January), Adelaide (21-22 February), Hobart (8 March), Gold Coast (20-21 March), Canberra (22 March), Melbourne (27 March – 20 April), Sydney (2 May), Brisbane (8-11 May), Newcastle (13 July).</em></p></li> </ul>
