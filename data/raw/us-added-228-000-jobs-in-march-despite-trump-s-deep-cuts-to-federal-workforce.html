<p>The US added 228,000 jobs in March, far more than expected, as the US economy shook off the blow from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s deep cuts to federal workers.</p> <p>The figure was up<strong> </strong>from an adjusted 117,000 jobs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/mar/07/us-february-jobs-report">added</a> in February. Unemployment rose slightly to<strong> </strong>4.2%.</p> <p>Economists anticipated 140,000 jobs would be added in March 2025, a slight decrease from February and a continued decline from the monthly average of 167,000 jobs over the past 12 months.
