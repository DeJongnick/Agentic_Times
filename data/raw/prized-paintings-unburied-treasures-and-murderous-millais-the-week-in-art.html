Her aim was to illustrate the deep connection between a woman and a man, a relationship shaped by care and burden, intimacy and distance. The man swings from the flowing black dress of the woman above him. The clothing becomes the bridge between the two figures, soft yet unbreakable. It’s a visual metaphor for how men, knowingly or not, often rest on the invisible emotional strength of women. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/03/women-behind-the-lens-fatimazohra-serri-morocco-photographer-quiet-act-of-resistance-words-silenced">Read more here</a>. </p> <h2>What we learned</h2> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/04/newly-discovered-portrait-of-shakespeares-patron-suggests-he-is-the-fair-youth-of-the-sonnets">A newly discovered portrait may depict ‘fair youth’ of Shakespeare’s sonnets</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/04/stirling-prize-for-architecture-shortlist-spruced-up-big-ben-cambridge-crystal-donut">A crystal doughnut and spruced-up Big Ben feature in this year’s Stirling prize for architecture shortlist</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/02/mona-hatoum-encounters-giacometti-review-barbican">Mona Hatoum and Giacometti have a meeting of marvellously macabre minds</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/02/trans-art-artists">The work of current trans artists speaks to an important moment</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/sep/02/artefacts-london-museum-preserving-somali-culture-house">A museum in London is the UK’s first dedicated space for Somali heritage</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/sep/01/johnny-vegas-on-swapping-comedy-for-ceramics-youve-got-to-be-hungry-for-it-and-right-now-im-hungry-for-sculpture">Johnny Vegas has returned to his first love – pottery</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/aug/31/david-hockneys-90-metre-normandy-nature-frieze-to-be-shown-in-london">David Hockney’s 90-metre Normandy frieze is arriving in London</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/aug/31/they-had-everything-then-nothing-the-prodigies-the-art-world-forgot">Robert Colquhoun and Bobby MacBryde are the forgotten bright young things of modern British art</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2025/aug/31/pablo-picasso-theatre-dance-tate-modern-weeping-woman">A new exhibition at Tate Modern looks at Picasso’s love of the theatrical</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/sep/03/women-behind-the-lens-fatimazohra-serri-morocco-photographer-quiet-act-of-resistance-words-silenced">Fatimazohra Serri’s photography resists roles imposed on Moroccan women</a></p> <h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2> <p><strong>Isabella by John Everett Millais, 1849</strong></p>    <p>A murder story by the 14th-century writer Giovanni Boccaccio becomes a satire on capitalism in this bristling Victorian scene. A family of rich Florentine merchants sit at table, their faces caricatures of cunning and greed. Millais was painting in the wake of Europe’s 1848 revolutions and Britain’s Chartist movement, at a time when novelists were probing the injustices of the new industrial society. Medieval Florence with its highly commercial economy offers Millais a mirror of his own time. In the foreground, Isabella is wooed by the young apprentice Lorenzo with love-hungry eyes. But one of her brothers kicks her dog with a long white-stockinged leg as another studies the blood-red wine in his glass. They are planning to kill this penniless youth who dares love their sister. A pot of basil against the blue sky is presumably the very one in which she will keep Lorenzo’s head.<br>• <a href="https://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/artifact/isabella">Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool</a></p> <h2>Sign up to the Art Weekly newsletter</h2> <p>If you don’t already receive our regular roundup of art and design news via email, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/19/sign-up-to-the-art-weekly-email">please sign up here</a>.</p> <h2>Get in touch</h2> <p>If you have any questions or comments about any of our newsletters please email <a href="mailto:newsletters@theguardian.com">newsletters@theguardian.com</a></p>
