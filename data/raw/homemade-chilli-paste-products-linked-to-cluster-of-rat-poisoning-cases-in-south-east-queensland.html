<p>Health authorities have identified homemade chilli paste products as the source of a cluster of rat poisoning cases in south-east Queensland.</p> <p>Five people from the same geographic area presented to hospitals earlier in October with symptoms consistent with being exposed to brodifacoum, the active ingredient in rat poison.</p> <p>Queensland Health began investigating any potential link or source, and on Friday night announced that of those five people, they were aware that three had consumed homemade unlabelled chilli paste products.</p> <p>“These products are a homemade capsicum and chilli paste and a homemade marinated eggplant containing a capsicum and chilli paste,” Queensland Health said in a statement.</p> <p>These product samples have tested positive for brodifacoum, the statement said.</p> <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/email-newsletters?CMP=copyembed&amp;CMP=emailbutton"><sub>Sign up: AU Breaking News email</sub></a></p> <p>Queensland Health has issued an alert for people to be aware of the products they warn could still be circulating in the Logan community, either having been bought or gifted from mid-September 2025 onwards.</p> <p>Chief health officer Dr Catherine McDougall said “the identified products are homemade and do not appear to be widely distributed. It is believed they are available only very locally in the Logan community.”</p> <p>Queensland Health warned if people believe they have these products at home, they should be thrown away immediately in the bin, and not the garden as pets could eat the products.</p> <p>Brodifacoum interferes with the body’s ability to produce Vitamin K, which is essential for blood to clot and can cause bleeding-related complications if ingested.</p> <p>Bleeding-related symptoms can include bleeding gums, unexplained bruises, blood in urine or stool and swelling of joints that cannot otherwise be explained.</p> <p>McDougall said no other possible cases of brodifacoum poisoning have been identified since the five individuals were reported last week. Queensland Health said all five were now well.</p> <p>“We do not believe there is a widespread risk to the broader community; however, we encourage people in the Logan area to be alert,” McDougall said.</p> <p>“The investigation remains ongoing, we are continuing to make further inquiries and will keep the community updated.”</p>  <figure class="element element-embed" data-alt="pointer">  <iframe class="fenced" srcdoc="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;script src=&quot;https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2025/01/21/article-button.js&quot;&gt;&lt;script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"></iframe> </figure>
