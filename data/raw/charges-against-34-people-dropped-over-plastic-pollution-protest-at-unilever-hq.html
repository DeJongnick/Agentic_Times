<p>Criminal charges have been dropped against dozens of people who staged a protest against plastic pollution outside the headquarters of Unilever.</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has decided not to proceed against 34 individuals days before their trial was due to start.</p> <p>Eight people had been facing charges of aggravated trespass and 26 protesters were charged with the new offence of “locking on”, which was introduced in the Public Order Act 2023.</p> <p>In a letter from the CPS, lawyers said charges were being dropped because there was “not enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction”.</p> <p>The charges related to a protest outside Unilever’s headquarters in London last September when Greenpeace activists blockaded the entrances in protest over the company’s alleged failure to tackle plastic pollution.</p> <p>Will McCallum, a co-executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “This is a bolt of good news in an otherwise bleak landscape for protest rights. Our activists were facing a combined total of up to 15 years in prison for standing up to one of the world’s largest plastic polluters.</p> <p>“The invented crime of ‘locking on’ is just one new tool in a well-stocked legal arsenal that is being used to stifle dissent and send peaceful protesters to jail. Previous governments brought in these laws and powers, but the responsibility lies with [the prime minister] Keir Starmer to end their chilling effect on democracy and repeal them.”</p> <p>The crime of locking on was one of a number of offences and powers created by the previous Conservative government in its crackdown on peaceful protest.</p> <p>Last year, one climate activist was sentenced to five years in prison, and four others to four years in prison, for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/jul/18/five-just-stop-oil-supporters-jailed-over-protest-that-blocked-m25">taking part in a video</a> call to discuss a planned protest.</p> <p>Greenpeace’s protest was part of a continuing campaign against Unilever after the company announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/28/unilever-accused-of-breaking-plastics-pledge-53bn-sachets-greenpeace">major rollback of plastic reduction </a>targets last year.</p> <p>Climbers scaled the headquarters and attached a large artwork to the outside wall. Activists also blocked the entrances to the building, locking themselves on to large models of the company’s flagship Dove products and a “dead dove” parody of the brand’s logo.</p> <p>The first trials had been due to begin on 15 January at City of London magistrates court.</p> <p>Unilever has been approached for a comment.</p>
