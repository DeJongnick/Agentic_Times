  <p><strong>Drones in Poland are another unsettling post-Alaska escalation by Russia. </strong></p> 
  <p>The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh has this analysis: </p> 
  <p><em>Whatever Donald Trump discussed with Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/15/trump-putin-alaska-meeting-ukraine">in Alaska last month</a>, the outcome has only been a stepped increase in Russian aggression that has now forced Nato’s military into action. On Tuesday night 19 Russian drones <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/poland-shoots-down-drones-over-its-territory-amid-russian-attack-on-ukraine-says-military">entered the country’s airspace</a>, according to the prime minister, Donald Tusk – a number that cannot be easily explained away as accidental.</em></p> 
  <p><em>Until that point, Russia’s war in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> had not spilled over in a notable way to a Nato country. Though the drone incursion cannot be described as militarily significant (only one house has been reported damaged so far) the Polish incident is qualitatively different from anything that has happened since February 2022.</em></p> 
  <p><em>A month ago a single Russian drone exploded in eastern Poland, which was at the time notable. Two days ago, Estonia complained that a Russian Mi-8 attack helicopter had violated its airspace in the Baltic Sea for the third time this year. This time the drones forced a closure of four airports overnight, some flying via Belarus.</em></p> 
  <p><em>There is a fit with other post-Alaska Russian attacks in Ukraine, however. Last month, Russia returned to its campaign of bombing Ukrainian cities, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/28/russia-launches-kyiv-attack-ukraine-capital-deaths-injuries">killing at least 18 people in Kyiv</a> in late August. On Sunday, the Kremlin went one further. For the first time, a key Ukrainian government building, the cabinet building, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/07/child-among-three-people-killed-in-russian-attack-on-kyiv-that-also-sparked-fire-at-government-building">was struck</a> as part of a massive nationwide assault of more than 800 drones that stayed inside Ukraine.</em></p>

  <p><strong>The UN has warned of a “real risk” of the war in Ukraine spilling over throughout the rest of the region. </strong></p> 
  <p>Speaking on Wednesday, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said: “The incident... again underlines the regional impact and real risk of expansion of this devastating conflict.” </p> 
  <p>Dujarric’s comments came as Russian drones flew into Polish airspace, in turn prompting outrage across European countries as Nato allies weigh a response to the incursion. </p>

  <p><strong>UK’s John Healey</strong> may have presided over <strong>an unexpectedly slimmed down meeting of E5 defence ministers in Woolwich today</strong>, with Poland’s <strong>Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz</strong> forced to fly back to Warsaw overnight and France’s <strong>Sébastien Lecornu</strong> promoted to prime minister. </p> 
  <p>But <strong>Healey demonstrated that Nato allies are responding to the Russian drone incursion seriously</strong> with the promise that UK was looking at “options to bolster Polish air defences”. </p> 
  <p>Though <strong>he wouldn’t quite say that Russia had deliberately targeted Poland,</strong> the criticism was strong: “They were dangerous, <strong>they were reckless</strong>, they breached sovereign Polish and Nato airspace”. </p> 
  <p><strong>Last night’s response, involving Dutch F-35s scrambling to help their Polish counterparts, demonstrated Nato’s effectiveness</strong> but it <strong>must be a concern to western planners that only 3 or 4 out of 20 drones</strong> (even if they were not armed) <strong>were shot down</strong> – a low proportion compared to what Ukraine typically achieves.</p>

  <p>Poland’s foreign minister <strong>Radosław Sikorski</strong> is now speaking in Warsaw, <strong>talking about the “unprecedented” attack “not only on the territory of Poland, but also on Nato and the EU.”</strong></p>

  <p>He then says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“As you know, <strong>Russian drones have veered into Polish airspace before, and not only drones, also cruise missiles.</strong> One of them, during this war, landed 10 kilometres from my house. <strong>When one or two drones does it, it is possible that it was a technical malfunction, but as I told you, in this case, there were 19 breaches, and it simply defies imagination that could be accidental.”</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He confirms that Poland has invoked Article 4 of Nato to call a discussion on the threat its faced.</p> 
  <p>He then explains:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“We have invoked Article Four.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Take a look at precedents, at what happened when other Allies did that, when Turkey did it, when she felt endangered by events in the air during the Syrian civil war, additional Patriot missiles were sent to Turkey.</em></p>

  <p>His answer is pretty non-commital, but makes a reference to the UK armed force’s previous experience of serving in central and eastern Europe.</p> 
  <p>He says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“<strong>I have asked the UK armed forces to look at options about how we can bolster that Nato air defence over Poland.</strong> We, too, are part of a regular air policing mission. Up until six weeks ago, we had six typhoon jets, part of the British component to that Nato air policing mission over Poland, an extra 200 personnel.</em></p> 
   <p><em>We have 300 UK personnel in Poland at the moment, reinforcing Nato’s deterrence as well as the Polish deterrence and defence as well, and <strong>we will do what we can as part of Nato, as part of a collective response that Poland has asked for from us, its Nato allies.</strong>”</em></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Putin ‘hits new level of hostility against Europe’, UK defence minister says, asks UK armed forces to look at bolstering Nato's air defence over Poland</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>UK defence secretary <strong>John Healey </strong>is now speaking after the E5 meeting of France, Germany, the UK, Italy and Poland in London, responding to the overnight Russian drone incursion in Polish air space.</p> 
  <p>He says:</p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“We face <strong>a new era of threat. War in Europe,</strong> rising Russian aggression, and last night, <strong>Putin hit a new level of hostility against Europe.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>We saw across Nato’s eastern border a serious violation of Polish airspace, deep enough for Warsaw airport to be closed, and Nato jets shooting down Russian drones in what is <strong>the first defensive action of its kind since Putin launched his full scale attack on Ukraine.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>And just at the same period as Russia’s attacks on Ukraine intensify, as prime minister Starmer said this morning, <strong>these moves, he said, only serve to remind us of President Putin’s blatant disregard for peace.</strong></em></p> 
   <p><em>So together, we, <strong>the E5 totally condemn these attacks.</strong> Russian actions are reckless. They are dangerous. They are unprecedented.</em></p> 
   <p><em><strong>We see what Putin is doing yet again. He is testing us yet again.”</strong></em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He noted the Polish defence minister “rightly returned home” overnight to be in Warsaw to coordinate next steps, as he paid tribute “to the Polish and Nato personnel involved in such a rapid and effective defensive.”</p> 
  <p>Addressing the Polish people, he says “<strong>as your Nato ally, we will support you;</strong> our Polish friends, as your Nato ally, we will play our part to help secure the safety of your people.”</p> 
  <p>He says <strong>he has asked the UK armed forces “to look at options to bolster Nato’s air defence over Poland.”</strong></p> 
  <blockquote> 
   <p><em>“Today, as a five nations, we say to President Putin: your aggression only serves to strengthen the unity between our Nato nations; your aggression only serves to strengthen our determination to stand with Ukraine,” he says.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Defence minister from Italy and junior ministers from Italy, France also offered their solidarity with Poland.</p>

  <p>“I call on Russia to put an end to this reckless escalation. I reiterate to the Polish people and their government our full solidarity. I will soon speak with Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte. <strong>We will not compromise on the security of the Allies,</strong>” he said.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Ukrainian</strong> president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> said on Wednesday that <strong>Poland</strong> was deliberately targeted in a <strong>Russian</strong> drone attack overnight. </p> 
  <p>“Increasing evidence indicates that this movement, this direction of strike, was no accident,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.</p> 
  <p>He wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>More information is coming in about the intrusion of Russian attack drones into Polish territory. As of now, it’s known about eight drones. Increasing evidence indicates that this movement, this direction of strike, was no accident. There have been previous incidents of individual Russian drones crossing the border and traveling a short distance into neighboring countries. But this time, we are recording a much larger scale and deliberate targeting. </p> 
   <p>Ukraine is ready to provide Poland with all the necessary data available regarding this Russian strike. Ukraine is also ready to help Poland build an effective system of warning and protection against such Russian threats. It is clear that Russian aggression poses a danger to every independent nation in our region, and therefore only joint and coordinated action can guarantee reliable security. </p> 
   <p>The precedent of using combat aircraft from several European countries simultaneously to shoot down Russian weapons and protect human lives is highly significant. Ukraine has long proposed to its partners the creation of a joint air-defence system to ensure the guaranteed downing of ‘shaheds’, other drones, and missiles through the combined strength of our combat aviation and air defenses. Together, Europeans are always stronger. Russia must feel that the response to this escalatory step, and even more so to an attempt to humiliate one of Europe’s key countries, will be clear and strong from all partners.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Ukrainian</strong> president <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskyy</strong> has described <strong>Russia</strong>’s latest attack on the country, which saw drones enter <strong>Polish</strong> airspace, as “another step of escalation” and “an extremely dangerous precedent for Europe”.</p> 
  <p>Zelenskyy said on Wednesday that at least eight drones had targeted Poland during Russian attacks overnight that deployed a total of about 415 drones and over 40 missiles.</p> 
  <p>He called for a stronger response from allies and said “delaying restrictions on Russia and its accomplices only means increasing the brutality of the strikes”.</p> 
  <p>Here is his statement that was posted on his X account:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Rescuers are now working in Volochysk, Khmelnytskyi region, where the Russians struck an ordinary sewing workshop with a missile. As of now, three people are reported injured. This is just one of the sites of today’s massive Russian attack: about 415 drones of various types and more than 40 cruise and ballistic missiles. Fifteen of our regions were under attack. Sadly, one person was killed as a result of shelling in the Zhytomyr region. My condolences to the family and loved ones.</p> 
   <p>Moscow always pushes the boundaries of what is possible, and if it does not encounter a strong reaction, it remains at the new level of escalation. Today there was another step of escalation – Russian-Iranian ‘shaheds’ operated in the airspace of Poland, in Nato airspace. It was not just one ‘shahed’ that could be called an accident, but at least eight strike drones aimed toward Poland.</p> 
   <p>An extremely dangerous precedent for Europe. Whether there will be further steps depends entirely on the coordination and strength of the response. The Russians must feel the consequences. Russia must feel that the war cannot be expanded and will have to be ended.</p> 
   <p>The pause in sanctions has gone on far too long. Delaying restrictions on Russia and its accomplices only means increasing the brutality of the strikes. Sufficient weapons are needed to deter Russia. A strong response is needed – and it can only be a joint response by all partners: Ukraine, Poland, all Europeans, the United States. I thank everyone who is helping.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Russian drone incursion into Poland shows that “Putin’s sense of impunity keeps growing”, Ukraine’s foreign minister Andrii Sybiha has said, and called for partner countries in neighbouring countries to be allowed to shoot down drones and missiles in Ukrainian air space. In a post on X he wrote:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Putin just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. The longer he faces no strength in response, the more aggressive he gets.</p> 
   <p>A weak response now will provoke Russia even more—and then Russian missiles and drones will fly even further into Europe.</p> 
   <p>This situation shows that finally the decision needs to be taken to enable partner air defence capabilities in neighbouring countries to be used to intercept drones and missiles in the Ukrainian air space, including those approaching Nato borders.</p> 
   <p>Ukraine has suggested such step for a long time.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Welcome and summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Poland has shot down drones following repeated violations of its airspace during a Russian attack on Ukraine, prime minister Donald Tusk has said.</p> 
  <p>“An operation is underway related to the repeated violation of Polish airspace,” Tusk wrote on X “The military has used weaponry against the objects.”</p> 
  <p>The announcement came <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/10/poland-shoots-down-drones-over-its-territory-amid-russian-attack-on-ukraine-says-military">after Poland closed airports</a> and launched an operation “to neutralise” objects that crossed over its border.</p> 
  <p>Earlier, Ukraine’s air force reported that Russian drones had entered Nato-member Poland’s airspace, posing a threat to the city of Zamosc, but it subsequently removed that statement from the Telegram messaging app.</p>
