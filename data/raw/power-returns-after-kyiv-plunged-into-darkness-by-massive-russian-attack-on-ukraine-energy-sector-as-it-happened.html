 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>We will be closing this blog shortly. Here is an overview of today’s developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Power has been restored to 270,000 consumers in Kyiv after Russian overnight attacks knocked it out, Ukraine’s energy minister Svitlana Hrynchuk wrote on Facebook on Friday. </strong>Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia used over 450 drones and 30 missiles in a country-wide attack targeting the energy sector. He reported power outages across nine regions and stressed the need for partners’ support with air defence systems and sanctions enforcement.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Russian drones and missiles damaged 12 apartment buildings in the south-eastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, killing a seven-year-old boy and injuring four people, according to the regional governor.</strong> Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said 12 people had been injured, with eight of them taken to hospital.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Twenty-three Ukrainian children and adolescents have been brought out of Russian-occupied areas of the country to territory under Kyiv’s control, president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff said on Thursday.</strong> Andriy Yermak, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said the rescue was carried out under the president’s “Bring Kids Back UA” programme aimed at bringing to safe areas children deported to Russia or confined to Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>French president Emmanuel Macron will convene a meeting of France’s mainstream political parties on Friday ahead of a self-imposed deadline to name a new prime minister, as the country’s central bank chief warned the political crisis was curbing growth.</strong> Macron is searching for his sixth prime minister in under two years and will need to find a personality whose appeal spans the centre-right to centre-left in order to steer a budget through a fragmented and fractured parliament.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Venezuelan opposition politician María Corina Machado has won the Nobel peace prize.</strong> The committee commended Machado as a “brave and committed champion of peace” who “keeps the flame of democracy burning during a growing darkness”. Jørgen Watne Frydnes, the leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, made the announcement at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Spain on Friday rejected US president Donald Trump’s suggestion it should be expelled from Nato for failing to meet his ramped-up defence spending target. </strong>Spanish government sources said: “Spain is a committed and full member of Nato. And it meets its capacity targets as much as the United States.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Police in Belgium have arrested three young adults suspected of plotting a jihadist-inspired attack using drone-mounted explosives, with the Belgian prime minister reported to be among the politicians targeted. </strong>The arrests were made in the northern city of Antwerp as part of an investigation into “attempted terrorist murder and participation in the activities of a terrorist group”, the federal prosecutor Ann Fransen told a news conference.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The Democratic Republic of the Congo has accused the EU of “an obvious double standard” for maintaining a minerals deal with Rwanda to supply Europe’s hi-tech industries when it deployed a far-wider sanctions regime in response to the war in Ukraine.</strong> Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, the DRC foreign minister, urged the EU to levy much stronger sanctions against Rwanda, which has fuelled the conflict in eastern DRC, describing the bloc’s response to violations of DRC territory as “very timid”.</p></li>

  <p><em>Lisa O’Carroll is a Guardian senior staff correspondent who writes about international trade, post-Brexit EU affairs and Anglo-Irish affairs</em></p> 
  <p>Irregular migration dropped by 22% in the first nine months of 2025, the EU border enforcement agency, Frontex has said.</p> 
  <p>But the figures also see the scale of the issue confronting the UK government which has seen a 14% surge of small boats and dinghies loaded by people smugglers attempting to cross the English channel.</p> 
  <p>New figures show the west Africa route into the EU, largely to the Canary Islands, is down by almost 60% while the Western Balkans is down 47%.</p> 
  <p>Attempts to cross the Mediterranean, mainly to Italy and Greece, remains the busiest route with almost 51,000 attempting the route.</p> 
  <p>The Frontex figures also confirm the jump in attempts to cross into the UK from France, up 14% to 54,300.</p> 
  <p>This is 20,000 more than the number who made the crossing across the English channel, according to British data up to the end of September.</p> 
  <p>UK foreign minister Yvette Cooper on Thursday announced £10m ($13m) for solutions to tackle gangs transporting migrants through Europe at a conference in Northern Ireland with counterparts from the Western Balkans.</p> 
  <p>Over 34,000 people have arrived in the UK in small boats this year, with at least 27 people killed attempting the perilous journey in the same time, according to an AFP tally based on official data.</p>

  <p><strong>Spain on Friday rejected US president Donald Trump’s suggestion it should be expelled from Nato for failing to meet his ramped-up defence spending target,</strong> Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.</p> 
  <p>Spanish government sources said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Spain is a committed and full member of Nato. And it meets its capacity targets as much as the United States.</em></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The US president suggested on Thursday the Nato alliance should weigh throwing Spain out of its membership ranks over a dispute about the western European nation’s lagging military spending.</p> 
  <p>Members of the US-backed security alliance agreed in June to sharply increase their military spending to 5% of gross domestic product, delivering on a major priority for Trump, who wants Europeans to spend more on their own defense.</p> 
  <p>But <strong>Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez</strong> said at the time that he would not commit to the 5% target, calling it “incompatible with our welfare state and our world vision.”</p>

  <p>The strikes cut off water and energy supplies while also triggering a fire in a high-rise apartment building. Nine people were injured.</p> 
  <p>Kremlin forces also hit the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia with at least seven overnight drone strikes, killing a seven-year-old and wounding at least three people, according to Ivan Fedorov, the head of the regional military administration.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> has accused the EU of “an obvious double standard” for maintaining a minerals deal with Rwanda to supply Europe’s hi-tech industries when it deployed a far-wider sanctions regime in response to the war in Ukraine.</p> 
  <p>Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, the DRC foreign minister, urged the EU to levy much stronger sanctions against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/rwanda">Rwanda</a>, which has fuelled the conflict in eastern DRC, describing the bloc’s response to violations of DRC territory as “very timid”.</p> 
  <p>Referencing the EU’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she said: “It is an obvious double standard – I want to be constructive here – that makes us curious and inquisitive about understanding why the EU again struggles so much to take action.”</p> 
  <p>The DRC and Rwanda <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/27/rwanda-drc-peace-deal-us-trump-m23">signed a peace deal in June</a>, brokered by the US and Qatar, aiming to end the decades-old conflict, which escalated early this year when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/30/drc-leader-calls-for-military-recruits-rwanda-backed-rebels-advance">the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group seized swathes of DRC territory</a>, including two key cities. But deadly attacks on civilians have continued and a deadline to reach a peace agreement was missed in August.</p> 
  <p>Last year a group of UN experts said up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside M23 and that the Rwandan military was in “de facto control of M23 operations”. Rwanda has long denied backing M23 and says its forces act in self-defence.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p><strong>Venezuelan opposition politician María Corina Machado has won the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nobelpeaceprize">Nobel peace prize</a>.</strong></p> 
  <p>The committee commended Machado as a “brave and committed champion of peace” who “keeps the flame of democracy burning during a growing darkness”.</p> 
  <p>Jørgen Watne Frydnes, the leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, made the announcement at the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo.</p> 
  <p>This year’s award committee has been under particular scrutiny after an intense public and private campaign by Donald Trump. The US president has been openly envious that four of his predecessors, including Barack Obama, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jica/learn/historyculture/nobel-peace-prize-presidents.htm">received</a> the award.</p> 
  <p>Trump’s outbursts have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/norway-braces-for-trumps-reaction-if-he-does-not-win-nobel-peace-prize">caused concern</a> in Norway about the risk of retaliation if the 79-year-old did not get what is often considered the world’s most prestigious award.</p>

  <p>Europe must quickly get its own reusable rocket launcher to catch up to billionaire Elon Musk’s dominant SpaceX, <strong>European Space Agency director Josef Aschbacher</strong> told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in an interview.</p> 
  <p>While the US company has an overwhelming lead in the booming space launch industry, a series of setbacks, including Russia’s withdrawal of its rockets, left Europe without an independent way to blast its missions into space.</p> 
  <p>That year-long hiatus ended with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/28/europe-must-boost-space-investment-to-secure-autonomy-from-us-says-esa-boss">the first launch of Europe’s much-delayed Ariane 6 rocket in July 2024.</a> But the system is not reusable, unlike SpaceX’s Falcon 9 workhorse.</p> 
  <p>“We have to really catch up and make sure that we come to the market with a reusable launcher relatively fast,” Aschbacher said at AFP’s headquarters in Paris.</p> 
  <p>“We are on the right path” to getting this done, he added, ahead of the ESA’s ministerial council in the German city of Bremen next month.</p>

  <p>The arrests were made in the northern city of <strong>Antwerp</strong> as part of an investigation into “attempted terrorist murder and participation in the activities of a terrorist group”, the federal prosecutor <strong>Ann Fransen</strong> told a news conference.</p> 
  <p>She said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><em>Certain elements indicate that the suspects intended to carry out a jihadist-inspired terrorist attack against political figures.</em></p> 
   <p><em>There are also indications that the suspects aimed to construct a drone capable of carrying a payload.</em></p>

  <p>The prosecutor’s office declined to name the intended targets, but several Flemish media outlets reported that they included the <strong>prime minister,</strong> <strong>Bart De Wever,</strong> who was previously the mayor of Antwerp.</p> 
  <p>“Prime minister Bart, all our support goes out to you and your family. Thank you to the security services,” the defence minister, Theo Francken, said on social media.</p>

  <p><strong>WHO Europe director Hans Kluge</strong> said in a statement.</p>
