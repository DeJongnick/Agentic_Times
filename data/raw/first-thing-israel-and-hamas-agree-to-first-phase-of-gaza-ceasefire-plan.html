<p>Good morning.</p> 
<p>Israel and Hamas have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/09/first-phase-of-ceasefire-deal-to-end-war-in-gaza-agreed-by-israel-and-hamas">agreed to the initial phase of a ceasefire plan</a> in Gaza, pausing hostilities in the devastated territory and bringing the best hope yet of an end to a bloody two-year war that has killed tens of thousands, destabilized much of the Middle East and prompted protests around the world.</p> 
<p>Donald Trump announced the agreement on his Truth Social network, saying all of the hostages held in Gaza would be released soon and that Israel would withdraw troops to an agreed line as the first step to a “Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace”.</p> 
<p>Hamas said on Thursday it had agreed the US president’s proposal and confirmed the deal included an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and a hostage-prisoner exchange.</p>

<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What are the details of the agreement?</strong> The details and sequencing of remain unclear but the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/09/gaza-ceasefire-deal-trump-biggest-diplomatic-achievement-what-detail">statement of purpose</a> by Israel and Hamas is meaningful. The 20 hostages believed to be still alive in Gaza, and as many as 1,700 Palestinian prisoners, could be freed within 72 hours.</p></li> 
 <li><p><strong>What about the thornier issues?</strong> It was not immediately certain whether the parties had made any progress on questions such as how Hamas will be disarmed, as the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has demanded, and eventual governance of Gaza.</p></li>

<h2><strong>Trump </strong><strong>criticized for calls to jail Chicago mayor and Illinois governor as national guard arrives in city</strong></h2> 
<p>Donald Trump on Wednesday called for the imprisonment of Brandon Johnson, Chicago’s mayor, and JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor. Trump’s remarks come as national guard troops have begun arriving in the Chicago area at the order of the Trump administration, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/trump-jail-brandon-johnson-jb-pritzker-chicago-illinois">despite objections from elected Illinois officials</a>.</p> 
<p>At a news conference on Tuesday, Pritzker said Trump was attempting to “justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command”.</p> 
<p>The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military’s role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active-duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What did Trump say?</strong> He accused Illinois officials of failing to protect US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. “Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday morning. “Governor Pritzker also!”</p></li>

<h2><strong>Shutdown deadlock deepens as senators reject competing bills</strong></h2> 
<p>The deadlock over ending the government shutdown deepened on Wednesday, with senators once again <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/us-government-shutdown-deadlock">rejecting competing bills</a> to restart funding as Democrats and Republicans remain at loggerheads over reopening federal agencies.</p> 
<p>It came as union leaders for air traffic controllers and airport security screeners warned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/government-shutdown-airports-delays">staffing shortages at airports</a> would cause further disruption. Today is day nine of the shutdown.</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><p><strong>What do Democrats want?</strong> Democrats are demanding that any bill to fund the government be paired with an array of healthcare-centered provisions, including an extension of premium tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans. Those credits are due to expire at the end of the year, raising the costs for the roughly 20 million people enrolled if they are not renewed.</p></li>
