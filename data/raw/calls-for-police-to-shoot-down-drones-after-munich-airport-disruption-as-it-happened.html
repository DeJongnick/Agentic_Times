We only hope he won’t be able to form a government,”</strong> said <strong>Venuše Rýdl</strong>, 68, a voter in the Prague suburb of Modřany, who was unpersuaded by Babiš’s promises to cut taxes, cap energy prices and lower the pension age.</p> <p>Her husband, <strong>Rudolf</strong>, 70, agreed. <strong>“We don’t believe Babiš, and we don’t trust him,”</strong> he said. “He’s a populist and he’s out for himself. He showed it last time he was in government – why would this time be different? He would be bad for the country.”</p> <p><strong>If the polls are to be believed, however, many do not share their pessimism.</strong> Jan, a smart 76-year-old former small business owner about 60 miles (100km) away in north Bohemia, is one of them. <strong>“He does things for ordinary people,”</strong> he said. “He makes an effort for us: last time, he raised pensions, and lowered transport fares.”</p> <p><strong>Babiš “is not arrogant or snotty at all”, Jan added.</strong> “I’ve met him. He keeps his promises. And I like that he surrounds himself with competent people.” <strong>Vladimir Tykvart</strong>, 72, agreed critics had got the election frontrunner wrong.</p> <p><strong>“He’s not pro-Russian – that’s just nonsense,”</strong> Tykvart said. “He’s already been prime minister, and he didn’t try make us like Russia, or Slovakia, or Hungary. And I don’t believe for one moment he would lead us away from the EU or from Nato.”</p>    <p><strong>Quite where he would lead the country, however, is unclear.</strong> Babiš, whose wealth comes from a sprawling empire of farming, food processing and fertiliser firms, started his Action of Dissatisfied Citizens (ANO, meaning Yes in Czech) party in 2011.</p> <p>Back then, it was a centrist anti-corruption movement. It has since swung left, to capture disillusioned, mainly older social democrats, often in poorer rural areas, and then radically right, in search of the burgeoning conservative vote.</p> <p><strong>Few supporters seem concerned by the trial Babiš faces for an alleged $2m EU subsidy fraud from 2007,</strong> when he allegedly took Stork Nest, a farm and hotel complex outside Prague, out of his conglomerate to make it eligible for a small business subsidy.</p> <p>Babiš, <strong>who has been twice acquitted of the charges in two previous trials, has always denied wrongdoing,</strong> describing the allegations as politically motivated. </p> <p>The Prague high court earlier this year overturned the most recent acquittal and ordered a retrial.</p> <p><em>Read <strong>Jon’s</strong> report from Prague in full here:</em></p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/02/east-or-west-czechs-split-over-where-possible-return-of-trumpist-could-lead-andrej-babis-polls">East or west?

warning of challenges Germany faces 35 years after reunification</h2>  <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>German chancellor Merz marked the 35th anniversary of the German reunification, calling for “renewed unity” as the country braces for new challenges.</strong></p>    <p>In a speech in <strong>Saarbrücken</strong>, Merz remarked that in the not-too-distant future – <em>well, in 10 years</em> – Germany will have been united for as long as it had been divided, as <strong>he celebrated what he insisted remained a successful unification process.</strong></p> <p>But <strong>he also warned about growing polarisation in the German society,</strong> drawing inspiration from Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa’s “The Leopard” as <strong>he warned that “much will have to change if things are to remain as good or improve.”</strong></p> <p>He said that <strong>the German nation faced “an important, perhaps decisive” moment in its history,</strong> as “the appeal of what we can the west is noticeably declining” and “new alliances of autocracies are forming against us, attacking liberal democracy as a way of life.”</p> <p><strong>“Therefore, we must regain the ability to defend our freedom,”</strong> he said to applause from the audience.</p> <p>Merz continued with words of caution that <strong>“years of irregular, undirected migration to Germany have polarised our country</strong> and dug new divisions into our society.”</p> <p>He also <strong>stressed the importance of European integration</strong>, urging the bloc to cut regulation and refocus on “economic competitiveness,” but also stressing that the EU will either find strength in its unity or it will struggle due to internal divisions.</p> <p><strong>“We in Germany know: when Europe is doing well, Germany is doing well</strong>, and when Europe is not doing well, Germany is doing worse, too.”</p> <p>In a nice touch, his guest of honour, French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron,</strong> opened
