They’re better now but for me, it’s appalling that this is the second year in a row that Concacaf and the powers that be have allowed an MLS team to go down to Mexico for a big final and get poisoned. It’s ridiculous. Something has to to protect these environments.”</p> <p>A Cruz Azul spokesman described Marsch’s comments as being “out of line”, while Vancouver’s sporting director Axel Schuster refused to blame the Mexican club for any skulduggery “without further proof”. </p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-684445018f08d8006b374057" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-07T13:58:01.372Z">2.58pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">   </div>   </div> <div id="block-684440a98f08edac2d86a29e" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-07T13:48:34.359Z">2.48pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Netherlands:</strong> Ronald Koeman’\s side get their World Cup qualifying campaign under way tonight with a trip to Helsinki to play Finland.

La Repubblica’s front-page groaned: “Azzurri humiliated in Oslo, the playoff nightmare returns”.</p> <p>Italy manager Luciano Spalletti was spared following last year’s dismal Euros but is now under real pressure and nothing but a convincing win at home to Moldova on Monday will do.</p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-07T12:54:20.051Z">at 1.54pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-684433bc8f08179dec9cd456" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-07T12:50:51.537Z">1.50pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Brazil:</strong> Having missed out on the Rangers job that eventually went to Russell Martin, David Ancelotti has decided to join his father Carlo as an assistant in the Brazil national team’s coaching set-up.</p> <p>“The arrival of Davide Ancelotti to the National Team represents another step by the CBF [Brazilian Football Confederation] in its quest for innovation and technical improvement,” read a CBF statement. “His international experience and training methodologies will be fundamental for the development of the players and for building an even more competitive team.

Speaking ahead of Sunday’s Nations League final against Spain in Munich, the Portugal captain said suggestions he was set to take part in the newly expanded competition were wide of the mark. “I will not be at the Club World Cup,” he said, adding that he had “been contacted” by several participating teams.</p> <p>Ronaldo came into Nations League in Germany with doubts surrounding his future at club level, with the 40-year-old’s contract at Saudi side Al-Nassr set to expire at the end of June. In May, the Portuguese posted on social media “the chapter is over” as reports emerged he could switch to another club, potentially Saudi side Al Hilal, one of the teams who will be at the tournament in the United States in June.</p> <p>Ronaldo said he was not interested in making a short-term decision which would allow him to play in the competition. “Some teams reached out to me. Some made sense and others did not, but you can’t try and do everything, you can’t catch every ball.”</p> <p>Ronaldo’s statement will constitute a blow for Gianni Infantino, who invented a new transfer window in what many have interpreted as a brazen attempt to engineer a situation where Ronaldo could participate in his vanity project. The Club World Cup is struggling to attract an audience, with ticket prices steadily being reduced as the tournament, which starts next Saturday, approaches.</p>   </div>   </div> <div id="block-684427788f08edac2d86a1e1" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-07T11:57:55.571Z">12.57pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur:</strong> Having decided that winning trophies and qualifying for the Champions League should not be their head coach’s main objective and sacked Ange Postecoglou accordingly, Spurs are in the market for a new manager and Thomas Frank fits the bill having never done either.

A reserve goalkeeper at Ipswich who has played just nine minutes of first-team football this season, Slicker had an inauspicous debut, was at fault for all three of Iceland’s goals and ended the match being mocked by his own fans. It was a night to forget for the 22-year-old but merely highlighted Scotland’s shortage of experienced, reliable keepers who play regularly for their clubs.</p> <p>“It’s a circumstance that I pointed out in March,” said Clarke. “I could see something like this possibly coming. The good thing, or the only crumb of comfort to take from it, is it happened in a friendly match. We’ll be better covered when it comes to the autumn. It’s pretty unusual to have five first choice all struggling with injury, all out. Not everybody plays regularly at their club. It’s something that we have to address and something we have to look at. It’s not going to change in a click of a finger. It’s not going to change quickly.

After the initial novelty wore off, it was fairly straightforward for opposing managers to set themselves up for Ange-ball, and the results dried up. If the next manager can make us competitive with teams like Forest, Bournemouth, etc. in the next season, that would be a start.”</em></p>   </div>   <p class="block-time updated-time">Updated <time datetime="2025-06-07T07:51:13.733Z">at 8.51am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id="block-6843ecdc8f08179dec9cd2e3" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-07T07:42:01.375Z">8.42am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>John Rudd has messaged in with his view on the dismissal of Ange Postecoglou:</strong></p> <p><em>“Daniel Levy and the board don’t quite know what they want. How much money have they paid out to out going managers over the last 10 years or so? With the league form so dismal and the English media assassinating Ange all season long. It was always just going to happen (being sacked). No doubt next season Tottenham will finish mid table and another manager will go by the wayside. I will add that Ange-ball never has experienced this level of injury. It makes me wonder if it was the playing style or just players being incredibly unlucky. It’s a shame his style didn’t succeed. Let’s see Burnley 5-4-1 formation and wonder if the Prem League will ever see high octane football again.”</em></p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6843ea9b8f08d8006b373e29" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-07T07:38:39.010Z">8.38am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Here’s a reminder of the England squad available for today’s match against Andorra and Tuesday’s international friendly against Senegal.</strong></p> <p><strong>Goalkeepers:</strong> Dean Henderson, Jordan Pickford, James Trafford.</p> <p><strong>Defenders:</strong> Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dan Burn, Trevoh Chalobah, Levi Colwill, Reece James, Ezri Konsa, Myles Lewis-Skelly, Kyle Walker.</p> <p><strong>Midfielders:</strong> Jude Bellingham, Conor Gallagher, Morgan Gibbs-White, Jordan Henderson, Curtis Jones, Cole Palmer, Declan Rice, Morgan Rogers.</p> <p><strong>Forwards:</strong> Eberechi Eze, Anthony Gordon, Harry Kane, Noni Madueke, Bukayo Saka, Ivan Toney.</p> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6843e86f8f08edac2d86a09e" class="block" data-block-contributor="profile/davidhytner"> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-07T07:24:42.349Z">8.24am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p><strong>Ange Postecoglou advanced his case to the last.</strong> And it was a measure not only of his ability to own the narrative, to master it, but his body of work at Tottenham that he was able to do so with such conviction.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/06/ange-ball-was-breath-of-fresh-air-but-europa-league-was-not-enough-to-save-him">Ange-ball was breath of fresh air but Europa League alone could not save him | David Hytner</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id="block-6843e6e18f08d8006b373e1f" class="block" data-block-contributor=""> <p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2025-06-07T07:17:32.898Z">8.17am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class="block-elements">  <p>As always, <strong>I want to hear from you today!</strong> What are your thoughts on Ange Postecoglou’s dismissal?
