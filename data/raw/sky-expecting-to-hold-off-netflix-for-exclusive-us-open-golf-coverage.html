<p>Sky Sports is in advanced talks over signing a new six-year deal for exclusive UK live rights for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/16/jj-spaun-wins-us-open-report">the US Open</a>. The current contract expires after next year’s Championship at Shinnecock Hills and it is expecting to beat off competition from other broadcasters, including Netflix, to secure an extension.</p> <p>The new deal will cement Sky’s position as the home of televised golf in the UK, as it has the rights for all the men’s and women’s majors, the Ryder Cup, the PGA Tour and the DP World Tour. The PGA Tour deal also expires next year and Sky is expected to seek an extension.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/13/gary-neville-row-nottingham-forest-unresolved-sky-ban-assurances">Gary Neville’s row with Nottingham Forest unresolved as new season beckons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sources involved in the tender process said Netflix made a credible offer, which reflects its growing interest in securing sports content.</p> <p>Another source said Netflix viewed the US Open as fitting its sports model of bidding for stand-alone events it feels will attract new subscribers, rather than attempting to take on traditional broadcast companies in the battle for year-round content from leagues and global tours. It previously collaborated with the US PGA on the documentary Full Swing, which ran for three series.</p> <p>Netflix is becoming a significant player in the battle for sports content and this year secured exclusive US rights for football’s 2027 and 2031 Women’s World Cups, while it also has a three-year contract with the NFL to broadcast two matches live on Christmas Day from 2024 to 2026.</p> <p>Netflix increasingly views sports as a key part of its entertainment offering after the huge success of the controversial <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2024/nov/14/jake-paul-profile-mike-tyson-boxing-youtuber">Mike Tyson-Jake Paul fight</a> it broadcast last year, which was watched in 65m households in the US, with 50m streaming the other main fight on the card between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano.</p> <p>In January 2024, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/jan/23/netflix-live-streaming-wwe-raw-deal">Netflix announced a 10-year deal with World Wrestling Entertainment</a> worth $5bn to broadcast the hit show Raw. Having enjoyed a major hit with Drive to Survive, Netflix is also understood to be bidding for US Formula One rights from next year.</p> <p>Sky has the UK F1 rights secured until 2029 and will seek an extension when the tender process takes place.</p> <p>Sky declined to comment.</p>
