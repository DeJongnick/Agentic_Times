<p>The habitat of the largest giant tortoise population in the world is threatened by a Qatari-funded hotel development that aims to bring luxury yachts, private jets and well-heeled tourists to a remote island in the Indian Ocean, conservationists have warned.</p> <p>Plans for an upmarket resort on Assomption, which is part of the Aldabra island group, are currently under discussion by Seychelles authorities, and construction is already finished on an airport expansion that would allow bigger aircraft to land on the 11.6-sq-km (4.5-sq-mile) coral island.</p> <p>The developers have said they will follow world class sustainability practices. But wildlife conservation organisations and biologists argue that the project is being rushed through without sufficient analysis of the dangers. They say it should be halted until there is independent scrutiny of the risks posed to island fauna, which also include whales, turtles and many species of birds.</p> <p>They also fear there may be knock-on effects on the Aldabra atoll, which is a Unesco-protected ecosystem just 17 miles (27km) from Assomption. Aldabra is considered one of the world’s conservation jewels. It is most famous as a refuge for about 150,000 giant tortoises that bear the same name and are known for their longevity and immense size; males have an average weight of 250kg and a carapace of more than 122 cm.</p>    <p>In captivity, the oldest on record was a tortoise called Adwaita, who is reputed to have died at the age of 255 years in 2006 in Kolkata zoo, India. Other individuals include Darwin, who died in Blackpool zoo at the age of 105, and Esmeralda, who is said to be 180.</p> <p>Giant tortoises were wiped out from most Indian Ocean islands in the 19th century as a result of predation by sailors, but the Aldabra population thrived thanks to their isolation. Along with <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/185/">400 other endemic species</a> and the extraordinary colours of the landscape, they were part of why the atoll was listed as a world heritage site by Unesco in 1982.</p> <p>In recent decades, access has largely been limited to researchers, but the new high-end development may draw some of the world’s richest people much nearer. </p> <p>Unesco said it had been informed by a third party about the potential project on Assomption, which might have an impact on the Aldabra atoll world heritage site. A spokesperson said: “Unesco is following the situation and has requested further information from Seychelles authorities, recalling the need to protect the outstanding universal value of the site.” The UN body has sent a letter to Seychelles president Wavel Ramkalawan outlining its concerns.</p> <p>Local conservation groups have also alerted the authorities to the ecological risks they say are posed by the hotel project proposed by Assets Group, a Qatari-owned company. These include invasive alien species, disturbance of tortoise and turtle habitats, destruction of sand dunes for construction, pollution, increased air and ocean traffic, and soil and plant damage.</p> <p>While the main impacts would be on Assomption, there have been concerns about the threat to Aldabra, according to a scoping document seen by the Guardian and compiled by the Island Conservation Society, which oversaw the environmental impact assessment.</p> <p>The Indian Ocean Tortoise Alliance said the development jeopardised the Seychelles’ reputation as a global leader in marine environment protection: “The Assomption Island development project has the potential to significantly disrupt and inflict irreparable damage to one of the most precious national treasures of Seychelles, and indeed one of the most pristine and unique natural places still remaining on our planet,” observed the alliance’s founder, Thomas Kaplan, in a submission earlier this year. </p> <p>Another organisation, the Seychelles Islands Foundation, called for an immediate halt of construction until a biosecurity management plan was put in place. The foundation said that while it was not opposed in principle to the economic development of Assomption, it should not be rushed.</p> <p>“Given the proximity of Assomption to Aldabra, it is crucial to implement biosecurity measures that prevent the introduction of any invasive alien species to either island, given the devastating impacts they can have,” a spokesperson said in an email.</p> <p>There are also questions about the speed at which the project is moving forward and the lack of independent scrutiny. The main body responsible for the environmental impact assessment is the <em> </em>independent NGO the Island Conservation Society (ICS) which has signed an agreement with the government-owned Islands Development Company (IDC) to act as conservation managers on islands that it leases, including Assomption. This is headed by one of the most powerful figures in the Seychelles, Glenny Savy.</p> <p>The IDC says it is following due process and helping the Seychelles economy. It denies that the Assomption development will interfere with the habitat of the Aldabra atoll and said that, in any case, tortoises have adapted well to development in the past, and restoration of native vegetation and provision of water sources for the hotel will benefit the giant reptiles.</p>    <p>In an email, the IDC said concerns about disturbance of whale migration routes and pollution of marine environments were unfounded because no motorised water sports will be permitted in the vicinity of Assomption and maritime traffic will be limited to resupply boats and vessels with staff, guests and visitors. It said strict biosecurity protocols have been put in place for the construction and operational phases of the development. Half a dozen horses will be introduced for guests to ride around the island without the need for motor vehicles. The IDC said it was experienced and capable of ensuring environmental safeguards would be adequate.</p> <p>“In conclusion, we believe that Aldabra, much like the Galápagos – another Unesco world heritage site – should be accessible to the world. Currently, Aldabra’s access is limited to a select few, unlike the Galápagos, which welcomes global visitors,” a spokesperson said in an email.</p> <p>The Assets Group, one of the largely privately owned developers in the Gulf, said its focus was on preserving and protecting Assomption and its ecosystem. It said it had conducted all the necessary environmental impact assessments working with local organisations.</p> <p>“Our approach is to protect species and reintroduce native ones. All planning and any future building will be conducted in a responsible manner, following sustainable best practice, with effective waste and water management in addition to regenerating the island’s biodiversity, which has been severely impacted in recent decades,” it said, referring to decades of guano mining on Assomption. “The planned development, when it gets under way, will revive and regenerate the island of Assomption, in collaboration with leading sustainability experts.”</p> <p>An ICS spokesperson said that trustees are volunteers, who do not participate in the environment impact assessment (EIA) process coordinated by the executive of ICS. This process includes scoping meetings with government agencies, environmental bodies and a public hearing to compile terms of reference.</p> <p>He said: “ICS reports directly to the Ministry of Environment, not the developer nor even our own board. ICS acknowledges there are significant threats with the project that must be addressed by the EIA. However, Assomption is a wasteland after a century of ruthless exploitation. The alternative of a military base here (proposed very recently) would have required no EIA. Sustainable tourism has helped increase numbers of tortoises, nesting turtles and seabirds on several Seychelles islands.</p> <p>“This can be replicated on Assomption with funding made available to conduct ecosystem restoration such as the eradication of rats and cats, replanting of native trees and reintroduction of native animals from Aldabra. ICS expects this to make a huge positive impact to Assomption biodiversity.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 4 October 2024. An earlier version described ICS as part of the IDC; in fact they are separate but have a partnership in which ICS acts as conservation manager for the islands. A response from ICS has been added.</p>
