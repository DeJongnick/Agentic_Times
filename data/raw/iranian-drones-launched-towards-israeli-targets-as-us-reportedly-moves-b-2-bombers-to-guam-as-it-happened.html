 <h2 class="block-title">Closing summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The Guardian’s live coverage of the crisis in the Middle East is coming to a close until tomorrow. Here’s a round-up of what happened today: </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran’s president, Masoud Pezeshkian, has warned of a “more devastating” retaliation if Israel’s attacks against Iran continues, adding that Iran would not halt its nuclear program “under any circumstances,” Agence France-Presse reports. </strong>Iran denies seeking a nuclear bomb, and on Saturday Pezeshkian said its right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme “cannot be taken away... by threats or war.”</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel launched new strikes against southern Iran on Saturday, with its military saying that it is targeting the areas of Bandar Abbas where drone storage sites and a weapons facility is located. </strong>Israeli forces are “currently striking UAV storage facilities and a weapons facility in southwestern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> in the area of Bandar Abbas,” a military statement said, Agence France-Presse reports.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The US military is moving B-2 bombers from mainland US to the Pacific island of Guam, two US officials told Reuters on Saturday. </strong>The New York Times further <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/21/world/middleeast/b2-stealth-bombers-guam.html?smid=url-share">reports</a> that the bombers, which have a range of over 6,000 nautical miles and a payload capacity of more than 40,000 pounds to carry various conventional and nuclear weapons, took off from Whiteman Air Force base in Missouri.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Yemen’s Houthis will target US ships in the Red Sea if Washington becomes involved in Israeli attacks on Iran, the group’s military spokesperson said on Saturday. </strong>“If the US gets involved in an attack and aggression against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> with the Israeli enemy, the armed forces will target its ships and warships in the Red Sea,” the group’s military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a video statement.</p></li> 
   <li><p>The <strong>Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</strong> has asked the <strong>Trump administration</strong> to step in with an initial $30m so it can continue its much scrutinised and Israeli-backed aid distribution in Gaza. The funding application, obtained by AP, offers some of the first financial details about the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and its work in the territory.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said it would be “very, very dangerous for everyone” if the United States becomes actively involved in the war with Israel</strong>. He spoke to reporters in Istanbul on his way home from talks in Geneva.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s military said on Saturday it had killed two top Iranian military officials in overnight strikes.</strong> An Israeli military official said on Saturday that Saeed Izadi, the head of the Palestine Corps of al-Quds, the foreign branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, had been killed in a strike on a flat in the city of Qom, central <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran launched a salvo of missiles at Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning.</strong> A building in central Israel caught fire after being hit by the shrapnel of an intercepted Iranian missile. Later on Saturday, a drone strike hit a residential building in north Israel, damaging the building. No casualties were reported from the missile barrage or the drone strike.</p></li>

It expects $38m from those unspecific government donors for June, in addition to the hoped-for $30 million from the United States. The application shows no funding from private philanthropy or any other source.</p>

  <p><strong>Israel’s assault on Iran, including its nuclear and ballistic weapons programme, is unlikely to secure its long-term strategic objectives, even if Benjamin Netanyahu manages to persuade the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a> into joining the conflict in the coming days and weeks, experts have said.</strong></p> 
  <p>According to diplomats, military specialists and security analysts, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> – and its prime minister – is likely to face mounting headwinds in the campaign, amid warnings that it risks dangerously destabilising the region.</p> 
  <p>There is mounting scepticism over whether even the US’s use of massive ground-penetrating bombs would be able to knock out Iran’s Fordow nuclear facility, which is buried deep beneath a mountain, and questions have emerged about Israel’s ability to sustain a long-range offensive that has exposed its cities to counterattack by ballistic missiles.</p> 
  <p>Experts make the distinction between Israel’s operational success in targeting key Iranian sites and individuals, and its strategic objectives which appear to have expanded to regime change in Tehran, on top of destroying its nuclear programme.</p>

  <p>“The discussions and proposals made by the Europeans in Geneva were unrealistic. Insisting on these positions will not bring Iran and Europe closer to an agreement,” the senior official told Reuters, while speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Summary of the day so far</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>It is approaching 6pm in <strong>Gaza City</strong> and <strong>Tel Aviv</strong>, and 6.30pm in <strong>Tehran</strong>. Here is a summary of the key developments so far on today’s blog:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said it would be “very, very dangerous for everyone” if the United States becomes actively involved in the war with Israel</strong>. He spoke to reporters in Istanbul on his way home from talks in Geneva. Araghchi said American military involvement “would be very unfortunate”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s military said on Saturday it had killed two top Iranian military officials in overnight strikes.</strong> An Israeli military official said on Saturday that Saeed Izadi, the head of the Palestine Corps of al-Quds, the foreign branch of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, had been killed in a strike on a flat in the city of Qom, central <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>. The official said Behnam Shahriyari, another senior official in al-Quds responsible for helping finance the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, had also been killed in a strike.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Iran launched a salvo of missiles at Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning.</strong> A building in central Israel caught fire after being hit by the shrapnel of an intercepted Iranian missile. Later on Saturday, a drone strike hit a residential building in north Israel, damaging the building. No casualties were reported from the missile barrage or the drone strike.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Several “powerful explosions” were heard on Saturday afternoon in south-western Iran’s Ahvaz, the daily Shargh reported. </strong>The Israeli military had previously announced it was striking “military infrastructure” in the south-west.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Four members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were killed in an Israeli attack on a training centre in north-west Iran</strong>, the ISNA news agency reported. Earlier on Saturday, Iranian media reported that five Iranian Revolutionary Guards were killed in Israeli strikes in the city of Khorramabad.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told Iran’s foreign minister Abbas Araghchi that a resumption of negotiations is the only solution to the nuclear dispute</strong>. According to the Turkish presidency, Erdoğan also told Araghchi that Turkey is ready to be a facilitator and that direct talks are needed between US and Iranian officials as soon as possible to pave the way for diplomacy.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Erdoğan also said on Saturday that Israel’s attacks on Iran right before a new round of nuclear talks with the US aimed to sabotage the negotiations</strong>, and it showed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> did not want to resolve issues through diplomacy. Speaking at a foreign ministers’ meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul, Erdoğan urged countries with influence over Israel not to listen to its “poison” and to seek a solution to the fighting via dialogue without allowing a wider conflict.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>French president Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that he had received a call from his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian and that they had agreed to accelerate negotiations between European powers and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a> over its contested nuclear programme. </strong>The French president said he expressed his “deep concern” to Pezeshkian about the country’s nuclear programme.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>However, the discussions and proposals made by the European powers to Iran over its nuclear programme in Geneva were unrealistic and insisting on them will not bring both sides closer to an agreement, a senior Iranian official told Reuters.</strong>“In any case, Iran will review the European proposals in Tehran and present its responses in the next meeting,” the official said. He added that zero enrichment was a dead end and that Iran would not negotiate over its defensive capabilities, including its missile programme.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan told his counterparts from Muslim countries that Israel was dragging the region into “total disaster” with its attacks on Iran</strong>. Speaking at a foreign ministers’ meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in Istanbul, Fidan called on Muslim countries to stand with Iran against Israel, and said the region had an “Israel problem” after its assault on Gaza and attacks on Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>In Iran, at least 430 people have been killed and 3,500 injured by Israeli strikes since fighting began, state media said.</strong> At least 25 people have been killed and hundreds injured by Iranian strikes in Israel.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel deployed 50 aircraft over Iran overnight, hitting the Isfahan nuclear site for the second time. </strong>Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said in an interview on Saturday that its attacks had delayed Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb for at least “two or three years”, and that the Israeli military campaign would continue.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The UN nuclear agency confirmed on Saturday that a centrifuge manufacturing workshop at Iran’s Isfahan nuclear site had been hit</strong>. “There was no nuclear material at this site and therefore the attack on it will have no radiological consequences,” the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement quoting its chief Rafael Grossi.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The UNHCR said on Saturday that the intensity of the attacks is already triggering population movements in Israel and Iran</strong>. “This region has already endured more than its share of war, loss, and displacement – we cannot allow another refugee crisis to take root,” the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Vladimir Putin has said he is willing to mediate between Israel and Iran</strong>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/18/iranian-regime-collapse-would-be-serious-blow-for-russia">latter of which is a close ally of the Kremlin</a>. In an interview with Sky News Arabia on Saturday, the Russian president said Moscow was opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons but there was no evidence that Iran aimed to build any.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Gulf Cooperation Council ambassadors have expressed concerns to UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi about the safety of nuclear facilities close to their countries amid the Israeli-Iranian crisis, Qatar state news agency reported on Saturday. </strong>Reuters reported that the ambassadors warned Grossi during a meeting in Vienna about the “dangerous repercussions” of targeting nuclear facilities.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Police in Iran’s Qom province said on Saturday that 22 people “linked to Israeli spy services” had been arrested since 13 June, Fars news agency reported. </strong>“Twenty two people were identified and arrested on charges of being linked to the Zionist regime’s spy services, disturbing public opinion and supporting the criminal regime,” the agency said, citing the head of police intelligence in Iran’s Qom province.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israel’s military said its navy hit a Hezbollah “infrastructure site” near the southern Lebanese city of Naqoura, a day after Israel’s foreign minister warned the Lebanese armed group against entering the Iran-Israel war. </strong>The military claimed the site was used by Hezbollah’s Radwan Force “to advance terror attacks against Israeli civilians”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Germany has temporarily relocated the staff of its embassy in Tehran abroad due to the current threat situation, a foreign ministry official said on Saturday</strong>. The embassy remains operational and can be contacted via phone by Germans who are still in Iran, the official said.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>A senior United Arab Emirates (UAE) official has urged a quick end to the Iran-Israel conflict, warning of a “difficult aftermath” if the conflict is prolonged</strong>. Anwar Gargash, diplomatic adviser to the UAE’s president Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, said the war was “setting back” the wealthy Gulf region.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Internet-access advocacy group NetBlocks.org reported on Saturday that the limited internet access that had come back in Iran has once again “collapsed”. </strong>The group said on X that the disconnect came after “a brief period when residents could exchange messages with the outside world”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Thousands of protesters marched towards Whitehall from Russell Square in central London on Saturday.</strong> Protesters waved Palestinian flags and chanted “free, free Palestine”, “occupation no more, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> is a terrorist state” and “stop bombing Iran”. Many chanted “shame on you” as they walked past dozens of counter-protesters, organised by pro-Israeli group Stop The Hate, near Waterloo Bridge.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The United Nations high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, has urged more international support for Syria</strong> to speed up reconstruction and enable further refugee returns after 14 years of civil war.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Syria’s security forces have detained Wassim al-Assad, a cousin of toppled leader Bashar al-Assad, state news agency Sana said on Saturday. </strong>Wassim al-Assad was sanctioned by the US in 2023 for leading a paramilitary force backing Assad’s army and for trafficking drugs including the amphetamine-like drug captagon.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican) has described the escalating conflict between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a> and Iran as a “terrifying reminder of how close the world remains to nuclear disaster”, arguing Australia should condemn illegal military attacks and ratify the global treaty banning nuclear weapons. </strong>Israeli strikes on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/what-has-israel-hit-in-iran-and-who-were-the-generals-and-nuclear-scientists-killed">Iranian nuclear facilities</a> violate international law, Ican has alleged, and could cause radioactive contamination with long-term consequences for human health and the environment.</p></li>

  <p><em>Here is the Guardian’s latest news story on the <strong>Israel-Iran</strong> conflict:</em></p> 
  <p><strong>Israel</strong>’s military has said it killed two top <strong>Iranian</strong> military officials in overnight strikes as Iran warned it would be “very dangerous for everyone” if the <strong>US</strong> intervened in the conflict.</p> 
  <p>An Israeli military official said on Saturday that <strong>Saeed Izadi</strong>, the head of the <strong>Palestine Corps of al-Quds,</strong> the foreign branch of the <strong>Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp</strong>, had been killed in a strike on a flat in the city of <strong>Qom</strong>, central <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran">Iran</a>.</p> 
  <p>The Israeli military said Izadi had played a key role in the financing and arming of <strong>Hamas</strong> before its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.</p> 
  <p>The official said <strong>Behnam Shahriyari</strong>, another senior official in <strong>al-Quds force</strong> responsible for helping finance the <strong>Lebanese</strong> militia <strong>Hezbollah</strong>, had also been killed in a strike.</p> 
  <p>After talks between the Iranian foreign minister, <strong>Abbas Araghchi</strong>, and <strong>European</strong> counterparts in <strong>Geneva</strong> ended on Friday evening with no breakthrough, Iran launched a salvo of missiles at Israel in the early hours of Saturday morning.

  <p><strong>Syria</strong>’s security forces have detained <strong>Wassim al-Assad</strong>, a cousin of toppled leader <strong>Bashar al-Assad</strong>, state news agency Sana said on Saturday, according to Reuters. </p> 
  <p>Wassim al-Assad was sanctioned by the <strong>United States</strong> in 2023 for leading a paramilitary force backing Assad’s army and for trafficking drugs including the amphetamine-like drug captagon. </p> 
  <p>Bashar al-Assad was toppled by an Islamist-led rebel insurgency in December and fled to <strong>Moscow</strong>. Most of his family members and inner circle either fled Syria or went underground. </p> 
  <p>Syria’s new security forces have been pursuing members of the former administration – mainly those involved in the feared security branches accused of rights abuses. </p> 
  <p>Rights groups have called for a fully fledged transitional justice process to hold them to account.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>A senior <strong>United Arab Emirates (UAE)</strong> official has urged a quick end to the <strong>Iran-Israel</strong> conflict, warning of a “difficult aftermath” if the conflict is prolonged, reports Agence Fance-Presse (AFP).</p> 
  <p><strong>Anwar Gargash</strong>, diplomatic adviser to the UAE’s president <strong>Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan</strong>, said the war was “setting back” the wealthy <strong>Gulf region</strong>.</p> 
  <p>“The longer a war takes, the more dangerous it becomes,” he told journalists in a briefing on Friday. “I think any extended confrontation or war between Israel and Iran will only bring a very difficult aftermath.”</p> 
  <p><strong>US</strong> president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has given Iran a “maximum” of two weeks to negotiate before possible US airstrikes, but <strong>Tehran</strong> said it would not hold talks while under attack.</p> 
  <p>“De-escalation is extremely important,” Gargash said. “We still feel that there is a path back to negotiations on these issues.”</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Middle East</strong> is still dealing with the repercussions of the 2003 US-led invasion of <strong>Iraq</strong>, which toppled <strong>Saddam Hussein</strong> but left the country divided and destabilised.</p> 
  <p>AFP reports that one major risk of the current war is disruption to the <strong>strait of Hormuz</strong> between Iran and the Arabian peninsula, which carries one-fifth of global oil output.</p> 
  <p>“This war flies in the face of the regional order the Gulf countries want to build, which is focused on regional prosperity,” Gargash said. “We feel that this is setting us back, not only us in the UAE, but I would say the region.”</p>

  <p><em>On the topic of <strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>Iran</strong>, my colleague <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/pjotr-sauer">Pjotr Sauer</a></strong> has written an analysis on how the Iranian regime collapse would be serious blow for Russia:</em></p> 
  <p>The <strong>Kremlin</strong> is unlikely to arm Iran, let alone get involved in the fighting, said a Russian source with ties to the foreign ministry. “Moscow clearly doesn’t want conflict with Trump and is also doing everything it can to urge the US to return to diplomacy. But Russia’s priority remains avoiding any moves that could undermine its warming ties with the new US administration or prompt a shift in Trump’s stance on Ukraine,” the source said.</p> 
  <p>Still, the Kremlin stands to lose from a prolonged <strong>US</strong>-backed <strong>Israeli</strong> military campaign that devastates Iran’s economic and military infrastructure and threatens the survival of the regime in <strong>Tehran</strong>.</p> 
  <p>“If the current Iranian regime collapses, it would be both a strategic and reputational blow for Russia,” the source with ties to the Russian foreign ministry said.</p> 
  <p>“A bigger loss than the fall of Damascus,” the source added, referring to <strong>Moscow</strong>’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/17/bashar-al-assad-syria-russia-moscow-putin-middle-east">diminished influence over </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/dec/17/bashar-al-assad-syria-russia-moscow-putin-middle-east">Syria</a></strong> after the fall of <strong>Bashar al-Assad</strong>, a longtime Kremlin ally whose eventual defeat marked the end of a costly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/08/syria-fall-of-damascus-sidelines-russia-and-brings-turkey-to-the-fore">decade-long Russian intervention</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Russia</strong> has repeatedly told <strong>Israel</strong> that there is no evidence <strong>Iran</strong> is aiming to get nuclear weapons, Sky News Arabia on Saturday quoted Russian president <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong> as saying in an interview, according to Reuters.</p> 
  <p>“Russia, as well as the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), has never had any evidence that Iran is preparing to obtain nuclear weapons, as we have repeatedly put the Israeli leadership on notice,” Sky News Arabia quoted Putin as saying. </p> 
  <p>Russia is ready to support Iran in developing a peaceful nuclear programme, Putin was quoted as saying, adding that Iran has the right to do so. </p> 
  <p>Speaking at an economic forum in <strong>St Petersburg</strong> on Friday, Putin said Russia was sharing its ideas on how to stop the bloodshed in the <strong>Iran-Israel</strong> conflict with both sides. He did not give details of those ideas.</p>

  <p>The <strong>United Nations</strong> high commissioner for refugees, <strong>Filippo Grandi</strong>, has urged more international support for <strong>Syria</strong> to speed up reconstruction and enable further refugee returns after 14 years of civil war, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p> 
  <p>“I am here also to really make an appeal to the international community to provide more help, more assistance to the Syrian government in this big challenge of recovery of the country,” Grandi told reporters on Friday on the sidelines of a visit to <strong>Damascus</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Syrians who had been displaced internally or fled abroad have begun gradually returning home since the December overthrow of longtime ruler <strong>Bashar al-Assad</strong>, whose brutal repression of peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 triggered war. </p> 
  <p>But the wide-scale destruction, including to basic infrastructure, remains a major barrier to returns. Grandi said more than two million people had returned to their areas of origin, including about 1.5 million internally displaced people, while 600,000 others have come back from neighbouring countries including <strong>Lebanon</strong>, <strong>Jordan</strong> and <strong>Turkey</strong>.</p> 
  <p>“Two million of course is only a fraction of the very big number of Syrian refugees and displaced, but it is a very big figure,” he said, reports AFP. According to <strong>UNHCR</strong>, 13.5 million Syrians remain displaced internally or abroad.</p> 
  <p>Grandi said that after Assad’s toppling, the main obstacle to returns was “a lack of services, lack of housing, lack of work”, adding that his agency was working with Syrian authorities and governments in the region “to help people go back”.</p> 
  <p>He said he discussed the importance of the sustainability of returns with Syrian foreign minister <strong>Asaad al-Shaibani</strong>, including ensuring “that people don’t move again because they don’t have a house or they don’t have a job or they don’t have electricity” or other services such as health.</p> 
  <p>Sustainable returns “can only happen if there is recovery, reconstruction in Syria, not just for the returnees, for all Syrians”, he said. He added that he also discussed with Shaibani how to “encourage donors to give more resources for this sustainability”.</p> 
  <p>With the recent lifting of western sanctions, the new Syrian authorities hope for international support to launch reconstruction, which the UN estimates could cost more than $400bn.</p>

  <p>The <strong>International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican)</strong> has described the escalating conflict between <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel">Israel</a></strong> and <strong>Iran</strong> as a “terrifying reminder of how close the world remains to nuclear disaster”, arguing <strong>Australia</strong> should condemn illegal military attacks and ratify the global treaty banning nuclear weapons.</p> 
  <p>Israeli strikes on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/13/what-has-israel-hit-in-iran-and-who-were-the-generals-and-nuclear-scientists-killed">Iranian nuclear facilities</a> violate international law, Ican has alleged, and could cause radioactive contamination with long-term consequences for human health and the environment.</p> 
  <p>“The prospect of radiation release, the erosion of non-proliferation norms, and the emboldening of nuclear-armed states to act without accountability – this is the deadly logic of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/nuclear-deterrence-myth-lethal-david-barash">nuclear deterrence</a> playing out in real time,” said <strong>Gem Romuld</strong>, the Australian director of Ican, a Nobel prize-winning anti-nuclear group.</p> 
  <p>“We need urgent de-escalation and a return to diplomacy. Australia should press its allies, particularly the United States, to act responsibly and stop enabling this cycle of violence.”</p> 
  <p>Israel, the only nuclear-armed state in the <strong>Middle East</strong>, is widely believed to be modernising its arsenal. It remains outside the <strong>nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT)</strong>, but is estimated to have 90 nuclear warheads. Israel has never officially acknowledged that it possesses nuclear weapons.</p> 
  <p>Iran, which had previously proposed a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East, is a state party to the NPT but has now threatened to withdraw. The Iranian foreign minister, <strong>Abbas Araghchi</strong>, insisted Iran’s nuclear programme was peaceful and that it sought an end to hostilities: </p>

  <p>“At this meeting, at the suggestion of Iran, the issue of the Zionist regime’s attack on our country will be specifically addressed,” Tasnim quoted Araghchi as saying.</p> 
  <p>Araghchi said on Friday that Tehran was ready to “consider diplomacy” again only if Israel’s “aggression is stopped”.</p> 
  <p>The Arab League ministers are expected to release a statement after their meeting, Turkish state news agency Anadolu said.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Israel says it killed a Revolutionary Guards chief in apartment attack</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Israeli defence minister <strong>Israel Katz</strong> has said the military killed a veteran commander in the Iranian Revolutionary Guards’ overseas arm in a strike in an apartment in Qom, Iran.</p> 
  <p>The veteran commander, <strong>Saeed Izadi</strong>, had led the Palestine Corps of the Quds Force, Katz said in a statement on Saturday quoted by Reuters.</p> 
  <p>There was no confirmation from the Revolutionary Guards.</p> 
  <p>The Quds Force built up a network of Arab allies known as the Axis of Resistance, establishing Hezbollah in Lebanon in 1982 and supporting Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the Iran-aligned network has suffered major blows over the past two years as Israeli offensives have weakened Hamas and Hezbollah.</p> 
  <p>Katz said Izadi financed and armed Hamas during its October 2023 attacks on Israel, describing the commander’s killing as a “major achievement for Israeli intelligence and the air force”.</p> 
  <p>Izadi was sanctioned by the US and the UK over what they said were his ties to Hamas and Palestinian militant faction Islamic Jihad.</p>

  <p>Iran’s Fars news agency has said the Isfahan nuclear facility – one of the country’s biggest – has been targeted in Israel’s latest attacks but there is no leakage of hazardous materials.</p> 
  <p>Iranian media also said Israel attacked a building in the city of Qom, with initial reports of a 16-year-old killed and two people injured.</p> 
  <p>Israeli bombing has killed at least 639 people and wounded 1,326, according to Iranian media, while Iranian missiles have killed at least 25 people and wounded hundreds in Israel.</p> 
  <p>As fighting continues to escalate, the Israeli military chief of staff, <strong>Lt Gen Eyal Zamir</strong>, said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/israel-warns-hezbollah-not-to-get-involved-in-conflict-with-iran">Israelis must prepare for “difficult days” ahead</a>.</p> 
  <p>“To remove a threat of such magnitude, against such an enemy, we must be ready for a prolonged campaign,” he said on Friday. “Day by day, our freedom to operate is expanding and the enemy’s is narrowing.”</p>

  <p>More here on Israel claiming it has already set back Iran’s presumed nuclear programme by at least two years.</p> 
  <p>Israel said on Saturday its air force had launched fresh airstrikes against missile storage and launch sites in central Iran, Agence France-Presse reports, as it kept up a wave of attacks it says are aimed at preventing its rival from developing nuclear weapons – an ambition Tehran denies.</p> 
  <p>“According to the assessment we hear, we already delayed for at least two or three years the possibility for them to have a nuclear bomb,” Israel’s foreign minister, <strong>Gideon Saar</strong>, said in an interview published in Germany’s Bild newspaper on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>He said Israel’s week-long onslaught would continue.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We will do everything that we can do there in order to remove this threat.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The comments come a day after US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong> warned Tehran it has a “maximum” of two weeks to avoid possible American air strikes.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Opening summary</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Welcome to our continuing live coverage of the Israel-Iran war.</p> 
  <p>The two countries exchanged fresh attacks early on Saturday, a day after Tehran <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/21/israel-and-iran-launch-new-attacks-as-tehran-says-it-will-not-negotiate-nuclear-programme-while-under-threat">said it would not negotiate</a> over its nuclear programme while under threat and Europe tried to keep peace talks alive.</p> 
  <p>Shortly after 2.30am in Israel the military warned of an incoming missile barrage from Iran, triggering air raid sirens across parts of central Israel including Tel Aviv, as well as in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Explosions echoed over Tel Aviv as Israel’s air defence systems responded.</p> 
  <p>At the same time, Israel launched a new wave of attacks against missile storage and launch infrastructure sites in Iran, the Israeli military said.</p> 
  <p>An Israeli military official said Iran had fired five ballistic missiles and there were no immediate indications of any missile impacts or reports of casualties.</p> 
  <p>The new attacks came as Israel’s foreign minister said its strikes on Iran had delayed Tehran’s potential to develop a nuclear weapon by “at least two or three years”. Israel’s offensive has produced “very significant” results, Gideon Saar told German newspaper Bild in an interview published on Saturday.</p> 
  <p>At the United Nations on Friday, Israeli ambassador <strong>Danny Danon </strong>vowed that his country would not stop its attacks on Iran until the country’s nuclear threat was dismantled, while Iran said it would continue to defend itself against Israel.</p> 
  <p>“We will not stop,” Danon said during a UN security council session in New York. “Not until Iran’s nuclear threat is dismantled, not until its war machine is disarmed, not until our people and yours are safe.”</p> 
  <p>Iran’s UN ambassador, <strong>Amir Saeid Iravani</strong>, urged the security council to take action, saying: “Israel apparently declared that it will continue this strike for as many days as it takes. We are alarmed by credible report that the United States ... may be joining this war.”</p> 
  <p>In other developments:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><p><strong>The UN secretary general warned on Friday that expansion of the Israel-Iran conflict could “ignite a fire no one can control”</strong>. António Guterres called on both sides to “give peace a chance” and said the conflict must not be allowed to expand.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump said Europe would not be able to help much in the Iran-Israel war</strong>. “Iran doesn’t want to speak to Europe, they want to speak to us,” the US president said. “Europe is not going to be able to help in this one.” European foreign ministers urged Iran on Friday to engage with Washington over its nuclear program after talks in Geneva aimed at opening negotiations for a new nuclear deal ended with little sign of progress.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The head of the UN nuclear watchdog agency warned that attacks on nuclear facilities could result in “radioactive releases with great consequences</strong> within and beyond boundaries” of the state attacked. Rafael Grossi also called for maximum restraint.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Donald Trump said his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, was wrong in suggesting there was no evidence Iran was building a nuclear weapon</strong>. Later on Friday Gabbard said on social media that the media had taken her words “out of context” and that she agreed with the president.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>Israeli fire killed at least 44 Palestinians in Gaza on Friday, many who were seeking food aid</strong>, local officials said. At least 25 people awaiting aid trucks were killed by Israeli action south of Netzarim in central Gaza, the Hamas-run local health authority said. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots at suspected militants who advanced in a crowd towards them and the Israeli aircraft then fired a missile and “eliminated the suspects”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The UN’s children’s agency said the scarcity of drinking water in Gaza was at a crisis point and “children will begin to die of thirst”</strong>. Unicef said a shortage of fuel to operate wells and desalination plants in the territory meant it “is facing what would amount to a man-made drought”.</p></li> 
   <li><p><strong>The European Union has said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2025/jun/20/eu-israel-human-rights-obligations-gaza-document">“there are indications” that Israel is in breach of human rights obligations</a> over its conduct in Gaza</strong>, but stopped short of calling for immediate sanctions. The leaked document from the EU’s foreign policy service, seen by the Guardian, represents a significant moment in Europe’s relations towards a longstanding ally.</p></li>
