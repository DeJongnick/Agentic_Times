<h2>Who Do You Think You Are?</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>Broadcaster Mishal Husain has written a book about her grandparents’ experience of the end of the British empire in India and the formation of Pakistan – and now she takes an utterly absorbing journey through her family history. She starts in India, where an ancestor was personal physician to a maharaja. <em>Hollie Richardson</em></p> <h2>Stacey &amp; Joe</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC One</strong><strong><br></strong>It would take a hard heart not to be charmed by the daffy antics of the Solomon-Swash clan, from winding each other up constantly on a safari park visit to their Peter Pan-themed Halloween costumes. But the cameras also follow Joe and Stacey to a therapy session to discuss his recent ADHD diagnosis. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>For the Love of Dogs With Alison Hammond</h2> <p><strong>8.30pm, ITV1</strong></p>    <p>The penultimate walkies to Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home, where Alison meets an energetic bulldog-cross puppy who takes a liking to her gloves. She also helps a Frenchie with a poorly leg and a nervous bernese mountain dog. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>George Clarke’s Amazing Places</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>The bustling interiors series continues to celebrate people attempting impossible-sounding builds. Top of the list this week: a woman in possession of three disused supermarket delivery van fridges who swears she can turn them into an eco-cabin. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Joe Lycett’s United States of Birmingham</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Sky Max</strong><strong><br></strong>So far, the comedian’s utterly pointless mission to get all the Birminghams in the US and Canada to sign a friendship agreement is going well. Now he heads to Ohio – the state with the highest concentration of Brums. It’s an action-packed time of caving and gliding, followed by drinking a bloody mary with a sausage in it. <em>HR</em></p> <h2>Barristers: Fighting for Justice</h2> <p><strong>10pm, Channel 4</strong><strong><br></strong>The series continues to offer a gripping, usually sobering insight into the morality of life as a barrister. This time, Laurie-Anne Power takes on the case of a 15-year-old boy accused of murder. Does society need to be protected from this teenager and, if so, for how long? <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2> <p><strong>Anatomy of a Fall</strong><strong> (Justine Triet, 2023), Netflix</strong></p>    <p>Can a court of law get to the truth of a relationship? That’s the problem facing writer Sandra (a compelling Sandra Hüller) when she goes on trial for the murder of her husband, Samuel (Samuel Theis), after he falls to his death from the attic of their house. Justine Triet’s knotty drama is as much a dissection of a marriage and gender expectations as it is of a potential crime. Audio recordings, sexual history, the plots of Sandra’s novels, even the evidence of their partially sighted son Daniel (Milo Machado-Graner) – everything is open to interpretation. <em>Simon Wardell</em></p> <p><strong>Wish You Were Here</strong><strong> (David Leland, 1987), </strong><strong>1.40am, Film4</strong><strong><br></strong>Part of a David Leland double bill with The Big Man, the writer’s effervescent 1987 directorial debut centres on a terrifically ebullient turn from Emily Lloyd. Her 16-year-old Lynda is a rebellious character in her dull seaside town in the early 1950s, to the recurring horror of her father (Geoffrey Hutchings). In an era when female independence is just not allowed – and there are predatory older man such as Tom Bell’s projectionist Eric around – Lynda’s future is uncertain, but you can be sure she’ll do it her way. <em>SW</em></p> <h2>Live sport</h2> <p><strong>Champions League</strong><strong> football: </strong><strong>Arsenal v Paris Saint-Germain, 6.30pm, Prime Video</strong><strong>. </strong>The semi-final, first-leg match.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 1 May 2025 because an earlier version, owing to an editing error, referred to Joe’s parents attending a therapy session to discuss Joe’s recent ADHD diagnosis. It was Stacey and Joe who attended the session.</p>
