<h2>Crafting in Ghana</h2> 
<p><a href="https://globalmamas.org/about/">Global Mamas</a>, in the port town of Elmina, creates financial prosperity for local women through the production of handcrafted goods using traditional techniques. We joined them at a batik workshop, where <a href="https://globalmamas.org/producer/mavis-thompson/">Mavis Thompson</a> showed us how to dip our chosen designs into melted wax, and stamp a length of cream cotton. After dyeing the fabric using natural pigments, we plunged it into boiling water to remove the wax. As the cotton had to be sun-dried between each stage, we sat on low stools and watched the other Global Mamas produce larger, more complex designs. Our vibrantly coloured tablecloths are a reminder of a happy afternoon with Mavis and the mamas.<br><strong>Helen Jackson</strong></p> 
<h2>An anti-mafia walking tour in Sicily</h2> 
<p>Say Sicily, and people often think The Godfather. Go beyond the cliches by joining the three-hour <a href="https://www.addiopizzotravel.it/default.asp?p=vacanza&amp;tour=17&amp;hl=en">Addiopizzo</a> walking tour of Palermo (€32), organised by the local grassroots anti-mafia movement of the same name. They support businesses who refuse to pay the <em>pizzo</em> – protection money extorted by the mafia. The tour takes in the moving Wall of Legality mural depicting mafia victims and the courthouse where the stories of those who have stood up to Cosa Nostra are told. Rest your tired feet afterwards with a <em>panelle</em> (chickpea fritter) and a gelato at pizzo-free businesses.<br><strong>Selena Daly</strong></p>

<h2>A cloud forest adventure in Ecuador</h2> 
<p><a href="https://www.santaluciaecuador.com/">Santa Lucía Cloud Forest Reserve</a> is a community-run eco project nestled in the heart of Ecuador’s rainforests. Hike through mist-draped jungle, swim beneath cascading waterfalls and savour home-cooked meals in cosy cabins, while joining local researchers as they track elusive <a href="https://www.bbcearth.com/news/the-real-life-paddington-bear">Andean bears</a> and assist with community outreach initiatives. This is genuinely sustainable tourism – protecting one of the planet’s most threatened ecosystems while creating vital income for local families. Pickup trucks are available from Quito, though the local bus journey through the Andean foothills is an unforgettable way to arrive. It’s a truly unique “holiday” – wild, breathtaking and genuinely impactful. Staying at the ecolodge, visitors can also join guided hikes and birdwatching trips. A two-day, one-night stay starts at $190.<br><strong>Bobby</strong></p> 
<h2>Organic vineyards and biodiversity near Bordeaux</h2> 
<p>On a family holiday to Bordeaux last autumn we noticed that winemakers were increasingly turning to environmentally friendly methods such as biodynamics and having draught horses rather than machines till the soil. We went on an estate tour that was more than just tasting the odd glass of wine. Our guide informed and educated us about the benefits of organic cultivation and winemaking methods, and at <a href="https://www.chateau-dauphine.com/en/">Château de La Dauphine</a>, we were invited to explore the permaculture vegetables and beehives. At the <a href="https://www.cavederauzan.com/">Caves de Rauzan</a> estate, a biodiversity trail wound its way through the countryside. We toured the vineyards on ebikes hired in Bordeaux.<br><strong>Nigel</strong></p> 
<h2>Inclusive walking tours in Edinburgh</h2> 
<p>In Edinburgh, I was struck by <a href="https://www.mercattours.com/our-stories-your-city">Mercat Tours</a>’ Our Stories, Your City – a community initiative funded by visitor donations. It enables disadvantaged residents to experience five-star tours and historic attractions on their doorstep so they encounter first-hand the history which shaped their community – without financial barriers or stigma. This builds a sense of pride and belonging for those excluded, and evidences tourism as a force for good. To me, it’s a beautiful example of a meaningful travel business and their world-class storytelling not just employing local people but providing unexpected benefits for vulnerable locals.<br><strong>Carron</strong></p> 
<h2>Stay with locals in Kyrgyzstan</h2> 
<p>Kyrgyzstan has a growing <a href="https://cbtkyrgyzstan.kg/en/">Community Based Tourism Association</a> through which visitors can stay with local people. We stayed overnight in Kyzyl-Oi, with <a href="https://cbtkyrgyzstan.kg/en/accomodation/gostevoj-dom-tinatin-kyzyl-oj/">Tinatin Saidinova</a> and her family. Located on the ancient Silk Roads, the small village is surrounded by red mountains, with the Kökömeren River nearby. Our room was simply furnished with single beds, and we shared a bathroom with our guide and driver. The dining room was the focal point, with Tinatin ensuring we were well fed on Kyrgyz dishes, including <em>chak chak</em>, deep-fried dough drenched in honey. We drank coffee in a tiny cafe, bought Russian beers from the shop, and felt we’d contributed to village life.<br><strong>Roy Messenger</strong></p> 
<h2>Winning tip: cottages in County Tyrone</h2> 
<p>Because of the Troubles, the Sperrin mountains used to attract only a few holidaymakers, but some pioneers worked relentlessly to bring in more adventurous visitors. The best example is <a href="https://ancreagan.com/">An Creagán</a> in Tyrone, near Omagh, which offers two-night stays from £340 or three nights from £360.50 in cottages of varying sizes<em>,</em> including one complimentary breakfast. It’s a community-owned resort that has given work to about 300 local people. The accommodation consists of traditional cottages, and there is a much-needed bar and restaurant that locals support all year round. Nature lovers come for its paths and cycle trails, and stargazers for its unpolluted skies. It is about an hour’s drive from Derry or Belfast, but a world away from both. <br><strong>Tom</strong></p>
