<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration">Trump administration</a>’s military <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/25/trump-venezuela-strikes-regime-change">airstrikes</a> against boats off Venezuela’s coast that the White House claims were being used for drug trafficking are “extrajudicial killings”, said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rand-paul">Rand Paul</a>, the president’s fellow Republican and US senator from Kentucky.</p> 
<p>Paul’s strong comments on the topic came on Sunday during an interview on Republican-friendly Fox News, three days after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump">Donald Trump</a> publicly claimed he “can’t imagine” federal lawmakers would have “any problem” with the strikes when asked about seeking congressional approval for them.</p> 
<p>US forces in recent weeks have carried out at least eight strikes against boats in the Caribbean off <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/venezuela">Venezuela</a>’s coast, killing about 40 people that the Trump administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/14/trump-six-killed-us-strike-boat-venezuela">has</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/02/trump-administration-caribbean-drug-cartels">insisted</a> were involved in smuggling drugs.</p> 
<p>Speaking with Fox News Sunday anchor Shannon Bream, Paul asserted that Congress has “gotten no information” on the campaign of strikes from Trump’s administration – despite the president claiming the White House would be open to briefing the federal lawmakers about the offensive.</p> 
<p>“No one said their name, no one said what evidence, no one said whether they’re armed, and we’ve had no evidence presented,” Paul said of the targeted boats or those on board. He argued that the Trump administration’s actions bring to mind the way China and Iran’s repressive governments have previously executed drug smugglers.</p>

<p>“They summarily execute people without presenting evidence to the public,” Paul contended in his conversation with Bream. “So it’s wrong.”</p> 
<p>Paul’s comments separate him from other Republican members of Congress who have spoken in favor of the Trump administration’s offensive near Venezuela, including US House representative Bernie Moreno of Ohio and Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, as reported by the US news website <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/23/2025/its-important-to-liberate-venezuela-congressional-republicans-cheer-trumps-offensive">Semafor</a>.</p> 
<p>The Kentucky libertarian joined Democratic US senators Tim Kaine of Virginia and Adam Schiff of California in introducing a war powers resolution that would have blocked the Trump administration’s use of military strikes within or against Venezuela. But the measure <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/senate-republicans-trump-deadly-force-cartels">failed to win</a> a majority in the Senate.</p> 
<p>Trump on Friday told the media that his administration would be willing to brief lawmakers on the strikes but simply <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/oct/23/trump-san-francisco-federal-agents-white-house-ice-immigration-latest-news-updates?page=with%3Ablock-68fac17c8f08951f69bbc078#block-68fac17c8f08951f69bbc078">saw no reason</a> to seek congressional authorization for them.</p> 
<p>“I think we’re just gonna kill people that are bringing drugs into our country, OK?” Trump said. “We’re going to kill them. They’re going to be – like – dead.”</p> 
<p>Paul has had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/07/jd-vance-venezuelan-boat-strike-rand-paul">military-related disagreements</a> with Trump before his Sunday interview on Fox.</p> 
<p>Trump telegraphed his intent to use the US military to support his administration’s goals of deporting immigrants en masse before he won his second presidency in the 2024 election. After Trump’s second electoral victory but before he retook the Oval Office in January, Paul said he believed using the military in support of deportation was “illegal” and a task better suited for US law enforcement. “It’s a terrible image, and I … oppose that,” Paul <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/25/rand-paul-trump-mass-deportation">said at the time</a>.</p>
