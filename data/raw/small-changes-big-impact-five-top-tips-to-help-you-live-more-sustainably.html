<p>Have you noticed that we’ve all been involved in a small but mighty revolution? Gone are the days when we’d pile our shopping into single-use plastic bags or buy water off the shelf without a second thought. Now, instead, a sturdy tote bag and a trusty reusable water bottle are <em>the</em> must-have accessories. And all it took was for us to make a few small changes in our everyday lives.</p> <p>Obviously, “sustainable living” means different things to different people. For some, it’s buying fruit and veg from local producers, while for others it’s a solar-powered home or driving an EV. But, ultimately, it’s about us coming together to live well and enjoy life, without wrecking the planet. And those everyday decisions, made collectively, can change the way an entire nation works. So, if you’re wondering what else you can do to make a difference today, here are our top tips.</p> <h2><strong>Wash smarter</strong></h2> <p>It’s no secret that reducing the temperature on your washing machine is a surefire way to save energy around the house. But did you know cooler washes also tend to better preserve the fibres in your favourite clothes, allowing you to enjoy wearing them for longer? Set your washing machine to 20C for everyday washes, while using a liquid detergent, such as Ecover, to keep your clobber as good as new. </p>    <p>Or better yet, doing a “sniff test” before you wash your clothes is a great way to help you save energy. A quick whiff can be a good indicator of whether you can wear those trousers for another day – and cleaning only a specific area or stain can also help keep your garments out of the washing machine for longer. Just dab a bit of stain remover and water on the part that’s dirty, and, voilà, you’ve just gained a few extra wears from your favourite pair of jeans!</p> <h2><strong>Repair, reuse, recycle</strong></h2> <p>Making the most of the items you already own is one of the most powerful ways to embrace a sustainable lifestyle. Yes, you’re creating far less waste, but you’re also getting more bang for your buck – and who doesn’t want that? Shopping secondhand is an obvious and fail-safe go-to for great clothes at bargain rates. Likewise, selling things you have outgrown means someone else gets to appreciate your glorious taste. Some top clothing brands even offer to repair and repurpose old garments for those items that you can’t bear to part with. And with far less material ending up in landfill, it’s a win-win situation.</p> <p>When your phone finally bites the dust, check out whether the manufacturer has an in-house repair service. Laptops, printers and games consoles can often be repaired within a few days. Even better, many companies also recycle irreparable devices so all the clever tech can be reused in a new device. You might even nab a discount on a replacement item if you hand in your unusable device, which is a bit of a bonus, if you ask us.</p> <p>If you recycle at home, make sure all items are clean, empty and dry – you know the drill. Or even better, take a minute to check out the tiny number on the base of bottles, and, remember, rigid plastic – which is usually marked with a triangle and numerals 1 and 2 – is typically recyclable. Anything flimsier, such as plastic bags, straws and cutlery – or with a numeral higher than 2 – aren’t generally recycled.</p> <p>Still, one of the best ways to ditch single-use plastics is by using <a href="https://uk.ecover.com/products/dishwashing/wrapper-free-all-in-one-power-dishwasher-tablets/" rel="nofollow">Ecover’s new powerful dishwasher tablets</a>, which have got rid of their wrapper for an innovative plastic-free coating.</p> <h2><strong>Conscious shopping</strong></h2> <p>According to a report by <a href="https://truecostmovie.com/learn-more/environmental-impact/#:~:text=Disposable%20Clothing,of%20textile%20waste%20each%20year." rel="nofollow">The True Cost</a>, a documentary on fast fashion, we consume 400% more clothing than we did 20 years ago. That’s a hell of a lot of stuff! Thankfully, many of us are now familiar with the perils of cheap, mass-produced brands – they mostly fall apart after a few wears, for starters – and are moving towards a more sustainable way of shopping.</p> <p>Splashing out on higher quality seasonal staples – from jeans to winter coats – that have the potential to last for years, not just for Christmas, is one of the easiest ways to reduce consumption. Plus, you’ll save money in the long-run by not needing to replace them constantly. Simply doubling the number of times you wear one piece of clothing lowers greenhouse gas emissions associated with that product by 44%, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/sustainability-blog/refashioning-clothings-environmental-impact" rel="nofollow">according to McKinsey</a>. Who needs fast fashion when you have a slow, comfortable, looks-amazing-no-matter-how-often-you-wear-it range instead?</p>    <h2><strong>Own less, feel good</strong></h2> <p>Newsflash: having less “stuff” can be incredibly liberating. Master the “less is more” technique by always asking yourself the simple question of, “Do I really need this?” before buying something new. If you decide you need the item, think about how to make that purchase as sustainable as possible – perhaps go secondhand or opt for a retailer that offers a repair, reuse and recycle facility.</p> <h2><strong>Waste no space</strong></h2> <p>Did you know that living with clutter can <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/clutter" rel="nofollow">impact our brains</a> – causing us to feel less focused or even overloaded, anxious and depressed? Simply organising your home space better can reduce the levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, in your body – bringing calm and all-round good vibes.</p> <p>The same goes for your dishwasher. Make sure you organise your dishwasher carefully, running it only once it’s fully loaded. Fewer cycles mean less water and energy wasted, after all!</p> <blockquote> <p>Enjoyed this article?
