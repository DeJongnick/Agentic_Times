<p>Keir Starmer has announced plans to consult on a mandatory digital ID to come into force by mid-2029 at the latest. Here we answer some of the most pressing questions.</p>  <h2>Why do the people of the UK need a digital ID?</h2>  <p>They don’t, according to most of Labour’s political opponents. But Keir Starmer, with the backing of the Tony Blair Institute, believes it is time for the UK to join the other countries, such as Estonia and India, that already have a mandatory digital ID credential.</p> <p>Downing Street argues it will speed up citizens’ access to government services and will help employers determine whether people have the right to work in the UK. It would deter smuggling gangs who organise small boat crossings, Labour claimed, adding that digital ID will also make it simpler to apply for services such as driving licences, childcare and welfare, while streamlining access to tax records.</p> <h2>Why is Tony Blair involved?</h2>  <p>He tried but failed to introduce a national ID card when he was prime minister. In recent years he began lobbying for a digital version. His institute, which is heavily funded by the foundation of Larry Ellison, the founder of the US tech company Oracle, says it will “directly improve the government’s fiscal position by reducing benefit fraud, improving the efficiency of tax-revenue collection and helping to better target financial-support payments during crises”.</p> <h2>How does the public feel about it?</h2>  <p>According to <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/57-britons-support-national-id-card-scheme-have-significant-concerns-over-data-security-and">polling</a> from Ipsos this month, the public is divided on the idea of a specifically digital ID, with 38% in support and 32% opposed. Support is higher at 57% when the question asked about a “national identity card”. Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, has joined leaders of the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives, the DUP, SNP and Sinn Féin in opposing the idea.</p> <p>“It will make no difference to illegal immigration, but it will be used to control and penalise the rest of us,” he said. “The state should never have this much power.”</p> <h2>What data will the digital ID include and where will citizens keep it?</h2>  <p>It will include the holder’s name, date of birth, information on nationality or residency status and a photograph. Ministers are also considering whether to add an address. It will be kept as a digital file inside a wallet that can be held on a smartphone. This <a href="http://gov.uk">gov.uk</a> “wallet” is being developed to hold digital driving licences. The same data will also be stored on government databases so anyone needing to verify a credential can cross-check digitally.</p> <p>It is not yet clear whether all the data will be gathered in one place, which experts fear could be a prime target for hackers.</p> <h2>Will it be compulsory?</h2>  <p>In the first instance it will be mandatory as proof of a citizen’s right to work in the UK. The government has not said it will be essential for any other interactions yet. It won’t be essential to carry it.</p> <p>But some people fear this is the thin end of a wedge and that it will lead to digital ID being used for more and more interactions with officialdom and become increasingly ubiquitous.</p> <h2>What happens if there is an error?</h2>  <p>This is a concern highlighted by, among others, Gianvito Lanzolla, a professor of strategy at Bayes business school in London. He said errors could “cascade” across areas like tax and healthcare, potentially locking people out of essential services.</p> <h2>What about people who don’t have a smartphone?</h2>  <p>About 1.7m households are offline, according to the Digital Poverty Alliance. Eight per cent of people aged 16 or over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2025/feb/22/the-tyranny-of-apps-those-without-smartphones-are-unfairly-penalised-say-campaigners?utm_source=chatgpt.com">do not have a smartphone</a>, which for the UK translates into just under 4.5 million people, but among the over-75s the proportion is said to be 28%.</p> <p>“The introduction of digital IDs sets a dangerous precedent, potentially only allowing people the right to work if they can afford and use a smartphone,” said the charity’s chief executive, Elizabeth Anderson. She said this could create a blackhole in the labour market and exclude a significant portion of the population.</p> <p>It has been reported that people without access to a smartphone could be given a physical card instead.</p> <h2>What if a phone is lost or stolen?</h2>  <p>The digital credential can be immediately revoked and reissued.</p>
