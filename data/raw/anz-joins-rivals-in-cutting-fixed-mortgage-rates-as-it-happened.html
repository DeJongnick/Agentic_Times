  <p><strong>Anthony Albanese speaks from Laos</strong></p> 
  <p>The prime minister, <strong>Anthony Albanese</strong>, is speaking at the Asean summit in Laos.</p> 
  <p>He hails the “good news” of the resumption of lobster trade with China, which he says means 3,000 jobs in Australia secure into the future:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I come to these forums in order to advance Australia’s national interests, in order to protect jobs and enhance our economic engagement.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Albanese thanks the business leaders in sectors from IT to green energy who have come to the summit. The business meeting held this morning progressed the south-east Asia economic strategy to 2040 – with 47 recommendations implemented and the establishment of business investment in south-east Asia, he says.</p> 
  <p>Albanese will fly home from Laos this evening.</p>

  <p><strong>Australian shares ease but finish week in the green</strong></p> 
  <p>The local share market has finished slightly lower but its weekly performance was enough to make up for last week’s losses and leave it within striking distance of a fresh all-time high, AAP reports.</p> 
  <p>The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Friday closed down 8.5 points, or 0.1%, at 8,214.5, while the broader All Ordinaries dipped 7.2 points, or 0.08%, to 8,491.5.</p> 
  <p>For the week, the ASX200 gained 64.5 points, or 0.79%, after dropping 62.2 points the prior week.</p> 
  <p>Its finish on Friday was 55.3 points, or 0.7%, off its all-time best close of 8,269.8 set on September 30.</p> 
  <p>The Australian dollar was buying 67.40 US cents, from 67.30 US cents at Thursday’s ASX close.</p>

  <p><strong>Quit stage diving at concerts, insurers tell musicians</strong></p> 
  <p>If bands would stop stage diving at concerts, insuring Australia’s live music events would be much easier, an inquiry has been told. <strong>AAP</strong> reports:</p> 
  <p>Long-time live music fan <strong>Jason Holmes</strong> sells insurance for entertainment events through his brokerage H2 Insurance Solutions and said watching performers take risks onstage makes him cringe.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It’s only fun until something goes wrong, and regularly something does go wrong, and then obviously that’s where we see claims.</p> 
   <p>Insurers are saying: ‘Hey, you can’t jump in a crowd, you can’t throw things into the crowd.’ The artists need to be made aware of this.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The hearing in Canberra today is the latest examining a crisis in Australia’s music industry, with festivals such as Splendour in the Grass cancelled and venues closing as costs soar.</p> 
  <p>One of those costs is insurance. In general, public liability insurance premiums have increased by 40% since 2015, according to the <strong>Insurance Council of Australia</strong>.</p> 
  <p>The live music scene is predominantly insured through international companies, according to the council’s <strong>Alexandra Hordern</strong> – local insurers view the market as unprofitable and too risky.</p>

  <p><strong>Murray Watt</strong>, the minister for workplace relations, earlier today said the government is open to changes to the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (Palm) scheme, acknowledging there has been too many instances of abuse.</p> 
  <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/24/australias-expanded-pacific-labour-scheme-could-erode-workers-rights-ex-official-warns">scheme allows Australian employers to hire workers from the Pacific Islands and Timor-Leste for seasonal roles</a> for up to nine months, or longer-term roles for up to four years. Watt said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>We have seen unfortunately far too many abuses of the Palm scheme</strong> and it’s important for Australia and our reputation that when people come to work in Australia, they don’t get exploited and they get treated fairly.</p> 
   <p>Unfortunately, I’m aware of some examples of that not happening in this very region across Bundaberg and we have seen the <strong>Fair Work Ombudsman</strong> take action against particular employers and particular labour hire firms who have done the wrong thing and that’s exactly the way it should be.</p> 
   <p>We actually have made changes to the Palm scheme since coming to office a couple of years ago to try to reduce the exploitation that we have seen. We brought in, for example, minimum amounts of pay that need to be paid to people to make sure they do have money in their pockets. We have made changes around the housing requirements.</p> 
   <p>But what I can say is that wherever there is exploitation going on of Palm workers or local workers <strong>as a Labor government we will continue to take action and we’re open to further changes.</strong></p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Victoria apologises to stolen generation in quiet ceremony</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>An historic apology has been offered to Victoria’s stolen generation victims by Victoria’s premier, <strong>Jacinta Allan</strong>, <strong>AAP</strong> reports.</p> 
  <p>Allan made the personal apology on behalf of the state government yesterday in Melbourne’s inner north. The premier posted a picture online of the smoking ceremony after the event and wrote on Facebook:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Members of the stolen generations have never received an apology in person from the Victorian government. Until today.</p> 
   <p><strong>On behalf of successive Victorian governments and parliaments, I apologised to those children who were forcibly removed from their families. To the babies and children who grew up without knowing who they were. And the mums and dads who were left – sometimes for a lifetime – searching.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Allan told reporters in Shepparton today that she and the attorney general were “joined by people in their 80s, people in their 50s who were part of that stolen generation who are still experiencing the grief and trauma of being torn away from their family at birth.”</p> 
  <p>The opposition spokesperson, <strong>David Davis</strong>, criticised the government for not inviting the media to cover the ceremony, declaring the apology should have been delivered in plain sight.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">LNP leader says end of coal before 2030s 'fanciful'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The LNP leader, <strong>David Crisafulli</strong>, appears to be walking away from a commitment to 75% emissions reduction by 2035.</p> 
  <p>Asked if he still backed the interim target, which he voted to legislate earlier this year, Crisafulli said his focus was elsewhere:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Our primary target, the biggest focus, is net zero by 2050. We will continue to make sure we’re on the journey, that we have a credible path to get there. 2050 is the number one target.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He didn’t answer a question as to whether he would amend the emissions reduction target.</p> 
  <p>Crisafulli has previously said he would repeal Queensland’s 80% by 2035 renewable energy target. The party voted against legislating it. Last week he said he would extend the life of the Callide unit B coal-fired power station past its scheduled end of life in 2028.</p> 
  <p>Yesterday he said he would extend the life of coal plants “indefinitely”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The notion that by the early 2030s you can turn off Queensland’s baseload power without impacting reliability or people’s hip pocket is fanciful, and even the government’s own energy department has said so.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Queensland has eight coal-fired power stations, including the last plant built in the country, Kogan Creek, commissioned in 2007. Many are due to close in the 2030s.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>The federal minister for communications, <strong>Michelle Rowland</strong>, has said the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/may/03/australia-porn-age-verification-technology-government">age assurance trial</a> – to prevent children from accessing pornography – is evaluating technology that “could be effective to age limit access to social media platforms”.</p> 
  <p>Addressing the social media summit in South Australia, Rowland said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Let me also take this opportunity to acknowledge the extensive work of former high court chief justice <strong>Robert French</strong>. Our age assurance trial is evaluating technologies that could be effective to age limit access to social media platforms from 13 up to 16 years and preventing people under 18 from accessing online pornography. The trial includes targeted stakeholder consultation and consumer-focused research looking into attitudes towards different technologies and important issues of privacy, security and accessibility.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Rowland said she anticipated the independent review of Australia’s Online Safety Act final report “in coming weeks”, and that it would be unlikely there would be a consensus on the right age to ban users from social media:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Let me be clear that <strong>no solution will be perfect, and the consensus on the right age is unlikely.</strong> Young people, of course, are digitally savvy and will find ways to circumvent controls, but we can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>ANZ has joined its big bank rivals in cutting its fixed mortgage rates ahead of expectations the Reserve Bank will lower the official cash rate.</p> 
  <p>Many two- and three-year fixed loans are now priced at a full percentage point below standard variable rates, which equates to four quarter-point rate cuts.</p> 
  <p>Canstar said ANZ had cut owner-occupier fixed rates by up to 0.6 percentage points and investor fixed rates by up to 0.7 percentage points, representing the bank’s first fixed rate cuts of 2024.</p> 
  <p>Canstar’s data insights director, <strong>Sally Tindall</strong>, says:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>For months, ANZ held out on changing fixed rates when the other majors were busy making cuts, but the bank has now gone and made the chop.</p>

  <p><strong>Penalties on platforms, not users, in approach to social media age ban legislation</strong></p> 
  <p>Penalties will be faced by platforms, not users, in the federal government’s legislative design for a national minimum age for social media access, the minister for communications, <strong>Michelle Rowland,</strong> says.</p> 
  <p>She is addressing the social media summit in South Australia, and said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A key design principle of the commonwealth’s legislative approach is to place the onus on the platforms, not on parents or young people. <strong>Penalties for users will not feature in our legislative design.</strong></p> 
   <p>Instead, it will be incumbent on the platforms to demonstrate that they are taking reasonable steps to ensure fundamental protections are in place at the source. Our approach will ensure the eSafety regulator provides oversight and enforcement.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Rowland said the federal government is considering an exemption framework, “to accommodate access for social media services that demonstrate a low risk of harm to children”. She said the aim is to “create positive incentives” for platforms to develop “age-appropriate versions of their apps and embed safe and healthy experiences”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>By design, we are conscious of the harmful features in the design of platforms that drive addictive behaviours, and this is why we will set parameters to guide platforms in designing social media that allows connections but not harms to flourish.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The federal government will set a 12-month implementation timeframe, for the industry and regulator to implement necessary systems and processes, Rowland said.</p>

  <p>The federal court has reserved its decision on whether an “extraordinary and unprecedented” application by <strong>Channel Seven</strong> to suppress details of a dispute with a former employee should be granted.</p> 
  <p>A former Spotlight journalist, <strong>Amelia Saw</strong>, has taken legal action against the network and alleges in her statement of claim that the program created a hostile working environment for women. Seven is seeking to suppress the details of her claim ahead of mediation.</p> 
  <p><strong>Philip Boncardo</strong>, acting for Saw, described Seven’s application as “extraordinary and unprecedented” and told the court Seven was essentially trying to avoid embarrassment.</p> 
  <p>In her submission for Seven, <strong>Kate Eastman SC</strong> said Saw’s statement of claim and amended statement of claim contained “salacious communications” about conversations and text messages and should not be made available to the media.</p> 
  <p>Three media organisations, including <strong>Nine Entertainment</strong>, opposed the suppression order. <strong>Justice Nye Perram</strong> reserved his decision.</p>

  <p>The spokesperson was not able to say how the B-double actually managed to roll over on to its side, but said crews were called to the scene at about 9.15am this morning.</p> 
  <p>The truck landed about 3m from the bowsers and ruptured its own fuel tank, with around 200L spilled that crews are working to clean up. Crews are also working to decant the rest of the truck and unload its contents – pet food – so it can be moved.</p> 
  <p>The driver was trapped for a short period of time and taken to hospital with head injuries, which are believed to be non-life threatening.</p> 
  <p>There is no specific timeframe on when the service station will reopen, but it is expected emergency services will be responding for another few hours at least.</p>

  <p>Voluntary rules about labelling AI content could be fast-tracked in time for the 2025 election and mandatory restrictions applied to political ads when they are ready.</p> 
  <p>The Adopting Artificial Intelligence inquiry issued the recommendations in its interim report today, but failed to secure the endorsement of a majority of its members, with four out of six senators clashing over its content.</p> 
  <p>In a dissenting report, the inquiry’s deputy chair, Greens senator <strong>David Shoebridge,</strong> said the recommendations would allow deepfake political ads to “mislead voters or damage candidates’ reputations”. Two Coalition senators argued a rushed process would unfairly restrict freedom of speech.</p> 
  <p>A temporary, targeted ban on political deepfakes should be introduced to help voters participating in the next federal election, Shoebridge said.</p>

   <p>Under current laws, it would be legal to have a deepfake video pretending to be the prime minister or the opposition leader saying something they never, in fact, said as long as this is properly authorised under the Electoral Act.

And importantly, we will continue to pursue efforts to make sure that the platforms are held to account and do more.

  <p>Just following on from our last post where executives at Coles and Woolworths told a Senate committee they need to ask biscuit maker Arnott’s why their chocolate biscuits are cheaper in the UK than in Australia.</p>

  <p>Vegemite retails for $1.93 per 100g at Morrisons but costs customers $2.27 at Coles and $2.21 at Woolworths, according to price checks conducted by Guardian Australia.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Executives at Coles and Woolworths have told a Senate committee they’ll need to ask Tim Tam-owner Arnott’s why their chocolate biscuits are cheaper in the UK than in Australia.</p> 
  <p>“It’s probably a great question for Arnott’s,” <strong>Paul Harker</strong>, chief commercial officer at Woolworths, told the parliamentary committee on cost of living today.</p> 
  <p><strong>Adam Fitzgibbons</strong>, head of public affairs at Coles, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think the question almost presupposes that Arnott’s sells their product to us at the same price that they would sell those products to other retailers internationally. That’s not something that I or Coles would have visibility of at all, but I think that’s certainly a question that would be very best directed towards Arnott’s.</p>

  <p>The products are manufactured in Australia, raising questions over markups applied by supermarkets. Food manufacturers have consistently said that supermarkets have the final say over pricing decisions.</p> 
  <p>The committee chair, Liberal senator <strong>Jane Hume</strong>, said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It does sound passing strange, doesn’t it, that a product that is manufactured in western Sydney would cost more at a supermarket in Sydney than it would at a supermarket in London after it’s travelled 17,000km.</p>

   <p>Part of the framework of doing that was training police in the new criminal framework of coercive control as a crime, so we can actually prosecute these men, mainly, that coercively control their partners, people that they purport to love.</p>

  <p><strong>NSW deputy premier on electronic monitoring of alleged serious DV offenders</strong></p> 
  <p>The deputy premier, <strong>Prue Car,</strong> addressed press a short while ago to announce the NSW government’s electronic monitoring of alleged serious domestic violence offenders.</p> 
  <p>We brought to Car’s attention <strong>Alicia</strong>*, a woman who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/oct/10/alicia-thinks-she-will-be-killed-by-her-controlling-ex-she-says-police-wont-listen-until-theres-a-dead-body">told Guardian Australia</a> she fears she will be killed by her controlling ex, but that police won’t listen until “there’s a dead body”.</p> 
  <p>Asked how the NSW government can say it is committed to ending violence against women when someone begging for help from police was repeatedly dismissed, Car said it is “those kinds of women and stories that spurred the government on to do something about this once and for all”.</p> 
  <p>She said this is “not a simple problem to fix” and needs to be “attacked from all angles”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We are attempting to do that from every angle, making it harder for those charged with these heinous, heinous offences to be given bail while they await their trial. From today, they are going to have to wear an ankle bracelet.</p> 
   <p>In no way would we ever stand here and say that this is simple, or that we have solved this. There are too many women in NSW that fall victim to domestic violence, to coercive control. It took a significant amount of years to get to the point where coercive control, about where a woman goes, who she sees, what money she spends, leads to physical, mental, sexual violence. It’s women like that that we are attempting to do this for.</p>

  <p><strong>Dementia set to become Australia’s leading cause of death: ABS data</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Dementia Australia</strong> says that new data from the ABS shows dementia is set to become the nation’s leading cause of death.</p> 
  <p>In 2023, dementia accounted for 9.1% of all deaths, closely following ischaemic heart disease at 9.2%. Dementia is the leading cause of death for Australian women, representing 12.2% of all female deaths and 6.4% of male deaths.</p> 
  <p>Dementia Australia’s CEO, <strong>Prof Tanya Buchanan,</strong> said the ABS data reinforces the urgent need for a public health approach to reducing, or preventing, the risk of developing dementia. She said this was especially important given there is no cure for dementia and poor community understanding of the terminal nature of the disease.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There are currently an estimated 421,000 Australians living with dementia and without a significant intervention, this number is expected to increase to more than 812,500 by 2054.</p> 
   <p>As dementia edges closer to becoming the leading cause of death of Australians, it is crucial that we act now to focus on the brain health of the nation as well as provide more targeted, effective support to those impacted by dementia.</p>

  <p>The foreign minister <strong>Penny Wong</strong> is now taking questions.</p> 
  <p>Asked when the first lobsters will hit China, she says “by the end of the year” but is hoping for a “little earlier than that”.</p> 
  <p>She is also asked if the government trusts China as a trading partner, and what lessons have been learned. Wong responds:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We learned a few lessons as a country, didn’t we? The first is that <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> talking tough isn’t the same as being tough and that Mr Dutton and his colleagues really took an approach to the relationship with China which ultimately didn’t end up with a relationship that was stable, where we are could agree, disagree, cooperate where we can, disagree where we must and engage in the national interest.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>She accuses the opposition of seeking to continue politicising the China-Australia relationship:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I’ve been very clear, China has a set of interests – some of those are very different to Australia’s. There are gonna be areas where we disagree and Australia has been very clear about standing up for those issues which are important to Australians. But we also know that <strong>it’s important to engage and we will continue to do that in a mature, calibrated and deliberate way.</strong></p>

  <p>Parker wrote that she is “not alone in feeling unsettled” in the lead-up to the first anniversary of the unsuccessful referendum, on 14 October:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Like a lot of other First Nations people and our allies, since 14 October 2023 I have tried not to overthink the overwhelming no vote, instead focusing on ways to deal with the still fresh and profound grief ossifying within me.</p> 
   <p>It was important for the whole nation to sit for a while with what happened and for mob especially not to drift automatically to “we’re fine; nothing can hurt us”. It did hurt – a lot – and it continues to hurt as some no proponents try to cancel all things First Nations.</p>

  <p>The New South Wales premier, <strong>Chris Minns, </strong>says the advice of older generations is “not available” to parents when it comes to raising children with social media.</p> 
  <p>He told FIVEAA radio earlier this morning:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>The best thing you can do as a parent, and what’s been done for generations when you’re looking for advice or expertise about how to raise your own kids, is to ask your parents or your grandparents about what they did when you’re a pain in the bum. But <strong>that’s not available to us, because this is the first generation that’s gone through widespread, ubiquitous use of social media</strong>, and the what they’re being exposed to online.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Minns also said social media companies “know that it’s doing harm”:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They’re the richest, most powerful firms in the world, and they effectively refuse to do anything about it.</p>

  <p><strong>Young consumers more willing to pay premium for clean energy, according to survey</strong></p> 
  <p>Young consumers are more willing to pay a premium for clean energy, a study released by Accenture has found.</p> 
  <p>As <strong>AAP</strong> reports, the study found 43% of Australian households had struggled to pay energy bills over the past year – more than the world average (37%) and significantly more than nearby Asia-Pacific countries (29%).</p> 
  <p>Most Australian energy consumers (81%) also thought energy providers had a significant role to play in the transition to renewable energy, while 74% thought individuals should play a part.</p> 
  <p>But convincing those energy consumers to pay a premium to access renewable energy could be difficult, while prices of electricity and gas continued to rise, Accenture Australia utilities lead <strong>Mayur Bhaskar</strong> said.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Although consumers do believe in the energy transition, less than half are actually willing or able to assume the cost of it. <strong>Younger age demographics were happy to pay more and that was fascinating.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The survey found 53% of Australians would not pay a premium to support cleaner energy options, with members of the silent generation, baby boomers and generation X most likely to reject the idea.</p> 
  <p>However, 20% of energy consumers were willing to pay up to 15% more for more sustainable power and 27% were willing to pay a higher premium, with the response most common from millennials and gen Z respondents.</p>

  <p><strong>‘Truckload of challenges’ to implementing age limit on social media, SA premier says</strong></p> 
  <p>Continuing from our last post: the South Australian premier, <strong>Peter Malinauskas</strong>,<strong> </strong>was asked about the logistics of enforcing an age limit on young people who already have social media accounts.</p> 
  <p>He told FIVEAA radio there is merit to a “grandfathering proposition” that does not require already active users be removed if they will soon reach the age threshold.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>A 14- or 15-year-old already on it, to boot someone off for them to get it again in six months’ time, probably doesn’t make much sense. But what we can do is we can institute a law that makes it very clear that, for children under a certain age, this is it, game’s up. You’re not getting access to social media within the space of two to three years.</p> 
   <p>In any event, the ban would be effectual for the age group that you’re seeking to apply that limit from, so there are ways to do this. <strong>There is no doubt, absolutely no doubt, that there are a truckload of challenges and complexities to this effort and, you know, actually implementing this reform. </strong>Yes, there are going to be challenges, but the cause is worthy.</p>

  <p><strong>AI boom just getting started, fund manager says</strong></p> 
  <p>Artificial intelligence is just at the start of generating an entire ecosystem of innovative platforms and investors need to be ready to jump on the bandwagon, one fund manager says.</p> 
  <p>As <strong>AAP</strong> reports, <strong>Nick Griffin</strong> – the founding partner and chief investment officer of Melbourne-based investment manager <strong>Munro Partners</strong> – said the AI thematic had generated strong returns for Munro’s funds in the past 12 months and he expected that to continue.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’re effectively having an iPhone moment – that’s what AI is, and that’s the best way to think about this.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Griffin said Apple created an app ecosystem that led to just about every company in the world creating an app for something. Some became huge companies – such as Uber, Spotify, Google and Facebook – and nearly everyone used apps to make their life easier, performing tasks such as online banking and checking in to airline flights.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Generative AI is exactly the same thing – what’s going to happen is that you’re going to see thousands of applications built on these large language models that are effectively going to make your life easier, and they’re going to be across every industry on the planet.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Griffin said Munro firmly believed that AI chip maker Nvidia would become the most valuable company in the world. It’s No 2, behind Apple and ahead of Microsoft, with a market capitalisation of $A7tn.</p>

 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>NSW Health has warned of a “significant rise” in gastroenteritis cases across the state in recent weeks. It said the increase is being driven by two pathogens “which commonly cause vomiting and diarrhoea, rotavirus and norovirus”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Rotavirus can be particularly severe in young children. Norovirus is common cause of outbreaks are common in residential aged care facilities, schools and childcare centres.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The latest data shows rotavirus notifications are at “some of their highest levels in recent years”. The director of NSW Health’s One Health branch, <strong>Keira Glasgow</strong>, said it was important to reduce the spread of gastro before schools return next week:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>Last week,</strong> <strong>there were more than 2,700 presentations to NSW emergency departments with symptoms of gastroenteritis</strong>. Presentations were particularly high in children who are under five years of age.</p> 
   <p>The message to the community is clear – simple measures can help stop the spread of gastro. Maintaining good hand hygiene and keeping children at home when they are unwell will give us a good chance to slow the spread.</p>

  <p>Birmingham said “we continue to support strongly Israel’s right to self-defence”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have said clearly all along that Israel should act with regard to international law. We’ve stood in a consistent position with the United States administration of President <strong>[Joe] Biden</strong> in terms of the stances that we have taken … in encouraging practical support for Israel, and encouraging principled support for Israel to remove the terrorist threats on its doorstep and to have the right to respond to aggression from Hamas, Hezbollah or Iran. Now, how Israel does those should be done considerate of those international laws.</p>

  <p>Host <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> asked: “It’s been accused of breaking international laws. Do you condemn them?” Birmingham responded that “there are processes under way that will continue to assess those accusations.”</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p><strong>We would have to see what judgments and findings are made through different provisions.</strong> We’re clear and consistent in our support for Israel, also always emphasising the need to target their actions, the need to have regard for international law as we would expect, and as we have said from the passing of a parliamentary resolution last year.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">Birmingham says Australians fleeing Lebanon should pay own way because they ignored 'warning after warning'</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>Moving to the Middle East, <strong>Simon Birmingham</strong> was asked about <a href="https://thenightly.com.au/opinion/simon-birmingham-australians-who-ignored-calls-to-leave-lebanon-sooner-should-be-made-to-pony-up-c-16346018">comments he made</a> suggesting Australians fleeing Lebanon should be paying their own way instead of being “rewarded with a free ride”. </p> 
  <p>Birmingham doubled down on the comment and said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We need to make sure that Australians understand when the Australian government – whether it’s a Labor one or a Coalition one – issues travel warnings and says ‘Get out of somewhere’, that they should heed those warnings [and] not wait for a possible free ticket home.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>He argued about 15,000 Australians in Lebanon have “for months and months and months ignored the advice” to leave, or not travel to Lebanon.</p> 
  <p>Host <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> shared one story she had heard of a woman whose mother is dying in hospital, who is “completely tortured about the experience of leaving her mother there [and never seeing] her again”. She asked, do you accept that people haven’t just been trying to have a free ride, but have these really complex family situations?</p> 
  <p>Birmingham said he respects that people have “deep family ties to Lebanon” but:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>It doesn’t change the fact that, for many others, they did ignore warning after warning, it was only when the military action began that suddenly they picked the phone up to [Dfat] and said, ‘Can you help me get out now?’</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Birmingham said there should be “compassion” in situations where people “genuinely cannot afford” a ticket but, as a “general standing policy”, people should be expected to pay for their tickets “because that is one of the ways that we can incentivise people to, in future, have great adherence to those travel advisory warnings”.</p>

  <p><strong>Simon Birmingham says Australia must be ‘principled and predictable’ with China</strong></p> 
  <p>Asked if the Coalition would approach China in a similar fashion to that of the Albanese government, <strong>Simon Birmingham</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>An approach that I would take as foreign minister, that the Dutton government would take, and is one of being principled and predictable in our engagement with China, we should stand up for Australia’s values interests and address those issues of concern.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Has the Albanese government been principled and predictable? Birmingham responded:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>I think the concern there … is that I think China wonders whether Australia will stand as strongly in relation to identifying, speaking about those security concerns and risks in the region as I believe, and we believe that Australia should.</p> 
   <p>It is a case of being absolutely consistent, clear and upfront about addressing the problems when we see them, and trying to make sure that we work with our partners right across the region to emphasise to China that we all want to see a peaceful and stable region where others are respected.</p>

  <p>Speaking about Australia’s relationship with China more broadly, Birmingham said the government should be “seizing those opportunities” to make clear “to the highest levels of Beijing’s leadership” when there are concerns over Chinese actions.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>What we need to see from China … is what sort of expectations we should have of China now as a global power. They are a global power, and they will be for as far as the eye can see and conduct in terms of military exercises that are risky, confrontational and present a chance of conflict emerging is not the way that a responsible global power should engage.</p>

  <p><strong>Rowland questioned on gambling ad ban</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Michelle Rowland</strong> was also asked why it has taken 16 months for the government – as yet – to make no decision on gambling ads. The communications minister said the government has “been working diligently in this space” but action “should have been taken on this some 10 years ago”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We’re working very closely with the states and territories because the vast majority of recommendations in our late colleague <strong>Peta Murphy</strong>’s report go to issues that go across commonwealth and state jurisdictions.</p> 
   <p>We’re also working very closely to ensure that there are no unintended consequences here and it’s actually effective.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Rowland argued that the last time this was looked at by the previous government, “it resulted in an increase in advertising”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We have every anticipation that we will be able to respond comprehensively this year and that’s what we’re working towards as a government.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Will that response include legislation? Rowland responded:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>We will be taking advice on the appropriate form in which that can be done. <strong>Legislation is obviously an option because there is an interactive gambling act at the commonwealth level, which enables some of these approaches to be implemented.</strong></p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Can you actually reduce gambling ads without legislation? Rowland said she would “take advice on that”, pointing to codes of practice as another option.</p>

  <p><strong>Rowland says legislation to ‘age-gate’ social media being introduced before end of year</strong></p> 
  <p><strong>Michelle Rowland</strong> was asked which incentives platforms will actually have to do better, given there is no penalties in the legislation?</p> 
  <p>She said there were no penalties on the actual users of the platforms but as a review into the Online Safety Act continues, “the issue of penalties is something that we are looking at very closely”. So will there be penalties for the platforms?</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>There will be penalty for the platforms just as they are now in the Online Safety Act … These penalties will be drafted and, as I said, we’re currently reviewing the Online Safety Act because the penalties as they stand … the maximum penalties are less than $1 million for some offences.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>Rowland said the findings of the review will be delivered “in the next few weeks”.</p> 
  <p>She said the eSafety regulator has been doing this “for a number of years now” and “the fact that we do have certain platforms taking the regulator to court on a regular basis actually indicates that there is an understanding those laws are there”.</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>They are being challenged but, at the same time, the industry does understand the need to comply here and, by and large, does comply with the rules under the Online Safety Act.</p>

   <p><strong>I think the ultimate issue here is about [incentivising] the platforms to do better.</strong> We are on to the second generation of digital natives now. It is the case that social media is not going to be excluded from everyone’s lives completely and also the fact is that we can’t keep every person – every child – safe at every moment of every day when they are online.

  <p><strong>Research finds 4,000 jobs could be created with local wind tower manufacturing</strong> </p> 
  <p>Australia could create thousands of jobs and transition workers out of the fossil fuel industry if wind towers were produced at home, a research group says.</p> 
  <p>As <strong>AAP</strong> reports, wind energy is one of Australia’s main renewables and generates enough electricity to meet 7% of the nation’s demand. But all of Australia’s wind towers are imported from overseas.</p> 
  <p>The <strong>Centre for Future Work</strong>’s research found that 4,000 jobs could be created with local wind tower manufacturing and thousands more in supply industries like steel. Once the workforce was established, it could produce 800 towers every year with a cumulative value of $15bn over the next 17 years.</p> 
  <p>Report author <strong>Phil Toner</strong> said about 2.6m tonnes of CO2 emissions would also be avoided due to reduced shipping:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>Anyone concerned about the climate should be up in arms at the fact we’re importing huge heavy steel towers from China when we could be producing them here, which would provide fantastic opportunities for our burgeoning green steel sector.</p>

  <p><strong>Cautionary tale for building nuclear power stations in Australia</strong></p> 
  <p>There’s a cautionary tale out of the UK this morning for those who advocate building nuclear power stations in Australia.</p> 
  <p>EDF, the French energy company and nuclear specialist, is reportedly in talks with investors to raise up to £4bn – that’s almost $8bn – just to finish the delayed Hinkley Point C project in Somerset, Britain’s first new nuclear reactors in a generation.</p> 
  <p>The cost of the project has ballooned to almost £50bn – nearly $100bn – due in part to supply chain issues and struggles securing skilled engineers, according to Bloomberg. And now EDF wants investors to cough up more.</p>

 <h2 class="block-title">House prices rise more slowly, report shows</h2> 
 <div class="block-elements"> 
  <p>National home values rose by 1% in the September quarter, CoreLogic has said, the softest three-month rise since March 2023.</p> 
  <p>The slowdown in price growth was attributed to an increase in listings and more cautious buyer behaviour. The rate has brought down the annual growth rate from 9.7% earlier this year to 6.7%.</p> 
  <p>Rental prices barely budged, shifting up 0.1% over three months, the slowest rate since major pandemic lockdowns in 2020.</p> 
  <p>The data shows Perth, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide values are at record highs, with Perth having the highest annual growth rate at 24.1%. Brisbane’s rate is 14.5%, Sydney’s is 4.5% and Adelaide’s is 14.8%.</p> 
  <p>Melbourne and Hobart recorded quarterly and annual dwelling declines at -5.1% and -12.5%, respectively below record highs in March 2022</p> 
  <p>Regional housing markets experienced a quarterly increase of 1%, down from 2.3% in the three months to April. </p> 
  <p>CoreLogic Australia economist<strong> Kaytlin Ezzy</strong> said:</p> 
  <blockquote class="quoted"> 
   <p>While the market remains resilient in many areas, the pace of growth more broadly has clearly decelerated. Buyers and investors are becoming more cautious, and the current lending environment is leading to more measured purchasing decisions.</p> 
   <p>The higher rate of sales indicates there’s still solid buyer demand despite changing market conditions. As we move through spring, we’re likely to see further moderation in value growth as new listings continue to rise, providing some relief for buyers who have faced intense competition over the past year.</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>CoreLogic states national rental growth is slowing, with rents rising 0.1% over the quarter - the lowest rate in four years.</p> 
  <p>CoreLogic estimates the combined value of residential real estate rose to $11T at the end of September.</p>

  <p>Banks, telcos and digital platform services, including social media, are first on the list and will need to meet the new obligations. For example, a bank will need to tighten rules around transfers by having mandatory confirmation of payees in place.</p>
