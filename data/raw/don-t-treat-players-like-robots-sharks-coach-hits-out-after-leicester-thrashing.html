<p>The Sharks head coach, John Plumtree, accused rugby’s administrators of treating South African players “like robots” after he fielded a drastically weakened team in this crushing defeat. Already severely depleted by injury, the Sharks’ options were further limited by Plumtree’s decision to leave stellar names such as Siya Kolisi, Andre Esterhuizen and Ox Nché back home in South Africa. The only possible conclusion was that this match had long since been written off as a cross in the “L” column by the visitors.</p> 
<p>The Sharks had listed 15 players as unavailable due to injury when naming a XV featuring eight changes from last week’s home victory against Exeter. Bongi Mbonambi, Eben Etzebeth, Lukhanyo Am and Makazole Mapimpi were among those sidelined. But the absence of Kolisi, Esterhuizen and Nché – fit but rested – must have been a bitter disappointment for anyone who bought a ticket.</p>

<p>Plumtree, who said Etzebeth was concussed last week in the win over Exeter, revealed Kolisi was given the week off due to some personal issues as well as a slight injury niggle. Asked if he had sympathy with fans who saw his young, depleted side overrun at Welford Road, he said: “Absolutely. We want to bring Siya here. We want to bring our best here: what a showcase.</p> 
<p>“I want to bring our strongest Sharks side here and play on the biggest stage. I can understand their [the fans’] frustration. I want to go out there and give Leicester a good hiding in front of their home crowd. Don’t worry about that.</p> 
<p>“We’re all competitive. But the reality is we’ve got to look after these athletes. They are not robots. They don’t front up every week. And right now, the South African boys are treated like robots.”</p> 
<p>After seeing his powerful side score eight tries – with the Springboks’ Handré Pollard pouring the pain on the callow Sharks with a try and six conversions in a sensational all-round display – the Leicester head coach, Michael Cheika, had little sympathy for Plumtree’s view. “There is no solution required,” Cheika said. “This is the European Cup. It’s the pinnacle tournament in European footy. The idea is to do your best, and go out there and win it against the best teams. I’m not worried about the competition setup. I don’t see anything wrong with it.”</p> 
<p>The first half had strongly suggested that for anyone interested in competitive sport, this was a waste of time. The Sharks did lead briefly thanks to an early penalty by Siya Masuku and Manu Tshituka’s try. But the Tigers, after some ponderous early defending, later took total control and had a win bonus point wrapped up by half-time.</p>

    <p>Alex Dombrandt and Cadan Murley plundered hat-tricks as <b>Harlequins</b> campaign was given liftoff with a 53-16 victory over the <b>Stormers</b>.&nbsp;A week after falling to Racing 92 in Paris, Quins produced an eight-try demolition of South African visitors who were missing seven Springboks to injury including Manie Libbok, Damian Willemse and Frans Malherbe.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The irrepressible Dombrandt and Murley took centre stage in front of England coach Steve Borthwick, who was watching from the stands, as the hosts ended a two-match losing run. Marcus Smith lasted 66 minutes in a pleasing end to his week after signing a new contract that keeps him at the club until 2028 and he was joined at half-back by Danny Care, who was given a rare start this season.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>La Rochelle</b> inflicted a second successive defeat on <b>Bristol</b> with a 35-7 win at Stade Marcel-Deflandre.&nbsp;The highlight was a stunning first-half finish by the former England wing Jack Nowell for La Rochelle’s opening try, and the two-time champions went on to collect a bonus point.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Tolu Latu, Levani Botia, UJ Seuteni and Thomas Berjon followed Nowell over the Bristol line, while the fly-half Ihaia West kicked five conversions.&nbsp;Jack Bates claimed Bristol’s solitary touchdown just before half-time, converted by Sam Worsley, as their hopes of reaching the last-16 were dealt a major setback.&nbsp;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Ulster</b>’s hopes of progressing from Pool One suffered another setback after they lost 40-19 against <b>Bordeaux-Bègles</b> in Belfast. A week after conceding 60 points to the holders, Toulouse, Ulster led 19-14 at half-time after tries from Cormac Izuchukwu, Nick Timoney and Werner Kok.&nbsp;Bordeaux, though, overwhelmed Ulster after the break as Damian Penaud, Guido Petti, Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Ugo Boniface claimed touchdowns that followed a first-half penalty try and score for Tevita Tatafu.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Leinster</b> backed up their impressive victory over Bristol by beating <b>Clermont Auvergne</b> 15-7 at Dublin’s Aviva Stadium. Garry Ringrose and Jordie Barrett scored first-half tries for the Pool Two favourites after Alivereti Raka claimed an early Clermont score, with the Leinster fly-half Sam Prendergast adding a conversion and penalty.&nbsp; <b>PA Media</b></p>

<p>The Argentina front-rower Julián Montoya and the England lock George Martin were among six internationals welcomed back into a strong home lineup. Montoya scored twice before Ollie Hassell-Collins pounced on an embarrassing error by Eduan Keyter. In attempting to keep a punt for touch in play the wing inadvertently set up his opponent who had chased the kick, and he gratefully accepted the invitation. Solomone Kata and Pollard made it five first-half tries before Jack van Poortvliet, Charlie Clare and Emeka Ilione sealed the rout after the interval.</p> 
<p>Leicester thus have a first Champions Cup win to go with last week’s losing bonus point in Bordeaux. They sit third in the Premiership, handily placed behind only Bath and Bristol. Cheika’s project is undoubtedly progressing and he singled out Martin as an outstanding performer against the Sharks.</p> 
<p>Plumtree, meanwhile, thinks the schedule is unrealistic: “I think the organisers need to have a look at it and go: ‘Well, why are we sending a team up here for one week?’ We arrive on Wednesday and play on Saturday. It’s hardly high performance. Maybe we should come up here and play a couple of games, and stay for a fortnight? They need to look at it.”</p> 
<p>Told that Plumtree had said his South Africans were being treated like robots, Cheika was dismissive: “Look at the guy next to me [Argentina’s Montoya]. Ask him. He’s doing it. Inside of the organisation, you look after your blokes.”</p>
