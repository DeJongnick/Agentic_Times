<p>Ruben Amorim’s tactics and man-management are being questioned by some in the Manchester United dressing room and there is a feeling at the club that the head coach may resign unless results pick up.</p> 
<p>Amorim is under severe pressure after the Carabao Cup <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/aug/27/grimsby-manchester-united-carabao-cup-second-round-match-report">penalty shootout elimination by Grimsby</a>, the first time United have lost to a fourth-tier team in the competition. The reverse means the side are without a victory this season, having also lost to Arsenal and drawn with Fulham in the league, putting pressure on them before their home game with Burnley on Saturday. United are understood to have no plans to sack Amorim but there is a sense at the club that if results do not turn his stubbornness may prompt him to walk away – possibly as early as next week during the international break – rather than change his methods.</p>

</aside> 
<p>After last season’s record low Premier League finish of 15th, the poor run is sparking questions of Amorim from within the squad, the Guardian understands. The head coach’s insistence on a 3-4-3 formation is causing particular scrutiny after earning 27 points in 29 league matches.</p> 
<p>There is also bemusement regarding his man-management approach, which is viewed by many players as well-meaning but sometimes counter-productive.</p> 
<p>After the Grimsby loss Amorim said “something has to change” but he is viewed at United as being wedded to his formation, so there is no expectation that was a reference to altering the shape he also used consistently – and successfully – at Sporting in his previous job.</p> 
<p>Jason Wilcox, the director of football, is thought to be aware of the problems regarding Amorim’s tactics and handling of his players and may move to address these.</p> 
<p>Amorim also said after the Grimsby match: “Let’s focus on the next game and then we have the stop for the international games. We will think things through.”</p>

    <p>Besiktas have sacked the former Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær after they were knocked out of the Conference League play-offs by Lausanne.</p>
    <p>Besiktas were beaten 1-0 at home by the INEOS-owned Lausanne on Thursday night, with the former Arsenal striker Nathan Butler-Oyedeji scoring the only goal in first-half stoppage-time before Besiktas had Felix Uduokhai sent off early in the second half, giving Lausanne a 2-1 aggregate win.</p>
    <p>A Besiktas statement said: "Our contract with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær has been terminated following a decision made at the board meeting. Following the meeting, our chairman, Serdal Adali, thanked Solskjær for his services to date."</p>
    <p>The Norwegian took charge of the Super Lig club in January - his first coaching role since leaving United in November 2021 - and guided them to fourth by the end of last season.</p>

<p>United’s match with Burnley is their last before the international break. The message from within Old Trafford on Thursday was that it remained business as usual. United resume after the break with the derby at Manchester City on 14 September.</p> 
<p>One player who will not feature again for United is Alejandro Garnacho. The winger – one of the players Amorim was keen to move on – appears likely to move to Chelsea. The two clubs have finally agreed a £40m deal with a 10% sell-on fee.</p>
