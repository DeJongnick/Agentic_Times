<p>Government ministers met representatives from the fossil fuel industry more than 500 times during their first year in power – equivalent to twice every working day, according to research.</p> <p>The analysis found that fossil fuel lobbyists were present at 48% more ministerial meetings during Labour’s first year in power than under the Conservatives in 2023.</p> <p>The government defended the meetings, saying ministers held meetings with a wide range of representatives from “the energy industry, unions and civil society to drive forward our clean energy superpower mission”.</p> <p>The findings have raised concern among critics about the extent of the fossil fuel industry’s influence over government at a time when ministers are trying to lower bills and transition to a more sustainable energy system.</p> <p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/nov/23/companies-still-investing-too-much-in-fossil-fuels-global-energy-watchdog-says">report from the International Energy Agency</a> in 2023 found that fossil fuel companies still had “minimal” engagement with the global clean energy transition, contributing just 1% of clean energy investment globally.</p> <p>Carys Boughton, of <a href="https://fossilfreeparliament.uk/">Fossil Free Parliament</a>, which carried out the research, said fossil fuel corporations were being given a “backstage pass to government”.</p> <p>“These lobbyists should have no place in ministerial meetings about the energy transition, taxing profits or cutting our bills – it’s in their interest to sabotage these talks.”</p> <p>The analysis, which is based on the government’s published record of ministerial meetings, found:</p> <ul> <li><p>Ministers at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) met fossil fuel lobbyists 274 times, with industry figures present at almost a quarter of meetings.</p></li> <li><p>During the same period DESNZ ministers met trade union representatives 61 times.</p></li> <li><p>Ed Miliband, the secretary for energy and climate change, met fossil fuel lobbyists 91 times – with a third of all his meetings attended by industry figures.</p></li> <li><p>Three fossil fuel companies: BP, Shell and Equinor, met ministers 100 times between them.</p></li> <li><p>Fossil fuel lobbyists<strong> </strong>attended almost every government meeting about the energy profits levy, a temporary windfall tax on the “extraordinary profits” of North Sea oil and gas companies.</p></li> </ul> <p>Carla Denyer, the Green party MP for Bristol Central, said:<strong> </strong>“Instead of listening to scientists, communities affected by flooding, or parents desperate to secure a safe future for their children and grandchildren, this government is prioritising lobbyists and profits for oil and gas giants. These revelations must mark a turn away from the grubby politics of fossil fuel lobbying.”</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/oct/14/millions-more-homes-in-great-britain-at-risk-of-flooding-investigation-finds">Towns may have to be abandoned due to floods with millions more homes in Great Britain at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government insisted the findings were “misleading”, saying many of the firms listed also had clean energy investments and that these were often the focus of the discussions.</p> <p>A spokesperson added: “Our priority is a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the North Sea in line with our climate and legal obligations, and we are working with the sector to protect current and future generations of good jobs. We need to replace our dependency on unstable fossil fuel markets with clean, homegrown power controlled in Britain, to protect bill payers, drive growth and boost our energy security.”</p> <p>Several <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/mar/14/shell-warns-it-may-slow-emissions-reduction-during-crucial-climate-decade">major fossil fuel</a> corporations have been criticised <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/26/bp-oil-and-gas-spending-green-energy-scale-back">for cutting their green investments</a> in recent years amid a global pushback against climate action galvanised by the election of US president Donald Trump.</p> <p>Katrina McDonnell, a campaigns manager at the Good Law Project, said:<strong> </strong>“Keir Starmer promised a government of service, but that doesn’t mean bowing the knee to corporations making money out of climate catastrophe. It’s time for Starmer to stop cosying up to polluters and put people first.”</p> <p>• This article was amended on 16 October 2025. Owing to an error in supplied information, an earlier version said Ed Miliband met fossil fuel lobbyists 250 times during Labour’s first year in power; this should have said 91 meetings.</p>
