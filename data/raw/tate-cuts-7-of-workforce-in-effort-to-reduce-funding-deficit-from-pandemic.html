<p>Tate is cutting 7% of its workforce as the British arts institution seeks to address a funding deficit left over from the pandemic.</p> <p>About 40 roles have been affected by the cuts, made through voluntary departures and recruitment freezes.</p> <p>Tate, which has four galleries across London, Liverpool and Cornwall, said it had been working with staff for a number of months to achieve the reduction.</p> <p>“Tate has an ambitious programme to grow our audiences across the nation and beyond,” a spokesperson said. “To eliminate the deficit left over from the pandemic, we have strengthened new income streams, strategically prioritised our most impactful activities, and carefully streamlined out workforce.”</p> <p>The spokesperson said Tate had achieved its goals “by not replacing vacant roles and by accepting voluntary exits, working closely with colleagues and unions over a number of months”.</p> <p>They added: “Such changes ensure we have the stability we need to continue being as ambitious and innovative as ever.”</p> <p>While the number of domestic visitors to museums and galleries has returned to pre-pandemic levels, there are still fewer visitors from abroad. Overall, visitor numbers are about three-quarters of pre-pandemic levels which, combined with cuts to culture budgets, is putting pressure on institutions to reduce costs.</p> <p>Last year, Tate’s trustees approved another deficit budget to give the institution time to develop a new financially sustainable business model.</p> <p>About 30% of Tate’s income comes from government grants. The rest is raised through private fundraising – including corporate support, philanthropic donations and legacy bequests – as well as money from exhibition ticket sales.</p> <p>Tate Liverpool, which opened at the Royal Albert Dock in 1988, is undergoing a £29.7m redevelopment, which includes the installation of new galleries.</p> <p>Tate St Ives is restoring the Palais de Danse – Barbara Hepworth’s second studio space. In May, Tate Modern will mark its 25th birthday with free performances and events, as well as the return of Louise Bourgeois’s spider, Maman, to the Turbine Hall.</p> <p>The Prospect union said it was engaging with Tate on the planned changes and would support any staff affected.</p> <p>The union’s national secretary for heritage, Sharon Brown, said: “We are clear that the expertise and experience of museum and gallery workers, who are often underpaid and undervalued, is what brings the collections alive and is fundamental to the success of the sector.</p> <p>“Budget cuts and the impact of the pandemic have hit the sector hard and more must be done to invest in these institutions and the workforce, which are an essential part of our domestic and international visitor economy as well as of Britain’s cultural landscape.”</p>
