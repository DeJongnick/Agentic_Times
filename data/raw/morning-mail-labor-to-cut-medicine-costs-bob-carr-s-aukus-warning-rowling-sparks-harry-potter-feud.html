<p>Morning everyone. It feels like the campaign for an election that hasn’t even been called yet is in full swing. Labor is unveiling plans to slash the cost of medicines in next week’s budget and Coalition MPs are pleading with Peter Dutton for a cost-of-living policy to sell on the stump.</p> 
<p>We also have a fascinating insight into the social trends and attitudes that will shape the election, Bob Carr condemns the Aukus pact as risking a “colossal surrender of sovereignty”, and we reveal the winner of this year’s hot cross bun taste test.</p>
