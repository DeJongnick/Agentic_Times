<p>Re your editorial (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/25/the-guardian-view-on-standards-in-politics-a-golden-reform-opportunity-squandered">The Guardian view on standards in politics: a golden reform opportunity squandered, 25 July</a>), before being elected to parliament for the first time last year, I dedicated nearly 15 years of my life to tackling bribery and corruption. And I am pleased that the government is implementing its manifesto commitments to improve standards.</p> <p>Let us not forget the steady work of Margaret Hodge, who is progressing a comprehensive, cross-government anti-corruption strategy to be published later this year, and the Covid counter-fraud commissioner, Tom Hayhoe, whose work is so vital to restoring trust in government. And let us not forget what the government has already committed to in its first 12 months: replacing the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, increasing the frequency of ministerial hospitality disclosures, scrapping hereditary peers, votes at 16, rolling out automatic voter registration, tightening up political party financing and empowering the Electoral Commission. </p> <p>That’s a track record to be proud of and a clear change of course from the political indifference to ethics, integrity and democratic participation exhibited by recent Conservative governments. Is there&nbsp;more to be done? Yes, but talk&nbsp;of squandering opportunities is&nbsp;far wide of the mark. <br><strong>Phil Brickell MP</strong><br><em>Labour, Bolton West</em></p> <p><strong><em>• Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
