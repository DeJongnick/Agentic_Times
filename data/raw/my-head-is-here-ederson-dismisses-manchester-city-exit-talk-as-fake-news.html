I understand you guys – you need the news to put a like on social media or rant for the news.</p> <p>“I understand but there’s a lot of fake news around my name. My head is here. It stays with City. It gives me everything to go back to the Premier League again and try to win the Champions League as well. My mind is staying in the club.”</p> <p>City play Juventus on Thursday at Orlando’s Camping World Stadium in their final group match and could face Real Madrid in the last 16. “It’s life,” Ederson said. If Real Madrid comes, I will play and try to win – OK.</p> <p>“I think we have an advantage, if we finish first. But for us, we’re ready for everything. I work every day to try to win every game and go to the final. The team works to win this competition. I look at every player and their focus is on the training, the games.</p> <p>“It’s a new competition, a new trophy. I have the opportunity to be in the first team to win this trophy [in a 32-side tournament]. It’s really important for us to put the name on the history of this competition, for the first group to win this title.”</p>
