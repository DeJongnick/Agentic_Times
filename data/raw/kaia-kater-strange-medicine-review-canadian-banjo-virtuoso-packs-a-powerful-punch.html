<p>Born in Montreal to a Canadian mother and a Grenadian father, <a href="https://www.kaiakater.com/">Kaia Kater</a> made her name as a banjo revivalist, much celebrated in folk circles as a teenager, though from the outset her backwoods picking came alongside songs with contemporary themes. Her previous album, 2018’s <em>Grenades</em>, looked at the history of her father’s homeland, since when she has become a successful TV and film composer. Now 30, Kater brings her talents into full bloom on this fourth album, which marries dazzling banjo playing with percussion, strings, brass and more – a subtle kaleidoscope of sound over which her voice floats melodically but often accusingly. </p> <p>The songs are a clever mix of personal and political. Is The Witch, a sumptuous duet with <a href="https://www.aoifeodonovan.com/">Aoife O’Donovan</a>, addressed to an ex-lover or to the historic patriarchy that persecuted women as witches? Clearly both. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSP8fMISJBw&amp;t=9s">Fédon</a> celebrates the leader of the 1795 uprising against British rule in Grenada, but there is room, too, for protests against the internet and, on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLtm44i13EM">Maker Taker</a>, a parasitic music business. Often As the Autumn is an austere folk ballad, while History in Motion carries a Joni Mitchell imprint. It’s all “strange medicine”, whereby poisonous experience becomes a healing force, and gloriously realised. </p>       <figure class="element element-video" data-canonical-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_HFRh0AQEs"                                                                        >  <iframe height="480" width="854" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j_HFRh0AQEs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen ></iframe> <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_HFRh0AQEs">Watch the video for The Witch by Kaia Kater</a>.</figcaption> </figure>
