<p>As a multicultural broadcaster, SBS is in the eye of the storm when it comes to international politics. Without a managing director after James Taylor resigned in August to take up the position of chief executive of outdoor advertising company oOh!media, the broadcaster is also grappling with two sensitive issues.</p> 
<p>SBS’s decision last month not to follow the lead of a number of European broadcasters and boycott next year’s Eurovision song contest if Israel is permitted to compete has infuriated many viewers.</p> 
<p>The broadcaster has confirmed it had received audience feedback after media reports about its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/sep/17/eurovision-2026-israel-sbs-australia-resists-eu-boycott">intention to take part</a>.</p> 
<p>“SBS recognises this is a time of deep concern to our audiences. We take all feedback seriously, and remain committed to providing comprehensive and trusted coverage of the conflict from diverse perspectives across our network,” a spokesperson told Weekly Beast.</p>

<p>At Senate estimates, Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi joined SBS fans in expressing her dismay, peppering executives with questions.</p> 
<p>“Israel is also set to attend and will perform pop songs, while the state of Israel bombs and buries Palestinian children under rubble,” Faruqi said.</p> 
<p>“If Israel participates, will Australia, because SBS is the broadcaster, will you also withdraw, or will you provide cover for Israel?”</p> 
<p>The acting managing director, Jane Palfreyman, said it was crucial in these “troubling times” to be impartial and not to state a position for or against. </p> 
<p>In a later exchange, the director of corporate affairs, Clare O’Neil, said viewers had enjoyed Eurovision for 40 years and that was not going to change.</p> 
<p>Faruqi was also critical of SBS’s <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/sbs-staff-sworn-off-naming-palestine-despite-federal-recognition-20251008-p5n0vv.html">reported</a> editorial response to the Albanese government’s recognition of Palestine. A report in Nine newspapers claimed staff are “unable to use the word Palestine”.</p> 
<p>The director of news and current affairs, Mandi Wicks, later issued a clarification, which said it “is not correct to say that SBS journalists are not allowed to use the term Palestine”.</p> 
<p>Wicks said SBS’s guidance is now to refer to the “Occupied Palestinian Territories, which Australia recognises as the State of Palestine”.</p> 
<p>“This provides context for our audiences, and accurately reflects the recent developments,” she told Weekly Beast. “SBS is editorially independent from government, and our editorial guidance is continually evolving.”</p> 
<p>The ABC’s guidance is that staff can refer to Palestine when referring to its geography, history, community and the intended state encompassing the Occupied Palestinian Territory, adding “it is still correct to refer to the ‘Occupied Palestinian Territory’ and in some circumstances ‘Occupied Palestinian Territory’ is preferred as it more clearly communicates the actual current status of the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem”.</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-style-guide-p">Guardian’s style guide advises the use of Palestine</a> to refer to the occupied West Bank and Gaza, but to avoid using the term Palestinian territories.</p> 
<h2>Trump’s business deals in ABC spotlight</h2> 
<p>On Monday’s Four Corners, the ABC’s Americas editor, John Lyons, producer Elise Potaka and US journalists Emilie Gramenz and Phoebe Hosier investigate accusations that Donald Trump is profiting from the presidency.</p>

<h2>National Press Club cancels Pulitzer winner</h2> 
<p>The cancellation of an address by the Pulitzer prize-winning US journalist Chris Hedges at the National Press Club, 19 days after it was confirmed, has infuriated not just the former New York Times war correspondent himself but organisers of his tour, the Australian Friends of Palestine Association (Afopa).</p> 
<p>Weekly Beast spoke to Hedges after he published a <a href="https://chrishedges.substack.com/">furious post</a>. He said it’s a “very common experience for those of us who are speaking about the genocide” to be snubbed.</p> 
<p>Despite what the press club said, it was a firm invitation, he insisted. Having read the correspondence between Afopa and the club, we agree.</p> 
<p>On 8 September the club sent an email that said Hedges was slated to speak on Monday 20 October, with the words: “Our confirmation is attached”. His bio and photos were duly sent.</p> 
<p>On 27 September a further email from the NPC chief executive, Maurice Reilly, headed “URGENT Cancellation Chris Hedges address” said that “in the interest of balancing out our program we will withdraw our offer”.</p> 
<p>Hedges, who had already written his NPC address which was to focus on the betrayal of Palestinian journalists, accused the club of “caving to the Israel lobby”.</p> 
<p>He also alleged the Israeli ambassador to Australia, Amir Maimon, “is reportedly being considered to speak”.</p> 
<p>The NPC said there were no plans for the ambassador to speak at the club.</p> 
<p>So why was Hedges cancelled? Reilly said: “We have had a review of our speaker program and our broadcast expectations. We are receiving an excess of proposals in favour for the Palestine cause which is understandable in the current environment.”</p> 
<p>He cited <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/01/mass-slaughter-gaza-stands-apart-other-genocides-chris-sidoti-people-cannot-escape">Chris Sidoti</a>, Prof Ben Saul, judge Navi Pillay and James Elder from Unicef as speakers who fit in that category. He denied there had been any external pressure from sponsors or lobby groups.</p> 
<p>Hedges, who will give the annual Edward Said <a href="https://apan.org.au/event/edward-said-memorial-lecture-requiem-for-gaza/">memorial lecture</a> on 18 October, will now give his NPC address at a Sydney event on 20 October, which will be livestreamed. </p> 
<h2>One Nation asks what ABC did 50 years ago</h2> 
<p>Sometimes it is hard to pick which question at Senate estimates is the most ridiculous, but a line of questioning from One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts relating to an interview broadcast on ABC Radio in 1975 was a clear winner on Wednesday.</p> 
<p>Roberts started off earlier in the evening by asking the ABC’s managing director, Hugh Marks, whether the ABC would “keep pornography out of the hands of children”.</p> 
<p>Before Marks could answer, Roberts was told by the committee chair, Senator Varun Ghosh, that his question should be directed to the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, who was appearing later.</p> 
<p>Roberts returned to the forum later to ask a follow-up question to a matter raised by former Liberal senator Eric Abetz in 2018.</p>

<p>“Did the ABC in 1975 allow three self-confessed pederasts to be interviewed in the ABC Sydney studios and did the ABC ever report that to the New South Wales police?</p> 
<p>“Did you say 1975?” then MD David Anderson asked before taking the question on notice.</p> 
<p>At the time the ABC told Abetz it had no records of the interview, but according to contemporary reports Lateline interviewed three “self-confessed pederasts” in 1975.</p> 
<p>Now Roberts wanted an “assurance that the ABC will not use its platform to air material sympathetic to or supportive of paedophiles or pederasts ever again”.</p> 
<p>Marks said material that did not meet the ABC’s editorial standards would not be broadcast.</p> 
<h2>Rowland goes from breakfast to 7.30</h2> 
<p>Former ABC News Breakfast co-host Michael Rowland will join 7.30 in the newly created role of national affairs reporter next month.</p> 
<p>A former Washington correspondent, Rowland has had regular stints with the program as reporter and fill-in host and is a former business and economics correspondent for Lateline.</p> 
<p>“Across more than 35 years in journalism, Michael has built a reputation for sharp insight, engaging storytelling and unflappable composure under pressure,” 7.30 executive producer, Joel Tozer, told staff. “His breadth of experience – spanning politics, economics and major global events – will be a tremendous asset to 7.30 as we continue to deliver impactful and agenda-setting reporting.”</p> 
<p>Is he being groomed as a future host?</p>
