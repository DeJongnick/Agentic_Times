<p>The ritual of facial cleansing is sacrosanct in my home, but only for me. While beauty buffs use melting balms, silky oils and rich creams to remove daily makeup, dirt and SPF, and separate exfoliants to remove dull skin, the vast majority of consumers – including my own family – will always prefer a foaming face wash that does it all. </p> <p>I get it. Exfoliating cleansers are fast to use (and easily stored in the shower), and give that fully refreshed feeling only wet cleansing can. The drawback is that they can leave your face feeling tight, dry and begging for moisturiser, and frequently fail what I call “the towel test” – that is, they leave behind enough makeup for it to lightly stain a white towel during post-cleanse drying. So which exfoliating cleansers do a decent job and leave skin clean, without too much squeak?</p> <p>For oily and spotty skin, I frequently recommend CeraVe’s <strong><a href="https://www.boots.com/cerave-sa-smoothing-cleanser-236ml-10272454">SA</a></strong><a href="https://www.boots.com/cerave-sa-smoothing-cleanser-236ml-10272454">&nbsp;</a><strong><a href="https://www.boots.com/cerave-sa-smoothing-cleanser-236ml-10272454">Smoothing Cleanser</a> </strong>with salicylic acid (£14.50), since the beta hydroxy acids cut through oiliness without leaving skin parched, thanks to comforting ceramides.</p> <aside class="element element-rich-link element--thumbnail"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2025/may/21/sali-hughes-on-beauty-feeling-the-heat-avoid-summer-meltdowns-with-new-long-wear-makeup">Sali Hughes on beauty: Feeling the heat? Avoid summer meltdowns with new long-wear makeup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On dull, drier skin, I love the always&nbsp;excellent Skingredients’ new (refillable) <strong><a href="https://www.boots.com/skingredients-aha-cleanse-brightening-exfoliating-lactic-acid-cleanser-refillable-primary-pack-100ml-10312901p">AHA Brightening + Exfoliating Lactic Acid Cleanse</a></strong> (£28, pictured). This recommendation is a bit of a cheat, since the product doesn’t foam, but it rinses off with water (leave on for 60 seconds before doing so, for best results), cleanses properly and gives face-wash fans that very clean, fresh feeling they crave. The lactic acid (my exfoliant of choice) here is gentler than other alpha hydroxy acids and its moisturising abilities help ease that tight, dry sensation. Slot this one in place of your usual cleanser a couple of times a week.</p> <p>Also using lactic acid for brightness and smoothness is Simple’s <strong><a href="https://www.boots.com/simple-smoothing-gel-cleanser-for-sensitive-skin-240ml-10355692">Smoothing Gel Cleanser For Sensitive Skin</a></strong> (£9). This is an impressive product from a brand that has raised its game considerably over the past two or three years. It removed all but my eye makeup (clear that with micellar lotion before turning on the tap), rinsing away quickly and easily, leaving no residue and only very mild tightness (unavoidable on drier skins).</p> <p>To those who find even a separate wash for face a step too far, I offer Beauty Pie’s <strong><a href="https://www.beautypie.com/products/acidenzyme-face-and-body-cleanser">AcidEnzyme Jumbo Exfoliating Face &amp; Body Cleanser</a></strong> (£28.50 to members) for a massive 400ml pump bottle. My family is mad for this unfragranced, easily rinsed, sudsing wash that helps clears pores and mild acne, whether it’s on the face, chest or back.</p>
